15135,perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids pfecas are a group of emerging recalcitrant contaminants that are being developed to replace legacy per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas in industrial applications and that are generated as by products in fluoropolymer manufacturing here we report on the removal and destruction of four structurally different pfecas using an integrated anion exchange resin aer and electrochemical oxidation eco treatment train results from this work illustrated that 1 flow through columns packed with pfas selective aers are highly effective for the removal of pfecas and 2 pfeca affinity is strongly correlated with their hydrophobic features regeneration of the spent resin columns revealed that high percentage e g 80 of organic cosolvent is necessary for achieving 60 100 pfeca release and regeneration efficiency was higher for a macroporous resin than a gel type resin treatment of spent regenerants showed 1 99 99 methanol removal was achieved by distillation 2 99 999 conversion of the four studied pfecas was achieved during the eco treatment of the still bottoms after 24 hours with an energy per order of magnitude of pfeca removal ee o 1 03 kwh m3 of total groundwater treated and 3 85 of the organic fluorine was recovered as inorganic fluoride trifluoroacetic acid tfa perfluoropropionic acid pfpra and perfluoro 2 methoxyacetic acid pfmoaa were confirmed via high resolution mass spectrometry as transformation products tps in the treated still bottoms and two distinctive degradation schemes and four reaction pathways are proposed for the four pfecas lastly dissolved organic matter dom inhibited uptake regeneration and oxidation of pfecas throughout the treatment train suggesting pretreatment steps targeting dom removal can enhance the system s treatment efficiency results from this work provide guidelines for developing effective separation concentration destruction treatment trains and meaningful insights for achieving pfeca destruction in impacted aquatic systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction since the mid 1900s per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas and more specifically perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas have been used in various consumer products and industrial applications due to their extreme resistance to chemical and thermal degradation lindstrom et al 2011 as a result pfaa contamination in the environment has become a considerable concern as they exhibit significant bioaccumulation potential and toxicity in wildlife and humans and many regulatory efforts have been advanced to reduce their production and usage barzen hanson et al 2017 hu et al 2016 to limit the use of pfaas in industrial applications perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids pfecas containing ether groups c o c have been manufactured the insertion of oxygen atoms into perfluoroalkyl backbones is designed to make the molecules more labile to degradation and less bioaccumulative but recent toxicological studies have found that selected pfecas were even more bioaccumulative than their perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid pfca predecessors pan et al 2017 strynar et al 2015 pfecas enter the environment as a result of their use as processing aids in fluoropolymer production galloway et al 2020 washington et al 2020 as well as in the form of byproducts that are generated during the production of fluoropolymer manufacturing hopkins et al 2018 the frequent detection of pfecas in various environmental matrices gebbink et al 2017 hopkins et al 2018 sun et al 2016 has made them a new class of contaminants of emerging concern for instance hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid hfpo da commonly known as genx has been detected in private drinking water wells at concentrations up to 4 000 ng l ncdeq 2017 given their structural similarities with pfcas pfecas are not removed or transformed in conventional and many advanced treatment processes i e ozonation at water treatment facilities hopkins et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 current treatment approaches for pfecas have considered physical separation with subsequent pfeca destruction in the concentrate liu and sun 2021 pica et al 2019 among the available separation technologies anion exchange resins aers have received increased attention as they can remove pfas through both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions and exhibit higher selectivity towards short chain pfcas pfecas than carbonaceous materials e g granular activated carbon gac fang et al 2021 liu and sun 2021 batch screening results for nine aers and nine pfecas showed that increased pfeca uptake was correlated with increased aer and pfeca hydrophobicity e g polystyrene backbone and or long perfluoroalkyl ether chain which agrees with removal trends observed for pfcas and other polyfluorinated compounds boyer et al 2021 fang et al 2021 another advantage of aers is their ability to be regenerated on site without the use of high temperature processes allowing aer reuse for multiple cycles deng et al 2010 dixit et al 2020b zaggia et al 2016 waste produced during the regeneration process which involves the use of methanolic brine can be distilled to remove reclaim the organic solvent which is often vital for aer regeneration in addition the post distillation waste also known as still bottoms is an ideal candidate for destructive technologies as they are often presented in smaller volumes with concentrated pfas content several advanced oxidative and reductive processes have recently been developed to destroy pfecas and electrochemical oxidation eco in particular has shown promising results for pfeca defluorination bentel et al 2020 pica et al 2019 singh et al 2019 it follows that the high salinity of still bottoms also benefits eco treatment due to their highly conductive environment wang et al 2021 while past batch studies increased the mechanistic understanding of aer and eco technology for the treatment of selected pfecas the feasibility of combining these two technologies together as one integrated separation and destruction system remains largely unknown more importantly knowledge gaps remain in the adsorption and regeneration of pfecas in flow through aer columns and a systematic understanding of eco s efficacy in treating pfecas contained still bottoms has not yet been established for example the regeneration of pfeca saturated aers has only been evaluated using salt only solutions e g 10 nh4cl with prolonged contact time e g 3 hours in batch experiments and only minimal desorption was observed for highly selective aers liu and sun 2021 on the other hand while eco treatment showed promising results for pfca mineralization schaefer et al 2018 past studies indicated that pfecas could have different degradation pathways and rates than pfcas during eco due to the additional ether functional group s olvera vargas et al 2022 pica et al 2019 also eco treatment of still bottoms was only evaluated for pfcas using ti4o7 anodes wang et al 2021 in this study the removal and destruction of four pfecas that varied in perfluoroalkyl chain length and number of ether oxygen atoms table 1 were evaluated using aer columns followed by resin regeneration regenerant distillation and eco treatment of still bottoms breakthrough and regeneration data were collected to determine aer and pfecas properties that affect pfecas adsorption and desorption in flow through columns the impact of naturally occurring dissolved organic matter dom on aer column performance was assessed using a pfeca spiked groundwater via a down selected aer column and regeneration scheme spent regenerants produced from the regeneration process were distilled to recover methanol and produce still bottoms were treated in an eco cell equipped with a commercially available boron doped diamond bdd anode samples from the eco reactor were collected over time and analyzed by liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry to identify reaction intermediates and establish reaction pathways as well as by ion chromatography to determine mineralization rates results from this work will provide valuable insights into the removal effectiveness and regenerability of commercially available aers for the treatment of pfecas in flow through columns and the efficacy of bdd based eco technology for treating pfecas contained in still bottoms most importantly it will provide recommendations on the feasibility of coupling aer and eco technology as an integrated system to remediate pfecas at contaminated groundwater sites and at water treatment facilities 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and resins a full listing of chemical reagents and aers is provided in the supporting information si unless otherwise stated all solutions were prepared using deionized di water elga purelab flex 3 18 2 mÏ‰ cm resistivities properties for the two pfas selective aers selected for this study are summarized in table s1 of the si 2 2 pfeca adsorption and destruction experiments 2 2 1 flow through column test two water sources i e tap water and groundwater were chosen as the influents for the aer columns to compare the impact of dom on the pfeca selectivity of the two aers a summary of the two waters characteristics is provided in table 2 the experimental design for the flow through column using glass columns with an inside diameter of 2 5 cm and a height of 10 cm was adopted from a previous study schaefer et al 2019 details of the column design and packing are provided in the si section 2 the design flow rate i e 4 9 ml min for each column was based on a manufacturer recommended empty bed contact time ebct of 3 min and corresponded to a hydraulic loading rate hlr of 0 6 m h a mixture of the four pfecas was spiked into each influent either tap water or groundwater to yield individual pfeca concentrations of approximately 1 mg l the exact initial concentration of each pfeca in the influent is provided in table 1 these elevated pfeca concentrations facilitated reaching the desired pfeca mass loadings on the aers for subsequent regeneration and destruction studies while limiting the volume of water required a total of 2 000 bv of influent was treated through each aer column after the columns were pre conditioned si section 2 and aqueous samples were collected periodically to monitor pfeca and toc concentrations 2 2 2 aer column regeneration and methanol distillation after loading the aer columns with pfeca spiked tap water spent aers were regenerated using three regeneration solutions 1 3 nh4 2so4 3 nh4oh brine alkaline 2 0 2 nh4 2so4 80 methanol brine co solvent and 3 0 2 nh4 2so4 80 propylene glycol brine co solvent rationales for selecting the three regeneration recipes are provided in the si section 2 individual spent aer columns were used to evaluate the effectiveness of each regenerant and approximately 147 ml 10 bv of regenerant was pumped through each aer column over three hours with a flow rate of 0 82 ml min ebct 18 mins hlr 0 6 m h the longer ebct during the regeneration process provided increased contact time between the regenerants and impacted aers to potentially improve pfeca regeneration efficiencies the regenerant that produced the highest pfeca desorption in the tap water study was further selected to regenerate the spent aer columns from the groundwater experiment a total of 26 bv of regenerant was used for aers that had treated pfeca spiked groundwater which had a higher toc concentration than the tap water 7 3 compared to 0 6 mg l table 2 the produced waste from the groundwater study was distilled at 70 c for 7 5 hours to reduce its methanol content for the eco treatment because methanol is known for consuming hydroxyl radicals during eco schaefer et al 2020 the distillation process was conducted on a heating plate with the regenerant stirred constantly the total volume of the regenerant was distilled to 3 of its original volume to minimize the presence of methanol before reconstituting with di water to 150 ml to provide sufficient solution volume for subsequent eco testing note reconstituting with di is not required for full scale operations that produce enough still bottoms for eco treatment all uptake and regeneration experiments were conducted in duplicate aliquots of samples from the regenerants and still bottoms were collected and analyzed for pfecas to ensure no pfeca loss occurred during the distillation process the methanol content in the samples before and after the distillation process was also measured using gas chromatography with flame ionization detection gc fid to calculate its total methanol removal efficiency 2 2 3 electrochemical oxidation experiment the still bottoms produced from the distillation process were treated in a single compartment microflow eco cell electrocell north america inc with a stainless steel cathode and a boron doped diamond on niobium support anode condias gmbh germany the active surface area of each electrode was 10 cm2 the distance between electrodes was 4 mm the eco experiments were performed similarly to those described previously schaefer et al 2018 schaefer et al 2020 briefly the diluted still bottoms 150 ml were recirculated through the electrochemical cell at 100 ml min using a peristaltic pump for 24 hours at room temperature 25 c a constant current density 40 ma cm2 was applied to the solutions via an e3633a 200w power supply agilent and each eco cell s applied voltage was monitored throughout the experiment duplicate eco cells were prepared to treat the still bottoms and aqueous samples were collected periodically to determine ph anions pfceas toc and chemical oxidation demand cod 2 3 analytical concentrations of target pfecas and their possible degradation intermediates were determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms and lc quadrupole time of flight qtof ms respectively details of the lc ms ms lc qtof ms and other analytical e g toc and anions methods are provided in the si section si 2 2 4 energy requirements to assess the energy consumption of the eco treatment the electric energy per order of magnitude of individual pfeca removed ee o was calculated using equation 1 e e o w v l o g c 0 c f where ee o is the energy per order of magnitude of individual pfeca removed kwh m3 w is the energy consumed by the eco system over the 24 hour reaction time kwh v is the volume of the still bottom m3 c0 and cf are the initial and final concentrations of individual pfeca Âµg l the calculation of energy consumption for the distillation and pumping processes is included in the si section si 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 aer column experiments tap water column experiments with pfeca spiked tap water were conducted to compare the effectiveness of 1 the two aers for pfeca removal and 2 the three regenerant formulations for pfeca recovery from each aer the initial concentration of individual pfecas in the influent is summarized in table 1 as shown in fig s3 all four pfecas showed minimal breakthrough throughout the loading experiment i e 2 000 bvs and more than 99 9 of their total mass in the influent was removed by both aers which translated into an average pfeca loading of 4 72 mg of total pfeca g aer it is worth noting that the adsorption capacity of the two aers is expected to be greater than this value because negligible breakthroughs occurred at the end of the loading experiment because of their high affinity toward pfcas in batch studies fang et al 2021 it is not surprising that the two selected aers displayed strong selectivity towards the four pfecas selected here while the uptake of pfecas was similar between the two aers regeneration efficiencies were very different between the two aers as well as among the regeneration recipes fig 1 shows that pfeca recovery from the pfa694e resin was negligible 3 for all pfecas regeneration recipes whereas the brine methanol regenerant recovered a substantial 60 percentage of pfecas from the a592e resin column the extremely low regeneration of pfa694e is likely due to its morphology as shown in table s1 the only known structural difference available from the vendor for the two aers is their porosity where a592e is classified as a macroporous resin and pfa694e as a gel type resin the primary difference between gel type and macroporous aers is the degree of their backbone cross linking on average the pore size of the less cross linked macroporous resins is more than twice that of the heavily cross linked gel type resins sengupta 2017 it follows that the larger pores within macroporous aers e g a592e can provide an easier path for regenerants to access the sorbed pfecas furthermore past studies have found that the intraparticle diffusion path length within gel type resins is longer than within macroporous resins and can result in a slower sorption desorption rate sengupta 2017 nonetheless given the limited information available on the two aers detailed physical anatomy more investigation is still needed to further confirm the factors that differentiate their regenereability as for the regeneration of a592e only the salt methanol solution showed promising results for releasing the four pfecas among the three investigated regenerants fig 1 while past studies showed that brine only regenerants could potentially recharge pfas spent aers they were only successful for shorter chain compounds e g perfluorobutanoic acid with more hydrophilic aers e g polyacrylic resin which are less effective for removing pfecas dixit et al 2020a liu and sun 2021 the difference in pfeca release between the brine only and salt methanol solutions indicates that an organic cosolvent is needed to disrupt hydrophobic interactions between pfecas and aers to achieve a high regeneration percentage to our surprise the propylene glycol based regenerant yielded only a low pfeca recovery in the a592e column 30 the lower regeneration efficiency of the propylene glycol compared to the methanol regenerant is potentially related to the additional alcohol functional group attached to propylene glycol which can induce additional hydrogen bonds with water and reduce its ability to disrupt hydrophobic interactions between the pfecas and the aer based on the results observed from the screening experiments a592e and the salt methanol solution were selected as the optimized aer and regenerant combination to further evaluate pfeca uptake and regeneration in the context of treating pfeca spiked groundwater with an elevated doc concentration 3 2 aer column experiments groundwater pfeca uptake and regeneration profiles of the four pfecas are shown in fig 2 a b for the a592e columns initial individual pfeca concentrations in the spiked groundwater are provided in table 1 unlike the tap water study breakthrough 5 to 10 of the influent concentrations of all four pfecas was observed in the a592e columns over the course of treating 2 000 bvs of pfeca spiked groundwater and breakthrough percentages increased with increasing loading volume fig 2a the percentage of the total pfeca mass removed from the groundwater ranged from 90 96 throughout the study the lower removal percentages compared to those obtained in tap water suggest that elevated dom level in groundwater table 2 interfered with pfeca uptake by the aer this concept was supported by the toc removal and breakthrough trend observed in the a592e column as shown in fig 2a more than 70 of the toc in the groundwater influent was removed by the aer columns after 2 000 bvs of loading and nearly 20 of breakthrough was detected after 500 bvs previous aer studies have shown that nom such as humic acid fulvic acid and large molecular weight organic fractions can inhibit the removal of pfaas by aers from natural waters dixit et al 2019 gagliano et al 2020 kothawala et al 2017 the results presented herein for pfecas are consistent with these previous aer studies using pfaas with respect to the adverse impacts of nom results of the groundwater study showed pfecas with different perfluorinated carbon chains displayed strong but similar affinity towards the aer for example the total mass percentage adsorbed by a592e for pfmopra ncf 3 pfmoba ncf 4 and hfpo da ncf 5 was 90 92 and 93 respectively where ncf is the number of fluorinated carbon atoms these results differ from previous pfaa studies where selectivity coefficients between pfas and aers are higher for compounds with more hydrophobic features e g longer perfluoroalkyl chain boyer et al 2021 fang et al 2021 the equally high adsorption percentage of a592e towards the four pfecas suggests it is highly effective for treating pfecas with different structural features another phenomenon observed in this study is the addition of an ether group in pfecas increased the affinity when ncf was constant as shown in fig 2a uptake of pfdohpa by a592e was 96 2 1 3 while that of pfmoba was 92 2 2 1 errors indicate the 95 confidence interval the only structural difference between these two compounds is one additional ether group in pfdohpa table 1 a similar trend was also observed when comparing the adsorption of perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids where a polyfluorinated ether sulfonate with the same number of carbon chains as pfos showed a higher adsorption percentage than pfos du et al 2016 in theory ether functional groups should increase the parent compound s hydrophilicity because its oxygen atom can facilitate hydrogen bonding which in turn is expected to decrease the affinity of the parent compound towards hydrophobic aers one explanation for the higher adsorption of pfdohpa two ether groups than pfmoba one ether group in this work is that the steric hindrance produced by pfdohpa s ether group neighboring fluorine atoms prohibits its ability to form hydrogen bonds han et al 2021 it follows that the ether oxygen in pfdohpa is essentially behaving more like a carbon atom which increases the chain length and affinity of the parent compound towards aers han et al 2021 pfdohpa also exhibited a higher adsorption percentage compared to hfpo da e g 96 2 1 3 vs 92 9 2 3 even though both compounds have the same linear carbon chain length this outcome is potentially caused by the difference in their carbon chain s arrangement where pfdohpa is linear while hfpo da is branched table 1 the bulkier branched carbon chain in hfpo da can decrease its accessibility for exchange sites on the aers and resulted in lower uptake past studies have shown that pfas with bulkier functional groups can result in a lower adsorption rate than their linear analogues in both aers and gac fang et al 2021 rodowa et al 2020 the regeneration profile for the pfeca loaded a592e resin columns is shown in fig 2b compared to the results from the screening tests with low toc tap water the regeneration efficiency of the salt methanol solution decreased significantly for the a592e resin columns that had treated groundwater for example after the same regeneration process e g 10 bvs at 0 82 ml min the pfeca regeneration percentages of the columns that had treated tap water ranged from 66 103 whereas it was 42 58 after the 1st regeneration of the column that had treated groundwater the different regeneration efficiencies between the two water sources were likely caused by the differences in om loading on the columns that had treated tap water and groundwater by mass balance more than 150 mg as c of the groundwater dom was loaded to the a592e column at the end of the treatment cycle compared to 18 mg as c of the tap water dom it is possible that the groundwater dom competed with pfecas as solutes during the regeneration process and or blocked the resin pores to prevent pfecas desorption dixit et al 2018 li et al 2003 which in turn decreased the regeneration efficiency of the regenerant for pfecas to further evaluate the regenerability of the aer column loaded with groundwater dom a second regeneration was performed using 16 bvs of regenerants at a loading rate of 0 25 ml min interestingly even with additional bvs and a slower flow rate the second regeneration resulted in less pfeca recovery than the first i e 10 20 less based on the total adsorbed pfeca mass in the columns this outcome suggests that more bvs are needed for resin regeneration as the pfecas mass on the aer columns decreases overall the total regeneration percentage for all pfecas reached around 82 92 after 26 bvs of regeneration indicating appreciable regeneration of the pfeca impacted aer in the presence of high dom can be achieved with a small volume i e 1 8 of the loading volume of salt methanol regenerant nonetheless the high percentage of methanol in the regenerant should be further reduced via distillation to minimize the waste volume produced from the regeneration procedure and recover the organic solvent for future regeneration cycles it is worth noting that the structure of the pfecas also impacted regeneration efficiency as shown in fig 2b the regeneration of the pfecas increased p 0 05 as their carbon chain length increases i e more hydrophobic in the presence of the water methanol regenerant on the other hand the desorption of hfpo da and pfdohpa did not show a large difference indicating the steric hindrance effect of branched pfecas e g hfpo da only impact their interaction with solid phase medium e g aers 3 3 eco treatment of regeneration waste the total volume of the exhausted regenerant was reduced by a factor of 18 after distillation and table s2 summarizes the properties of the regenerants before and after the distillation process results of the post distillation solution still bottoms showed that negligible pfeca losses occurred during the distillation process and the methanol mass decreased by more than 4 orders of magnitude compared to the non distilled solution the properties of the reconstituted with di water still bottoms before and after the eco treatment are provided in table 3 an eco cell voltage of 22 23 v was applied throughout the experiment to produce a constant 40 ma cm2 current density the total energy consumed by the eco cell per 24 hours is 0 22 kwh both the toc and cod removal in the still bottom was more than 96 and a small increase in temperature from approximately 23 to 26 c occurred during the treatment the ph of the still bottoms decreased to as low as 3 due to the acid production commonly observed at bdd anodes carter and farrell 2008 the log scale degradation profile of the four pfecas in the concentrated still bottoms and their overall defluorination percentage over 24 hours of eco treatment are shown in fig 3 despite the high concentrations of hydroxyl radical scavenging species in the still bottom e g toc chloride sulfate baeza and knappe 2011 schaefer et al 2017 more than 5 log removal in concentration was achieved after 24 hours of eco treatment and 85 removal was achieved after 2 hours in addition the eco cells achieved 90 defluorination sum for all four pfecas combined based on aqueous fluoride generation after 24 hours signifying the high pfeca mineralization efficiency of the designed system because the final ph of the treated solution ph 2 9 is close to the acid dissociation constant pk a of hydrofluoric acid hf pk a 3 2 it is plausible that the defluorination percentage exceeded 90 after eco treatment if a portion of the released fluorine was lost in the form of hf gases fang et al 2019 to minimize the adverse effect of the generated hf on the treatment system i e corrosion either controlling the eco system s effluent ph or installing a vacuum hood coupled with an alkaline trapping electrolyte e g 0 1m naoh is recommended removal of all four investigated pfecas were well described by a pseudo first order rate law r2 0 99 as indicated by the regression results shown in fig 3 resulting kinetic profiles and rate constants are provided in si fig s4 and table s3 furthermore current normalized pseudo first order rate constants were calculated for the four pfecas using equation 2 to assess their structure reactivity relationships k n k v s d where kn is the current normalized pseudo first order rate constant l h 1a 1 k is the first order rate constant h 1 table s3 v is the volume of the treated solution l s is the specific surface area of the anode m2 and d is the applied current density ma m2 as shown in table 4 a slight increase in the kn values was observed for pfecas with increasing alkyl chain length and the number of ether groups it is worth noting that while the increase of the kn values is small between different pfecas the increasing trend based on their structural features e g chain length and ether group was found statistically significant p 0 05 moreover a similar reactivity trend was also observed in pfca studies where shorter chain pfcas showed a lower kn than their longer chain analogues e g pfhpa pfoa comparison table 4 past studies have indicated that the higher kn values of long chain pfcas during eco treatment can be attributed to their increased adsorption on the hydrophobic bdd surface zhuo et al 2012 and the smaller energy gap between their lowest and highest unoccupied molecular orbitals i e more prone to donate electrons cheng et al 2018 wang et al 2020 because the oxidative degradation of both pfcas and pfecas is initiated by direct electron transfer niu et al 2013 pica et al 2019 it is likely that the surface adsorption and electron susceptibility trend observed for long chain pfcas during eco treatment also applies to pfecas however such a trend needs to be further verified via computational modeling such as density functional theory dft calculation in future efforts a comparison of kn values for hfpo da among different studies also indicated that the chloride concentration in the treated solution negatively impacts the efficiency of the eco system for example the kn of hfpo da decreased by more than 80 when the cl concentration in the treated matrix increased from 0 to 495 ppm table 4 because previous studies confirmed that hydroxyl radicals play an important role in the cleaving of c f bonds in eco systems and identified chloride as a hydroxyl radical scavenging agent schaefer et al 2017 wang et al 2020 results from this work suggests that the presence of hydroxyl radicals are also crucial for the defluorination of pfecas olvera vargas et al 2022 suresh babu et al 2022 findings from this work were also compared with the data from a recent pfaa eco study where aer still bottom was used as the influent and magnÃ©li phase titanium suboxide was used as the anode table 4 the extremely low kn values of pfaas and defluorination ratio from the previous work suggest that both chloride ion and toc can inhibit the performance of the eco treatment system regardless of the selected electrode wang et al 2021 another observation when comparing the kn values among different eco studies is that all four pfecas showed a higher rate constant than pfoa even when pfoa was in a matrix with no or low chloride and toc concentrations schaefer et al 2018 one possible explanation for the observed higher rate constants is the addition of ether groups in pfecas compared to pfcas because the ether carbon i e c o c in hfpo da s backbone has substantially lower dissociation energy than the c c bond in pfoa pica et al 2019 it is plausible that this structural modification leads to a faster degradation rate for pfecas compared to pfcas this concept is supported by the different oxidative electron transfer pathways proposed for hfpo da and pfoa where hfpo da starts with decarboxylation or direct ether oxygen bond cleavage near the ether oxygen but pfoa starts with c c bond cleavage at the carboxylate headgroup niu et al 2013 olvera vargas et al 2022 yang et al 2022 one challenge for implementing eco treatment systems is perchlorate production because most influent sources contain appreciable levels of chloride especially for concentrated waste streams while a mitigation strategy was utilized in this study by regenerating the spent aer columns with sulfate based salts to minimize the presence of chloride ions in the still bottom approximately 2 mm of chloride were present in the still bottoms the chloride ion detected in the still bottoms is likely from the regeneration process where the adsorbed chlorine from the groundwater influent is washed off and concentrated in the spent regenerant it follows that the final chloride concentration in the still bottoms represents 1 6 of the total chloride mass flushed through the aer columns tables 2 3 following eco treatment for 24 hours the perchlorate concentration was 2 mm indicating that chloride in the still bottoms was completely oxidized to perchlorate table 3 to address the perchlorate produced during eco system operations past sand column studies have demonstrated that up to 3 log removal of perchlorate ions can be achieved via biological treatment within 10 days schaefer et al 2017 given the excellent pfeca treatment potential of the eco system e g 5 log removal of the parent pfecas and 85 defluorination in one day it is worth evaluating the economic impact of adding follow up polishing steps for perchlorate treatment and future investigations are needed to integrate these systems into an optimized treatment train 3 4 proposed electrochemical degradation pathways results from suspect screening analysis using lc qtof ms confirmed trifluoroacetic acid tfa perfluoropropionic acid pfpra and perfluoro 2 methoxyacetic acid pfmoaa as transformation products tps of the pfecas during eco treatment details of the confirmation procedure are provided in the si section si 5 while tfa and pfpra are known tps for hfpo da from previous electrochemical oxidation studies olvera vargas et al 2022 suresh babu et al 2022 yang et al 2022 limited information is available on tps for other pfecas to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that identified pfmoaa as an electrochemical degradation intermediate transformation pathways of the investigated pfecas are proposed based on the tps determined in this study and previously proposed mechanisms as shown in figs 4 and 5 the transformation of all four pfecas is expected to be initiated by direct electron transfer det at the carboxylic group followed by kolbe decarboxylation to form an alcohol intermediate intermediate a c e and g such step is generally accepted as the starting point for the degradation of pfecas and pfcas during eco treatment pica et al 2019 radjenovic et al 2020 suresh babu et al 2022 because the intermediates of hfpo da and pfdohpa after det and kolbe decarboxylation intermediate a and g share a similar structural configuration for their alcohol group and ether bridges two potential degradation pathways that focused on the reaction of these two moieties are proposed pathway 1 and 2 in fig 4 in pathway 1 no breakage of ether bridges is proposed because it is not kinetically favorable based on the density functional theory dft calculation results of a previous study pica et al 2019 instead intermediate a and g is proposed to lose a cf3 after being attacked by oh and form an acyl fluoride intermediate pica et al 2019 the acyl fluoride intermediates then undergo reaction with oh instead of hydrolysis because of favorable kinetics given by dft calculation followed by releasing of fcooh and cf2o in sequence until complete mineralization to hf and co2 however the confirmation of pfpra in this work suggested otherwise because cf3cf2cf2 is the prerequisite for forming pfpra during eco treatment which can only be generated via the ether bond cleavage in hfpo da therefore an alternative pathway is proposed pathway 2 in this work with the weaker ether bridge of intermediate a and g being attacked by hydroxyl radical oh similar to the degradation of polyfluoroalkyl ether acids with a o cfh moiety during total oxidizable precursor top assay zhang et al 2019 then the produced intermediates are proposed to go through a sequential unzipping process as is the case for legacy pfas during eco treatment le et al 2019 niu et al 2013 radjenovic et al 2020 leading to the generation of pfpra and tea before complete mineralization as for the degradation of pfmopra and pfmoba these compounds are expected to follow the same degradation pathway because their similarity in structure after the det and kolbe decarboxylation the alcohol intermediates of pfmopra and pfmoba intermediate c and e are proposed to be attacked by oh and form acyl fluoride intermediates by releasing f two potential transformation pathways are proposed for acyl fluoride intermediate d and f pathway 3 and 4 in fig 5 in pathway 3 the acyl fluoride intermediates are proposed undergo hydrolysis and produce pfmoaa as an intermediate the proposed pathway also indicates that pfmopra can be a possible intermediate during the hydrolysis of pfmoba s acyl fluoride intermediate f fig 5a while further confirmation via single solute experiments is needed to validate the production of pfmopra during pfmoba degradation the proposed reaction mechanism suggests this phenomenon can be a cause of the slower degradation kinetic of pfmopra compared to the other three pfecas table 4 following the hydrolysis of the acyl fluoride intermediates the generated pfmoaa is proposed to go through a new cycle of det and kolbe decarboxylation leading to complete mineralization the second pathway pathway 4 in proposed for the acyl fluoride intermediates of pfmopra and pfmoba is similar to pathway 1 where the intermediates undergo reaction with oh followed by fcooh release and eventual production of hf and co2 based on the proposed degradation pathways for the four pfecas it is evident that the rate limiting step of pfecas after det and kolbe decarboxylation differs from those for pfcas nonetheless because the exact mechanisms for electrooxidation of pfecas and pfcas are still under debate in the scientific community further investigations such as single solute eco experiments and computational modeling are still needed to verify the proposed degradation pathways confirm the rate limiting step i e kinetics or mass transfer for the degradation of different pfecas and their intermediates identify additional tps for individual pfecas and quantify the contribution of different pathways to tp generation to investigate the impact of tps and potentially volatilized hf on the fluorine mass balance the distribution of fluorine in the eco system was calculated based on the initial mass of fluorine added in the form of pfecas the mass of fluoride measured in the aqueous phase and the mass of fluorine remaining in quantified pfecas the mass of fluorine contained in tps both identified and unidentified as well as in hf that may have volatilized was calculated as the difference between initially added fluorine and fluorine fluoride quantified in the aqueous phase as shown in fig 6 while only 10 of the initially added fluorine remained in the parent pfecas after 2 hours of eco treatment 30 was in the form of tps and or volatilized hf in other words parent compound degradation occurs at a faster rate than mineralization therefore total organic fluorine measurements and headspace analyses are necessary to evaluate the treatment efficiency of pfeca destructive technologies more completely in addition the gradual release of f to the aqueous phase over time agrees with degradation pathways described here for pfecas and in previous studies for pfcas where c f bond cleavage led to the formation of multiple organofluorine reaction intermediates lastly the missing 10 of the initially added fluorine not recovered in the form of aqueous fluoride after 24 hrs of eco treatment suggests that some produced fluorine may have adsorbed to the eco cells ochiai et al 2011 volatilized to the atmosphere and or remained in organic reaction products that volatilized and or remained in the aqueous phase but could not be detected by our lc qtof ms method 3 5 energy cost of the treatment train the total energy consumed during the adsorption regeneration and eco treatment of pfecas by peristaltic pumps is estimated to be 0 025 kwh and the energy consumed during the distillation process by the heating element and stir plate is estimated to be 7 kwh or 1 75 kwh order of methanol concentration decrease while the energy cost for the distillation process seemed high it should be noted that the energy calculation for the above processes is based on each instrument s maximum power output their actual energy cost during operation is expected to be lower because they were operated at a lower setting furthermore because this work aims to evaluate the feasibility of treating on site generated still bottom using eco technology the energy efficiency of the pumping and distillation process was not optimized future work is still needed to develop an enhanced distillation process that not only improves the energy efficiency of the heating element but also recovers the distilled solvent for future use as for the energy consumption of the eco treatment process the ee o was calculated using equation 1 as shown in table 5 the ee o for the four pfecas is ranged between 263 to 275 kwh m3 when calculated based on the volume of the still bottom while these energy demands are high compared to previous eco or other destruction technologies e g 5 100 kwh m3 nau hix et al 2021 schaefer et al 2017 schaefer et al 2018 two considerations are worth mentioning first the electrochemically treated still bottom in this work is 0 5 of the volume that is treated through the aer columns thus the energy demand per volume of total groundwater treated would be 200 times less than the calculated values second because the four pfecas concentration at the end of the eco treatment was below their analytical detection limit table 3 5 ng l their log removal term in equation 1 was estimated using 5 ng l as cf however the actual concentration of each pfeca after 24 hour eco treatment is expected to be much lower than 5 ng l as illustrated in the pseudo first order fit model fig 3 and it would result in an even lower ee o value for each pfeca when applied to equation 1 after adjusting the abovementioned parameters with the total groundwater volume and predicted pfeca concentration using the pseudo first order fit model a modified ee o value for each pfeca is estimated to be between 0 83 1 03 kwh m3 table 5 in summary compared with the energy consumption of using eco as a stand alone process for treating pfeca in groundwater the treatment train proposed in this work significantly reduced the energy requirement for defluorinating pfecas 4 conclusion this research examined the feasibility of combining aer and electrochemical oxidation technologies as an integrated separation concentration destruction treatment train for the removal of pfecas in contaminated water results from the separation process highlight that the affinity of pfecas for aers is chain length dependent in a manner similar to traditionally studied pfcas furthermore by comparing the adsorption rate of pfecas with different ether group numbers pfdohpa vs pfmoba the extra ether oxygen atom was found to increase the hydrophobicity of the parent compound rather than decrease likely because neighboring fluorine atoms shielded the ether oxygen and prevented it from forming h bonds with water results from the concentration regeneration process showed that a high percentage e g 80 of organic cosolvent is necessary for achieving high regeneration efficiency and aer morphology pfeca structure and dom loading impact regeneration efficiency while utilizing high cosolvent content regenerants is not desirable at treatment facilities due to their hazardous nature it should be noted that aer regeneration is not operated continuously and the frequency of resin regeneration is highly site specific in addition results of the distillation process in this work showed that with proper optimization and management the solvent content of the spent regenerants can be significantly reduced to produce a low volume aqueous waste with high concentrations of pfecas salts and residual organic content that is ideal for downstream destruction technologies the treatment of the still bottoms destruction process in this research indicated that the electrochemical oxidative process using bdd anodes is extremely effective for degrading and defluorinating the investigated pfecas furthermore the measured current normalized pseudo first order rate constants showed that pfecas generally exhibit a higher first order rate than pfcas under similar environmental conditions on the other hand the smaller first order rate constants observed for the short chain pfecas suggest additional monitoring is needed during treatment non target analysis of the treated still bottoms confirmed pfmoaa for the first time as a tp for pfecas during eco treatment and reaction pathways were proposed for the studied pfecas throughout the studied separation concentration destruction treatment process dom in groundwater showed strong inhibition to the uptake release and destruction of the investigated pfecas such outcomes suggest that a dom pretreatment process should be considered for future full scale treatment train designs while results from this work shed light on the potential degradation mechanisms of the four pfecas and advanced the knowledge of combining aer and eo treatment technologies as one integrated system for the treatment of pfecas future work is still needed to evaluate the longevity of the regenerated aer column and elucidate additional tps to confirm the proposed degradation pathways given that the data show high regeneration efficiency can be achieved for the aer columns with only limited regenerant volume it is anticipated that a repeated adsorption desorption process can be performed using the designed system nonetheless a more rigorous analysis using different water matrices is needed for verification additional assessments such as single solute studies are also needed to verify the degradation intermediates of the pfecas and confirm factors that control their degradation rate moreover additional optimizations such as solvent recovery and tandem biological treatment need to be evaluated to better integrate the distillation and perchlorate treatment processes into the proposed treatment train to treat pfeca impacted water sources safely and more effectively lastly a detailed comparison should be made to other similar treatment technologies to systematically evaluate the performance of the proposed treatment system based on not only its pfas treatment efficiency

15135,perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids pfecas are a group of emerging recalcitrant contaminants that are being developed to replace legacy per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas in industrial applications and that are generated as by products in fluoropolymer manufacturing here we report on the removal and destruction of four structurally different pfecas using an integrated anion exchange resin aer and electrochemical oxidation eco treatment train results from this work illustrated that 1 flow through columns packed with pfas selective aers are highly effective for the removal of pfecas and 2 pfeca affinity is strongly correlated with their hydrophobic features regeneration of the spent resin columns revealed that high percentage e g 80 of organic cosolvent is necessary for achieving 60 100 pfeca release and regeneration efficiency was higher for a macroporous resin than a gel type resin treatment of spent regenerants showed 1 99 99 methanol removal was achieved by distillation 2 99 999 conversion of the four studied pfecas was achieved during the eco treatment of the still bottoms after 24 hours with an energy per order of magnitude of pfeca removal ee o 1 03 kwh m3 of total groundwater treated and 3 85 of the organic fluorine was recovered as inorganic fluoride trifluoroacetic acid tfa perfluoropropionic acid pfpra and perfluoro 2 methoxyacetic acid pfmoaa were confirmed via high resolution mass spectrometry as transformation products tps in the treated still bottoms and two distinctive degradation schemes and four reaction pathways are proposed for the four pfecas lastly dissolved organic matter dom inhibited uptake regeneration and oxidation of pfecas throughout the treatment train suggesting pretreatment steps targeting dom removal can enhance the system s treatment efficiency results from this work provide guidelines for developing effective separation concentration destruction treatment trains and meaningful insights for achieving pfeca destruction in impacted aquatic systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction since the mid 1900s per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas and more specifically perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas have been used in various consumer products and industrial applications due to their extreme resistance to chemical and thermal degradation lindstrom et al 2011 as a result pfaa contamination in the environment has become a considerable concern as they exhibit significant bioaccumulation potential and toxicity in wildlife and humans and many regulatory efforts have been advanced to reduce their production and usage barzen hanson et al 2017 hu et al 2016 to limit the use of pfaas in industrial applications perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids pfecas containing ether groups c o c have been manufactured the insertion of oxygen atoms into perfluoroalkyl backbones is designed to make the molecules more labile to degradation and less bioaccumulative but recent toxicological studies have found that selected pfecas were even more bioaccumulative than their perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid pfca predecessors pan et al 2017 strynar et al 2015 pfecas enter the environment as a result of their use as processing aids in fluoropolymer production galloway et al 2020 washington et al 2020 as well as in the form of byproducts that are generated during the production of fluoropolymer manufacturing hopkins et al 2018 the frequent detection of pfecas in various environmental matrices gebbink et al 2017 hopkins et al 2018 sun et al 2016 has made them a new class of contaminants of emerging concern for instance hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid hfpo da commonly known as genx has been detected in private drinking water wells at concentrations up to 4 000 ng l ncdeq 2017 given their structural similarities with pfcas pfecas are not removed or transformed in conventional and many advanced treatment processes i e ozonation at water treatment facilities hopkins et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 current treatment approaches for pfecas have considered physical separation with subsequent pfeca destruction in the concentrate liu and sun 2021 pica et al 2019 among the available separation technologies anion exchange resins aers have received increased attention as they can remove pfas through both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions and exhibit higher selectivity towards short chain pfcas pfecas than carbonaceous materials e g granular activated carbon gac fang et al 2021 liu and sun 2021 batch screening results for nine aers and nine pfecas showed that increased pfeca uptake was correlated with increased aer and pfeca hydrophobicity e g polystyrene backbone and or long perfluoroalkyl ether chain which agrees with removal trends observed for pfcas and other polyfluorinated compounds boyer et al 2021 fang et al 2021 another advantage of aers is their ability to be regenerated on site without the use of high temperature processes allowing aer reuse for multiple cycles deng et al 2010 dixit et al 2020b zaggia et al 2016 waste produced during the regeneration process which involves the use of methanolic brine can be distilled to remove reclaim the organic solvent which is often vital for aer regeneration in addition the post distillation waste also known as still bottoms is an ideal candidate for destructive technologies as they are often presented in smaller volumes with concentrated pfas content several advanced oxidative and reductive processes have recently been developed to destroy pfecas and electrochemical oxidation eco in particular has shown promising results for pfeca defluorination bentel et al 2020 pica et al 2019 singh et al 2019 it follows that the high salinity of still bottoms also benefits eco treatment due to their highly conductive environment wang et al 2021 while past batch studies increased the mechanistic understanding of aer and eco technology for the treatment of selected pfecas the feasibility of combining these two technologies together as one integrated separation and destruction system remains largely unknown more importantly knowledge gaps remain in the adsorption and regeneration of pfecas in flow through aer columns and a systematic understanding of eco s efficacy in treating pfecas contained still bottoms has not yet been established for example the regeneration of pfeca saturated aers has only been evaluated using salt only solutions e g 10 nh4cl with prolonged contact time e g 3 hours in batch experiments and only minimal desorption was observed for highly selective aers liu and sun 2021 on the other hand while eco treatment showed promising results for pfca mineralization schaefer et al 2018 past studies indicated that pfecas could have different degradation pathways and rates than pfcas during eco due to the additional ether functional group s olvera vargas et al 2022 pica et al 2019 also eco treatment of still bottoms was only evaluated for pfcas using ti4o7 anodes wang et al 2021 in this study the removal and destruction of four pfecas that varied in perfluoroalkyl chain length and number of ether oxygen atoms table 1 were evaluated using aer columns followed by resin regeneration regenerant distillation and eco treatment of still bottoms breakthrough and regeneration data were collected to determine aer and pfecas properties that affect pfecas adsorption and desorption in flow through columns the impact of naturally occurring dissolved organic matter dom on aer column performance was assessed using a pfeca spiked groundwater via a down selected aer column and regeneration scheme spent regenerants produced from the regeneration process were distilled to recover methanol and produce still bottoms were treated in an eco cell equipped with a commercially available boron doped diamond bdd anode samples from the eco reactor were collected over time and analyzed by liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry to identify reaction intermediates and establish reaction pathways as well as by ion chromatography to determine mineralization rates results from this work will provide valuable insights into the removal effectiveness and regenerability of commercially available aers for the treatment of pfecas in flow through columns and the efficacy of bdd based eco technology for treating pfecas contained in still bottoms most importantly it will provide recommendations on the feasibility of coupling aer and eco technology as an integrated system to remediate pfecas at contaminated groundwater sites and at water treatment facilities 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and resins a full listing of chemical reagents and aers is provided in the supporting information si unless otherwise stated all solutions were prepared using deionized di water elga purelab flex 3 18 2 mÏ‰ cm resistivities properties for the two pfas selective aers selected for this study are summarized in table s1 of the si 2 2 pfeca adsorption and destruction experiments 2 2 1 flow through column test two water sources i e tap water and groundwater were chosen as the influents for the aer columns to compare the impact of dom on the pfeca selectivity of the two aers a summary of the two waters characteristics is provided in table 2 the experimental design for the flow through column using glass columns with an inside diameter of 2 5 cm and a height of 10 cm was adopted from a previous study schaefer et al 2019 details of the column design and packing are provided in the si section 2 the design flow rate i e 4 9 ml min for each column was based on a manufacturer recommended empty bed contact time ebct of 3 min and corresponded to a hydraulic loading rate hlr of 0 6 m h a mixture of the four pfecas was spiked into each influent either tap water or groundwater to yield individual pfeca concentrations of approximately 1 mg l the exact initial concentration of each pfeca in the influent is provided in table 1 these elevated pfeca concentrations facilitated reaching the desired pfeca mass loadings on the aers for subsequent regeneration and destruction studies while limiting the volume of water required a total of 2 000 bv of influent was treated through each aer column after the columns were pre conditioned si section 2 and aqueous samples were collected periodically to monitor pfeca and toc concentrations 2 2 2 aer column regeneration and methanol distillation after loading the aer columns with pfeca spiked tap water spent aers were regenerated using three regeneration solutions 1 3 nh4 2so4 3 nh4oh brine alkaline 2 0 2 nh4 2so4 80 methanol brine co solvent and 3 0 2 nh4 2so4 80 propylene glycol brine co solvent rationales for selecting the three regeneration recipes are provided in the si section 2 individual spent aer columns were used to evaluate the effectiveness of each regenerant and approximately 147 ml 10 bv of regenerant was pumped through each aer column over three hours with a flow rate of 0 82 ml min ebct 18 mins hlr 0 6 m h the longer ebct during the regeneration process provided increased contact time between the regenerants and impacted aers to potentially improve pfeca regeneration efficiencies the regenerant that produced the highest pfeca desorption in the tap water study was further selected to regenerate the spent aer columns from the groundwater experiment a total of 26 bv of regenerant was used for aers that had treated pfeca spiked groundwater which had a higher toc concentration than the tap water 7 3 compared to 0 6 mg l table 2 the produced waste from the groundwater study was distilled at 70 c for 7 5 hours to reduce its methanol content for the eco treatment because methanol is known for consuming hydroxyl radicals during eco schaefer et al 2020 the distillation process was conducted on a heating plate with the regenerant stirred constantly the total volume of the regenerant was distilled to 3 of its original volume to minimize the presence of methanol before reconstituting with di water to 150 ml to provide sufficient solution volume for subsequent eco testing note reconstituting with di is not required for full scale operations that produce enough still bottoms for eco treatment all uptake and regeneration experiments were conducted in duplicate aliquots of samples from the regenerants and still bottoms were collected and analyzed for pfecas to ensure no pfeca loss occurred during the distillation process the methanol content in the samples before and after the distillation process was also measured using gas chromatography with flame ionization detection gc fid to calculate its total methanol removal efficiency 2 2 3 electrochemical oxidation experiment the still bottoms produced from the distillation process were treated in a single compartment microflow eco cell electrocell north america inc with a stainless steel cathode and a boron doped diamond on niobium support anode condias gmbh germany the active surface area of each electrode was 10 cm2 the distance between electrodes was 4 mm the eco experiments were performed similarly to those described previously schaefer et al 2018 schaefer et al 2020 briefly the diluted still bottoms 150 ml were recirculated through the electrochemical cell at 100 ml min using a peristaltic pump for 24 hours at room temperature 25 c a constant current density 40 ma cm2 was applied to the solutions via an e3633a 200w power supply agilent and each eco cell s applied voltage was monitored throughout the experiment duplicate eco cells were prepared to treat the still bottoms and aqueous samples were collected periodically to determine ph anions pfceas toc and chemical oxidation demand cod 2 3 analytical concentrations of target pfecas and their possible degradation intermediates were determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms and lc quadrupole time of flight qtof ms respectively details of the lc ms ms lc qtof ms and other analytical e g toc and anions methods are provided in the si section si 2 2 4 energy requirements to assess the energy consumption of the eco treatment the electric energy per order of magnitude of individual pfeca removed ee o was calculated using equation 1 e e o w v l o g c 0 c f where ee o is the energy per order of magnitude of individual pfeca removed kwh m3 w is the energy consumed by the eco system over the 24 hour reaction time kwh v is the volume of the still bottom m3 c0 and cf are the initial and final concentrations of individual pfeca Âµg l the calculation of energy consumption for the distillation and pumping processes is included in the si section si 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 aer column experiments tap water column experiments with pfeca spiked tap water were conducted to compare the effectiveness of 1 the two aers for pfeca removal and 2 the three regenerant formulations for pfeca recovery from each aer the initial concentration of individual pfecas in the influent is summarized in table 1 as shown in fig s3 all four pfecas showed minimal breakthrough throughout the loading experiment i e 2 000 bvs and more than 99 9 of their total mass in the influent was removed by both aers which translated into an average pfeca loading of 4 72 mg of total pfeca g aer it is worth noting that the adsorption capacity of the two aers is expected to be greater than this value because negligible breakthroughs occurred at the end of the loading experiment because of their high affinity toward pfcas in batch studies fang et al 2021 it is not surprising that the two selected aers displayed strong selectivity towards the four pfecas selected here while the uptake of pfecas was similar between the two aers regeneration efficiencies were very different between the two aers as well as among the regeneration recipes fig 1 shows that pfeca recovery from the pfa694e resin was negligible 3 for all pfecas regeneration recipes whereas the brine methanol regenerant recovered a substantial 60 percentage of pfecas from the a592e resin column the extremely low regeneration of pfa694e is likely due to its morphology as shown in table s1 the only known structural difference available from the vendor for the two aers is their porosity where a592e is classified as a macroporous resin and pfa694e as a gel type resin the primary difference between gel type and macroporous aers is the degree of their backbone cross linking on average the pore size of the less cross linked macroporous resins is more than twice that of the heavily cross linked gel type resins sengupta 2017 it follows that the larger pores within macroporous aers e g a592e can provide an easier path for regenerants to access the sorbed pfecas furthermore past studies have found that the intraparticle diffusion path length within gel type resins is longer than within macroporous resins and can result in a slower sorption desorption rate sengupta 2017 nonetheless given the limited information available on the two aers detailed physical anatomy more investigation is still needed to further confirm the factors that differentiate their regenereability as for the regeneration of a592e only the salt methanol solution showed promising results for releasing the four pfecas among the three investigated regenerants fig 1 while past studies showed that brine only regenerants could potentially recharge pfas spent aers they were only successful for shorter chain compounds e g perfluorobutanoic acid with more hydrophilic aers e g polyacrylic resin which are less effective for removing pfecas dixit et al 2020a liu and sun 2021 the difference in pfeca release between the brine only and salt methanol solutions indicates that an organic cosolvent is needed to disrupt hydrophobic interactions between pfecas and aers to achieve a high regeneration percentage to our surprise the propylene glycol based regenerant yielded only a low pfeca recovery in the a592e column 30 the lower regeneration efficiency of the propylene glycol compared to the methanol regenerant is potentially related to the additional alcohol functional group attached to propylene glycol which can induce additional hydrogen bonds with water and reduce its ability to disrupt hydrophobic interactions between the pfecas and the aer based on the results observed from the screening experiments a592e and the salt methanol solution were selected as the optimized aer and regenerant combination to further evaluate pfeca uptake and regeneration in the context of treating pfeca spiked groundwater with an elevated doc concentration 3 2 aer column experiments groundwater pfeca uptake and regeneration profiles of the four pfecas are shown in fig 2 a b for the a592e columns initial individual pfeca concentrations in the spiked groundwater are provided in table 1 unlike the tap water study breakthrough 5 to 10 of the influent concentrations of all four pfecas was observed in the a592e columns over the course of treating 2 000 bvs of pfeca spiked groundwater and breakthrough percentages increased with increasing loading volume fig 2a the percentage of the total pfeca mass removed from the groundwater ranged from 90 96 throughout the study the lower removal percentages compared to those obtained in tap water suggest that elevated dom level in groundwater table 2 interfered with pfeca uptake by the aer this concept was supported by the toc removal and breakthrough trend observed in the a592e column as shown in fig 2a more than 70 of the toc in the groundwater influent was removed by the aer columns after 2 000 bvs of loading and nearly 20 of breakthrough was detected after 500 bvs previous aer studies have shown that nom such as humic acid fulvic acid and large molecular weight organic fractions can inhibit the removal of pfaas by aers from natural waters dixit et al 2019 gagliano et al 2020 kothawala et al 2017 the results presented herein for pfecas are consistent with these previous aer studies using pfaas with respect to the adverse impacts of nom results of the groundwater study showed pfecas with different perfluorinated carbon chains displayed strong but similar affinity towards the aer for example the total mass percentage adsorbed by a592e for pfmopra ncf 3 pfmoba ncf 4 and hfpo da ncf 5 was 90 92 and 93 respectively where ncf is the number of fluorinated carbon atoms these results differ from previous pfaa studies where selectivity coefficients between pfas and aers are higher for compounds with more hydrophobic features e g longer perfluoroalkyl chain boyer et al 2021 fang et al 2021 the equally high adsorption percentage of a592e towards the four pfecas suggests it is highly effective for treating pfecas with different structural features another phenomenon observed in this study is the addition of an ether group in pfecas increased the affinity when ncf was constant as shown in fig 2a uptake of pfdohpa by a592e was 96 2 1 3 while that of pfmoba was 92 2 2 1 errors indicate the 95 confidence interval the only structural difference between these two compounds is one additional ether group in pfdohpa table 1 a similar trend was also observed when comparing the adsorption of perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids where a polyfluorinated ether sulfonate with the same number of carbon chains as pfos showed a higher adsorption percentage than pfos du et al 2016 in theory ether functional groups should increase the parent compound s hydrophilicity because its oxygen atom can facilitate hydrogen bonding which in turn is expected to decrease the affinity of the parent compound towards hydrophobic aers one explanation for the higher adsorption of pfdohpa two ether groups than pfmoba one ether group in this work is that the steric hindrance produced by pfdohpa s ether group neighboring fluorine atoms prohibits its ability to form hydrogen bonds han et al 2021 it follows that the ether oxygen in pfdohpa is essentially behaving more like a carbon atom which increases the chain length and affinity of the parent compound towards aers han et al 2021 pfdohpa also exhibited a higher adsorption percentage compared to hfpo da e g 96 2 1 3 vs 92 9 2 3 even though both compounds have the same linear carbon chain length this outcome is potentially caused by the difference in their carbon chain s arrangement where pfdohpa is linear while hfpo da is branched table 1 the bulkier branched carbon chain in hfpo da can decrease its accessibility for exchange sites on the aers and resulted in lower uptake past studies have shown that pfas with bulkier functional groups can result in a lower adsorption rate than their linear analogues in both aers and gac fang et al 2021 rodowa et al 2020 the regeneration profile for the pfeca loaded a592e resin columns is shown in fig 2b compared to the results from the screening tests with low toc tap water the regeneration efficiency of the salt methanol solution decreased significantly for the a592e resin columns that had treated groundwater for example after the same regeneration process e g 10 bvs at 0 82 ml min the pfeca regeneration percentages of the columns that had treated tap water ranged from 66 103 whereas it was 42 58 after the 1st regeneration of the column that had treated groundwater the different regeneration efficiencies between the two water sources were likely caused by the differences in om loading on the columns that had treated tap water and groundwater by mass balance more than 150 mg as c of the groundwater dom was loaded to the a592e column at the end of the treatment cycle compared to 18 mg as c of the tap water dom it is possible that the groundwater dom competed with pfecas as solutes during the regeneration process and or blocked the resin pores to prevent pfecas desorption dixit et al 2018 li et al 2003 which in turn decreased the regeneration efficiency of the regenerant for pfecas to further evaluate the regenerability of the aer column loaded with groundwater dom a second regeneration was performed using 16 bvs of regenerants at a loading rate of 0 25 ml min interestingly even with additional bvs and a slower flow rate the second regeneration resulted in less pfeca recovery than the first i e 10 20 less based on the total adsorbed pfeca mass in the columns this outcome suggests that more bvs are needed for resin regeneration as the pfecas mass on the aer columns decreases overall the total regeneration percentage for all pfecas reached around 82 92 after 26 bvs of regeneration indicating appreciable regeneration of the pfeca impacted aer in the presence of high dom can be achieved with a small volume i e 1 8 of the loading volume of salt methanol regenerant nonetheless the high percentage of methanol in the regenerant should be further reduced via distillation to minimize the waste volume produced from the regeneration procedure and recover the organic solvent for future regeneration cycles it is worth noting that the structure of the pfecas also impacted regeneration efficiency as shown in fig 2b the regeneration of the pfecas increased p 0 05 as their carbon chain length increases i e more hydrophobic in the presence of the water methanol regenerant on the other hand the desorption of hfpo da and pfdohpa did not show a large difference indicating the steric hindrance effect of branched pfecas e g hfpo da only impact their interaction with solid phase medium e g aers 3 3 eco treatment of regeneration waste the total volume of the exhausted regenerant was reduced by a factor of 18 after distillation and table s2 summarizes the properties of the regenerants before and after the distillation process results of the post distillation solution still bottoms showed that negligible pfeca losses occurred during the distillation process and the methanol mass decreased by more than 4 orders of magnitude compared to the non distilled solution the properties of the reconstituted with di water still bottoms before and after the eco treatment are provided in table 3 an eco cell voltage of 22 23 v was applied throughout the experiment to produce a constant 40 ma cm2 current density the total energy consumed by the eco cell per 24 hours is 0 22 kwh both the toc and cod removal in the still bottom was more than 96 and a small increase in temperature from approximately 23 to 26 c occurred during the treatment the ph of the still bottoms decreased to as low as 3 due to the acid production commonly observed at bdd anodes carter and farrell 2008 the log scale degradation profile of the four pfecas in the concentrated still bottoms and their overall defluorination percentage over 24 hours of eco treatment are shown in fig 3 despite the high concentrations of hydroxyl radical scavenging species in the still bottom e g toc chloride sulfate baeza and knappe 2011 schaefer et al 2017 more than 5 log removal in concentration was achieved after 24 hours of eco treatment and 85 removal was achieved after 2 hours in addition the eco cells achieved 90 defluorination sum for all four pfecas combined based on aqueous fluoride generation after 24 hours signifying the high pfeca mineralization efficiency of the designed system because the final ph of the treated solution ph 2 9 is close to the acid dissociation constant pk a of hydrofluoric acid hf pk a 3 2 it is plausible that the defluorination percentage exceeded 90 after eco treatment if a portion of the released fluorine was lost in the form of hf gases fang et al 2019 to minimize the adverse effect of the generated hf on the treatment system i e corrosion either controlling the eco system s effluent ph or installing a vacuum hood coupled with an alkaline trapping electrolyte e g 0 1m naoh is recommended removal of all four investigated pfecas were well described by a pseudo first order rate law r2 0 99 as indicated by the regression results shown in fig 3 resulting kinetic profiles and rate constants are provided in si fig s4 and table s3 furthermore current normalized pseudo first order rate constants were calculated for the four pfecas using equation 2 to assess their structure reactivity relationships k n k v s d where kn is the current normalized pseudo first order rate constant l h 1a 1 k is the first order rate constant h 1 table s3 v is the volume of the treated solution l s is the specific surface area of the anode m2 and d is the applied current density ma m2 as shown in table 4 a slight increase in the kn values was observed for pfecas with increasing alkyl chain length and the number of ether groups it is worth noting that while the increase of the kn values is small between different pfecas the increasing trend based on their structural features e g chain length and ether group was found statistically significant p 0 05 moreover a similar reactivity trend was also observed in pfca studies where shorter chain pfcas showed a lower kn than their longer chain analogues e g pfhpa pfoa comparison table 4 past studies have indicated that the higher kn values of long chain pfcas during eco treatment can be attributed to their increased adsorption on the hydrophobic bdd surface zhuo et al 2012 and the smaller energy gap between their lowest and highest unoccupied molecular orbitals i e more prone to donate electrons cheng et al 2018 wang et al 2020 because the oxidative degradation of both pfcas and pfecas is initiated by direct electron transfer niu et al 2013 pica et al 2019 it is likely that the surface adsorption and electron susceptibility trend observed for long chain pfcas during eco treatment also applies to pfecas however such a trend needs to be further verified via computational modeling such as density functional theory dft calculation in future efforts a comparison of kn values for hfpo da among different studies also indicated that the chloride concentration in the treated solution negatively impacts the efficiency of the eco system for example the kn of hfpo da decreased by more than 80 when the cl concentration in the treated matrix increased from 0 to 495 ppm table 4 because previous studies confirmed that hydroxyl radicals play an important role in the cleaving of c f bonds in eco systems and identified chloride as a hydroxyl radical scavenging agent schaefer et al 2017 wang et al 2020 results from this work suggests that the presence of hydroxyl radicals are also crucial for the defluorination of pfecas olvera vargas et al 2022 suresh babu et al 2022 findings from this work were also compared with the data from a recent pfaa eco study where aer still bottom was used as the influent and magnÃ©li phase titanium suboxide was used as the anode table 4 the extremely low kn values of pfaas and defluorination ratio from the previous work suggest that both chloride ion and toc can inhibit the performance of the eco treatment system regardless of the selected electrode wang et al 2021 another observation when comparing the kn values among different eco studies is that all four pfecas showed a higher rate constant than pfoa even when pfoa was in a matrix with no or low chloride and toc concentrations schaefer et al 2018 one possible explanation for the observed higher rate constants is the addition of ether groups in pfecas compared to pfcas because the ether carbon i e c o c in hfpo da s backbone has substantially lower dissociation energy than the c c bond in pfoa pica et al 2019 it is plausible that this structural modification leads to a faster degradation rate for pfecas compared to pfcas this concept is supported by the different oxidative electron transfer pathways proposed for hfpo da and pfoa where hfpo da starts with decarboxylation or direct ether oxygen bond cleavage near the ether oxygen but pfoa starts with c c bond cleavage at the carboxylate headgroup niu et al 2013 olvera vargas et al 2022 yang et al 2022 one challenge for implementing eco treatment systems is perchlorate production because most influent sources contain appreciable levels of chloride especially for concentrated waste streams while a mitigation strategy was utilized in this study by regenerating the spent aer columns with sulfate based salts to minimize the presence of chloride ions in the still bottom approximately 2 mm of chloride were present in the still bottoms the chloride ion detected in the still bottoms is likely from the regeneration process where the adsorbed chlorine from the groundwater influent is washed off and concentrated in the spent regenerant it follows that the final chloride concentration in the still bottoms represents 1 6 of the total chloride mass flushed through the aer columns tables 2 3 following eco treatment for 24 hours the perchlorate concentration was 2 mm indicating that chloride in the still bottoms was completely oxidized to perchlorate table 3 to address the perchlorate produced during eco system operations past sand column studies have demonstrated that up to 3 log removal of perchlorate ions can be achieved via biological treatment within 10 days schaefer et al 2017 given the excellent pfeca treatment potential of the eco system e g 5 log removal of the parent pfecas and 85 defluorination in one day it is worth evaluating the economic impact of adding follow up polishing steps for perchlorate treatment and future investigations are needed to integrate these systems into an optimized treatment train 3 4 proposed electrochemical degradation pathways results from suspect screening analysis using lc qtof ms confirmed trifluoroacetic acid tfa perfluoropropionic acid pfpra and perfluoro 2 methoxyacetic acid pfmoaa as transformation products tps of the pfecas during eco treatment details of the confirmation procedure are provided in the si section si 5 while tfa and pfpra are known tps for hfpo da from previous electrochemical oxidation studies olvera vargas et al 2022 suresh babu et al 2022 yang et al 2022 limited information is available on tps for other pfecas to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that identified pfmoaa as an electrochemical degradation intermediate transformation pathways of the investigated pfecas are proposed based on the tps determined in this study and previously proposed mechanisms as shown in figs 4 and 5 the transformation of all four pfecas is expected to be initiated by direct electron transfer det at the carboxylic group followed by kolbe decarboxylation to form an alcohol intermediate intermediate a c e and g such step is generally accepted as the starting point for the degradation of pfecas and pfcas during eco treatment pica et al 2019 radjenovic et al 2020 suresh babu et al 2022 because the intermediates of hfpo da and pfdohpa after det and kolbe decarboxylation intermediate a and g share a similar structural configuration for their alcohol group and ether bridges two potential degradation pathways that focused on the reaction of these two moieties are proposed pathway 1 and 2 in fig 4 in pathway 1 no breakage of ether bridges is proposed because it is not kinetically favorable based on the density functional theory dft calculation results of a previous study pica et al 2019 instead intermediate a and g is proposed to lose a cf3 after being attacked by oh and form an acyl fluoride intermediate pica et al 2019 the acyl fluoride intermediates then undergo reaction with oh instead of hydrolysis because of favorable kinetics given by dft calculation followed by releasing of fcooh and cf2o in sequence until complete mineralization to hf and co2 however the confirmation of pfpra in this work suggested otherwise because cf3cf2cf2 is the prerequisite for forming pfpra during eco treatment which can only be generated via the ether bond cleavage in hfpo da therefore an alternative pathway is proposed pathway 2 in this work with the weaker ether bridge of intermediate a and g being attacked by hydroxyl radical oh similar to the degradation of polyfluoroalkyl ether acids with a o cfh moiety during total oxidizable precursor top assay zhang et al 2019 then the produced intermediates are proposed to go through a sequential unzipping process as is the case for legacy pfas during eco treatment le et al 2019 niu et al 2013 radjenovic et al 2020 leading to the generation of pfpra and tea before complete mineralization as for the degradation of pfmopra and pfmoba these compounds are expected to follow the same degradation pathway because their similarity in structure after the det and kolbe decarboxylation the alcohol intermediates of pfmopra and pfmoba intermediate c and e are proposed to be attacked by oh and form acyl fluoride intermediates by releasing f two potential transformation pathways are proposed for acyl fluoride intermediate d and f pathway 3 and 4 in fig 5 in pathway 3 the acyl fluoride intermediates are proposed undergo hydrolysis and produce pfmoaa as an intermediate the proposed pathway also indicates that pfmopra can be a possible intermediate during the hydrolysis of pfmoba s acyl fluoride intermediate f fig 5a while further confirmation via single solute experiments is needed to validate the production of pfmopra during pfmoba degradation the proposed reaction mechanism suggests this phenomenon can be a cause of the slower degradation kinetic of pfmopra compared to the other three pfecas table 4 following the hydrolysis of the acyl fluoride intermediates the generated pfmoaa is proposed to go through a new cycle of det and kolbe decarboxylation leading to complete mineralization the second pathway pathway 4 in proposed for the acyl fluoride intermediates of pfmopra and pfmoba is similar to pathway 1 where the intermediates undergo reaction with oh followed by fcooh release and eventual production of hf and co2 based on the proposed degradation pathways for the four pfecas it is evident that the rate limiting step of pfecas after det and kolbe decarboxylation differs from those for pfcas nonetheless because the exact mechanisms for electrooxidation of pfecas and pfcas are still under debate in the scientific community further investigations such as single solute eco experiments and computational modeling are still needed to verify the proposed degradation pathways confirm the rate limiting step i e kinetics or mass transfer for the degradation of different pfecas and their intermediates identify additional tps for individual pfecas and quantify the contribution of different pathways to tp generation to investigate the impact of tps and potentially volatilized hf on the fluorine mass balance the distribution of fluorine in the eco system was calculated based on the initial mass of fluorine added in the form of pfecas the mass of fluoride measured in the aqueous phase and the mass of fluorine remaining in quantified pfecas the mass of fluorine contained in tps both identified and unidentified as well as in hf that may have volatilized was calculated as the difference between initially added fluorine and fluorine fluoride quantified in the aqueous phase as shown in fig 6 while only 10 of the initially added fluorine remained in the parent pfecas after 2 hours of eco treatment 30 was in the form of tps and or volatilized hf in other words parent compound degradation occurs at a faster rate than mineralization therefore total organic fluorine measurements and headspace analyses are necessary to evaluate the treatment efficiency of pfeca destructive technologies more completely in addition the gradual release of f to the aqueous phase over time agrees with degradation pathways described here for pfecas and in previous studies for pfcas where c f bond cleavage led to the formation of multiple organofluorine reaction intermediates lastly the missing 10 of the initially added fluorine not recovered in the form of aqueous fluoride after 24 hrs of eco treatment suggests that some produced fluorine may have adsorbed to the eco cells ochiai et al 2011 volatilized to the atmosphere and or remained in organic reaction products that volatilized and or remained in the aqueous phase but could not be detected by our lc qtof ms method 3 5 energy cost of the treatment train the total energy consumed during the adsorption regeneration and eco treatment of pfecas by peristaltic pumps is estimated to be 0 025 kwh and the energy consumed during the distillation process by the heating element and stir plate is estimated to be 7 kwh or 1 75 kwh order of methanol concentration decrease while the energy cost for the distillation process seemed high it should be noted that the energy calculation for the above processes is based on each instrument s maximum power output their actual energy cost during operation is expected to be lower because they were operated at a lower setting furthermore because this work aims to evaluate the feasibility of treating on site generated still bottom using eco technology the energy efficiency of the pumping and distillation process was not optimized future work is still needed to develop an enhanced distillation process that not only improves the energy efficiency of the heating element but also recovers the distilled solvent for future use as for the energy consumption of the eco treatment process the ee o was calculated using equation 1 as shown in table 5 the ee o for the four pfecas is ranged between 263 to 275 kwh m3 when calculated based on the volume of the still bottom while these energy demands are high compared to previous eco or other destruction technologies e g 5 100 kwh m3 nau hix et al 2021 schaefer et al 2017 schaefer et al 2018 two considerations are worth mentioning first the electrochemically treated still bottom in this work is 0 5 of the volume that is treated through the aer columns thus the energy demand per volume of total groundwater treated would be 200 times less than the calculated values second because the four pfecas concentration at the end of the eco treatment was below their analytical detection limit table 3 5 ng l their log removal term in equation 1 was estimated using 5 ng l as cf however the actual concentration of each pfeca after 24 hour eco treatment is expected to be much lower than 5 ng l as illustrated in the pseudo first order fit model fig 3 and it would result in an even lower ee o value for each pfeca when applied to equation 1 after adjusting the abovementioned parameters with the total groundwater volume and predicted pfeca concentration using the pseudo first order fit model a modified ee o value for each pfeca is estimated to be between 0 83 1 03 kwh m3 table 5 in summary compared with the energy consumption of using eco as a stand alone process for treating pfeca in groundwater the treatment train proposed in this work significantly reduced the energy requirement for defluorinating pfecas 4 conclusion this research examined the feasibility of combining aer and electrochemical oxidation technologies as an integrated separation concentration destruction treatment train for the removal of pfecas in contaminated water results from the separation process highlight that the affinity of pfecas for aers is chain length dependent in a manner similar to traditionally studied pfcas furthermore by comparing the adsorption rate of pfecas with different ether group numbers pfdohpa vs pfmoba the extra ether oxygen atom was found to increase the hydrophobicity of the parent compound rather than decrease likely because neighboring fluorine atoms shielded the ether oxygen and prevented it from forming h bonds with water results from the concentration regeneration process showed that a high percentage e g 80 of organic cosolvent is necessary for achieving high regeneration efficiency and aer morphology pfeca structure and dom loading impact regeneration efficiency while utilizing high cosolvent content regenerants is not desirable at treatment facilities due to their hazardous nature it should be noted that aer regeneration is not operated continuously and the frequency of resin regeneration is highly site specific in addition results of the distillation process in this work showed that with proper optimization and management the solvent content of the spent regenerants can be significantly reduced to produce a low volume aqueous waste with high concentrations of pfecas salts and residual organic content that is ideal for downstream destruction technologies the treatment of the still bottoms destruction process in this research indicated that the electrochemical oxidative process using bdd anodes is extremely effective for degrading and defluorinating the investigated pfecas furthermore the measured current normalized pseudo first order rate constants showed that pfecas generally exhibit a higher first order rate than pfcas under similar environmental conditions on the other hand the smaller first order rate constants observed for the short chain pfecas suggest additional monitoring is needed during treatment non target analysis of the treated still bottoms confirmed pfmoaa for the first time as a tp for pfecas during eco treatment and reaction pathways were proposed for the studied pfecas throughout the studied separation concentration destruction treatment process dom in groundwater showed strong inhibition to the uptake release and destruction of the investigated pfecas such outcomes suggest that a dom pretreatment process should be considered for future full scale treatment train designs while results from this work shed light on the potential degradation mechanisms of the four pfecas and advanced the knowledge of combining aer and eo treatment technologies as one integrated system for the treatment of pfecas future work is still needed to evaluate the longevity of the regenerated aer column and elucidate additional tps to confirm the proposed degradation pathways given that the data show high regeneration efficiency can be achieved for the aer columns with only limited regenerant volume it is anticipated that a repeated adsorption desorption process can be performed using the designed system nonetheless a more rigorous analysis using different water matrices is needed for verification additional assessments such as single solute studies are also needed to verify the degradation intermediates of the pfecas and confirm factors that control their degradation rate moreover additional optimizations such as solvent recovery and tandem biological treatment need to be evaluated to better integrate the distillation and perchlorate treatment processes into the proposed treatment train to treat pfeca impacted water sources safely and more effectively lastly a detailed comparison should be made to other similar treatment technologies to systematically evaluate the performance of the proposed treatment system based on not only its pfas treatment efficiency but also its energy consumption full scale applicability technology maturity and ease of waste management associated content appendix supplementary material includes the description of analytical

15136,the presence of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass in water environments has been linked to a slew of negative health effects in both animals and humans but the green and eco sustainable removal technologies remain largely unknown constructed wetland coupled microbial fuel cell cw mfc is termed a green process to control pollutants and recover energy however so far no study has investigated the removal of pfass and their effects on the performance of the cw mfc systems here we investigated the removal performance of pfoa and pfos in the cw mfc systems both in the absence and presence of electricity circuit and explored the distribution and fate of pfass and their interactions with other elements in the systems our findings demonstrated excellent removal efficiency of 96 pfoa and pfos in cw mfc systems pfoa and pfos were distributed throughout the system via wastewater flow while electrode material and plants are the main enrichment sites in which mfc enhanced up to 10 pfass removal however a loss of 7 2 13 5 of nitrogen removal and a decrease of 7 3 in bioelectricity output were observed when pfass were introduced in the system the driven force led to the loss of nitrogen removal and bioelectricity generation lies in the accumulation of pfass in system composition which affected microbial activity and community composition damaging the health of the plant and in turn reducing cw mfc s functioning no doubt cw mfc systems provide an alternative technique for pfass removal alleviating some limitations to the physical and chemical techniques but further investigation is highly needed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords per and polyfluoroalkyl substances cw mfc wetland plant microbial community potential risks data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass are a group of synthetic compounds comprising more than 9 000 chemicals cordner et al 2021 they have been developed for more than seven decades with the different types of fluoropolymers over 230 000 tonnes year worldwide for the moment zhang et al 2022 pfass are intentionally and accidentally released into the environment since they are widely made and utilized in industrial and consumer products such as packaging materials waterproof materials electronics polishes and aqueous film forming foams afffs evich et al 2022 thus pfass have been detected in different environments water soil and aerosols and have been associated with a slew of negative health effects in both animals and humans evich et al 2022 wastewater is regarded as a significant sink for pfass and other persistent organic pollutants pops arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 many researchers have conducted a series of studies on the content level distribution characteristics influencing factors and environmental behavior of pfass in wastewater in recent years kurwadkar et al 2022 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are designed to control and treat contaminants in wastewater but it is difficult to efficiently remove pfass as they are extremely resistant to biodegradation and chemical degradation arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 in addition wwtps are an important point source of pfass by degrading their precursors zhang et al 2022 several technologies to remove pfass from the aqueous environment have been proposed and discussed ji et al 2020 it seems that a single remediation approach for pfass removal may not be suitable for large scale applications due to the rigorous operating conditions and high energy consumption required this suggests that the gray technology of wastewater treatment seems to be difficult to achieve the pfass removal as such the green technology may be worth a try i e applying nature based solutions to tackle this issue may be an option wanninayake 2021 constructed wetlands cws are shown to be able to remove many pops such as antibiotics pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps and pesticides gorito et al 2017 hitherto several studies have investigated wetlands include natural and constructed wetland removal of pfass from aqueous environments for instance surface flow cw with submerged macrophytes has been investigated while the results showed that 33 59 88 99 of pfass could be removed through sediment adsorption and phytoextraction as well as bioaccumulation of microbiota li et al 2021c similarly qiao et al 2021 employed vertical flow cw vfcw to treat simulated domestic wastewater containing pfos and achieved over 93 removal efficiency based on soil as wetland substrate adsorption and plant uptake the removal efficiency of field cws for the removal of pfass contaminated river water on the other hand varied greatly ranging from 14 to 42 wang et al 2019b the discrepancies in removal efficiency might be attributed to changes in cw s design as well as pfass concentrations and characteristics however most cws are designed to treat degradable pollutants rather than the so called forever chemicals as an intensified cw technique the cw coupling with microbial fuel cell cw mfc system has been developed and increasingly studied in recent years ji et al 2021 cw system works on the principles of plant uptake bioaccumulation and substrate adsorption to remove pfass considering granular activated carbon gac adsorption is the most frequently employed technology for pfass removal pauletto and bandosz 2022 it is reasonable to believe that employing gac as electrode material in cw mfc system can enhance pfass immobilization however so far there is no report on the removal of pfass in cw mfc system moreover the effect of pfass on other contaminants removal performance and the environmental risk cannot be overlooked due to the persistent and bioaccumulative toxicity of pfass evich et al 2022 to the best of our knowledge very limited information exists on the fate and risk of pfass removal from the cw mfc system to bridge the knowledge gap this study was designed based on our series of cw mfc studies ji et al 2022a 2022b for the aims to 1 investigate the removal performance of pfass in the cw mfc systems both in the absence and presence of electricity circuit and to ascertain the role of electro biochemical effects 2 explore the distribution and fate of pfass 3 elucidate the adverse effect on the conventional contaminants removal and bioelectricity generation under pfass exposure and 4 further reveal the risk to microbial and wetland plants under long term pfass pressure this study for the first time investigated the pfass removal in the cw mfc system the findings can help pfass remediation and simultaneously provide a comprehensive understanding of the risk assessment and management of pfass contaminated wetland ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all pfass standards pfoa and pfos and isotope labeled internal standards mpfoa and mpfos 98 were purchased from wellington laboratories inc ontario canada table s1 presents the physicochemical characteristics of the selected pfass hplc grade methanol acetonitrile ammonium hydroxide ammonium acetate and milli q water were used throughout this study gac were obtained from henan province china and the gravel and crushed stone were obtained from guangdong province china 2 2 cw mfcs set up and operation the experiment was conducted in a glasshouse under natural light conditions and shelter from rainwater at the campus of jinan university guangzhou china three microcosm scale cw mfcs termed as cw mfccontrol cw mfcclose and cw mfcopen were constructed using pvc columns with a diameter of 20 cm and a height of 65 cm as illustrated in fig s1 details of the construction of cw mfcs are supplemented in text s1 gravel was employed as the main wetland substrate while gac 2 5 mm in diameter 468 m2 g of bet surface area has been employed as electrode cyperus altrnlifolius ca was planted on the cathode layer with a plant density of 6 rhizomes per system the design and operation parameters of this trial were illustrated in table s1 cw mfccontrol and cw mfcclose systems were operated in a closed circuit mode while cw mfcopen system was run in an open circuit mode to evaluate the effects of pfass exposure on the cw mfc system each of 10 Î¼g l pfoa and pfos has been added to the influent of cw mfcclose and cw mfcopen systems the concentration of pfass in the current experiment was a little bit higher than the typical detected concentration in wwtps but it is still in the same order of magnitude Î¼g l cw mfccontrol was no pfass addition to unravel the effect of pfass on cw mfc performance the experiment was conducted continuously for 5 months from october 2021 to february 2022 during which the air temperature and relative humidity were about 18 7 4 and 55 24 respectively the wastewater was continuously fed from the bottom to the top of the cw mfcs using a peristaltic pump bt100 1 l while the hydraulic retention time hrt was 72 h the properties of the synthetic domestic wastewater without pfass were the same as described in our previous experiments ji et al 2022b 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 conventional contaminants and bioelectricity monitoring the wastewater samples were periodically collected from the inlet and outlet of each system and their physical and chemical parameters were then determined by multiparameter water quality meter ysi proplus the concentrations of cod tp tn nh4 n and no3 n were measured according to the standard water quality index apha 2005 the methods of bioelectricity monitoring and calculation can be found in our previous study ji et al 2022b 2 3 2 monitoring and analysis of pfoa and pfos the extraction of pfoa and pfos from wastewater electrode material and plant samples were conducted according to a previously reported method with a slight modification where a detailed description of the procedure is presented in text s2 analysis of pfass concentrations were determined using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry uhplc ms ms triple quad 5500 ab sciex with the detailed information of the instrumental analysis in text s3 and text s4 the functional groups on the gac adsorption of pfass were investigated in the frequency range of 400 4000 cm 1 using fourier transform infrared ftir

monitoring the plant chlorophyll contents fluorescence parameters antioxidant enzyme activity superoxide dismutase sod peroxidase pod and catalase cat activity and the content of malondialdehyde mda as well as the hydrogen peroxide h2o2 of the ca were all monitored on a regular basis in each system details of the processes can be found in text s5 2 3 4 microbial enzyme activities the activities of microbial enzymes such as dehydrogenase dha ammonia monooxygenase amo nitrate reductase nr and acid phosphatase ap were evaluated in electrode and substrate materials the detailed processes were given in text s6 2 3 5 dna extraction and high throughput sequencing to analyze the microbial community before and after pfass exposure microbial samples were collected at the cathode and anode of each system the electrode material of anode and cathode before and after pfass exposure in different cw mfc systems was separately mixed and collected in triplicate and then stored at 20 before dna extraction the dna of the corresponding sample was extracted by dna extraction kits hipure soil dna mini kit magen china following extraction dna samples were evaluated by a nd 2000 spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies wilmington usa dna samples that meet the quality requirements were used for dna amplification pcr amplification of the v3 v4 region of bacterial 16s rrna gene was performed using the primer pair 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 a high throughput sequencing procedure was carried out on an illumina hiseq platform by biomarker technologies company beijing china 2 4 quality assurance and quality control procedures for quality assurance and quality control qa qc were carried out during the sampling extraction and analysis stages according to u s epa method 537 1 the possibility of pfoa and pfos adsorption on the polypropylene surface of the influent tank was considered and pre tested prior to the experiment the concentration difference between the two samples before and after adsorption was less than 5 indicating that adsorption of polypropylene barrels was not significant in this study the internal standard method with a calibration curve consisting of eight levels 0 1 5 10 25 50 100 and 200 Î¼g l has been established to calculate unknown sample concentrations the correlation coefficients of pfoa and pfos were greater than 0 99 a standard sample was run every 9 samples to check for carryover background contamination precision and accuracy in table s3 the signal to noise s n ratios of 3 and 10 were used to determine the limits of detection lod and limits of quantification loq the method detection limits mdls were derived from the mean concentration and standard deviation of the procedure blanks table s3 the pfoa and pfos recoveries fell in 80 120 2 5 statistical analysis all sample analysis was conducted in triplicates basis and the results were reported as the mean value standard deviation a one way anova test or t tests were used to identify differences between the different treatments a threshold p value of 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant bioinformatics and statistical analysis were used according to man et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfass removal and their fate in the cw mfc system 3 1 1 removal from wastewater fig 1 shows the influent and effluent concentrations of pfoa and pfos in the cw mfcs while the dynamics of pfass concentrations over the experiment period is presented in fig s2 there are differences in the design and measurement of pfoa and pfos concentrations in synthetic wastewater the actual average concentration of pfoa and pfos in influent was 6 46 0 52 Î¼g l and 9 34 0 87 Î¼g l respectively the pfoa removal rates of 97 84 100 and 96 74 100 were achieved in the cw mfcclose and the cw mfcopen respectively pfos levels in the effluent of cw mfcclose and cw mfcopen were 0 04 0 02 Î¼g l and 0 15 0 04 Î¼g l respectively these results suggest that cw mfc system can effectively removal pfoa and pfos no matter whether it is operated in open or closed circuit this also supports our hypothesis that cw mfc system could be capable of efficiently removing pfass ji et al 2020 however by inspecting the data it is shown that the cw mfcclose system is better than the cw mfcopen system reflecting the role of mfc being beneficial in removing pfass the concentrations of pfoa and pfos in different compositions of cw mfcs were presented in table 1 as shown in table 1 the highest concentration of pfass was enriched in the anode of the cw mfcclose system and the anode was considered to be the active site for cw mfcs to remove pops in other studies wang et al 2020 moreover the electrode layers both the anode and cathode removed 88 78 pfoa and 85 31 pfos based on the mass balance in the closed circuit cw mfc system while in the open circuit system only 83 61 pfoa and 75 69 pfos were removed these results imply that the closed circuit improves pfass retention by around 10 it is hypothesized that electric fields may improve gac adsorption of pfass niarchos et al 2022 and that mfc stimulates electroactive bacteria eab secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps and has adsorption capability for pfass yan et al 2021b 3 1 2 fate of pfass in cw mfc the concentrations of pfass in the influent anode effluent and final effluent are shown in fig 2 these results indicate that the electrode layers remove most of the pfass in the case of gac adsorption of pfass in anode layer the ftir spectra of the gac in the anode before and after pfass addition are shown in fig 2 c the visible peaks at 876 1377 and 1540 cm 1 correspond to the adsorption vibration peaks of the pfass characteristic functional groups which correspond to the cf2 and cf3 groups hui et al 2015 yang et al 2016 the bond with a peak range of 642 697 cm 1 was linked to c f wiggling vibrations huang et al 2018 the adsorption vibration peaks in 1054 cm 1 indicated that the existence of a sulfonic group on the gac by adsorption pfos chen et al 2017 huang et al 2018 moreover the pfoa in the cathode and anode layers gac of the cw mfcclose system were 2 84 6 11 ng g and 393 20 480 42 ng g respectively while the corresponding pfos was 2 85 8 86 ng g and 417 37 438 54 ng g respectively as shown table 1 thus more pfass were accumulated on the anode gac layer while few pfass were adsorbed on the cathode layer a review of the adsorption performance of commercial gac for pfass found that it has an adsorption capacity in the range of 0 165 760 mg g pauletto and bandosz 2022 although the gac maximum adsorption capacity for pfoa and pfos was not directly determined in this experiment the correlation between bet surface area and adsorption capacity of gac based on previous studies was established fig s3 the maximum adsorption capacity values for pfoa and pfos are predicted to be 248 mg g and 147 mg g respectively based on the bet surface area of gac in the experiment of 468 m2 g in addition the mass of gac filled in the anode and cathode layers in each system of this study was 1 78 and 0 90 kg respectively therefore gac in the systems has sufficient adsorption capacity of pfass and residual pfass from the anode can be adsorbed in the cathodic layer before efflux plants also have important contributions to the pfass removal in the cw mfcs the concentration of pfoa and pfos in the stems and leaves of ca in each system are measured at the end of experiment table 1 the bioaccumulation of the open circuit system under pfass exposure is higher than that of the close circuit system in terms of the concentration of pfass in ca this finding implies that mfc inside the cw system might lessen pfass migration transport and accumulation in wetland plants which might help reduce the likelihood of pfass being passed via the food chain one of the possible reasons is that more pfass are adsorbed and fixed in the anode layer in the cw mfcclose system and the concentration of pfass around the rhizosphere for plant uptake was declined by further examining the pfass in different tissues of ca the contents of pfoa and pfos in the leaves were larger than that in the stems one study of the distributions of pfos in ca was shown that the aerial parts have higher concentration than that of root parts under 1 Î¼g l pfos exposure qiao et al 2021 generally the intervention of mfc in the cw system causes more pfass to be retained in the anode gac layer thus reducing the amount of pfass taken up by plants lowering the toxicity of pfass to plants this not only improves the system s capability to remove pfass but also alleviates the pfas induced restriction of wetland plants 3 2 effects of pfass on cw mfc performance 3 2 1 wastewater treatment performance the accumulation of high concentrations of persistent pfass in system may have potentially harmful effects on the system s ability to treat wastewater fig 3 displays the conventional contamination removal of each system with and without pfass exposure as shown in fig 3 a under the mean influent cod concentration of 402 54 mg l the average cod removal efficiency for the control system was more than 90 over the entire operation period the cod value increased slightly to 423 50 mg l as a result of the addition of pfass to the inlet wastewater the cod removal efficiency of the cw mfcclose system without and with pfass exposure was 92 47 2 99 and 93 91 2 09 respectively similarly in the cw mfcopen system the cod removal rate was 85 84 2 82 without and 86 10 1 80 with pfass exposure it indicates that the existence of pfass in wastewater had no significant effect on cod removal p 0 05 in cw mfcs this result is quite different from conventional wastewater treatment systems reported yu et al 2018 demonstrated that the continuous addition of pfoa with high concentration 20 mg l on activated sludge process was restrained cod removal however in another experiment the low concentration 1 Î¼g l of pfos showed no significant impact on cod removal in vfcw system qiao et al 2021 tp removal of each system was plotted in fig 3 b it can be clearly observed that with or without pfass the tp removal rate increases with the operation period this is because the removal of tp in the cw mfc system mainly depends on the immobilization of the substrate and the uptake by plants as such low dose pfass exposure may not significantly interfere to the performance of cod and tp removal pfass in wastewater result in a significant decrease in nitrogen removal in the cw mfcs as shown in fig 3 c d in the control system the average removal efficiency of nh4 n was 90 24 2 05 in contrast the average removal rate of nh4 n of the close and open cw mfc systems was 87 09 and 63 41 respectively decreased by 7 22 p 0 05 and 13 51 p 0 05 compared with the absence pfass period the worse removal of nh4 n led to the deterioration of the tn removal which decreased by 2 45 p 0 05 and 13 98 p 0 05 in the close and open cw mfc systems respectively the effluent nitrate concentration in the open circuit system was significantly elevated during continuous exposure of pfoa and pfos fig s4 this suggests that pfoa and pfos co exposure can inhibit both nitrification and denitrification in the cw mfcs it has been showed that the high content of pfass were detected both in anode and cathode layer table 1 which are believed as the hot zones for nitrogen removal wang et al 2020 the significant differences between the results of with and without pfass exposure might be explained by the inhibitory effects of pfass on the activity of nitrogen removal microorganisms and microbial community jiang et al 2021 compared to close circuit system the cw mfcopen system had markedly decreased nitrogen removal during pfass exposure it should be noted that the close circuit cw mfc system was favorable for the enrichment of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria to enhance the nitrogen removal wang et al 2019a 2020 additionally the anode dependent ammonium oxidation may also contribute to the nitrogen removal in cw mfc system yan et al 2021a thus while the pfass could decrease the nitrogen removal the presence of mfcs provides a bioelectrochemical removal route for nitrogen and alleviates pfass inhibition 3 2 2 bioelectricity generation in order to explore the effects of pfass on bioelectricity generation of the cw mfc system the voltage output signal of the cw mfcs was recorded fig 4 without pfass exposure the average voltage values of the cw mfcclose system and the control system without pfass existence were 599 23 16 31 mv and 581 22 10 79 mv respectively implying no significant difference p 0 05 however it can be shown that the pfass was detrimental to maintaining bioelectricity generation in the cw mfc system the average output voltage of the cw mfcclose system decreased by 7 32 555 33 26 69 mv under the stress of pfass as shown in fig 4 the voltage output of the cw mfcclose system demonstrated a pattern of rapidly falling at the start then increasing and eventually becoming stable this indicates the inhibition of the bioelectricity generation in the initial pfass exposure stage while the inhibition seems to be gradually alleviated a previous study to use the cw mfc system for antibiotics tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole removal has discovered that relatively high influent antibiotic concentrations 400 1600 Î¼g l could still result in high regulated voltage output zhang et al 2017 the reason for this could be the biodegradation of the antibiotics after the microorganism s adoption however it may not be the case for pfoa and pfos which are thought to be difficult to degrade by microorganisms indeed the toxicity of pfass may impair electrogenic microbial activity in the system resulting in a lower voltage output the electrodes potentials without and with pfass exposure were monitored fig 4b the results show that with the accumulation of pfass in electrodes the average anodic potential rises from 149 24 89 16 mv to 104 82 36 21 mv while the cathodic potential falls from 468 47 102 33 mv to 408 53 106 81 mv deterioration of cathode performance might be induced by the changes in the cathode microenvironment table s4 unfavorable oxidizing conditions directly limits the oxygen reduction reaction in cathode and lower voltage output ji et al 2022a these results could be linked with the pfass accumulation at the cathode and the effects on plants li et al 2021c xiao et al 2022 the power density current density and polarization curves of the cw mfcclose system in the period before and after pfass exposure were also measured fig 4c the maximum current density without pfass exposure was 118 11 ma m2 while it declined to 110 23 ma m2 during the pfass exposure a similar result was also obtained in maximum power density that was dropped from 23 19 mw m2 to 19 85 mw m2 with pfass exposure furthermore the estimated internal resistances derived from the polarization curves were around 240 Ï‰ in the absence of pfass and nearly 300 Ï‰ in the presence of pfass these outcomes propose that pfass impede the bioelectricity generation of the cw mfc system with harmfulness to electrogenic microorganisms being the potential main considerations to cause it 3 3 effect of pfass on plants plants have multiple functions and play an important role for contaminants removal and bioenergy generation in the cw mfcs ji et al 2022a the accumulation of pfass may affect the plants which in turn affect system performance it is fascinating to explore the changes in plants behavior in the cw mfc system when pfass were introduced to test this hypothesis the growth the photosynthetic systems and the antioxidative enzymes of the plants were investigated 3 3 1 photosynthetic system as shown in fig 5 a the relative chlorophyll content of the three cw mfc systems was similar around 60 before pfass exposure however the relative chlorophyll content decreased significantly during the initial 6 days of pfass exposure thereafter the value settled around 40 compared with the control system the value was reduced by nearly one third these results clearly indicate the negative effects of pfass on plant photosynthetic pigments du et al 2020 observed a significantly negative correlation between chlorophyll level and pfass concentration in cucumis sativus leaves confirming that the pfass could introduce stress to the plants and cause inhibitory of the photosynthetic system moreover changes in chlorophyll levels in some wetland plants may be consistent with pfass concentrations for instance lower pfos 0 1 mg l did not cause significant changes in chlorophyll concentration for both acorus calamus and phragmites communis while the chlorophyll levels were significantly decreased when exposed to pfos at 50 mg l qian et al 2019 similar results have confirmed this finding in other plants li et al 2021b lin et al 2020 however the addition of 1 Î¼g l and 0 1 mg l pfos significantly increased the contents of photosynthetic pigments in ca in the cw li et al 2020a the reason for this paradoxical phenomenon is not clear but might be attributed to the different experimental systems to further explore the effects of pfass on the plant s photosynthetic system the changes in fluorescence parameters in each system were recorded the value of fv fm corresponds to the maximum quantum yield of photosynthesis and is used to indicate stress in leaves as shown in fig 5 b the values of fv fm of pfass exposure systems were significantly lower than that of the control system p 0 05 the lowest average value of the close and the open system was 0 749 0 024 and 0 737 0 015 respectively this provides evidence that pfass could result in inactivation damage of psii in plant leaves bjÃ¶rkman and demmig 1987 in addition to accurately obtain photosystems efficiency in psii photochemistry the values of non photochemical quenching npq were measured fig 5c it was found that the mean maximum npq of plants in close and open cw mfc systems exposed to pfass was significantly increased compared to the control system this suggests that the level of photochemical quenching of psii and the maximum working efficiency of psii in plant leaves are significantly reduced implying the significant inhibition of the photosynthetic reaction center murchie and lawson 2013 furthermore the changes in chlorophyll levels are closely related to the imbalance between biosynthesis and degradation which is reflected in the redox state of leaves the parameter ql is considered to be a more accurate predictor of the psii redox states which is monitored and plotted in fig 5 d the ql values of the plants in exposure systems differed significantly from the control indicating that pfass disrupted the redox state in leaves which may be affected by reactive oxygen species ros in leaves it is worth noting that photosynthesis strength is strongly connected to phytoremediation effectiveness and inadequate photosynthesis will limit plants capacity to remove contaminants simmer and schnoor 2022 collectively pfass accumulates in leaves after uptake and migration through roots and stems the toxicity of pfass causes plant s leaf chlorophyll content to decline and photosynthesis inhibition furthermore the effects of pfass on plants varied among cw mfcs it is obvious that plants in closed circuit operation of a cw mfc system had a larger stress resistant capacity which may be connected to the concentration of pfass in plants table 1 3 3 2 antioxidant response under biotic and or abiotic stress ros levels rise in plant leave cells and could damage plant health wang et al 2010 the production of h2o2 in ca leaves under the pfass exposure is presented in fig s5 under pfass exposure the h2o2 level of close and open cw mfc systems was respectively 1 5 fold for 0 63 0 01 Î¼mol g and 2 fold for 0 84 0 08 Î¼mol g greater than that of the control system for 0 46 0 02 Î¼mol g at the end of the experiment these findings are consistent with earlier research findings of plants under pfass exposure qian et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 malondialdehyde mda content is an important parameter responsible to the antioxidant potential as it can reflect the rate and intensity of lipid peroxidation as well as the degree of damage to plants suffered from adversity it is an excellent indicator to assess plant cell damage caused by ros kong et al 2016 as shown in fig s5 b the contents of mda in pfass exposure systems were higher than those in the control system p 0 05 combining the above results it is possible to conclude that pfass caused a high accumulation of ros and cell damage in ca leaves it should be emphasized that the presence of raising ros significantly impairs leaf photosynthesis which is consistent with a reduction in photosynthetic efficiency the antioxidant defense systems in plants were activated to cope with the accumulated ros induced by pfass exposure thus the effects of pfass exposure on the antioxidant enzyme system superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat and peroxidase pod activity and the results were shown in fig s6 in fig s6 a pfass exposure could increase sod activity in the different cw mfc systems this result further demonstrated that ros is abundantly accumulated in leaves under pfass exposure and increased sod activity is advantageous in removing ros li et al 2021a the activity of sod was positively correlated with the concentration of pfass exposed li et al 2021b qiao et al 2021 obviously the sod activity in the cw mfcopen system was higher than that in cw mfcclose system for most of the time during the trial which is positively linked with the concentration of pfass in plants table 1 in plant systems the detoxification of h2o2 is carried out by cat and pod the activities of cat and pod are shown in fig s6 b c compared with the control system cat activity in the exposure systems was significantly decreased the reasons for the decrease may be considered to be the high accumulation of ros to suppress cat activity when cat does not completely neutralize ros pod dissociates hydrogen peroxide biczak 2016 pod activity in the cw mfcs with pfass exposure was significantly higher than that in the control system p 0 05 considering the results of sod cat and pod activity plants in the cw mfcopen system have more active oxidative stress activity which is beneficial to alleviate the toxicity to plants caused by pfass it is worth noting that antioxidant defense system can protect plant cells from the negative effects of ros under oxidative stress but may cause the loss of chlorophyll liu et al 2014 overall pfass in plants harmed the plants photosynthetic system while activating their antioxidant defense system photosynthesis is the source for plants to provide other functions the inhibition reduces root activity and in turn hinders pollutant uptake and oxygen secretion by the root system all these effects can be reflected in the reduction of pollutant removal efficiency and bioelectricity generation in the cw mfc system 3 4 effects of pfass on microbial activities and community 3 4 1 microbial enzyme activity in the cw mfc systems the organic matter nitrogen and phosphorus removal and bioenergy generation are all dependent on a series of biochemical processes which are directly related to key enzyme activity four key enzyme activities related to organic matter removal and biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal were investigated and presented in fig s7 briefly during pfass exposure dehydrogenase dha ammonia monooxygenase amo and nitrate reductase nr activities were considerably decreased while acp activity remained unaffected in fig s7 a the dha activity in anode microorganisms of close and open cw mfc systems was reduced by 14 88 1 52 23 79 9 36 respectively dha activity has a close correlation with the electron transfer and consumption processes of eab in cw mfc system ji et al 2022b this can partly explain the deterioration of anode potential in the cw mfcs fig 4 meanwhile dha activity in middle and cathode regions was changed somewhat but not dramatically which suggests that a large amount of pfass have been removed at the anode layer fig s7 b shows that there were no significant differences in the values of key enzyme activity associated with microbial tp removal in either of the pfass exposure systems compared to the control system the enzymatic activity of amo and nr which are related to nitrification and denitrification were decreased in the presence of pfass in fig s7 c the observed values of amo activity in anode layer was slightly changed while they were sharply decreased in the middle and cathode layers in the pfass exposure systems specifically the amo activity in the cw mfcclose system was decreased by nearly 20 in the middle layer and further reduced to 72 31 18 73 in the cathode layer compared with the control system similarly amo activity inhibition was observed in the cw mfcopen system with 78 99 14 03 and 61 35 19 67 compared to the control system in the middle and cathode layer respectively the results showed that the pfass inhibition degree of nitrification process in the open circuit is greater than that in the close circuit of cw mfc system which in turn led to the changes in the nh4 n removal fig 3 the enzymatic activity of nr at middle layer in the cw mfcopen system is only 71 40 16 39 of the control system while the activity in the cathode layer is similarly drastically decreased fig s7 d this suggests that the biological denitrification enzyme system may be poisoned to some extent in the presence of pfass in the cw mfc system both above results imply that denitrification may be the rate limiting step for nitrogen removal in the cw mfcopen under pfass exposure by contrast when cw mfc system was operated in a closed circuit the nr enzyme activity was likewise hindered but nitrate could be reduced at the cathode layer by electrons that transferred from the anode ji et al 2022a overall the existence of a changing trend difference in the microbial enzyme activity in each system is to some extent consistent with the cw mfc system s decontamination and bioenergy generation performance 3 4 2 effect of pfass stress on microbial community the microbial community change in a cw mfc system under pfass exposure has not been investigated so far table s5 presented the sequencing data of the samples from the anode and cathode layers of cw mfcs by illumina novaseq analysis high coverage values more than 99 2 accurately reflect the genuine nature of the microorganisms in each sample alpha diversity indices were evaluated in fig s8 the average chao1 and ace index in both anode and cathode for close and open cw mfc systems was increased but the shannon values of microbiological samples displayed different patterns in various cw mfc working modes during pfass exposure in particular the shannon value rises in closed mode and falls in open mode these findings demonstrate that in a closed circuit cw mfc system pfass exposure enhanced bacterial richness but decreased bacterial diversity whereas in an open circuit cw mfc system pfass exposure would increase both bacterial richness and diversity qiao et al 2021 found a similar result when they investigated the richness and diversity of microorganisms in the vfcw after adding pfos in the current study the cw mfcopen system can be regarded as an enhanced vfcw system with filling gac the decreased bacterial diversity and increased bacterial richness in the cw mfcclose system may lie in the increased richness of pfass resistant species and the decrease of some sensitive species the variation of the bacterial community structure before and after pfass exposure was compared by using principal coordinates analysis pcoa on bray curtis dissimilarities fig 6 as shown in fig 6 a pcoa axis 1 and 2 represent respectively 78 63 and 12 90 of the total bacterial community variations in the anode bacterial community of each system pcoa 1 and pcoa 2 refer to 70 18 and 15 87 of the variability in bacterial communities in the cathode layer respectively fig 6b these results suggest that bacterial communities with and without pfas exposure are well segregated furthermore pfass increased the similarity of microbial community structure in cw mfcclose and cw mfcopen s cathode and anode the microbial communities in the different operation modes of the cw mfc system may evolve towards a similar trend under pfass stress li et al 2021c variations in bacterial community composition were further investigated by analyzing bacterial community composition and structure at the phylum class and genus levels fig 6 at the phylum level a total of 43 identified phyla were observed as shown in fig 6 c the high percentage of abundant phyla of the anode samples include proteobacteria 27 99 52 88 firmicutes 6 62 35 78 bacteroidetes 6 46 22 52 actinobacteria 0 71 12 57 chloroflexi 0 18 12 49 and acidobacteria 1 43 5 72 under pfass exposure the phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes both in the close and open cw mfc system presented higher abundance but the phyla proteobacteria actinobacteria chloroflexi and acidobacteria showed distinct decreases in the anode and cathode samples in the cw mfcopen system proteobacteria and acidobacteria phyla have been widely detected in the cws and natural wetland ecosystems and they play critical roles in nitrogen cycle biodegradation or biotransformation mellado and vera 2021 this perhaps explains why the nitrogen removal was a significant drop in open circuit mode and a slight decrease in close circuit mode of cw mfc system during pfass exposure firmicutes and bacteroidetes comprise many genera that undergo organic degradation under anaerobic conditions and have been documented as relatively dominant phyla in the pfass contaminated environments lu et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 for the class level analyses the presence of pfass could increase the relative abundance of bacteroidia and clostridia in the cw mfc system while the abundance of alphaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria was slightly decreased fig 6e and f these sub proteobacteria have denitrifying capacity li et al 2020b lu et al 2014 denitrification inhibition was more severe in the cw mfcopen system due to a significant decrease in the abundance of denitrifying microorganisms when compared to the absence of pfass exposure combined with the results of shifts in anodic and cathodic microbial community structure it can be concluded that exposure to pfass lowered the nitrogen removal capability of the cw mfc system geobacter pseudomonas azoarcus syntrophus caldisericum and longilinea were the predominant bacteria at the genus level in the anode bacterial communities of close circuit mode cw mfc systems fig 7 in particular geobacter and pseudomonas have been reported to be the principal bacteria of eabs that generate electricity in the cw mfc system gupta et al 2021 wang et al 2019a the high abundance of eabs facilitates the continuous output at a higher voltage of the cw mfc system operation with closed circuit in addition the relative abundances of the genus in the closed circuit and open circuit of cw mfcs were quite different indicating that connecting the external circuit was advantageous in order to build a suitable habitat for eabs however clustering of abundances at the taxonomic level showed that anode microbial abundances of close and open operation of cw mfc exhibited similarities after pfass exposure lactobacillus fusobacterium frateuria vibrio thiobacillus helicobacter and bacteroides were the dominant bacterial genus in the anode samples after pfass exposure thus pfass presence clearly shifted the genus relative abundance of anode bacteria in the cw mfcs the lower abundance of geobacter and pseudomonas in the anode bacterial community in part explained the reduced bioelectricity generation in the cw mfcclose system under pfass exposure overall exposure of pfass obviously shifted the diversity and structure of the microbial community in the electrodes of the cw mfc system resulting in varying degrees of reduced nitrogen removal efficiency and bioelectricity generation 3 5 potential risks and engineering significance 3 5 1 potential risks for pfass in cw mfc in this study pfoa and pfos were efficiently removed by cw mfc systems with gac adsorption and plant uptake however the risks of pfass accumulation in the substrates and bioaccumulation in plants must not be overlooked most of cw systems seem a sophisticated passive pfass treatment technology with the continual transport of pfass from the aqueous phase to the substrates and plants the substrate s adsorption capacity is restricted by its own characteristics while plants absorption and accumulation also have biological limits this study first investigated the toxic effects of continuous pfoa and pfos exposure on substrate surface biofilms and plant photosynthetic systems in the cw mfc system several negative effects on system performance were observed cw and or cw mfc system runs for few years in practical application vymazal 2011 the potential desorption and release of pfass needs to be carefully considered when the substrate becomes saturated more importantly pfass in plants can be potentially transferred and magnified through the food chain the bioaccumulation of pfass in tropical estuarine food webs has been demonstrated miranda et al 2021 and estuarine wetlands are an important natural wetland component to the best of our knowledge there is little information on pfass migration transfer and bioaccumulation in the cw system therefore the risk of pfass removal by the cw mfc system requires further and more comprehensive investigation 3 5 2 engineering significance despite the fact that it has certain adverse effects on system performance the bioelectricity output by cw mfc is difficult to achieve efficient recovery and utilization at the current stage the introduction of mfc into the cw system can effectively remove pfass and reduce ecological risk while sacrificing only a small amount of bioelectricity performance and a slight decrease in nutrient removal demonstrating its broad application potential thus cw mfc system offers a practical and cost effective engineering approach to control pfass on the one hand the cost of capital or operation limits the field applications of most of the pfass separation and destruction techniques wanninayake 2021 the cost of constructing cw mfc system mainly lies in the substrate and electrode materials while several cheap commercialized materials with high adsorption capacity can be the sole and joint used substrates or electrode materials in cw mfc system in addition cw and intensified cw systems have been constructed and operated extensively around the world without a doubt the cost of effectively pfass removal by adding replacing a portion of the pfass adsorbent material is far cheaper than the cost of building a set of physicochemical treatment equipment on the other hand although biological approaches to the treatment of pfass are extremely limited and not currently considered feasible cw mfc system provides a potential bioremediation approach this is because the accumulation of pfass in the substrate with long retention time and bioelectrochemical stimulation offers a favored condition for incubation and domestication pfass degrading microorganisms moreover there has been some recent progress in exploring the bioremediation of pfoa by an anaerobic autotrophic bacterium acidimicrobium sp strain a6 ruiz uriguen et al 2022 they demonstrated a 77 reduction in concentration and identification of shorter chain perfluorinated compounds validating the biodegradation of pfoa in the experiment it seems that there is a condition and pathway for pfoa and other pfass biodegradation or biotransformation due to the abundant microbial population and suitable microenvironment in cw mfc system however further studies are highly desirable 4 conclusion considering the rising number of emerging contaminants in wastewater and other aqueous environment cw mfc system for pfass contaminated wastewater is an unavoidable circumstance to try this study in both closed circuit and open circuit operation of the cw mfc systems demonstrated over 96 removal of the influent containing pfoa and pfos through adsorption by electrode materials and uptake by plants plus the mfc enhancement however with the efficient removal of pfass several adverse effects on system performance have occurred including nitrogen removal and bioelectricity generation in addition by comprehensive investigation of the photosynthetic system and antioxidant defense system of the plants it was found that the pfass harmed the plants healthy and in turn hindered the plant s function in the system furthermore pfass not only directly changed the microbial community structure but also indirectly inhibited microbial enzyme activities collectively cw mfc systems open an alternative way for the removal of pfass from the aquatic environment which can alleviate some barriers to the full application of physical and chemical techniques but further investigation is highly desirable declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

15136,the presence of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass in water environments has been linked to a slew of negative health effects in both animals and humans but the green and eco sustainable removal technologies remain largely unknown constructed wetland coupled microbial fuel cell cw mfc is termed a green process to control pollutants and recover energy however so far no study has investigated the removal of pfass and their effects on the performance of the cw mfc systems here we investigated the removal performance of pfoa and pfos in the cw mfc systems both in the absence and presence of electricity circuit and explored the distribution and fate of pfass and their interactions with other elements in the systems our findings demonstrated excellent removal efficiency of 96 pfoa and pfos in cw mfc systems pfoa and pfos were distributed throughout the system via wastewater flow while electrode material and plants are the main enrichment sites in which mfc enhanced up to 10 pfass removal however a loss of 7 2 13 5 of nitrogen removal and a decrease of 7 3 in bioelectricity output were observed when pfass were introduced in the system the driven force led to the loss of nitrogen removal and bioelectricity generation lies in the accumulation of pfass in system composition which affected microbial activity and community composition damaging the health of the plant and in turn reducing cw mfc s functioning no doubt cw mfc systems provide an alternative technique for pfass removal alleviating some limitations to the physical and chemical techniques but further investigation is highly needed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords per and polyfluoroalkyl substances cw mfc wetland plant microbial community potential risks data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass are a group of synthetic compounds comprising more than 9 000 chemicals cordner et al 2021 they have been developed for more than seven decades with the different types of fluoropolymers over 230 000 tonnes year worldwide for the moment zhang et al 2022 pfass are intentionally and accidentally released into the environment since they are widely made and utilized in industrial and consumer products such as packaging materials waterproof materials electronics polishes and aqueous film forming foams afffs evich et al 2022 thus pfass have been detected in different environments water soil and aerosols and have been associated with a slew of negative health effects in both animals and humans evich et al 2022 wastewater is regarded as a significant sink for pfass and other persistent organic pollutants pops arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 many researchers have conducted a series of studies on the content level distribution characteristics influencing factors and environmental behavior of pfass in wastewater in recent years kurwadkar et al 2022 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are designed to control and treat contaminants in wastewater but it is difficult to efficiently remove pfass as they are extremely resistant to biodegradation and chemical degradation arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 in addition wwtps are an important point source of pfass by degrading their precursors zhang et al 2022 several technologies to remove pfass from the aqueous environment have been proposed and discussed ji et al 2020 it seems that a single remediation approach for pfass removal may not be suitable for large scale applications due to the rigorous operating conditions and high energy consumption required this suggests that the gray technology of wastewater treatment seems to be difficult to achieve the pfass removal as such the green technology may be worth a try i e applying nature based solutions to tackle this issue may be an option wanninayake 2021 constructed wetlands cws are shown to be able to remove many pops such as antibiotics pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps and pesticides gorito et al 2017 hitherto several studies have investigated wetlands include natural and constructed wetland removal of pfass from aqueous environments for instance surface flow cw with submerged macrophytes has been investigated while the results showed that 33 59 88 99 of pfass could be removed through sediment adsorption and phytoextraction as well as bioaccumulation of microbiota li et al 2021c similarly qiao et al 2021 employed vertical flow cw vfcw to treat simulated domestic wastewater containing pfos and achieved over 93 removal efficiency based on soil as wetland substrate adsorption and plant uptake the removal efficiency of field cws for the removal of pfass contaminated river water on the other hand varied greatly ranging from 14 to 42 wang et al 2019b the discrepancies in removal efficiency might be attributed to changes in cw s design as well as pfass concentrations and characteristics however most cws are designed to treat degradable pollutants rather than the so called forever chemicals as an intensified cw technique the cw coupling with microbial fuel cell cw mfc system has been developed and increasingly studied in recent years ji et al 2021 cw system works on the principles of plant uptake bioaccumulation and substrate adsorption to remove pfass considering granular activated carbon gac adsorption is the most frequently employed technology for pfass removal pauletto and bandosz 2022 it is reasonable to believe that employing gac as electrode material in cw mfc system can enhance pfass immobilization however so far there is no report on the removal of pfass in cw mfc system moreover the effect of pfass on other contaminants removal performance and the environmental risk cannot be overlooked due to the persistent and bioaccumulative toxicity of pfass evich et al 2022 to the best of our knowledge very limited information exists on the fate and risk of pfass removal from the cw mfc system to bridge the knowledge gap this study was designed based on our series of cw mfc studies ji et al 2022a 2022b for the aims to 1 investigate the removal performance of pfass in the cw mfc systems both in the absence and presence of electricity circuit and to ascertain the role of electro biochemical effects 2 explore the distribution and fate of pfass 3 elucidate the adverse effect on the conventional contaminants removal and bioelectricity generation under pfass exposure and 4 further reveal the risk to microbial and wetland plants under long term pfass pressure this study for the first time investigated the pfass removal in the cw mfc system the findings can help pfass remediation and simultaneously provide a comprehensive understanding of the risk assessment and management of pfass contaminated wetland ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all pfass standards pfoa and pfos and isotope labeled internal standards mpfoa and mpfos 98 were purchased from wellington laboratories

conducted in a glasshouse under natural light conditions and shelter from rainwater at the campus of jinan university guangzhou china three microcosm scale cw mfcs termed as cw mfccontrol cw mfcclose

density of 6 rhizomes per system the design and operation parameters of this trial were illustrated in table s1 cw mfccontrol and cw mfcclose systems were operated in a closed circuit mode while cw mfcopen system was run in an open circuit mode to evaluate the effects of pfass exposure on the cw mfc system each of 10 Î¼g l pfoa and pfos has been added to the influent of cw mfcclose and cw mfcopen systems the concentration of pfass in the current experiment was a little bit higher than the typical detected concentration in wwtps but it is still in the same order of magnitude Î¼g l cw mfccontrol was no pfass addition to unravel the effect of pfass on cw mfc performance the experiment was conducted continuously for 5 months from october 2021 to february 2022 during which the air temperature and relative humidity were about 18 7 4 and 55 24 respectively the wastewater was continuously fed from the bottom to the top of the cw mfcs using a peristaltic pump bt100 1 l while the hydraulic retention time hrt was 72 h the properties of the synthetic domestic wastewater without pfass were the same as described in our previous experiments ji et al 2022b 2 3 analytical methods 2 3

as well as the hydrogen peroxide h2o2 of the ca were all monitored on a regular basis in each system details of the processes can be found in text s5 2 3 4 microbial enzyme activities the activities of microbial enzymes such as dehydrogenase dha ammonia monooxygenase amo nitrate reductase nr and acid phosphatase ap were evaluated in electrode and substrate materials the detailed processes were given in text s6 2 3 5 dna extraction and high throughput sequencing to analyze the microbial community before and after pfass exposure microbial samples were collected at the cathode and anode of each system the electrode material of anode and cathode before and after pfass exposure in different cw mfc systems was separately mixed and collected in triplicate and then stored at 20 before dna extraction the dna of the corresponding sample was extracted by dna extraction kits hipure soil dna mini kit magen china following extraction dna samples were evaluated by a nd 2000 spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies wilmington usa dna samples that meet the quality requirements were used for dna amplification pcr amplification of the v3 v4 region of bacterial 16s rrna gene was performed using the primer pair 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 a high throughput sequencing procedure was carried out on an illumina hiseq platform by biomarker technologies company beijing china 2 4 quality assurance and quality control procedures for quality assurance and quality control qa qc were carried out during the sampling extraction and analysis stages according to u s epa method 537 1 the possibility of pfoa and pfos adsorption on the polypropylene surface of the influent tank was considered and pre tested prior to the experiment the concentration difference between the two samples before and after adsorption was less than 5 indicating that adsorption of polypropylene barrels was not significant in this study the internal standard method with a calibration curve consisting of eight levels 0 1 5 10 25 50 100 and 200 Î¼g l has been established to calculate unknown sample concentrations the correlation coefficients of pfoa and pfos were greater than 0 99 a standard sample was run every 9 samples to check for carryover background contamination precision and accuracy in table s3 the signal to noise s n ratios of 3 and 10 were used to determine the limits of detection lod and limits of quantification loq the method detection limits mdls were derived from the mean concentration and standard deviation of the procedure blanks table s3 the pfoa and pfos recoveries fell in 80 120 2 5 statistical analysis all sample analysis was conducted in triplicates basis and the results were reported as the mean value standard deviation a one way anova test or t tests were used to identify differences between the different treatments a threshold p value of 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant bioinformatics and statistical analysis were used according to man et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfass removal and their fate in the cw mfc system 3 1 1 removal from wastewater fig 1 shows the influent and effluent concentrations of pfoa and pfos in the cw mfcs while the dynamics of pfass concentrations over the experiment period is presented in fig s2 there are differences in the design and measurement of pfoa and pfos concentrations in synthetic wastewater the actual average concentration of pfoa and pfos in influent was 6 46 0 52 Î¼g l and 9 34 0 87 Î¼g l respectively the pfoa removal rates of 97 84 100 and 96 74 100 were achieved in the cw mfcclose and the cw mfcopen respectively pfos levels in the effluent of cw mfcclose and cw mfcopen were 0 04 0 02 Î¼g l and 0 15 0 04 Î¼g l respectively these results suggest that cw mfc system can effectively removal pfoa and pfos no matter whether it is operated in open or closed circuit this also supports our hypothesis that cw mfc system could be capable of efficiently removing pfass ji et al 2020 however by inspecting the data it is shown that the cw mfcclose system is better than the cw mfcopen system reflecting the role of mfc being beneficial in removing pfass the concentrations of pfoa and pfos in different compositions of cw mfcs were presented in table 1 as shown in table 1 the highest concentration of pfass was enriched in the anode of the cw mfcclose system and the anode was considered to be the active site for cw mfcs to remove pops in other studies wang et al 2020 moreover the electrode layers both the anode and cathode removed 88 78 pfoa and 85 31 pfos based on the mass balance in the closed circuit cw mfc system while in the open circuit system only 83 61 pfoa and 75 69 pfos were removed these results imply that the closed circuit improves pfass retention by around 10 it is hypothesized that electric fields may improve gac adsorption of pfass niarchos et al 2022 and that mfc stimulates electroactive bacteria eab secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps and has adsorption capability for pfass yan et al 2021b 3 1 2 fate of pfass in cw mfc the concentrations of pfass in the influent anode effluent and final effluent are shown in fig 2 these results indicate that the electrode layers remove most of the pfass in the case of gac adsorption of pfass in anode layer the ftir spectra of the gac in the anode before and after pfass addition are shown in fig 2 c the visible peaks at 876 1377 and 1540 cm 1 correspond to the adsorption vibration peaks of the pfass characteristic functional groups which correspond to the cf2 and cf3 groups hui et al 2015 yang et al 2016 the bond with a peak range of 642 697 cm 1 was linked to c f wiggling vibrations huang et al 2018 the adsorption vibration peaks in 1054 cm 1 indicated that the existence of a sulfonic group on the gac by adsorption pfos chen et al 2017 huang et al 2018 moreover the pfoa in the cathode and anode layers gac of the cw mfcclose system were 2 84 6 11 ng g and 393 20 480 42 ng g respectively while the corresponding pfos was 2 85 8 86 ng g and 417 37 438 54 ng g respectively as shown table 1 thus more pfass were accumulated on the anode gac layer while few pfass were adsorbed on the cathode layer a review of the adsorption performance of commercial gac for pfass found that it has an adsorption capacity in the range of 0 165 760 mg g pauletto and bandosz 2022 although the gac maximum adsorption capacity for pfoa and pfos was not directly determined in this experiment the correlation between bet surface area and adsorption capacity of gac based on previous studies was established fig s3 the maximum adsorption capacity values for pfoa and pfos are predicted to be 248 mg g and 147 mg g respectively based on the bet surface area of gac in the experiment of 468 m2 g in addition the mass of gac filled in the anode and cathode layers in each system of this study was 1 78 and 0 90 kg respectively therefore gac in the systems has sufficient adsorption capacity of pfass and residual pfass from the anode can be adsorbed in the cathodic layer before efflux plants also have important contributions to the pfass removal in the cw mfcs the concentration of pfoa and pfos in the stems and leaves of ca in each system are measured at the end of experiment table 1 the bioaccumulation of the open circuit system under pfass exposure is higher than that of the close circuit system in terms of the concentration of pfass in ca this finding implies that mfc inside the cw system might lessen pfass migration transport and accumulation in wetland plants which might help reduce the likelihood of pfass being passed via the food chain one of the possible reasons is that more pfass are adsorbed and fixed in the anode layer in the cw mfcclose system and the concentration of pfass around the rhizosphere for plant uptake was declined by further examining the pfass in different tissues of ca the contents of pfoa and pfos in the leaves were larger than that in the stems one study of the distributions of pfos in ca was shown that the aerial parts have higher concentration than that of root parts under 1 Î¼g l pfos exposure qiao et al 2021 generally the intervention of mfc in the cw system causes more pfass to be retained in the anode gac layer thus reducing the amount of pfass taken up by plants lowering the toxicity of pfass to plants this not only improves the system s capability to remove pfass but also alleviates the pfas induced restriction of wetland plants 3 2 effects of pfass on cw mfc performance 3 2 1 wastewater treatment performance the accumulation of high concentrations of persistent pfass in system may have potentially harmful effects on the system s ability to treat wastewater fig 3 displays the conventional contamination removal of each system with and without pfass exposure as shown in fig 3 a under the mean influent cod concentration of 402 54 mg l the average cod removal efficiency for the control system was more than 90 over the entire operation period the cod value increased slightly to 423 50 mg l as a result of the addition of pfass to the inlet wastewater the cod removal efficiency of the cw mfcclose system without and with pfass exposure was 92 47 2 99 and 93 91 2 09 respectively similarly in the cw mfcopen system the cod removal rate was 85 84 2 82 without and 86 10 1 80 with pfass exposure it indicates that the existence of pfass in wastewater had no significant effect on cod removal p 0 05 in cw mfcs this result is quite different from conventional wastewater treatment systems reported yu et al 2018 demonstrated that the continuous addition of pfoa with high concentration 20 mg l on activated sludge process was restrained cod removal however in another experiment the low concentration 1 Î¼g l of pfos showed no significant impact on cod removal in vfcw system qiao et al 2021 tp removal of each system was plotted in fig 3 b it can be clearly observed that with or without pfass the tp removal rate increases with the operation period this is because the removal of tp in the cw mfc system mainly depends on the immobilization of the substrate and the uptake by plants as such low dose pfass exposure may not significantly interfere to the performance of cod and tp removal pfass in wastewater result in a significant decrease in nitrogen removal in the cw mfcs as shown in fig 3 c d in the control system the average removal efficiency of nh4 n was 90 24 2 05 in contrast the average removal rate of nh4 n of the close and open cw mfc systems was 87 09 and 63 41 respectively decreased by 7 22 p 0 05 and 13 51 p 0 05 compared with the absence pfass period the worse removal of nh4 n led to the deterioration of the tn removal which decreased by 2 45 p 0 05 and 13 98 p 0 05 in the close and open cw mfc systems respectively the effluent nitrate concentration in the open circuit system was significantly elevated during continuous exposure of pfoa and pfos fig s4 this suggests that pfoa and pfos co exposure can inhibit both nitrification and denitrification in the cw mfcs it has been showed that the high content of pfass were detected both in anode and cathode layer table 1 which are believed as the hot zones for nitrogen removal wang et al 2020 the significant differences between the results of with and without pfass exposure might be explained by the inhibitory effects of pfass on the activity of nitrogen removal microorganisms and microbial community jiang et al 2021 compared to close circuit system the cw mfcopen system had markedly decreased nitrogen removal during pfass exposure it should be noted that the close circuit cw mfc system was favorable for the enrichment of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria to enhance the nitrogen removal wang et al 2019a 2020 additionally the anode dependent ammonium oxidation may also contribute to the nitrogen removal in cw mfc system yan et al 2021a thus while the pfass could decrease the nitrogen removal the presence of mfcs provides a bioelectrochemical removal route for nitrogen and alleviates pfass inhibition 3 2 2 bioelectricity generation in order to explore the effects of pfass on bioelectricity generation of the cw mfc system the voltage output signal of the cw mfcs was recorded fig 4 without pfass exposure the average voltage values of the cw mfcclose system and the control system without pfass existence were 599 23 16 31 mv and 581 22 10 79 mv respectively implying no significant difference p 0 05 however it can be shown that the pfass was detrimental to maintaining bioelectricity generation in the cw mfc system the average output voltage of the cw mfcclose system decreased by 7 32 555 33 26 69 mv under the stress of pfass as shown in fig 4 the voltage output of the cw mfcclose system demonstrated a pattern of rapidly falling at the start then increasing and eventually becoming stable this indicates the inhibition of the bioelectricity generation in the initial pfass exposure stage while the inhibition seems to be gradually alleviated a previous study to use the cw mfc system for antibiotics tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole removal has discovered that relatively high influent antibiotic concentrations 400 1600 Î¼g l could still result in high regulated voltage output zhang et al 2017 the reason for this could be the biodegradation of the antibiotics after the microorganism s adoption however it may not be the case for pfoa and pfos which are thought to be difficult to degrade by microorganisms indeed the toxicity of pfass may impair electrogenic microbial activity in the system resulting in a lower voltage output the electrodes potentials without and with pfass exposure were monitored fig 4b the results show that with the accumulation of pfass in electrodes the average anodic potential rises from 149 24 89 16 mv to 104 82 36 21 mv while the cathodic potential falls from 468 47 102 33 mv to 408 53 106 81 mv deterioration of cathode performance might be induced by the changes in the cathode microenvironment table s4 unfavorable oxidizing conditions directly limits the oxygen reduction reaction in cathode and lower voltage output ji et al 2022a these results could be linked with the pfass accumulation at the cathode and the effects on plants li et al 2021c xiao et al 2022 the power density current density and polarization curves of the cw mfcclose system in the period before and after pfass exposure were also measured fig 4c the maximum current density without pfass exposure was 118 11 ma m2 while it declined to 110 23 ma m2 during the pfass exposure a similar result was also obtained in maximum power density that was dropped from 23 19 mw m2 to 19 85 mw m2 with pfass exposure furthermore the estimated internal resistances derived from the polarization curves were around 240 Ï‰ in the absence of pfass and nearly 300 Ï‰ in the presence of pfass these outcomes propose that pfass impede the bioelectricity generation of the cw mfc system with harmfulness to electrogenic microorganisms being the potential main considerations to cause it 3 3 effect of pfass on plants plants have multiple functions and play an important role for contaminants removal and bioenergy generation in the cw mfcs ji et al 2022a the accumulation of pfass may affect the plants which in turn affect system performance it is fascinating to explore the changes in plants behavior in the cw mfc system when pfass were introduced to test this hypothesis the growth the photosynthetic systems and the antioxidative enzymes of the plants were investigated 3 3 1 photosynthetic system as shown in fig 5 a the relative chlorophyll content of the three cw mfc systems was similar around 60 before pfass exposure however the relative chlorophyll content decreased significantly during the initial 6 days of pfass exposure thereafter the value settled around 40 compared with the control system the value was reduced by nearly one third these results clearly indicate the negative effects of pfass on plant photosynthetic pigments du et al 2020 observed a significantly negative correlation between chlorophyll level and pfass concentration in cucumis sativus leaves confirming that the pfass could introduce stress to the plants and cause inhibitory of the photosynthetic system moreover changes in chlorophyll levels in some wetland plants may be consistent with pfass concentrations for instance lower pfos 0 1 mg l did not cause significant changes in chlorophyll concentration for both acorus calamus and phragmites communis while the chlorophyll levels were significantly decreased when exposed to pfos at 50 mg l qian et al 2019 similar results have confirmed this finding in other plants li et al 2021b lin et al 2020 however the addition of 1 Î¼g l and 0 1 mg l pfos significantly increased the contents of photosynthetic pigments in ca in the cw li et al 2020a the reason for this paradoxical phenomenon is not clear but might be attributed to the different experimental systems to further explore the effects of pfass on the plant s photosynthetic system the changes in fluorescence parameters in each system were recorded the value of fv fm corresponds to the maximum quantum yield of photosynthesis and is used to indicate stress in leaves as shown in fig 5 b the values of fv fm of pfass exposure systems were significantly lower than that of the control system p 0 05 the lowest average value of the close and the open system was 0 749 0 024 and 0 737 0 015 respectively this provides evidence that pfass could result in inactivation damage of psii in plant leaves bjÃ¶rkman and demmig 1987 in addition to accurately obtain photosystems efficiency in psii photochemistry the values of non photochemical quenching npq were measured fig 5c it was found that the mean maximum npq of plants in close and open cw mfc systems exposed to pfass was significantly increased compared to the control system this suggests that the level of photochemical quenching of psii and the maximum working efficiency of psii in plant leaves are significantly reduced implying the significant inhibition of the photosynthetic reaction center murchie and lawson 2013 furthermore the changes in chlorophyll levels are closely related to the imbalance between biosynthesis and degradation which is reflected in the redox state of leaves the parameter ql is considered to be a more accurate predictor of the psii redox states which is monitored and plotted in fig 5 d the ql values of the plants in exposure systems differed significantly from the control indicating that pfass disrupted the redox state in leaves which may be affected by reactive oxygen species ros in leaves it is worth noting that photosynthesis strength is strongly connected to phytoremediation effectiveness and inadequate photosynthesis will limit plants capacity to remove contaminants simmer and schnoor 2022 collectively pfass accumulates in leaves after uptake and migration through roots and stems the toxicity of pfass causes plant s leaf chlorophyll content to decline and photosynthesis inhibition furthermore the effects of pfass on plants varied among cw mfcs it is obvious that plants in closed circuit operation of a cw mfc system had a larger stress resistant capacity which may be connected to the concentration of pfass in plants table 1 3 3 2 antioxidant response under biotic and or abiotic stress ros levels rise in plant leave cells and could damage plant health wang et al 2010 the production of h2o2 in ca leaves under the pfass exposure is presented in fig s5 under pfass exposure the h2o2 level of close and open cw mfc systems was respectively 1 5 fold for 0 63 0 01 Î¼mol g and 2 fold for 0 84 0 08 Î¼mol g greater than that of the control system for 0 46 0 02 Î¼mol g at the end of the experiment these findings are consistent with earlier research findings of plants under pfass exposure qian et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 malondialdehyde mda content is an important parameter responsible to the antioxidant potential as it can reflect the rate and intensity of lipid peroxidation as well as the degree of damage to plants suffered from adversity it is an excellent indicator to assess plant cell damage caused by ros kong et al 2016 as shown in fig s5 b the contents of mda in pfass exposure systems were higher than those in the control system p 0 05 combining the above results it is possible to conclude that pfass caused a high accumulation of ros and cell damage in ca leaves it should be emphasized that the presence of raising ros significantly impairs leaf photosynthesis which is consistent with a reduction in photosynthetic efficiency the antioxidant defense systems in plants were activated to cope with the accumulated ros induced by pfass exposure thus the effects of pfass exposure on the antioxidant enzyme system superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat and peroxidase pod activity and the results were shown in fig s6 in fig s6 a pfass exposure could increase sod activity in the different cw mfc systems this result further demonstrated that ros is abundantly accumulated in leaves under pfass exposure and increased sod activity is advantageous in removing ros li et al 2021a the activity of sod was positively correlated with the concentration of pfass exposed li et al 2021b qiao et al 2021 obviously the sod activity in the cw mfcopen system was higher than that in cw mfcclose system for most of the time during the trial which is positively linked with the concentration of pfass in plants table 1 in plant systems the detoxification of h2o2 is carried out by cat and pod the activities of cat and pod are shown in fig s6 b c compared with the control system cat activity in the exposure systems was significantly decreased the reasons for the decrease may be considered to be the high accumulation of ros to suppress cat activity when cat does not completely neutralize ros pod dissociates hydrogen peroxide biczak 2016 pod activity in the cw mfcs with pfass exposure was significantly higher than that in the control system p 0 05 considering the results of sod cat and pod activity plants in the cw mfcopen system have more active oxidative stress activity which is beneficial to alleviate the toxicity to plants caused by pfass it is worth noting that antioxidant defense system can protect plant cells from the negative effects of ros under oxidative stress but may cause the loss of chlorophyll liu et al 2014 overall pfass in plants harmed the plants photosynthetic system while activating their antioxidant defense system photosynthesis is the source for plants to provide other functions the inhibition reduces root activity and in turn hinders pollutant uptake and oxygen secretion by the root system all these effects can be reflected in the reduction of pollutant removal efficiency and bioelectricity generation in the cw mfc system 3 4 effects of pfass on microbial activities and community 3 4 1 microbial enzyme activity in the cw mfc systems the organic matter nitrogen and phosphorus removal and bioenergy generation are all dependent on a series of biochemical processes which are directly related to key enzyme activity four key enzyme activities related to organic matter removal and biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal were investigated and presented in fig s7 briefly during pfass exposure dehydrogenase dha ammonia monooxygenase amo and nitrate reductase nr activities were considerably decreased while acp activity remained unaffected in fig s7 a the dha activity in anode microorganisms of close and open cw mfc systems was reduced by 14 88 1 52 23 79 9 36 respectively dha activity has a close correlation with the electron transfer and consumption processes of eab in cw mfc system ji et al 2022b this can partly explain the deterioration of anode potential in the cw mfcs fig 4 meanwhile dha activity in middle and cathode regions was changed somewhat but not dramatically which suggests that a large amount of pfass have been removed at the anode layer fig s7 b shows that there were no significant differences in the values of key enzyme activity associated with microbial tp removal in either of the pfass exposure systems compared to the control system the enzymatic activity of amo and nr which are related to nitrification and denitrification were decreased in the presence of pfass in fig s7 c the observed values of amo activity in anode layer was slightly changed while they were sharply decreased in the middle and cathode layers in the pfass exposure systems specifically the amo activity in the cw mfcclose system was decreased by nearly 20 in the middle layer and further reduced to 72 31 18 73 in the cathode layer compared with the control system similarly amo activity inhibition was observed in the cw mfcopen system with 78 99 14 03 and 61 35 19 67 compared to the control system in the middle and cathode layer respectively the results showed that the pfass inhibition degree of nitrification process in the open circuit is greater than that in the close circuit of cw mfc system which in turn led to the changes in the nh4 n removal fig 3 the enzymatic activity of nr at middle layer in the cw mfcopen system is only 71 40 16 39 of the control system while the activity in the cathode layer is similarly drastically decreased fig s7 d this suggests that the biological denitrification enzyme system may be poisoned to some extent in the presence of pfass in the cw mfc system both above results imply that denitrification may be the rate limiting step for nitrogen removal in the cw mfcopen under pfass exposure by contrast when cw mfc system was operated in a closed circuit the nr enzyme activity was likewise hindered but nitrate could be reduced at the cathode layer by electrons that transferred from the anode ji et al 2022a overall the existence of a changing trend difference in the microbial enzyme activity in each system is to some extent consistent with the cw mfc system s decontamination and bioenergy generation performance 3 4 2 effect of pfass stress on microbial community the microbial community change in a cw mfc system under pfass exposure has not been investigated so far table s5 presented the sequencing data of the samples from the anode and cathode layers of cw mfcs by illumina novaseq analysis high coverage values more than 99 2 accurately reflect the genuine nature of the microorganisms in each sample alpha diversity indices were evaluated in fig s8 the average chao1 and ace index in both anode and cathode for close and open cw mfc systems was increased but the shannon values of microbiological samples displayed different patterns in various cw mfc working modes during pfass exposure in particular the shannon value rises in closed mode and falls in open mode these findings demonstrate that in a closed circuit cw mfc system pfass exposure enhanced bacterial richness but decreased bacterial diversity whereas in an open circuit cw mfc system pfass exposure would increase both bacterial richness and diversity qiao et al 2021 found a similar result when they investigated the richness and diversity of microorganisms in the vfcw after adding pfos in the current study the cw mfcopen system can be regarded as an enhanced vfcw system with filling gac the decreased bacterial diversity and increased bacterial richness in the cw mfcclose system may lie in the increased richness of pfass resistant species and the decrease of some sensitive species the variation of the bacterial community structure before and after pfass exposure was compared by using principal coordinates analysis pcoa on bray curtis dissimilarities fig 6 as shown in fig 6 a pcoa axis 1 and 2 represent respectively 78 63 and 12 90 of the total bacterial community variations in the anode bacterial community of each system pcoa 1 and pcoa 2 refer to 70 18 and 15 87 of the variability in bacterial communities in the cathode layer respectively fig 6b these results suggest that bacterial communities with and without pfas exposure are well segregated furthermore pfass increased the similarity of microbial community structure in cw mfcclose and cw mfcopen s cathode and anode the microbial communities in the different operation modes of the cw mfc system may evolve towards a similar trend under pfass stress li et al 2021c variations in bacterial community composition were further investigated by analyzing bacterial community composition and structure at the phylum class and genus levels fig 6 at the phylum level a total of 43 identified phyla were observed as shown in fig 6 c the high percentage of abundant phyla of the anode samples include proteobacteria 27 99 52 88 firmicutes 6 62 35 78 bacteroidetes 6 46 22 52 actinobacteria 0 71 12 57 chloroflexi 0 18 12 49 and acidobacteria 1 43 5 72 under pfass exposure the phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes both in the close and open cw mfc system presented higher abundance but the phyla proteobacteria actinobacteria chloroflexi and acidobacteria showed distinct decreases in the anode and cathode samples in the cw mfcopen system proteobacteria and acidobacteria phyla have been widely detected in the cws and natural wetland ecosystems and they play critical roles in nitrogen cycle biodegradation or biotransformation mellado and vera 2021 this perhaps explains why the nitrogen removal was a significant drop in open circuit mode and a slight decrease in close circuit mode of cw mfc system during pfass exposure firmicutes and bacteroidetes comprise many genera that undergo organic degradation under anaerobic conditions and have been documented as relatively dominant phyla in the pfass contaminated environments lu et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 for the class level analyses the presence of pfass could increase the relative abundance of bacteroidia and clostridia in the cw mfc system while the abundance of alphaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria was slightly decreased fig 6e and f these sub proteobacteria have denitrifying capacity li et al 2020b lu et al 2014 denitrification inhibition was more severe in the cw mfcopen system due to a significant decrease in the abundance of denitrifying microorganisms when compared to the absence of pfass exposure combined with the results of shifts in anodic and cathodic microbial community structure it can be concluded that exposure to pfass lowered the nitrogen removal capability of the cw mfc system geobacter pseudomonas azoarcus syntrophus caldisericum and longilinea were the predominant bacteria at the genus level in the anode bacterial communities of close circuit mode cw mfc systems fig 7 in particular geobacter and pseudomonas have been reported to be the principal bacteria of eabs that generate electricity in the cw mfc system gupta et al 2021 wang et al 2019a the high abundance of eabs facilitates the continuous output at a higher voltage of the cw mfc system operation with closed circuit in addition the relative abundances of the genus in the closed circuit and open circuit of cw mfcs were quite different indicating that connecting the external circuit was advantageous in order to build a suitable habitat for eabs however clustering of abundances at the taxonomic level showed that anode microbial abundances of close and open operation of cw mfc exhibited similarities after pfass exposure lactobacillus fusobacterium frateuria vibrio thiobacillus helicobacter and bacteroides were the dominant bacterial genus in the anode samples after pfass exposure thus pfass presence clearly shifted the genus relative abundance of anode bacteria in the cw mfcs the lower abundance of geobacter and pseudomonas in the anode bacterial community in part explained the reduced bioelectricity generation in the cw mfcclose system under pfass exposure overall exposure of pfass obviously shifted the diversity and structure of the microbial community in the electrodes of the cw mfc system resulting in varying degrees of reduced nitrogen removal efficiency and bioelectricity generation 3 5 potential risks and engineering significance 3 5 1 potential risks for pfass in cw mfc in this study pfoa and pfos were efficiently removed by cw mfc systems with gac adsorption and plant uptake however the risks of pfass accumulation in the substrates and bioaccumulation in plants must not be overlooked most of cw systems seem a sophisticated passive pfass treatment technology with the continual transport of pfass from the aqueous phase to the substrates and plants the substrate s adsorption capacity is restricted by its own characteristics while plants absorption and accumulation also have biological limits this study first investigated the toxic effects of continuous pfoa and pfos exposure on substrate surface biofilms and plant photosynthetic systems in the cw mfc system several negative effects on system performance were observed cw and or cw mfc system runs for few years in practical application vymazal 2011 the potential desorption and release of pfass needs to be carefully considered when the substrate becomes saturated more importantly pfass in plants can be potentially transferred and magnified through the food chain the bioaccumulation of pfass in tropical estuarine food webs has been demonstrated miranda et al 2021 and estuarine wetlands are an important natural wetland component to the best of our knowledge there is little information on pfass migration transfer and bioaccumulation in the cw system therefore the risk of pfass removal by the cw mfc system requires further and more comprehensive investigation 3 5 2 engineering significance despite the fact that it has certain adverse effects on system performance the bioelectricity output by cw mfc is difficult to achieve efficient recovery and utilization at the current stage the introduction of mfc into the cw system can effectively remove pfass and reduce ecological risk while sacrificing only a small amount of bioelectricity performance and a slight decrease in nutrient removal demonstrating its broad application potential thus cw mfc system offers a practical and cost effective engineering approach to control pfass on the one hand the cost of capital or operation limits the field applications of most of the pfass separation and destruction techniques wanninayake 2021 the cost of constructing cw mfc system mainly lies in the substrate and electrode materials while several cheap commercialized materials with high adsorption capacity can be the sole and joint used substrates or electrode materials in cw mfc system in addition cw and intensified cw systems have been constructed and operated extensively around the world without a doubt the cost of effectively pfass removal by adding replacing a portion of the pfass adsorbent material is far cheaper than the cost of building a set of physicochemical treatment equipment on the other hand although biological approaches to the treatment of pfass are extremely limited and not currently considered feasible cw mfc system provides a potential bioremediation approach this is because the accumulation of pfass in the substrate with long retention time and bioelectrochemical stimulation offers a favored condition for incubation and domestication pfass degrading microorganisms moreover there has been some recent progress in exploring the bioremediation of pfoa by an anaerobic autotrophic bacterium acidimicrobium sp strain a6 ruiz uriguen et al 2022 they demonstrated a 77 reduction in concentration and identification of shorter chain perfluorinated compounds validating the biodegradation of pfoa in the experiment it seems that there is a condition and pathway for pfoa and other pfass biodegradation or biotransformation due to the abundant microbial population and suitable microenvironment in cw mfc system however further studies are highly desirable 4 conclusion considering the rising number of emerging contaminants in wastewater and other aqueous environment cw mfc system for pfass contaminated wastewater is an unavoidable circumstance to try this study in both closed circuit and open circuit operation of the cw mfc systems demonstrated over 96 removal of the influent containing pfoa and pfos through adsorption by electrode materials and uptake by plants plus the mfc enhancement however with the efficient removal of pfass several adverse effects on system performance have occurred including nitrogen removal and bioelectricity generation in addition by comprehensive investigation of the photosynthetic system and antioxidant defense system of the plants it was found that the pfass harmed the plants healthy and in turn hindered the plant s function in the system furthermore pfass not only directly changed the microbial community structure but also indirectly inhibited microbial enzyme activities collectively cw mfc systems open an alternative way for the removal of pfass from the aquatic environment which can alleviate some barriers to the full application of physical and chemical techniques but further

electrochemical advanced oxidation process eaop is recommended for high strength refractory organics wastewater treatment but the accompanying chlorinated byproduct generation becomes a bottleneck that limits the application of this technology to actual wastewater in this study we applied eaop 0 4 40 ma cm 2 to treat ultrafiltration effluent of an actual landfill leachate and quantitatively assessed the toxicities of the dominant chlorinated byproducts in eaop treated effluent considering both toxic effect and dose it followed the order active chlorine chlorate perchlorate organochlorines the toxic active chlorine could spontaneously decompose by settling and secondary bioreactor originally serving for denitrification could be used to reduce perchlorate and chlorate the effects of residual active chlorine and extra carbon addition on simultaneous denitrification perchlorate and chlorate reduction were investigated it seemed that 20 mg of active chlorine was an acceptable level to bioactivity and sufficient electron donors favored the removal of chlorate and perchlorate pseudomonas was identified as an active chlorine tolerant chlorate reducing bacteria and thauera was responsible for perchlorate reduction under the conditions of sufficient carbon source supply our results confirmed that the perchlorate and chlorate concentrations in the effluent below their health advisory levels were achievable solving the issue of toxic chlorinated byproduct generation during eaop this study provided a solution to realistic application of eaop to treat high chloride wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrochemical advanced oxidation process generation of chlorinated byproducts toxicity assessment chlorate and perchlorate reduction dominant species 1 introduction industrial wastewater such as landfill leachate is usually characterized with high strength refractory organic substances ammonium and chloride ion renou et al 2008 the degradable organic matter and nitrogen species could be removed by cost efficient biological process in advance and subsequently electrochemical advanced oxidation process eaop is widely recommended as post treatment for the remaining bio refractory contaminants in wastewater as expected refractory organic compounds are either completely mineralized or converted into bio degradable ones via direct or indirect electro oxidation during eaop however it usually accompanies with the undesirable chlorinated byproduct generation if the wastewater contains a large amount of chloride martÃ­nez huitle et al 2015 it is because that the redox potential for chlorine gas cl2 c l e0 1 36 v hypochlorous acid hclo c l e0 1 49 v chlorite clo 2 c l e0 0 89 v chlorate clo 3 c l e0 1 03 v perchlorate clo 4 c l e0 1 287 v and organochlorine are lower than the hydroxyl radical oh e0 2 67 v sulfate radical so 4 e0 2 6 v chlorine radical cl e0 2 4 v etc accordingly the inorganic or organic chlorinated byproducts are inevitably produced during eaop ike et al 2019 as previous studies reported anode materials current density velocity and chloride ion concentration all affected the chlorinated byproduct generation anglada et al 2011 donaghue and chaplin 2013 polcaro et al 2008 shen et al 2020 yao et al 2019 for example boron doped diamond bdd anode produced more perchlorate compared to metal oxides due to high electrocatalytic activity of bdd polcaro et al 2008 high current densities and low flow rates were conductive to increase the formation of chlorate and perchlorate donaghue and chaplin 2013 and more organochlorine was produced as the chloride ion concentration increased anglada et al 2011 moreover a chemically modified cathode vigorously produced h2o2 that quenched of active chlorine resulting in a significant reduction in chlorinated byproduct formation yao et al 2019 some cathodes with strong reduction capacity could conduct dechlorination and favored the reduction of organic chlorinated byproducts shen et al 2020 these chlorinated byproducts are suspected carcinogens and mutagens radjenovic and sedlak 2015 u s environmental protection agency gives the advisory values for chlorate and perchlorate of 210 and 56 Âµg l 1 to protect human health and the regulating values for trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas are set at 80 and 60 Âµg l 1 for ambient water the limit of chlorate is 30 mg l 1 in water quality guidelines of british columbia canada warrington 2002 and water quality guidelines limit trichloromethane of 1 8 Âµg l 1 for the protection of aquatic life by the canadian council of ministers of the environment unfortunately the reported concentrations of these concerned chemicals in the eaop effluent achieving as much as 2141 0 mg l 1 for chlorate and 252 6 mg l 1 for perchlorate extremely exceeded the aforementioned limits feng et al 2021 the prevalence of these chlorinated byproducts in the eaop treated effluent may cause a health or ecological risk to the receiving water body accordingly formation of chlorinated byproducts may compromise the quality of the eaop treated effluent radjenovic and sedlak 2015 it is identified as an issue by applying eaop to high chloride wastewater treatment researchers explored many ways to solve this problem one is to inhibit the formation of the chlorinated byproducts for example chlorine radical was selectively generated by newly fabricating wo3 bivo4 electrode to eliminate the target contaminants and control the chlorate generation as well fang et al 2020 in another free chlorine uv photolysis system chlorine radical was 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than hydroxyl radical resulting in less chlorate produced zhao et al 2021 mass transfer enhancement and shortening hydraulic retention time hrt in reactive electrochemical membranes could also prevent a large amount of chlorinated byproduct generation lin et al 2021 another way is to effectively remove the formed byproducts a range of techniques has been explored such as sorption ion exchange membrane filtration and microbial reduction radjenovic and sedlak 2015 hu et al 2021 among these microbial reduction has been used for per chlorate contaminated groundwater treatment which was extensively studied in terms of reactor type inoculum carbon source substrate concentration etc lai et al 2021 xu et al 2003 notably the industrial wastewater with the characteristics of high refractory organic substances and salinity is more complex compared to groundwater as expected higher concentrations of chlorate and perchlorate would be formed when high chloride wastewater is treated by eaop and nitrate as a competing electron acceptor is usually present alongside with chlorate and perchlorate in the eaop effluent therefore studies on per chlorate reduction in groundwater could be a reference but not a guideline for per chlorate reduction in industrial wastewater systematic investigations with respect to the treatment of eaop treated effluent has not been reported before moreover the effect of the chlorinated byproducts such as active chlorine and organochlorine on the microbial reduction is also seldom studied their toxicity to the subsequent biological treatment is still not clear in this study the ultrafiltration effluent of a landfill leachate treatment system was treated using eaop firstly the evolutions of cod nitrogen n species and chloride cl species were investigated for various current densities secondly the toxicological effect of the eaop treated effluent and individual and combined chlorinated byproducts were systematically evaluated finally the long term operation of the secondary biological reactor was conducted to perform simultaneous nitrate chlorate and perchlorate reduction and the dominant species responsible for contaminant removal was illuminated this work may address the questions of application of eaop to treat high chloride wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 electrochemical advanced oxidation eao for ultrafiltration effluent treatment the ultrafiltration effluent was obtained from the leachate treatment system of a closed municipal solid waste landfill in xiamen city fujian province china the leachate was first treated using anoxic aerobic process and then ultrafiltration membrane separation the main physicochemical characteristics of the ultrafiltration effluent are presented in table s1 the ultrafiltration effluent contained approximately 250 mg l 1 of cod and 100 mg l 1 of total nitrogen tn with a low biodegradability eaops are proposed as mediate treatment for biodegradability enhancement of ultrafiltration effluent in our previous study feng et al 2021 following by a secondary biological reactor to further remove degradable organic matter and nitrogen simultaneously a flow by electrode setup fig s1 was used to conduct the eao experiments a commercial bdd neocoat sa switzerland electrode was used as an anode and a stainless steel electrode was a cathode with a surface area of 50 cm2 each the electrode gap was set at 0 5 cm 400 ml of the ultrafiltration effluent continuously recirculated through the reactor by the peristaltic pump with a flow rate of 50 l h 1 under the hydraulic conditions the limiting current density j lim for the target ultrafiltration effluent treatment was calculated at 2 65 ma cm 2 according to our previous study feng et al 2021 the applied current densities j appl 0 4 1 5 10 40 ma cm 2 either higher or lower than jlim were selected to investigate the operating performances the end point of each run was the time at which the effluent cod was approximately 100 mg l 1 the evolution of cl species during eaops were detected active chlorine refers to a sum of chlorine hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite cl o and the dominant ingredient of active chlorine depends on liquid ph martÃ­nez huitle et al 2015 moreira et al 2017 active chlorine was

combined toxicities of the chlorinated byproducts the chlorinated byproducts mainly refer to active chlorine chlorate perchlorate and organochlorine in our study active chlorine mainly refers to hypochlorite due to the alkaline ph 7 5 8 5 in our system trichloromethane chcl3 and dichloroacetic acid c2h2cl2o2 were two typical compounds of thms and haas which were generated during eaops bagastyo et al 2012 and therefore were selected as the representative organochlorine byproducts in this study different dosages of the chlorinated byproducts were individually or jointly added for nur tests the concentrations of individual and mixing chemicals are shown in table 1 as for combined toxicity evaluation the selected experimental concentrations were similar to those chlorinated byproducts generated under different current densities three dose response models log logistic weibull 1 and weibull 2 ritz 2010 were applied to describe the inhibitory effect on denitrification the

determined by the akaike information criterion aic value and the standard error of the models golding et al 2022 moreover toxic unit tu and mixture toxicity index mti were adopted to assess the combined inhibition as described by lin et al 2020 eqs 4 7 we determined the types of combined toxicity according to m m 0 and mti value table 2 awoyemi et al 2020 4 t u i c i i c 50 i 5 m i 1 n t u i

concentration of component i when the mixture is at its ic 50 tu i max is the maximum toxic unit in the mixture m is the sum of the toxic unit of each compound in the mixture 2 3 operation of secondary biological treatment sequential batch reactor sbr was used for secondary biological treatment to further degrade organics and n species accompanying with the undesirable per chlorate removal the ultrafiltration effluent was first treated by eao under the conditions of 10 ma cm 2 for 75 min during which a substantial amount of the toxic active chlorine was generated the active chlorine could spontaneously decompose by settlement as shown in table 3 a step wise decrease in active chlorine from 90 to 20 mg l 1 was introduced to sbr i to investigate the effect of active chlorine on long term operating performances while the eaop treated effluent with trace active chlorine 1 mg cl l 1 was fed into sbr ii as a control phase i the working volume of the paralleled sbrs was 1 2 l half volume of the liquid was discharged and refilled every 6 hours so the hrt was 12 h bod5 no 3 n clo 3 cl clo 4 cl ratio in the influent was adjusted to 3 6 by adding extra acetic acid the dissolved oxygen was kept below 0 5 mg l 1 the mlss was maintained at approximately 4000 mg l 1 at phase ii the effect of organic carbon degradable cod no 3 n clo 3 cl clo 4 cl 4 9 3 9 and 2 7 in the influent on the operating performances was also investigated the hrt was extended to 24 h for complete biological reactions 2 4 high through sequencing and analysis the seeding sludge was sampled as well as the acclimated sludge at day 31 and day 90 when the reactors were exposed to the active chlorine of 40 mg cl l 1 and sufficient electron donor of bod5 no 3 n clo 3 cl clo 4 cl ratio of 4 9 respectively total dna was extracted using the fast dna spin kit mp usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the dna concentration and quality were measured using a nanodrop spectrophotometer nd 2000 thermo usa all dna extracts were stored at 20 c the v4 and v5 regions of the 16s rrna genes were amplified by the bacterial universal primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcgg 3 and 907r 5 ccgtcaattcmtttragttt 3 the amplicon libraries were ready for sequencing via illumina miseq platform majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china the datasets were available in ncbi s short read

performed by majorbio i sanger cloud platform www i sanger com fisher exact test was adopted for the significance of differences between samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 the evolution of cl species in leachate during eaops eaops mainly aims to degrade cod and enhance the biodegradability cod degradation fitted pseudo first order kinetic and the biodegradability increased from the initial b c ratio of 0 24 to the range of 0 42 0 85 under different applied current densities fig s2 meanwhile the residual ammonium in the ultrafiltration effluent was mostly converted to nitrate with a minor part lost in the form of nitrogen gas fig s3 the more detailed information is shown in text s3 in this study we more concerned the evolution of cl species during eaops the total c l concentration in the ultrafiltration effluent of landfill leachate was approximately 1200 mg l 1 table s1 as shown in fig 1 c l was gradually oxidized to high valence active chlorine clo 2 clo 3 and clo 4 as both applied current densities and reaction time increased clo 2 was negligibly detected since it was rapidly oxidized to clo 3 and clo 4 moreira et al 2017 generally the amounts of the generated active chlorine clo 3 and clo 4 were positively correlated to the applied current densities and the passed charge fig s4 however when the same amount of charge was consumed the chlorinated byproduct generation is different with 0 3 0 4 ah l 1 of specific electrical charge low applied current density preferred to produce chlorate while more active chlorine and perchlorate were produced at moderate and high applied current density respectively these results were also indicated by byproduct formation rates fig s4f accordingly active chlorine sharply increased to the range of 151 178 mg cl l 1 at j appl jlim clo 4 concentration increased by 160 times from 0 7 to 111 5 mg cl l 1 when the applied current densities varied from 0 4 to 40 ma cm 2 with the corresponding proportion of clo 4 increasing from 0 1 to 9 1 other study also observed a wide range of chlorinated byproduct generation with the values of 2 1 672 mg cl l 1 for chlorate and 2 9 83 2 mg cl l 1 for perchlorate when a variety of wastewater was treated radjenovic and sedlak 2015 santos et al 2020 the distributions of ce for electro oxidation of cod n and cl species under various current densities are shown in fig 2 theoretically the ce for cod degradation is 100 at jappl jlim martÃ­nez huitle et al 2015 in our case the corresponding ce for cod degradation accounted for 80 6 and 57 0 when the applied current densities were 0 4 and 1 ma cm 2 jlim respectively but the sum of ce for cod n and cl species was almost 100 this indicated that no more charge was served for the other side reactions accordingly we believed that the active chlorine and clo 3 occurring under low current densities was due to the direct oxidation with c l eqs 8 10 as the applied current density increased ce for cod decreased and cl species evolution strengthened the sum of ce for cod n and cl species became far below 100 it suggested that other species significantly reacted with electrode mainly including water indirect oxidation induced by hydroxyl radical played a more important role in electro oxidation at jappl jlim both direct and indirect oxidation contributed to the generation of chlorinated byproducts eqs 11 14 fang et al 2020 martÃ­nez huitle et al 2015 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 especially for clo 4 the valence state of cl in clo 4 is as high as 7 so clo 4 is considered to be strictly evolved from the oxidation of clo 3 at the anode surface radjenovic and sedlak 2015 8 2 c l c l 2 2 e 9 c l 2 h 2 o hclo c l h 10 c l 3 h 2 o clo 3 6 h 6 e 11 c l oh cl o h e 12 cl o oh clo 2 h e 13 clo 2 oh clo 3 h e 14 clo 3 oh clo 4 h e moreover organochlorines may be vigorously generated herein aocl variations generally presented an increasing and subsequently decreasing patterns fig 1f the peak values were 1 0 1 0 1 2 2 0 and 1 5 mg cl l 1 when the applied current densities were 0 4 1 5 10 and 40 ma cm 2 respectively aocl represented a quite small proportion of cl species compared to other chlorinated byproducts the generation of organochlorines during eaops may be attributed to the reaction of hclo or cl o with dissolved organic matter ike et al 2019 a decrease in aocl concentration in the late period of the electrolysis was because of the further mineralization of the produced organochlorines 3 2 toxicity of chlorinated byproducts 3 2 1 eaop treated effluent chlorinated byproducts such as active chlorine clo 3 clo 4 and organochlorines have been reported to be toxic to the environmental microorganisms seibert et al 2020 we used the luminescent bacteria vibrio fischeri to evaluate the acute toxicity of the eaop treated effluents for various current densities fig s5a the results showed that the effluents of higher current densities 10 and 40 ma cm 2 were more toxic than the lower ones 0 4 1 and 5 ma cm 2 and the luminescence inhibition rate intensified as the eaops progressed toxicity test by luminescent bacteria may not be indicative of activated sludge behavior phillips et al 2018 accordingly we assessed the acute toxicity based on nur test fig s5b oller et al 2011 the inital denitrification rate of the ultrafiltration effluent was approximately 4 0 mg n g 1 mlss h 1 the nurs barely changed with time when the current density was set at 0 4 and 1 ma cm 2 however the nurs decreased with the reaction time under the high applied current densities of 5 10 and 40 ma cm 2 with the values of 3 4 0 8 and 0 2 mg n g 1 mlss h 1 at the end of the electrolysis respectively when passing the same amount of charge high applied current density accelerated the reduction of denitrification rate fig s4f both luminescence inhibition rate and nur test confirmed that the eaop treated effluents especially under high current densities were toxic to the microorganisms it can be seen that there were significantly negative correlations between aocl active chlorine clo 3 and clo 4 concentrations and biotoxicity table s2 this indicated that the existences of chlorinated byproducts might dramatically affect the performances of subsequent biological treatment therefore the individual and combined toxicities of the chlorinated byproducts were further investigated 3 2 2 individual toxicity of the chlorinated byproducts microbial toxicity has been proved to increase whatever kind of supporting electrolyte was applied during eaop phillips et al 2018 however the specific toxicities with regards to the generated byproducts of the supporting electrolytes are seldom studied in our study denitrification rates influenced by different dosages of chlorinated byproducts were tested to determine their individual toxicity fig s6 overall the denitrification rate decreased with the increase of the concentrations of cl o clo 3 clo 4 chcl3 and c2h2cl2o2 the curve dropped rapidly when the concentration exceeded a specific threshold value dose respond model is considered as an appropriate method for risk assessment ritz 2010 herein we selected three classes of sigmoidal dose response models to depict effective doses smaller aic indicates a better fit to the data according to the fitting results of the models table 4 and fig s6 weibull 1 was recognized as the optimization model the weibull 1 curves are asymmetric which descend slowly from the upper limit and approach the lower limit rapidly consistent with our experimental results the ic50 of cl o clo 3 clo 4 chcl3 and c2h2cl2o2 were calculated at 0 089 3 5 12 7 1 7 and 2 5 g cl l 1 respectively their inhibitory effect on denitrification activity followed the order cl o chcl3 c2h2cl2o2 clo 3 clo 4 cl o is known as a highly cytotoxic substance gray et al 2013 we recognized cl o the most toxic compound among the produced chlorinated byproducts organic halogenated byproducts were also highly toxic and even more difficultly degraded than their precursors moreira et al 2017 1 0 2 0 mg cl l 1 of the detected aocl was far from the effective dose so their toxicities could be nearly neglected in our study moreover it was reported that clo 3 and clo 4 at milligram or microgram levels were toxic to plants humans and animals bardiya and bae 2011 but our results showed a high tolerance of activated sludge to clo 3 and clo 4 it was probably due to the detoxification of activated sludge via bacterial per chlorate reduction 3 2 3 combined toxicity of the chlorinated byproducts cl o concentration was found to be most influential to microbial activity the combined toxicities of cl o coupled with other chlorinated byproducts were further investigated table 4 and fig s7 the changing patterns of denitrification rates serving for combined toxicity evaluation were similar to those of individual toxicity the curves declined gradually at first and dropped dramatically after the knee points the ic50 values were harvested from the fitting models then tu m m0 and mti were calculated table 5 and the types of combined toxicity were identified table 2 the combined effects of cl o clo 3 cl o clo 4 and cl o clo 3 clo 4 cl o chcl3 cl o c2h2cl2o2 and cl o chcl3 c2h2cl2o2 on microbial activity were identified as synergism the mti value was reported to be positive with synergistic effect zheng et al 2021 according to our results cl o exerted a huge impact on the toxicities of other chlorinated byproducts in the mixture which were in the order clo 4 93 4 c2h2cl2o2 81 2 chcl3 13 3 clo 3 1 43 complementary actions anti counteractive actions and facilitating actions may all contribute to synergistic effect jia et al 2009 the results suggested that the simultaneous appearances of inorganic and or organic chlorinated byproducts in eaop treated effluent aggravated the inhibition on denitrification the direct discharge of eaop treated wastewater with a mixture of chlorinated byproducts may cause a higher toxicity to the receiving aquatic life 3 3 minimizing the impact of toxic active chlorine on subsequent biological process according to the individual and combined toxicity assessments the active chlorine was identified to be most influential to denitrifying bacterial activity the active chlorine in the eaop treated effluent mainly in a form of cl o especially under the high current density conditions can pose a threat to the biological process by contrast relatively low concentrations of chlorate perchlorate and organochlorines had no significant effects on activated sludge therefore eliminating active chlorine should be given priority to before the eaop treated effluent entered the subsequent biological reactor fortunately the active chlorine could be spontaneously decomposed by settling fig 3 the concentration of active chlorine dropped dramatically at first and then leveled off gradually based on it an intermediate tank was set between the eao equipment and the secondary biological reactor it was reported that the denitrification rate of 2 1 mg n g 1 mlss h 1 was considered as the threshold value of bacterial tolerance to the toxic compound lin et al 2020 accordingly the corresponding active chlorine concentration was approximately 90 mg cl l 1 fig s6a according to the active chlorine degradation curve the hrt of the intermediate tank was set at 9 h to achieve 90 mg cl l 1 of active chlorine and lessen its toxicity to the activated sludge in the subsequent biological reactor 3 4 the factors affecting simultaneous reduction of nitrate chlorate and perchlorate 3 4 1 long term operation under the active chlorine shock conditions the average cod b c ratio tn cl o clo 3 and clo 4 of the eaop treated effluent were approximately 122 7 mg l 1 0 6 99 6 mg l 1 130 0 mg cl l 1 66 8 mg cl l 1 and 39 3 mg cl l 1 respectively the effect of active chlorine dosage on simultaneous denitrification and per chlorate reduction was shown in fig 4 a the tn removal rate of the control reactor sbr ii was averagely 91 when the active chlorine in the influent was below 1 mg cl l 1 by contrast the tn removal rate dropped dramatically within two days when sbr i was exposed to the active chlorine of 90 mg cl l 1 and the nitrite was immediately accumulated with tn in the effluent quickly raising up to 96 2 mg l 1 from 6 8 mg l 1 it indicated that the denitrifying activity was severely inhibited the results were inconsistent with the acute toxicity assessment which showed that the activated sludge could reserve the denitrifying activity of 2 1 mg n g 1 mlss h 1 when the active chlorine came to 90 mg cl l 1 the differences were probably due to the acute and long term effect of active chlorine on activated sludge the microorganism could not endure the long term shock of active chlorine as much as 90 mg cl l 1 it took nearly one week to recover the denitrifying activity afterwards we adopted a step wise decrease in active chlorine to figure out the threshold value that microorganism could endure when the active chlorine was 45 and 40 mg cl l 1 the system deteriorated again extending the acclimation time to 14 24 hrts could not improve the operating performances then the active chlorine was further decreased to 35 30 and 20 mg cl l 1 tn removal gradually improved to 58 7 72 6 and 78 3 averagely there existed 12 7 difference of tn removal between sbr ii and sbr i being exposed to 20 mg cl l 1 of active chlorine it indicated that active chlorine more or less affected denitrification if the influent contained the undesirable active chlorine clo 3 reduction lagged behind the nitrogen removal in the initial and gradually reached an almost complete removal xu et al 2003 apart from this clo 3 reduction presented a similar changing pattern with tn removal over active chlorine it was noted that the clo 3 removal efficiency was even higher than that of tn removal under the same active chlorine shock the clo 3 removal efficiency in sbr i caught up with sbr ii when the active chlorine in the influent was decreased to 35 mg cl l 1 accordingly it seemed that chlorate reductase was less sensitive to active chlorine compared to denitrifying reductase the chlorate reducing bacteria could be induced defense mechanism upon exposure of active chlorine atashgahi et al 2018 as for clo 4 it was barely reduced during the whole acclimation period 3 4 2 the effect of available organic carbon it is believed that perchlorate reduction requires more rigorous operating conditions such as sufficient electron donors coates and achenbach 2004 the theoretical cod no 3 n cod clo 4 cl and cod clo 3 cl values were 2 86 1 8 and 1 35 for their own reduction the degradable cod no 3 n clo 3 cl clo 4 cl ratios to 4 9 3 9 and 2 7 were investigated in both reactors fig 4b denitrification chlorate and perchlorate reduction could simultaneously occur under the conditions of sufficient electron donor supply xu et al 2003 the tn clo 3 and clo 4 removal efficiencies of both reactors exceeded 90 at bod5 no 3 n clo 3 cl clo 4 cl 4 9 even though sbr i was chronically influenced by active chlorine sufficient carbon source could compensate for such deficiency as a result sbr i achieved a higher tn removal than before however the perchlorate reduction dramatically deteriorated when insufficient carbon source was supplied perchlorate removal rate dropped to 3 3 13 and 0 1 7 at bod5 no 3 n clo 3 cl clo 4 cl was 3 9 and 2 7 respectively perchlorate reductase seemed to be less competitive with denitrifying and chlorate reductases for electron donor bardiya and bae 2011 proved that perchlorate reduction was significantly delayed when it encountered nitrate under the conditions of relatively insufficient electron donor supply e g bod5 no 3 n clo 3 cl clo 4 cl 2 7 tn and clo 3 removal rates were 66 4 4 9 and 44 5 5 in sbr i and 39 6 7 5 and 100 in sbr ii sbr i prioritized denitrification while sbr ii utilized chlorate in priority it is widely believed that bacteria utilize nitrate in preference to chlorate coates and achenbach 2004 however there existed an exception in our study according to the operating conditions we speculated that chlorate reducing bacteria had a higher competition for carbon source in sbr ii but denitrification outcompeted chlorate reduction by dual influence of active chlorine shock and insufficient electron supply in sbr i it concluded that sufficient electron donors favored the removals of toxic chlorinated byproducts some perchlorate reducing and chlorate reducing enzyme have high substrate affinities nam et al 2016 which means the bacteria could utilize relatively low concentrations of substrate clo 4 and clo 3 in this study under sufficient electron donor conditions clo 4 and clo 3 concentrations in the effluent were below the detection limits 5 Âµg l 1 for chlorate and 32 Âµg l 1 for perchlorate far from their health advisory levels therefore addition of electron donors for clo 4 and clo 3 reduction appears to hold promise as a bioremediation technology 3 4 3 the evolutions of nitrate chlorate and perchlorate during one cycle of operation we conducted an assay to trace the evolutions of target pollutants in sbr i and sbr ii throughout one operational cycle fig 4c for sbr i the ultimate no 3 and clo 3 removal efficiencies were 95 9 and 39 9 respectively the nitrate utilization rate 0 97 mg n g 1 mlss h 1 was higher than that of clo 3 0 39 mg cl g 1 mlss h 1 clo 4 concentration almost maintained stable in the whole period no 3 existence delayed the clo 3 and clo 4 reduction due to competition for common electron donor particularly when the electron donor was insufficient stein et al 2022 the reason for a preferential utilization of no 3 over clo 4 was a lower energy barriers of electron transfer for no 3 based on density functional theory calculation lv et al 2020 for sbr ii clo 3 0 67 mg cl g 1 mlss h 1 was more rapidly reduced than no 3 0 4 mg n g 1 mlss h 1 the clo 4 was about to diminish until the clo 3 was completely eliminated it suggested that the preferred electron acceptor was clo 3 rather than no 3 with regards to the specific microbial community in sbr ii some chlorate reducing bacteria could not reduce no 3 lv et al 2020 and clo 4 atashgahi et al 2018 compared to clo 4 reduction the clo 3 conversion proceeded more efficiently clo 4 reduction was even completely inhibited when clo 3 existed nam et al 2016 in light of the metabolic complexity exceptions exist xiao and roberts 2013 a preferential utilization of clo 3 over no 3 occurred in sbr ii we do not know the trigger timing and underlying microbial mechanism correlative studies need to be in process 3 5 changes in the microbial communities sequencing may answer the differences of operating performances between sbrs as shown in table s3 seeding sludge had the richest out number and changes of diversity indices showed that sbr i at day 31 had the lowest diversity it confirmed that active chlorine was detrimental to bacteria with only some endurable consortium survival when the reactors were fed with sufficient carbon source day 90 the bacteria restored and diversity increased active chlorine and organics addition have significant impacts on microbial community composition at the phylum level fig s8 proteobacteria was absolutely dominant 97 2 in the activated sludge sample when sbr i was exposed to active chlorine of 40 mg cl l 1 bacteria belonging to phylum proteobacteria may most endure the active chlorine shock bacteroides was the second most abundant phylum and other bacteria had little tolerance to active chlorine almost all dissimilatory perchlorate reducing bacteria isolated from diverse habitats have been proved to belong to phylum proteobacteria bardiya and bae 2011 meanwhile denitrifying bacteria have also been classified into proteobacteria wang et al 2018 accordingly sbr i gradually possessed the ability of simultaneous utilization of no 3 and clo 3 under the active chlorine shock by contrast high concentration of organic matter reintroduced bacteria to the reactors alternatively some heterotrophic microorganism revived under the conditions of sufficient carbon source and relatively low strength active chlorine but they still accounted for a small proportion of the total bacteria to identify notable compositional changes in different phases inter group differences at genus level were analyzed fig 5 pseudomonas was most enriched when the reactor was exposed to active chlorine pseudomonas was recognized as a denitrifying bacteria it was also reported that chlorate reductase and chlorite dismutase could be induced in pseudomonas xu et al 2004 so it may achieve chlorate reducing capability in this study pseudomonas was the most dominant species in sbr i accounting for 69 1 of the total bacteria accordingly there is a reason to believe that pseudomonas is an active chlorine tolerant chlorate reducing bacteria in the control reactor of sbr ii zoogloea flavobacterium thauera and pseudoxanthomonas became dominant besides pseudomonas they were all recognized as denitrifiers mao et al 2022 and some of them thauera and zoogloea were reported to have the capacity of perchlorate reduction li et al 2019 wan et al 2019 perchlorate reducing bacteria are ubiquitous and mostly have a wide range of metabolic capacities ye et al 2012 such as chlorate reducing ability thus their presence may be responsible to significant chlorate reduction in both sbrs under the conditions of sufficient carbon source supply the removal efficiencies of no 3 clo 3 and clo 4 exceeded over 90 at this point thauera outcompeted with other genus and became the most dominant wan et al 2019 pointed out that thauera may have the ability to simultaneously reduce nitrate and perchlorate moreover the aforementioned denitrifiers retained their ascendancy in this phase fig s9 and these nitrate reducing strains may also conduct perchlorate reduction xiao and roberts 2013 it was notable that dechloromonas started to enrich in this phase which is well recognized as the perchlorate reducing bacteria coates and achenbach 2004 to sum up the succession of microbial composition suggested the capacity of simultaneous no 3 and clo 3 and clo 4 reduction consistent with the experimental phenomenon 4 conclusions biotoxicity by the produced active chlorine and health risk by the produced clo 3 and clo 4 are the two main bottlenecks that limit the application of eao technology to actual wastewater measures could be taken to solve the problems active chlorine could spontaneously decompose to acceptable level so an intermediate tank with an appropriate hrt is suggested to set between eao equipment and secondary bioreactor the active chlorine tolerant consortium could be acclimated in the secondary bioreactor achieving the goal of simultaneous no 3 clo 3 and clo 4 reduction especially under sufficient electron donor conditions clo 3 and clo 4 could be completely reduced far from their health advisory levels accordingly eao is feasible for high chloride wastewater treatment the dominant bacteria interspecies relation and community succession responsible to no 3 clo 3 and clo 4 reduction in wastewater treatment are

electrochemical advanced oxidation process eaop is recommended for high strength refractory organics wastewater treatment but the accompanying chlorinated byproduct generation becomes a bottleneck that limits the application of this technology to actual wastewater in this study we applied eaop 0 4 40 ma cm 2 to treat ultrafiltration effluent of an actual landfill leachate and quantitatively assessed the toxicities of the dominant chlorinated byproducts in eaop treated effluent considering both toxic effect and dose it followed the order active chlorine chlorate perchlorate organochlorines the toxic active chlorine could spontaneously decompose by settling and secondary bioreactor originally serving for denitrification could be used to reduce perchlorate and chlorate the effects of residual active chlorine and extra carbon addition on simultaneous denitrification perchlorate and chlorate reduction were investigated it seemed that 20 mg of active chlorine was an acceptable level to bioactivity and sufficient electron donors favored the removal of chlorate and perchlorate pseudomonas was identified as an active chlorine tolerant chlorate reducing bacteria and thauera was responsible for perchlorate reduction under the conditions of sufficient carbon source supply our results confirmed that the perchlorate and chlorate concentrations in the effluent below their health advisory levels were achievable solving the issue of toxic chlorinated byproduct generation during eaop this study provided a solution to realistic application of eaop to treat high chloride wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrochemical advanced oxidation process generation of chlorinated byproducts toxicity assessment chlorate and perchlorate reduction dominant species 1 introduction industrial wastewater such as landfill leachate is usually characterized with high strength refractory organic substances ammonium and chloride ion renou et al 2008 the degradable organic matter and nitrogen species could be removed by cost efficient biological process in advance and subsequently electrochemical advanced oxidation process eaop is widely recommended as post treatment for the remaining bio refractory contaminants in wastewater as expected refractory organic compounds are either completely mineralized or converted into bio degradable ones via direct or indirect electro oxidation during eaop however it usually accompanies with the undesirable chlorinated byproduct generation if the wastewater contains a large amount of chloride martÃ­nez huitle et al 2015 it is because that the redox potential for chlorine gas cl2 c l e0 1 36 v hypochlorous acid hclo c l e0 1 49 v chlorite clo 2 c l e0 0 89 v chlorate clo 3 c l e0 1 03 v perchlorate clo 4 c l e0 1 287 v and organochlorine are lower than the hydroxyl radical oh e0 2 67 v sulfate radical so 4 e0 2 6 v chlorine radical cl e0 2 4 v etc accordingly the inorganic or organic chlorinated byproducts are inevitably produced during eaop ike et al 2019 as previous studies reported anode materials current density velocity and chloride ion concentration all affected the chlorinated byproduct generation anglada et al 2011 donaghue and chaplin 2013 polcaro et al 2008 shen et al 2020 yao et al 2019 for example boron doped diamond bdd anode produced more perchlorate compared to metal oxides due to high electrocatalytic activity of bdd polcaro et al 2008 high current densities and low flow rates were conductive to increase the formation of chlorate and perchlorate donaghue and chaplin 2013 and more organochlorine was produced as the chloride ion concentration increased anglada et al 2011 moreover a chemically modified cathode vigorously produced h2o2 that quenched of active chlorine resulting in a significant reduction in chlorinated byproduct formation yao et al 2019 some cathodes with strong reduction capacity could conduct dechlorination and favored the reduction of organic chlorinated byproducts shen et al 2020 these chlorinated byproducts are suspected carcinogens and mutagens radjenovic and sedlak 2015 u s environmental protection agency gives the advisory values for chlorate and perchlorate of 210 and 56 Âµg l 1 to protect human health and the regulating values for trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas are set at 80 and 60 Âµg l 1 for ambient water the limit of chlorate is 30 mg l 1 in water quality guidelines of british columbia canada warrington 2002 and water quality guidelines limit trichloromethane of 1 8 Âµg l 1 for the protection of aquatic life by the canadian council of ministers of the environment unfortunately the reported concentrations of these concerned chemicals in the eaop effluent achieving as much as 2141 0 mg l 1 for chlorate and 252 6 mg l 1 for perchlorate extremely exceeded the aforementioned limits feng et al 2021 the prevalence of these chlorinated byproducts in the eaop treated effluent may cause a health or ecological risk to the receiving water body accordingly formation of chlorinated byproducts may compromise the quality of the eaop treated effluent radjenovic and sedlak 2015 it is identified as an issue by applying eaop to high chloride wastewater treatment researchers explored many ways to solve this problem one is to inhibit the formation of the chlorinated byproducts for example chlorine radical was selectively generated by newly fabricating wo3 bivo4 electrode to eliminate the target contaminants and control the chlorate generation as well fang et al 2020 in another free chlorine uv photolysis system chlorine radical was 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than hydroxyl radical resulting in less chlorate produced zhao et al 2021 mass transfer enhancement and shortening hydraulic retention time hrt in reactive electrochemical membranes could also prevent a large amount of chlorinated byproduct generation lin et al 2021 another way is to effectively remove the formed byproducts a range of techniques has been explored such as sorption ion exchange membrane filtration and microbial reduction radjenovic and sedlak 2015 hu et al 2021 among these microbial reduction has been used for per chlorate contaminated groundwater treatment which was extensively studied in terms of reactor type inoculum carbon source substrate concentration etc lai et al 2021 xu et al 2003 notably the industrial wastewater with the characteristics of high refractory organic substances and salinity is more complex compared to groundwater as expected higher concentrations of chlorate and perchlorate would be formed when high chloride wastewater is treated by eaop and nitrate as a competing electron acceptor is usually present alongside with chlorate and perchlorate in the eaop effluent therefore studies on per chlorate reduction in groundwater could be a reference but not a guideline for per chlorate reduction in industrial wastewater systematic investigations with respect to the treatment of eaop treated effluent has not been reported before moreover the effect of the chlorinated byproducts such as active chlorine and organochlorine on the microbial reduction is also seldom studied their toxicity to the subsequent biological treatment is still not clear in this study the ultrafiltration effluent of a landfill leachate treatment system was treated using eaop firstly the evolutions of cod nitrogen n species and chloride cl species were investigated for various current densities secondly the toxicological effect of the eaop treated effluent and individual and combined chlorinated byproducts were systematically evaluated finally the long term operation of the secondary biological reactor was conducted to perform simultaneous nitrate chlorate and perchlorate reduction and the dominant species responsible for contaminant removal was illuminated this work may address the questions of application of eaop to treat high chloride wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 electrochemical advanced oxidation eao for ultrafiltration effluent treatment the ultrafiltration effluent was obtained from the leachate treatment system of a closed municipal solid waste landfill in xiamen city fujian province china the leachate was first treated using anoxic aerobic process and then ultrafiltration membrane separation the main physicochemical characteristics of the ultrafiltration effluent are presented in table s1 the ultrafiltration effluent contained approximately 250 mg l 1 of cod and 100 mg l 1 of total nitrogen tn with a low biodegradability eaops are proposed as mediate treatment for biodegradability enhancement of ultrafiltration effluent in our previous study feng et al 2021 following by a secondary biological reactor to further remove degradable organic matter and nitrogen simultaneously a flow by electrode setup fig s1 was used to conduct the eao experiments a commercial bdd neocoat sa switzerland electrode was used as an anode and a stainless steel electrode was a cathode with a surface area of 50 cm2 each the electrode gap was set at 0 5 cm 400 ml of the ultrafiltration effluent continuously recirculated through the reactor by the peristaltic pump with a flow rate of 50 l h 1 under the hydraulic conditions the limiting current density j lim for the target ultrafiltration effluent treatment was calculated at 2 65 ma cm 2 according to our previous study feng et al 2021 the applied current densities j appl 0 4 1 5 10 40 ma cm 2 either higher or lower than jlim were selected to investigate the operating performances the end point of each run was the time at which the effluent cod was approximately 100 mg l 1 the evolution of cl species during eaops were detected active chlorine refers to a sum of chlorine hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite cl o and the dominant ingredient of active chlorine depends on liquid ph martÃ­nez huitle et al 2015 moreira et al 2017 active chlorine was determined by the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd colorimetry pcii hach usa the contents of c l clo 2 clo 3 and clo 4 were determined by ion chromatograph ics 3000 dionex sunnyvale ca equipped with

byproducts 2 2 1 acute toxicity test with vibrio fischeri the freeze dried vibrio fischeri was purchased from j q environmental technologies co ltd beijing china the bacteria need to be recovered by resuscitation fluid before use then 1 ml of the bacterial fluid was added into 10 Âµl of the samples for 15 min at 22 c in a 96 well plate the toxicities of the samples blank control and negative control 2 nacl solution were evaluated based on the changes in luminescence intensity by multimode microplate reader spark 10m tecan switzerland the inhibition rates were calculated according to the iso 11348 3 2007 standard method all tests were carried out in triplicate 2 2 2 nitrate uptake rate nur tests the eaop treated effluent was used for nur test to evaluate the potential toxicity to denitrifying activity a total volume of 60 ml of the eaop treated effluent and the activated sludge were added in a 100 ml flask the seeding sludge was obtained from the anoxic tank of the forementioned actual leachate treatment system the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss was 4500 mg l 1 bod5 no 3 n ratio was adjusted to 6 by adding extra acetic acid to ensure excessive carbon source for denitrification the anaerobic conditions were created by sparging n2 for 5 min and the flask was sealed with butyl rubber stopper and aluminum cap all the batch tests were performed in a shaker at a speed of 150 rpm for 6 h the water samples were harvested at 0 1 2 4 and 6 h for nitrite and nitrate analysis the denitrification rate vdn eqs 2 and 3 was calculated as described by zhang et al 2016

combined toxicities of the chlorinated byproducts the chlorinated byproducts mainly refer to active chlorine chlorate perchlorate and organochlorine in our study active chlorine mainly refers to hypochlorite due to the alkaline ph 7 5 8 5 in our system trichloromethane chcl3 and dichloroacetic acid c2h2cl2o2 were two typical compounds of thms and haas which were generated during eaops bagastyo et al 2012 and therefore were selected as the representative organochlorine byproducts in this study different dosages of the chlorinated byproducts were individually or jointly added for nur tests the concentrations of individual and mixing chemicals are shown in table 1 as for combined toxicity evaluation the selected experimental concentrations were similar to those chlorinated byproducts generated under different current densities three dose response models log logistic weibull 1 and weibull 2 ritz 2010 were applied to describe the inhibitory effect on denitrification the specific concentration causing a 50 reduction in denitrification rates ic50 could be obtained by fitting the models with r package drc version 3 0 1 ritz and streibig 2005 the optimization model was determined by the akaike information criterion aic value and the standard error of the models golding et al 2022 moreover toxic unit tu and mixture toxicity index mti were adopted to assess the combined inhibition as described by lin et al 2020 eqs 4 7 we determined the types of combined toxicity according to m m 0 and mti value table 2 awoyemi et al 2020 4 t u i c i i c 50 i 5 m i 1 n t u i

secondary biological treatment sequential batch reactor sbr was used for secondary biological treatment to further degrade organics and n species accompanying with the undesirable per chlorate removal the ultrafiltration effluent was first treated by eao under the conditions of 10 ma cm 2 for 75 min during which a substantial amount of the toxic active chlorine was generated the active chlorine could spontaneously decompose by settlement as shown in table 3 a step wise decrease in active chlorine from 90 to 20 mg l 1 was introduced to sbr i to investigate the effect of active chlorine on long term operating performances while the eaop treated effluent with trace active chlorine 1 mg cl l 1 was fed into sbr ii as a control phase i the working volume of the paralleled sbrs was 1 2 l half volume of the liquid was discharged and refilled every 6 hours so the hrt was 12 h bod5 no 3 n clo 3 cl clo 4 cl ratio in the influent was adjusted to 3 6 by adding extra acetic acid the dissolved oxygen was kept below 0 5 mg l 1 the mlss was maintained at approximately 4000 mg l 1 at phase ii the effect of organic carbon degradable cod no 3 n clo 3 cl clo 4 cl 4 9 3 9 and 2 7 in the influent on the operating performances was also investigated the hrt was extended to 24 h for complete biological reactions 2 4 high through sequencing and analysis the seeding sludge was sampled as well as the acclimated sludge at day 31 and day 90 when the reactors were exposed to the active chlorine of 40 mg cl l 1 and sufficient electron donor of bod5 no 3 n clo 3 cl clo 4 cl ratio of 4 9 respectively total dna was extracted using the fast dna spin kit mp usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the dna concentration and quality were measured using a nanodrop spectrophotometer

performed by majorbio i sanger cloud platform www i sanger com fisher exact test was adopted for the significance of differences between samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 the evolution of cl species in leachate during eaops eaops mainly aims to degrade cod and enhance the biodegradability cod degradation fitted pseudo first order kinetic and the biodegradability increased from the initial b c ratio of 0 24 to the range of 0 42 0 85 under different applied current densities fig s2 meanwhile the residual ammonium in the ultrafiltration effluent was mostly converted to nitrate with a minor part lost in the form of nitrogen gas fig s3 the more detailed information is shown in text s3 in this study we more concerned the evolution of cl species during eaops the total c l concentration in the ultrafiltration effluent of landfill leachate was approximately 1200 mg l 1 table s1 as shown in fig 1 c l was gradually oxidized to high valence active chlorine clo 2 clo 3 and clo 4 as both applied current densities and reaction time increased clo 2 was negligibly detected since it was rapidly oxidized to clo 3 and clo 4 moreira et al 2017 generally the amounts of the generated active chlorine clo 3 and clo 4 were positively correlated to the applied current densities and the passed charge fig s4 however when the same amount of charge was consumed the chlorinated byproduct generation is different with 0 3 0 4 ah l 1 of specific electrical charge low applied current density preferred to produce chlorate while more active chlorine and perchlorate were produced at moderate and high applied current density respectively these results were also indicated by byproduct formation rates fig s4f accordingly active chlorine sharply increased to the range of 151 178 mg cl l 1 at j appl jlim clo 4 concentration increased by 160 times from 0 7 to 111 5 mg cl l 1 when the applied current densities varied from 0 4 to 40 ma cm 2 with the corresponding proportion of clo 4 increasing from 0 1 to 9 1 other study also observed a wide range of chlorinated byproduct generation with the values of 2 1 672 mg cl l 1 for chlorate and 2 9 83 2 mg cl l 1 for perchlorate when a variety of wastewater was treated radjenovic and sedlak 2015 santos et al 2020 the distributions of ce for electro oxidation of cod n and cl species under various current densities are shown in fig 2 theoretically the ce for cod degradation is 100 at jappl jlim martÃ­nez huitle et al 2015 in our case the corresponding ce for cod degradation accounted for 80 6 and 57 0 when the applied current densities were 0 4 and 1 ma cm 2 jlim respectively but the sum of ce for cod n and cl species was almost 100 this indicated that no more charge was served for the other side reactions accordingly we believed that the active chlorine and clo 3 occurring under low current densities was due to the direct oxidation with c l eqs 8 10 as the applied current density increased ce for cod decreased and cl species evolution strengthened the sum of ce for cod n and cl species became far below 100 it suggested that other species significantly reacted with electrode mainly including water indirect oxidation induced by hydroxyl radical played a more important role in electro oxidation at jappl jlim both direct and indirect oxidation contributed to the generation of chlorinated byproducts eqs 11 14 fang et al 2020 martÃ­nez huitle et al 2015 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 especially for clo 4 the valence state of cl in clo 4 is as high as 7 so clo 4 is considered to be strictly evolved from the oxidation of clo 3 at the anode surface radjenovic and sedlak 2015 8 2 c l c l 2 2 e 9 c l 2 h 2 o hclo c l h 10 c l 3 h 2 o clo 3 6 h 6 e 11 c l oh cl o h e 12 cl o oh clo 2 h e 13 clo 2 oh clo 3 h e 14 clo 3 oh clo 4 h e moreover organochlorines may be vigorously generated herein aocl variations generally presented an increasing and subsequently decreasing patterns fig 1f the peak values were 1 0 1 0 1 2 2 0 and 1 5 mg cl l 1 when the applied current densities were 0 4 1 5 10 and 40 ma cm 2 respectively aocl represented a quite small proportion of cl species compared to other chlorinated byproducts the generation of organochlorines during eaops may be attributed to the reaction of hclo or cl o with dissolved organic matter ike et al 2019 a decrease in aocl concentration in the late period of the electrolysis was because of the further mineralization of the produced organochlorines 3 2 toxicity of chlorinated byproducts 3 2 1 eaop treated effluent chlorinated byproducts such as active chlorine clo 3 clo 4 and organochlorines have been reported to be toxic to the environmental microorganisms seibert et al 2020 we used the luminescent bacteria vibrio fischeri to evaluate the acute toxicity of the eaop treated effluents for various current densities fig s5a the results showed that the effluents of higher current densities 10 and 40 ma cm 2 were more toxic than the lower ones 0 4 1 and 5 ma cm 2 and the luminescence inhibition rate intensified as the eaops progressed toxicity test by luminescent bacteria may not be indicative of activated sludge behavior phillips et al 2018 accordingly we assessed the acute toxicity based on nur test fig s5b oller et al 2011 the inital denitrification rate of the ultrafiltration effluent was approximately 4 0 mg n g 1 mlss h 1 the nurs barely changed with time when the current density was set at 0 4 and 1 ma cm 2 however the nurs decreased with the reaction time under the high applied current densities of 5 10 and 40 ma cm 2 with the values of 3 4 0 8 and 0 2 mg n g 1 mlss h 1 at the end of the electrolysis respectively when passing the same amount of charge high applied current density accelerated the reduction of denitrification rate fig s4f both luminescence inhibition rate and nur test confirmed that the eaop treated effluents especially under high current densities were toxic to the microorganisms it can be seen that there were significantly negative correlations between aocl active chlorine clo 3 and clo 4 concentrations and biotoxicity table s2 this indicated that the existences of chlorinated byproducts might dramatically affect the performances of subsequent biological treatment therefore the individual and combined toxicities of the chlorinated byproducts were further investigated 3 2 2 individual toxicity of the chlorinated byproducts microbial toxicity has been proved to increase whatever kind of supporting electrolyte was applied during eaop phillips et al 2018 however the specific toxicities with regards to the generated byproducts of the supporting electrolytes are seldom studied in our study denitrification rates influenced by different dosages of chlorinated byproducts were tested to determine their individual toxicity fig s6 overall the denitrification rate decreased with the increase of the concentrations of cl o clo 3 clo 4 chcl3 and c2h2cl2o2 the curve dropped rapidly when the concentration exceeded a specific threshold value dose respond model is considered as an appropriate method for risk assessment ritz 2010 herein we selected three classes of sigmoidal dose response models to depict effective doses smaller aic indicates a better fit to the data according to the fitting results of the models table 4 and fig s6 weibull 1 was recognized as the optimization model the weibull 1 curves are asymmetric which descend slowly from the upper limit and approach the lower limit rapidly consistent with our experimental results the ic50 of cl o clo 3 clo 4 chcl3 and c2h2cl2o2 were calculated at 0 089 3 5 12 7 1 7 and 2 5 g cl l 1 respectively their inhibitory effect on denitrification activity followed the order cl o chcl3 c2h2cl2o2 clo 3 clo 4 cl o is known as a highly cytotoxic substance gray et al 2013 we recognized cl o the most toxic compound among the produced chlorinated byproducts organic halogenated byproducts were also highly toxic and even more difficultly degraded than their precursors moreira et al 2017 1 0 2 0 mg cl l 1 of the detected aocl was far from the effective dose so their toxicities could be nearly neglected in our study moreover it was reported that clo 3 and clo 4 at milligram or microgram levels were toxic to plants humans and animals bardiya and bae 2011 but our results showed a high tolerance of activated sludge to clo 3 and clo 4 it was probably due to the detoxification of activated sludge via bacterial per chlorate reduction 3 2 3 combined toxicity of the chlorinated byproducts cl o concentration was found to be most influential to microbial activity the combined toxicities of cl o coupled with other chlorinated byproducts were further investigated table 4 and fig s7 the changing patterns of denitrification rates serving for combined toxicity evaluation were similar to those of individual toxicity the curves declined gradually at first and dropped dramatically after the knee points the ic50 values were harvested from the fitting models then tu m m0 and mti were calculated table 5 and the types of combined toxicity were identified table 2 the combined effects of cl o clo 3 cl o clo 4 and cl o clo 3 clo 4 cl o chcl3 cl o c2h2cl2o2 and cl o chcl3 c2h2cl2o2 on microbial activity were identified as synergism the mti value was reported to be positive with synergistic effect zheng et al 2021 according to our results cl o exerted a huge impact on the toxicities of other chlorinated byproducts in the mixture which were in the order clo 4 93 4 c2h2cl2o2 81 2 chcl3 13 3 clo 3 1 43 complementary actions anti counteractive actions and facilitating actions may all contribute to synergistic effect jia et al 2009 the results suggested that the simultaneous appearances of inorganic and or organic chlorinated byproducts in eaop treated effluent aggravated the inhibition on denitrification the direct discharge of eaop treated wastewater with a mixture of chlorinated byproducts may cause a higher toxicity to the receiving aquatic life 3 3 minimizing the impact of toxic active chlorine on subsequent biological process according to the individual and combined toxicity assessments the active chlorine was identified to be most influential to denitrifying bacterial activity the active chlorine in the eaop treated effluent mainly in a form of cl o especially under the high current density conditions can pose a threat to the biological process by contrast relatively low concentrations of chlorate perchlorate and organochlorines had no significant effects on activated sludge therefore eliminating active chlorine should be given priority to before the eaop treated effluent entered the subsequent biological reactor fortunately the active chlorine could be spontaneously decomposed by settling fig 3 the concentration of active chlorine dropped dramatically at first and then leveled off gradually based on it an intermediate tank was set between the eao equipment and the secondary biological reactor it was reported that the denitrification rate of 2 1 mg n g 1 mlss h 1 was considered as the threshold value of bacterial tolerance to the toxic compound lin et al 2020 accordingly the corresponding active chlorine concentration was approximately 90 mg cl l 1 fig s6a according to the active chlorine degradation curve the hrt of the intermediate tank was set at 9 h to achieve 90 mg cl l 1 of active chlorine and lessen its toxicity to the activated sludge in the subsequent biological reactor 3 4 the factors affecting simultaneous reduction of nitrate chlorate and perchlorate 3 4 1 long term operation under the active chlorine shock conditions the average cod b c ratio tn cl o clo 3 and clo 4 of the eaop treated effluent were approximately 122 7 mg l 1 0 6 99 6 mg l 1 130 0 mg cl l 1 66 8 mg cl l 1 and 39 3 mg cl l 1 respectively the effect of active chlorine dosage on simultaneous denitrification and per chlorate reduction was shown in fig 4 a the tn removal rate of the control reactor sbr ii was averagely 91 when the active chlorine in the influent was below 1 mg cl l 1 by contrast the tn removal rate dropped dramatically within two days when sbr i was exposed to the active chlorine of 90 mg cl l 1 and the nitrite was immediately accumulated with tn in the effluent quickly raising up to 96 2 mg l 1 from 6 8 mg l 1 it indicated that the denitrifying activity was severely inhibited the results were inconsistent with the acute toxicity assessment which showed that the activated sludge could reserve the denitrifying activity of 2 1 mg n g 1 mlss h 1 when the active chlorine came to 90 mg cl l 1 the differences were probably due to the acute and long term effect of active chlorine on activated sludge the microorganism could not endure the long term shock of active chlorine as much as 90 mg cl l 1 it took nearly one week to recover the denitrifying activity afterwards we adopted a step wise decrease in active chlorine to figure out the threshold value that microorganism could endure when the active chlorine was 45 and 40 mg cl l 1 the system deteriorated again extending the acclimation time to 14 24 hrts could not improve the operating performances then the active chlorine was further decreased to 35 30 and 20 mg cl l 1 tn removal gradually improved to 58 7 72 6 and 78 3 averagely there existed 12 7 difference of tn removal between sbr ii and sbr i being exposed to 20 mg cl l 1 of active chlorine it indicated that active chlorine more or less affected denitrification if the influent contained the undesirable active chlorine clo 3 reduction lagged behind the nitrogen removal in the initial and gradually reached an almost complete removal xu et al 2003 apart from this clo 3 reduction presented a similar changing pattern with tn removal over active chlorine it was noted that the clo 3 removal efficiency was even higher than that of tn removal under the same active chlorine shock the clo 3 removal efficiency in sbr i caught up with sbr ii when the active chlorine in the influent was decreased to 35 mg cl l 1 accordingly it seemed that chlorate reductase was less sensitive to active chlorine compared to denitrifying reductase the chlorate reducing bacteria could be induced defense mechanism upon exposure of active chlorine atashgahi et al 2018 as for clo 4 it was barely reduced during the whole acclimation period 3 4 2 the effect of available organic carbon it is believed that perchlorate reduction requires more rigorous operating conditions such as sufficient electron donors coates and achenbach 2004 the theoretical cod no 3 n cod clo 4 cl and cod clo 3 cl values were 2 86 1 8 and 1 35 for their own reduction the degradable cod no 3 n clo 3 cl clo 4 cl ratios to 4 9 3 9 and 2 7 were investigated in both reactors fig 4b denitrification chlorate and perchlorate reduction could simultaneously occur under the conditions of sufficient electron donor supply xu et al 2003 the tn clo 3 and clo 4 removal efficiencies of both reactors exceeded 90 at bod5 no 3 n clo 3 cl clo 4 cl 4 9 even though sbr i was chronically influenced by active chlorine sufficient carbon source could compensate for such deficiency as a result sbr i achieved a higher tn removal than before however the perchlorate reduction dramatically deteriorated when insufficient carbon source was supplied perchlorate removal rate dropped to 3 3 13 and 0 1 7 at bod5 no 3 n clo 3 cl clo 4 cl was 3 9 and 2 7 respectively perchlorate reductase seemed to be less competitive with denitrifying and chlorate reductases for electron donor bardiya and bae 2011 proved that perchlorate reduction was significantly delayed when it encountered nitrate under the conditions of relatively insufficient electron donor supply e g bod5 no 3 n clo 3 cl clo 4 cl 2 7 tn and clo 3 removal rates were 66 4 4 9 and 44 5 5 in sbr i and 39 6 7 5 and 100 in sbr ii sbr i prioritized denitrification while sbr ii utilized chlorate in priority it is widely believed that bacteria utilize nitrate in preference to chlorate coates and achenbach 2004 however there existed an exception in our study according to the operating conditions we speculated that chlorate reducing bacteria had a higher competition for carbon source in sbr ii but denitrification outcompeted chlorate reduction by dual influence of active chlorine shock and insufficient electron supply in sbr i it concluded that sufficient electron donors favored the removals of toxic chlorinated byproducts some perchlorate reducing and chlorate reducing enzyme have high substrate affinities nam et al 2016 which means the bacteria could utilize relatively low concentrations of substrate clo 4 and clo 3 in this study under sufficient electron donor conditions clo 4 and clo 3 concentrations in the effluent were below the detection limits 5 Âµg l 1 for chlorate and 32 Âµg l 1 for perchlorate far from their health advisory levels therefore addition of electron donors for clo 4 and clo 3 reduction appears to hold promise as a bioremediation technology 3 4 3 the evolutions of nitrate chlorate and perchlorate during one cycle of operation we conducted an assay to trace the evolutions of target pollutants in sbr i and sbr ii throughout one operational cycle fig 4c for sbr i the ultimate no 3 and clo 3 removal efficiencies were 95 9 and 39 9 respectively the nitrate utilization rate 0 97 mg n g 1 mlss h 1 was higher than that of clo 3 0 39 mg cl g 1 mlss h 1 clo 4 concentration almost maintained stable in the whole period no 3 existence delayed the clo 3 and clo 4 reduction due to competition for common electron donor particularly when the electron donor was insufficient stein et al 2022 the reason for a preferential utilization of no 3 over clo 4 was a lower energy barriers of electron transfer for no 3 based on density functional theory calculation lv et al 2020 for sbr ii clo 3 0 67 mg cl g 1 mlss h 1 was more rapidly reduced than no 3 0 4 mg n g 1 mlss h 1 the clo 4 was about to diminish until the clo 3 was completely eliminated it suggested that the preferred electron acceptor was clo 3 rather than no 3 with regards to the specific microbial community in sbr ii some chlorate reducing bacteria could not reduce no 3 lv et al 2020 and clo 4 atashgahi et al 2018 compared to clo 4 reduction the clo 3 conversion proceeded more efficiently clo 4 reduction was even completely inhibited when clo 3 existed nam et al 2016 in light of the metabolic complexity exceptions exist xiao and roberts 2013 a preferential utilization of clo 3 over no 3 occurred in sbr ii we do not know the trigger timing and underlying microbial mechanism correlative studies need to be in process 3 5 changes in the microbial communities sequencing may answer the differences of operating performances between sbrs as shown in table s3 seeding sludge had the richest out number and changes of diversity indices showed that sbr i at day 31 had the lowest diversity it confirmed that active chlorine was detrimental to bacteria with only some endurable consortium survival when the reactors were fed with sufficient carbon source day 90 the bacteria restored and diversity increased active chlorine and organics addition have significant impacts on microbial community composition at the phylum level fig s8 proteobacteria was absolutely dominant 97 2 in the activated sludge sample when sbr i was exposed to active chlorine of 40 mg cl l 1 bacteria belonging to phylum proteobacteria may most endure the active chlorine shock bacteroides was the second most abundant phylum and other bacteria had little tolerance to active chlorine almost all dissimilatory perchlorate reducing bacteria isolated from diverse habitats have been proved to belong to phylum proteobacteria bardiya and bae 2011 meanwhile denitrifying bacteria have also been classified into proteobacteria wang et al 2018 accordingly sbr i gradually possessed the ability of simultaneous utilization of no 3 and clo 3 under the active chlorine shock by contrast high concentration of organic matter reintroduced bacteria to the reactors alternatively some heterotrophic microorganism revived under the conditions of sufficient carbon source and relatively low strength active chlorine but they still accounted for a small proportion of the total bacteria to identify notable compositional changes in different phases inter group differences at genus level were analyzed fig 5 pseudomonas was most enriched when the reactor was exposed to active chlorine pseudomonas was recognized as a denitrifying bacteria it was also reported that chlorate reductase and chlorite dismutase could be induced in pseudomonas xu et al 2004 so it may achieve chlorate reducing capability in this study pseudomonas was the most dominant species in sbr i accounting for 69 1 of the total bacteria accordingly there is a reason to believe that pseudomonas is an active chlorine tolerant chlorate reducing bacteria in the control reactor of sbr ii zoogloea flavobacterium thauera and pseudoxanthomonas became dominant besides pseudomonas they were all recognized as denitrifiers mao et al 2022 and some of them thauera and zoogloea were reported to have the capacity of perchlorate reduction li et al 2019 wan et al 2019 perchlorate reducing bacteria are ubiquitous and mostly have a wide range of metabolic capacities ye et al 2012 such as chlorate reducing ability thus their presence may be responsible to significant chlorate reduction in both sbrs under the conditions of sufficient carbon source supply the removal efficiencies of no 3 clo 3 and clo 4 exceeded over 90 at this point thauera outcompeted with other genus and became the most dominant wan et al 2019 pointed out that thauera may have the ability to simultaneously reduce nitrate and perchlorate moreover the aforementioned denitrifiers retained their ascendancy in this phase fig s9 and these nitrate reducing strains may also conduct perchlorate reduction xiao and roberts 2013 it was notable that dechloromonas started to enrich in this phase which is well recognized as the perchlorate reducing bacteria coates and achenbach 2004 to sum up the succession of microbial composition suggested the capacity of simultaneous no 3 and clo 3 and clo 4 reduction consistent with the experimental phenomenon 4 conclusions biotoxicity by the produced active chlorine and health risk by the produced clo 3 and clo 4 are the two main bottlenecks that limit the application of eao technology to actual wastewater measures could be taken to solve the problems active chlorine could spontaneously decompose to acceptable level so an intermediate tank with an appropriate hrt is suggested to set between eao equipment and secondary bioreactor the active chlorine tolerant consortium could be acclimated in the secondary bioreactor achieving the goal of simultaneous no 3 clo 3 and clo 4 reduction especially under sufficient electron donor conditions clo 3 and clo 4 could be completely reduced far from their health advisory levels accordingly eao is feasible for high chloride wastewater treatment the dominant bacteria interspecies relation and community succession responsible to no 3 clo 3 and clo 4 reduction in wastewater treatment are

15138,production of medium chain carboxylic acids mccas by chain elongation ce presents a competitive alternative to conventional products of methane in anaerobic digestion treating organic waste streams considering energy recovery economic and environmental profits however the system stability and performance largely rely on the selective suppression of methanogens while stimulation of ce bacteria commercial inhibitors such as 2 bromoethanesulfonic sodium bes was shown to be effective but controversial conclusions exist on its inhibition characteristics and the inhibition mechanism remains unclear therefore this study systematically investigated the responses of methanogenesis in granular sludge to various bes levels focusing on methane production methanogenic pathway dynamic populations electron transport and energy metabolism results showed that compared with the control 3 0 g l bes was sufficient to induce a 72 9 reduced level on accumulative methane production by the end of 4 cycles 28 days which was likely to be attributed to the significantly suppressed metabolic pathways and intracellular regulations specifically bes suppressed the electron transport via unproper electron carriers and reduced electron amount as indicated by the decreased level of enzymes and genes involved such as coenzyme f420 co dehydrogenase and nadh ubiquinone reductase h translocating moreover bes regulated the intracellular energy metabolism leading to the impeded atp synthesis but enhanced atp consumption as evidenced by the variations on the activity or abundance of acetate kinase a1ao atp synthase nitrogenase and atp citrate synthase additionally bes enriched hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis over acetoclastic one as supported by variations on the archaeal community structures and regulations of differentially expressed genes involved moreover bes also reduced the contents of both protein and carbohydrate in extracellular polymeric substances eps this study is expected to enhance understanding of bes contribution to methanogenesis inhibition but mccas production in ce bioreactors graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion 2 bromoethanesulfonic sodium chain elongation methanogenesis enzyme data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad has been widely used for bioconversion of organic wastewater into renewable energy in the form of ch4 and short chain carboxylic acids scca with four or fewer carbons recently however most ad systems are considered to get less net present value by selling electricity as an example due to the relatively low energy density of methane and the energy intensive separation process for scca other anaerobic products such as h2 are safer and cleaner fuels with higher combustion heat value which are therefore considered as more valuable but costly alternative energy sources wang and yin 2017 comparatively medium chain carboxylic acids mccas e g butyrate caproic and caprylic acids possess relatively higher energy density and present greater market potentials as precursors of spices renewable fuels fungicides and food additives ge et al 2015 wang and yin 2022 therefore attention has been shifted to the selective production of mccas through carbon chain elongation ce via a reverse Î² oxidation pathway in the carboxylate platform agler et al 2014 candry et al 2020 xu et al 2015 in the mixed culture ce bioreactors for mccas two types of functional microorganisms are primarily involved namely methanogens and ce bacteria which hold different physiological characteristics both bacteria coexist in system as mutual competitors with the observation that methanogens negatively influenced the mcca yield and ce efficiency agler et al 2011 shi et al 2022 this was supported by the enhanced mccas production after methanogenesis inhibition ntagia et al 2021 in this regard the supplementation of inhibitors into ce bioreactors was shown to be one of feasible strategies for selective methanogens inhibition depending on their different physiological and community dynamic responses to the inhibitors chen et al 2021 steinbusch et al 2009 viana et al 2019 among the inhibitors 5 mm 2 bromoethanesulfonic sodium bes was demonstrated to be effective for the selective inhibition purpose in various types bioreactors such as sequencing batch reactors sbr bioelectrochemical reactors and expanded granular sludge bed cheng et al 2022 jourdin et al 2018 liu et al 2017 steinbusch et al 2011 wu et al 2020 for example allaart et al 2021 successfully achieved methanogenesis inhibition and stabilized the formation of butyrate and caproate with bes supplementation as a specialized inhibitor of methanogens bes could also provide remedial measures when ce reactors in engineering application are not stable without affecting the normal activities of ce bacteria which is generally superior to other methanogenic inhibitors however controversial conclusions exist on the bes based methanogenesis inhibition performance such as the sensitivity of methanogens in some studies only the negative response of acetoclastic methanogenesis was focused on to bes considering that acetoclastic pathway tended to be the dominant one sancho navarro et al 2016 while the pure hydrogenotrophic cultures were applied to obtain the excellent bes induced reduction of h2 and co2 consumption rates logroÃ±o et al 2022 additionally another report was found that both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens were both suppressed with the increasing bes levels ying et al 2018 and hydrogenotrophic methanogens might be less sensitive to bes than acetoclastic ones zinder et al 1984 therefore compared with other inhibitors e g chloroform and fatty acids which might suppress methanogens while simultaneously have certain effects on ce bacteria tan et al 2016 xu et al 2010 webster et al 2016 bes as a specific inhibitor of methanogens requires further investigations on its effects on both types of methanogens it also remains unclear how the bes specifically inhibits the methanogenesis process in terms of the methanogen metabolism and community structure for example multiple enzymes are essentially involved in the methanogenic metabolic pathway however the bes inhibition mechanism with respect to enzyme activity level and the abundance of genes encoding functional enzymes in microbes as well as their features regarding to electron transport system and energy metabolism are still obscure for example v type atpase a typical electrogenic h pump might contribute to the adaptation to stressful growth conditions such as salinity drought cold and excess heavy metals dietz et al 2001 however the bes impact on v type atpase and its regulation on bes stress still remain unclear it should also be noted that in most of the previous studies the determination of the bes effect on hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens were mainly based on the consumption or accumulation of h2 co2 and acetate as such it is lacking direct evidence of variations on microbial dynamic structures of both methanogens in response to bes considering that microbial community could self adjust to external environments the main objective of this study was to systematically investigate the concentration dependent bes effects on methanogenesis and the underlying inhibitory mechanism by applying techniques including high throughput 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing parameters were focused on to comprehensively decipher the methane production microbial morphology and community structure methanogenic pathways including acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis electron transport energy metabolism and extracellular substance secretions these findings are expected to enhance our understanding of bes assisted methanogenesis inhibition for the ce efficiency improvement and expand the feasibility of applying methanogen suppression techniques in the ce bioreactors 2 material and methods 2 1 bioreactor setup and sludge inoculum a laboratory scale cylindrically anaerobic sbr asbr 1 27 l was operated treating synthetic organic wastewater the reactor and wastewater details were presented in supporting information si texts s1 and figure s1 in text s2 the granular sludge asbr has been operated for more than three years with a 12 h period cycle consisting of three steps a 3 minute feeding step a 11 h 55 min reaction step with intermittent biogas mixing once every 1 5 h for 1 min and a 2 minute decanting step the sludge concentration was maintained at around 8 07 g mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss l with the particle diameter of 0 5 4 0 mm and the moisture content 90

methanogenesis when asbr was operated with stable biogas production and pollutant removal the inhibition experiment was conducted with bes inhibitor supplementation in anaerobic serum bottle 150 ml to be more specific the 6 ml inoculum from asbr and 60 ml wastewater were mixed in each bottle achieving a final mixed liquid suspended solids mlss of around 1 03 g l it was then purged with 15 min n2 and sealed immediately with the butyl rubber plug and the aluminum cap it was eventually placed in a shaking chamber with 120 rpm and at constant temperature 30 c hny 2102c tianjin honour instrument co ltd china each group was conducted for 4 cycles with 7 days per cycle at the end of each cycle supernatant was discarded after centrifugation and the bottle was then fed with the same volume of fresh wastewater five bes groups namely s0 s1 s2 s3 and s4 were set up to investigate the dose impacts 0 0 3 0 6 0 9 0 and 12 0 g l bes on the methanogen activities with each in triplicate phs were initially adjusted to 7 0 0 1 with 1 mol l hcl or naoh and further ensured with 1 65 ml bes buffer 1 mol l ph 7 03 multiple parameters were recorded at the end of each cycle including biogas

the commercial test kits beijing solarbio china and jiangsu jingmei biotechnology co ltd china respectively the content of cof420 was determined exactly following the procedures described by reynolds

shown in text s4 the sludge eps was extracted using the thermal treatment method ma et al 2012 in brief 30 ml sludge samples were centrifuged 3200 rpm 30 min to remove the bulk solution the supernatant was regarded as the soluble eps s eps fraction additionally the resulted sludge slurries were re suspended with 0 05 nacl to 12 ml after a 20 min centrifugation at 9000 rpm the supernatants were used as the loosely bounded eps lb eps while the remaining was re suspended with 0 05 nacl to 12 ml thermally treated at 80 c for 45 min and centrifuged for 20 min at 10000 rpm the supernatants were considered as the tightly bounded eps tb eps and filtrated using 0 45 Î¼m membranes for the excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectral analyses f 7000 fl spectrophotometer hitachi japan the contents of carbohydrate and protein in lb eps tb eps and s eps were evaluated according to the methods as published before chen et al 2020 in the pre experiment measurements both enzyme activity and eps content decreased with the increase of bes concentration therefore only samples from groups s0 and s4 were selected for the enzyme activity determination and groups s0 s2 and s4 for the comparison on the eps characteristics 2 5 chemical analysis mlss and mlvss were determined based on standard protocols federation and association 2005 methane levels in the headspaces of

with water quality detector 5b 3b v8 beijing lianhua yongxing china 2 6 statistical analysis the results are shown as average values standard error of mean from the independent triplicates with graphpad prism graphpad software inc usa the differences between among groups on the methane production enzyme activity or abundance and eps levels were examined for significance with t test one way anova followed by tukey s post hoc test at a 0 05 significance level 3 results the asbr achieved stable methanogenic performance after a 55 day operation table s1 in text s2 specifically the methane production rate and cod removal rate stabilized approximately at 22 78 ml g mlss d and 1 28 g cod l d respectively with inoculum from asbr the methane inhibition experiments were subsequently initiated with details as follows 3 1 effects on methane production the methane production in response to the inhibitor bes was evaluated by three parameters including the accumulative methane production amp average methane production rate ampr and specific methane production inhibition smpi fig 1 a c as shown in fig 1a amp which demonstrated the methanogenic capacity of methanogens significantly decreased with the increased bes concentrations for example by the end of day 28 group s1 supplemented with 3 g l bes obtained a reduced amp by 72 9 1026 42 51 27 ml g vss compared with group s0 3790 54 120 24 ml g vss p 0 0001 one way anova with tukey s test a higher bes level 6 g l in group s2 achieved an even lower amp 328 55 2 88 ml g vss on day 28 eventually leading to a 91 3 0 1 decreased amp level as referred to group s0 p 0 0001 one way anova with tukey s test additionally the bes concentration also showed various impact on the methane production within each cycle to be more specific in groups s1 or s2 no obvious differences were observed in each cycle in group s2 85 70 1 13 ml g vss methane was produced in the first cycle and this remained at similar level 81 76 0 98 ml g vss in the last cycle cycle 1 vs cycle 4 p 0 05 one way anova with tukey s test on the contrary in group s3 or s4 similar amp level was observed by day 28 as compared with that by day 21 p 0 05 one way anova with tukey s test indicating that almost no methane was produced in cycle 4 similar observation was achieved when evaluating ampr which also presented a bes does dependent effect specifically as illustrated in fig 1b the ampr level significantly decreased with the increased bes concentration for example by the end of 28 days the amprs of groups s1 s2 s3 and s4 only achieved 36 66 1 83 ml g vss d 11 73 0 10 ml g vss d 4 77 0 17 ml g vss d and 4 04 0 15 ml g vss d respectively accounting for 27 1 1 4 8 6 0 1 3 5 0 1 and 3 0 0 1 as compared with group s0 135 38 4 29 ml g vss d group s0 vs any of the other group p 0 0001 one way anova with tukey s test it was also found that within groups s0 s3 similar ampr level was achieved by the end of each cycle for each group comparison between each cycle except for cycle 4 vs other cycles in group s3 p 0 05 suggesting a relatively comparable average methanogenic capacity of methanogens along the testing period in most of the groups the smpi which described the inhibition effect of per bes unit on methanogens as referred to group s0 demonstrated that 3 g l bes resulted in the most inhibition effect on methanogenic activity fig 1c by the end of cycle 1 the smpi level in group s1 achieved 8 04 ml g vss mm d which was 1 63 3 17 times of the other groups moreover for each group a slightly decreasing trend on the inhibition effect was observed along the experiment which was evidenced by 21 6 group s1 17 4 group s2 12 6 group s3 and 11 6 group s4 lower smpi levels on day 28 when compared with the same group on day 7 therefore it is concluded that bes could already obtain relatively high inhibitory effect on methanogenic activity at the initial stage of the experiment 3 2 effects on microbial communities and key enzymes in methanogens figure s2 illustrates the microbial dynamic variations in groups s0 and s4 at the genus level indicating that methanosaeta methanobacterium and methanolinea are the most abundant ones specifically the amount of methanobacterium which is a typical obligately hydrogenotrophic methanogen increased from 11663 otu number group s0 to 13356 group s4 fig 2 a and figure s2 with the overall percentage elevating from 39 3 group s0 to 56 5 group s4 fig 2b similar observation was also demonstrated in methanolinea a facultatively acetolactic and hydrogenotrophic methanogen with the otu number enhanced from 672 group s0 to 852 group s4 and the overall percentage from 2 8 group s0 to 3 6 group s4 fig 2a and 2b in contrast the otu level and overall percentage of methanosaeta an obligately acetolactic methanogen was 18 3 and 8 7 lower in groups s4 than group s0 respectively fig 2b interestingly bathyarchaeia a newly discovered archaea was also detected figure s2 bathyarchaeia contains key enzymes in methanogenesis such as methyl coenzyme m reductase mcr and dihydromethanophenazine coenzyme b cob com heterodesulfit reductase hdr however bathyarchaeia could not constitute a complete ch4 metabolism pathway in addition in bathyarchaeia the gene encoding mcr not only contributes to the synthesis of methane but also simultaneously plays a critical role in methane oxidation therefore bathyarchaeia could not be defined exactly as a methanogen and it is not included in fig 2 the bes impact on the methanogenic ack activity and the com and cof420 contents were evaluated ack is central to carbon and energy metabolism and is essential in archaeal acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway this enzyme catalyzes the formation of acetyl phosphate by reversibly transferring the Î³ phosphoryl group from atp to the carboxylate group in acetate as illustrated in fig 1d by the end of cycle 4 ack activity in group s4 was significantly lower than that in group s0 0 228 0 042 u mg prot and 2 287 0 000 u mg prot respectively p 0 001 t test indicating the retarded or inhibited acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway on the other hand com as a unique cofactor of methanogens is required for methanogenesis process including both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathways similar as ack activity group s4 also showed 66 1 0 8 reduced com level than group s0 18 43 0 41 ng g vss and 54 35 1 80 ng g vss respectively p 0 01 t test fig 1e as a component of electron transport chain the content of cof420 which plays an important role in two reduction steps in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway from methenyltetrahydromethanopterin to methyltetrahydromethanopterin achieving only 19 2 of group s0 fig 1f the predicted gene abundance of multiple key enzymes such as those involved in either hydrogenotrophic or acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway and those critical for both pathways were evaluated and compared fig 2c the gene abundance of ack phosphate acetyltransferase pta and acetyl coa synthetase acss which are only involved in acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway are all remarkably decreased in group s4 with ack and pta even presented an over 90 reduced level surprisingly the other enzymes such as formylmethanofuran tetrahydromethanopterin n formyltransferase ftr methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase mch and 5 10 methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase mer etc which are essential in the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway demonstrated an enhanced level with bes supplementation with the gene abundance increasing from 18449 23 to 19627 5 ftr 12612 85 to 12883 5 mch and 12618 83 to 12949 5 mer similarly bes also induced promoted levels of tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase mtr methyl coenzyme reductase mcr and heterodisulfide reductase hdr which are involved in both methanogenesis pathways to achieve a further understanding of the inhibitory mechanism the impact of bes on atp metabolism and electron transport was determined fig 2c the levels of the enzymes responsible for catalyzing atp consumption i e v type atpase and nitrogenase in groups s4 were remarkably promoted as expected while those involved in stimulating atp synthesis e g atp citrate synthase demonstrated lower abundance with exposure to bes regarding the electron transport process co dehydrogenase codh is involved in the reduction from co to co2 with co serving as an electron donor in this step furthermore nadh is generally regarded as one of the electron carriers and nadh ubiquinone reductase h translocating ndh is required for transporting electrons between electron carriers compared with group s0 the supplementation of bes in group s4 suppressed the gene abundance of both codh and ndh by 4 78 and 9 02 respectively indicating the detrimental effect of bes on electron transport 3 3 effects on eps contents and subtypes the contents of eps were evaluated among three selected groups i e groups s0 s2 and s4 as shown in fig 1g the supplementation of bes resulted in the reduced contents of both protein and carbohydrate eventually leading to the decreased total eps content for example the protein level in group s4 was less than half of group s0 while the carbohydrate content in group s4 was 35 8 lower as compared with group s0 however regarding to the overall contents of protein and carbohydrate bes concentration presented various impact on the eps subtypes s eps lb eps and tb eps specifically the tb eps content decreased with increased bes concentration with the protein contents in groups s2 and s4 accounting for only 65 7 and 50 4 of that in group s0 while the carbohydrate levels being 20 0 and 40 7 lower than group s0 however such trend was not evidently observed in s eps and lb eps this is supported by the 12 9 and 123 5 higher levels of s eps and lb eps respectively in group s2 as compared with group s0 fig 1h and fig 1i the s eps lb eps and tb eps in three groups were also evaluated by 3d eem fig 3 for the s eps both groups s2 and s4 had strong fluorescence peaks at ex em 270 280 340 350 nm and the intensities were strengthened with the increase of bes concentration implying the enhanced soluble microbial by product like substances for the lb eps there were strong fluorescence peaks obtained at both 270 280 340 350 nm and 220 230 330 340 nm in most of the groups but with opposite trend the intensity of the peak at 270 280 340 350 nm remarkably correlated well with the bes concentration offering evidence on the production of the soluble microbial by product like substances as well in contrast the increased bes concentration resulted in the reduced intensity of the peak at 220 230 330 340 nm indicating the enhanced secretion of tryptophan like aromatic proteins comparatively the bes supplementation presented no significant influence on the fluorescence intensities of the tb eps peaks at 270 280 330 370 nm 220 230 340 350 nm and 220 230 300 310 nm moreover the supplemented bes was likely to break the original rod shaped microbial consortium into small pieces leading to the formation of rougher granular surfaces with extensive pores figure s3 4 discussion methanogenesis is a series of metabolic processes involving multiple key enzymes and related biological chemical processes this study confirmed the dose dependent inhibitory effect of bes on methanogenesis and the underlying mechanism was investigated fig 4 illustrates the effect of bes on methanogenesis through two instinct metabolic pathways including acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathways specifically bes inhibited the acetoclastic methanogens and the enzymes involved in the acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway however surprisingly enhanced the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis by promoting the hydrogenotrophic methanogens and the corresponding enzymes moreover evidence from the aspect of related enzyme activities or gene abundance was provided in the support of inhibitory effect resulted from the structural analog competition bes vs methyl com com additionally bes reduced the levels of the genes or enzymes involved in atp synthesis and electron transport while enhancing those critical for atp consumption furthermore the eps secretion was also observed to be suppressed with the bes application 4 1 bes enriched hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis over acetoclastic one as shown in figs 2b and fig 4 the abundance of the enzymes e g ack acss pta crucial in acetoclastic methanogenesis was all suppressed in green while those involved in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis e g fmd ftr mch mtd mer frh were enhanced in red this was also supported by the variations of two microbial populations fig 2a obviously bes supplementation selectively enriched hydrogenotrophic methanogens while the obligately acetoclastic methanogen abundance was reduced for example methanobacterium a typical hydrogenotrophic methanogen in group s4 with bes applied became more abundant than those in group s0 otu number 13356 and 11663 respectively while the relative abundance of methanosaeta a typical acetoclastic methanogen in group s4 was 8 7 lower than group s0 therefore rather than resulting in the inhibition of both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens group s4 with 12 0 g l bes surprisingly stimulated the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis from the aspect of typical methanogen amount and unique enzyme gene abundance this challenges a previous report in which 50 mm 10 6 g l bes already completely inhibited hydrogenotrophic methanogens which might be due to the inconsistency between the two studies on multiple parameters such as bioreactor types temperature ph retention time and organic loading rate for example as one of the critical factors the thermophilic system 55 70 c presented lower methane yield as compared with the mesophilic system 37 c khan et al 2016 the enhanced hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis observed in this study might be explained by the highly expression of mrta gene which encodes for an isoenzyme of methyl coenzyme m reductase encoded by the mcra gene webster et al 2016 to be more specific the mrta gene has been identified in hydrogenotrophic methanogens such as methanobacterium however it has not been found in acetoclastic methanogens it is possible that the bes supplementation resulted in the up regulated expression of mrta which allows the methyl coenzyme m reductase in hydrogenotrophic methanogens to continue functioning additionally mrta is not well differentiated from the reported mcra gene sequence therefore it might give some insight in the elevated predicted abundance of mcr although the abundance of methanobacterium was enhanced in group s4 the overall otu level of all identified methanogens was 7 5 lower than that in group s0 this observation coincidentally agreed with the obvious reduction of com level in group s4 as com which is present in all methanogens is quantitatively correlated with the methanogen abundance and hence is sometimes regarded as a biomarker for quick estimation of methanogen levels elias et al 1999 despite that bes stimulated the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway while inhibited the acetoclastic one bes still showed a negative influence on the overall methane production considering that the methanogenesis is mostly dominated by acetoclastic methanogenesis with a ratio of approximately 2 1 for acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis 4 2 specific inhibitory induced by competition between the analog bes and methyl com com apart from the direct influence of bes on the enzymes and methanogens involved in both methanogenesis pathways bes is an analog of methyl com which might compete with methyl com in the methanogenic pathway resulting in the inactivation of mcr and hence inhibiting methane formation fig 4 specifically mcr is a nickel enzyme and the nickel is bound within the prosthetic group f430 the active mcr contains ni i f430 which catalyzes the reduction of methyl com with cob to methane and cob s s com however the competition between bes and methyl com could lead to the specific binding of bes to f430 at the central active site of mcr in this study when bes bound to the ni i f430 at the active site it was likely to oxidize the active ni i f430 to the inactive ni ii f430 bromide ethene and sulfite thereby interrupting the methanogenesis process boyd et al 2006 this was evidenced by a previous study demonstrating the decreased mcr activities with enhanced bes supplementation with 1 2 4 6 and 8 Î¼m bes resulting in 52 69 78 88 90 and 94 lower mcr activities as compared with the control salvador et al 2019 therefore it could explain the reduced amp and ampr levels with bes applied in this study although the predicted gene abundance of mcr was elevated in group s4 fig 2c this suggested that the impact of the suppressed mcr activity might outweigh the influence of the increased mcr gene abundance additionally bes is also a structural analog of com with a bromine atom replacing the thiol group in com and therefore bes might hinder methane production by competitively inhibiting methyl transfer reaction at the terminal reductive step boyd et al 2006 which is also illustrated in fig 4 interestingly the com content in group s4 was remarkably reduced as compared with group s0 fig 1e this might be mainly due to the suppressed production of cob s s com from reduced abudnacne methyl com which was potentially attributed to the reduced activity or gene abundance of the acetoclastic unique enzymes e g ack pta acss thus it eventually led to the subsequent hindered formation of com and cob from cob s s com 4 3 suppressed electron transport resulted from bes supplementation in the electron transport process h2 or carboxyl group converted from acetic acid is generally applied as the electron donor while co2 hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis or methyl acetoclastic one functions as the electron acceptor co2 or methyl is eventually reduced to ch4 with cof420 cytochrome cob and nadh working as electron carriers as shown in fig 1f when bes was applied in group s4 the cof420 level was remarkably decreased indicating a potential negative effect on electron carriers therefore it was relatively difficult for methyl to obtain sufficient electrons for further reduction to ch4 this seemingly contradicts the promoted abundance of both mtd and mer due to their contribution to the synthesis of cof420 however it is also worth nothing an enhanced level of frh which is involved in the reduction process from cof420 to reduced coenzyme f420 cof420h2 considering that the degree of increase in the cof420 consumption was significantly greater than that in the synthesis as illustrated in fig 2c it eventually resulted in the reduced content of cof420 moreover the decreased gene abundance of ndh in group s4 fig 2c demonstrated the suppressed electron transport induced by bes as ndh catalyzes the reversible electron transport from electron carrier nadh to membrane bound quinone brandt 2006 this is further supported by the reduced codh level fig 2c due to its contribution to the co2 production from co which indicated the reduced number of electrons provided by co as electron donors this is consistent with a previous study demonstrating that the inhibitory effect of cyanide on methanogenesis was also attributed to the inhibition of codh with electron paramagnetic resonance epr detectable changes in codh krzycki and prince 1990 4 4 suppressed atp synthesis and elevated abundance of v type atpase for bes stress adaptation considering that atp is essential for acetate utilization in acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway and archaea growth the phosphorylation of acetate was negatively influenced by insufficient atp as well as the reduced ack activities shown in fig 1d on the contrary the hydrogenotrophic methanogens do not require atp to activate the utilization of the substrates i e co2 and h2 this was consistent with a previous report showing the accumulation of acetate in the bes applied reactors chen et al 2007 moreover it is likely that bes directly has a detrimental effect on the atp synthase in methanogens in which a1ao atp synthase is a typical and essential one although few studies have confirmed the negative correlation between bes and a1ao atp synthase it has been reported in a recent study that excessive ammonia a well known inhibitor for methanogen activity led to the suppressed expression of genes encoding atp synthase xing et al 2021 additionally considering that the energy of the electron transport from nadh to quinone was coupled to the generation of a proton motive force pmf for atp synthesis brandt 2006 the reduced ndh level might also contribute to a suppression of sufficient energy supply the successive hydrolysis of atp triggered by elevated v type atpase level under bes stress resulted in the reduction of atp level v type atpase is an atp driven enzyme which converts the energy from atp hydrolysis to electrochemical potential differences of protons across membranes and further drives a variety of secondary active transport systems or channel mediated transport systems beyenbach and wieczorek 2006 as bes detoxicate activities are energy consumption processes the predicted abundance of the gene encoding v type atpase which is mainly expressed in archaea and responsible for the adaptation to stressful conditions dietz et al 2001 xing et al 2021 was also analyzed to clarify the inhibition interaction as illustrated in fig 2c v type atpase presented remarkably higher level in group s4 than that in group s0 indicating that the supplementation of bes stimulated up regulation of v type atpase gene abundance for the purpose of archaea survival or function maintenance multiple studies have reported the contribution of v type atpase in the stress adaptation such as salinity drought heavy metals cold stress and anoxia for example under salinity stress a pronounced increase in the v type atpase amount was found to be related to salinity level based on linear regression analysis ratajczak et al 1994 additionally with the supplementation of heavy metals the activity of antiporter responsible for metal transport depended on the presence of proton gradient and therefore was also related to the v atpase abundance chardonnens et al 1999 therefore it is reasonable to assume that efficient exclusion of excess bes from cytoplasmic compartment might be the main mechanism for the archaea adaptation which was energized by a proton motive force driven by v type atpase therefore enhanced v type atpase abundance might be required however the exact transport system for bes has not been defined yet 4 5 reduced eps secretion induced by bes and environmental significance the secretion of total eps was presented to be bes dose dependent and the bes level also showed obvious effect on the abundance of varied eps subtypes which was likely due to the mutual transformation among different subtypes specifically the overall amount of protein and carbohydrate in lb eps demonstrated a positive correlation with that in s eps for example s eps and lb eps levels in group s2 both ranked highest among the three tested groups while group s4 demonstrated the lowest amount of s eps and lb eps moreover bes supplementation might contribute to the conversion of non biodegradable substances to biodegradable ones based on the 3d eem spectroscopy observations the soluble microbial by product like substances in s eps and lb eps positively corresponded to the bes level while opposite trend was found regarding to the tryptophan like substances in lb eps in addition it was likely that the bes induced suppressed methane production was also partially attributed to the reduced overall eps secretion which was supported by the 83 5 increased cumulative methane yield after 0 50 g l eps addition hu et al 2020 similar observation also demonstrated that the addition of iron based conductive materials simultaneously enhanced eps contents in methanogenic biomass and methanogenesis rates ye et al 2018 it is worth noting that the bes application had a remarkable impact on the granular sludge morphology with distinct surface destruction such as pores and small debris which provided some degree of protection from bes stress this study identified the methanogenesis inhibitor bes that potentially contributed to the improved mcca synthesis in the ce bioreactors this is also the first report that systematically clarified the underlying mechanism from multiple perspectives including methanogenic community electron transport energy metabolism and extracellular substance secretions the bes based approach will be a beneficial complement to solve the challenges induced by the negative impact of methanogens on ce bacteria in ce bioreactors the integration of the proposed bes supplementation with other approaches such as involvement of the ph control and sludge optimization will further promote the development of ad system it should be noted that in this study it was difficult to evaluate the substrate acetate degradation profile for the establishment of cod or mass balance to better understand the substrate conversion to methane considering that bes itself as an organic substance made a significant contribution to cod in the system however this might be indirectly and roughly evaluated by the variations of ph values due to the consumption of h during the conversion of acetate to acetic acid which needs further investigations moreover the economic and environmental profits were not performed in this study further efforts are required to better understand the contributions of the intracellular bes acquisition and bes transport to methanogens applying bes with various parameters such as its existence form ionized or unionized salt or acid and feeding mode 5 conclusions this study investigated the unique ability to inhibit methanogenic metabolism of bes which is a specialized inhibitor of methanogens relatively low concentration of bes 3 g l could cause great inhibition effect on methanogens with 72 9 reduced methane production the bes supplementation resulted in the inhibited activities or reduced abundance of those enzymes critical for electron transport and atp synthesis moreover the acetoclastic methanogens were more likely to be inhibited while the hydrogenotrophic ones became the dominant bacteria in the archaeal community structures additionally bes also demonstrated a negative impact on the proteins and carbohydrate secreted in eps the observations in this study provided a technically applicable approach to inhibited methanogenesis and promoted mcca production paving the way for sustainable resource and energy recovery from ad system declaration of

15138,production of medium chain carboxylic acids mccas by chain elongation ce presents a competitive alternative to conventional products of methane in anaerobic digestion treating organic waste streams considering energy recovery economic and environmental profits however the system stability and performance largely rely on the selective suppression of methanogens while stimulation of ce bacteria commercial inhibitors such as 2 bromoethanesulfonic sodium bes was shown to be effective but controversial conclusions exist on its inhibition characteristics and the inhibition mechanism remains unclear therefore this study systematically investigated the responses of methanogenesis in granular sludge to various bes levels focusing on methane production methanogenic pathway dynamic populations electron transport and energy metabolism results showed that compared with the control 3 0 g l bes was sufficient to induce a 72 9 reduced level on accumulative methane production by the end of 4 cycles 28 days which was likely to be attributed to the significantly suppressed metabolic pathways and intracellular regulations specifically bes suppressed the electron transport via unproper electron carriers and reduced electron amount as indicated by the decreased level of enzymes and genes involved such as coenzyme f420 co dehydrogenase and nadh ubiquinone reductase h translocating moreover bes regulated the intracellular energy metabolism leading to the impeded atp synthesis but enhanced atp consumption as evidenced by the variations on the activity or abundance of acetate kinase a1ao atp synthase nitrogenase and atp citrate synthase additionally bes enriched hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis over acetoclastic one as supported by variations on the archaeal community structures and regulations of differentially expressed genes involved moreover bes also reduced the contents of both protein and carbohydrate in extracellular polymeric substances eps this study is expected to enhance understanding of bes contribution to methanogenesis inhibition but mccas production in ce bioreactors graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion 2 bromoethanesulfonic sodium chain elongation methanogenesis enzyme data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad has been widely used for bioconversion of organic wastewater into renewable energy in the form of ch4 and short chain carboxylic acids scca with four or fewer carbons recently however most ad systems are considered to get less net present value by selling electricity as an example due to the relatively low energy density of methane and the energy intensive separation process for scca other anaerobic products such as h2 are safer and cleaner fuels with higher combustion heat value which are therefore considered as more valuable but costly alternative energy sources wang and yin 2017 comparatively medium chain carboxylic acids mccas e g butyrate caproic and caprylic acids possess relatively higher energy density and present greater market potentials as precursors of spices renewable fuels fungicides and food additives ge et al 2015 wang and yin 2022 therefore attention has been shifted to the selective production of mccas through carbon chain elongation ce via a reverse Î² oxidation pathway in the carboxylate platform agler et al 2014 candry et al 2020 xu et al 2015 in the mixed culture ce bioreactors for mccas two types of functional microorganisms are primarily involved namely methanogens and ce bacteria which hold different physiological characteristics both bacteria coexist in system as mutual competitors with the observation that methanogens negatively influenced the mcca yield and ce efficiency agler et al 2011 shi et al 2022 this was supported by the enhanced mccas production after methanogenesis inhibition ntagia et al 2021 in this regard the supplementation of inhibitors into ce bioreactors was shown to be one of feasible strategies for selective methanogens inhibition depending on their different physiological and community dynamic responses to the inhibitors chen et al 2021 steinbusch et al 2009 viana et al 2019 among the inhibitors 5 mm 2 bromoethanesulfonic sodium bes was demonstrated to be effective for the selective inhibition purpose in various types bioreactors such as sequencing batch reactors sbr bioelectrochemical reactors and expanded granular sludge bed cheng et al 2022 jourdin et al 2018 liu et al 2017 steinbusch et al 2011 wu et al 2020 for example allaart et al 2021 successfully achieved methanogenesis inhibition and stabilized the formation of butyrate and caproate with bes supplementation as a specialized inhibitor of methanogens bes could also provide remedial measures when ce reactors in engineering application are not stable without affecting the normal activities of ce bacteria which is generally superior to other methanogenic inhibitors however controversial conclusions exist on the bes based methanogenesis inhibition performance such as the sensitivity of methanogens in some studies only the negative response of acetoclastic methanogenesis was focused on to bes considering that acetoclastic pathway tended to be the dominant one sancho navarro et al 2016 while the pure hydrogenotrophic cultures were applied to obtain the excellent bes induced reduction of h2 and co2 consumption rates logroÃ±o et al 2022 additionally another report was found that both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens were both suppressed with the increasing bes levels ying et al 2018 and hydrogenotrophic methanogens might be less sensitive to bes than acetoclastic ones zinder et al 1984 therefore compared with other inhibitors e g chloroform and fatty acids which might suppress methanogens while simultaneously have certain effects on ce bacteria tan et al 2016 xu et al 2010 webster et al 2016 bes as a specific inhibitor of methanogens requires further investigations on its effects on both types of methanogens it also remains unclear how the bes specifically inhibits the methanogenesis process in terms of the methanogen metabolism and community structure for example multiple enzymes are essentially involved in the methanogenic metabolic pathway however the bes inhibition mechanism with respect to enzyme activity level and the abundance of genes encoding functional enzymes in microbes as well as their features regarding to electron transport system and energy metabolism are still obscure for example v type atpase a typical electrogenic h pump might contribute to the adaptation to stressful growth conditions such as salinity drought cold and excess heavy metals dietz et al 2001 however the bes impact on v type atpase and its regulation on bes stress still remain unclear it should also be noted that in most of the previous studies the determination of the bes effect on hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens were mainly based on the consumption or accumulation of h2 co2 and acetate as such it is lacking direct evidence of variations on microbial dynamic structures of both methanogens in response to bes considering that microbial community could self adjust to external environments the main objective of this study was to systematically investigate the concentration dependent bes effects on methanogenesis and the underlying inhibitory mechanism by applying techniques including high throughput 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing parameters were focused on to comprehensively decipher the methane production microbial morphology and community structure methanogenic pathways including acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis electron transport energy metabolism and extracellular substance secretions these findings are expected to enhance our understanding of bes assisted methanogenesis inhibition for the ce efficiency improvement and expand the feasibility of applying methanogen suppression techniques in the ce bioreactors 2 material and methods 2 1 bioreactor setup and sludge inoculum a laboratory scale cylindrically anaerobic sbr asbr 1 27

anova followed by tukey s post hoc test at a 0 05 significance level 3 results the asbr achieved stable methanogenic performance after a 55 day operation table s1 in text s2 specifically the methane production rate and cod removal rate stabilized approximately at 22 78 ml g mlss d and 1 28 g cod l d respectively with inoculum from asbr the methane inhibition experiments were subsequently initiated with details as follows 3 1 effects on methane production the methane production in response to the inhibitor bes was evaluated by three parameters including the accumulative methane production amp average methane production rate ampr and specific methane production inhibition smpi fig 1 a c as shown in fig 1a amp which demonstrated the methanogenic capacity of methanogens significantly decreased with the increased bes concentrations for example by the end of day 28 group s1 supplemented with 3 g l bes obtained a reduced amp by 72 9 1026 42 51 27 ml g vss compared with group s0 3790 54 120 24 ml g vss p 0 0001 one way anova with tukey s test a higher bes level 6 g l in group s2 achieved an even lower amp 328 55 2 88 ml g vss on day 28 eventually leading to a 91 3 0 1 decreased amp level as referred to group s0 p 0 0001 one way anova with tukey s test additionally the bes concentration also showed various impact on the methane production within each cycle to be more specific in groups s1 or s2 no obvious differences were observed in each cycle in group s2 85 70 1 13 ml g vss methane was produced in the first cycle and this remained at similar level 81 76 0 98 ml g vss in the last cycle cycle 1 vs cycle 4 p 0 05 one way anova with tukey s test on the contrary in group s3 or s4 similar amp level was observed by day 28 as compared with that by day 21 p 0 05 one way anova with tukey s test indicating that almost no methane was produced in cycle 4 similar observation was achieved when evaluating ampr which also presented a bes does dependent effect specifically as illustrated in fig 1b the ampr level significantly decreased with the increased bes concentration for example by the end of 28 days the amprs of groups s1 s2 s3 and s4 only achieved 36 66 1 83 ml g vss d 11 73 0 10 ml g vss d 4 77 0 17 ml g vss d and 4 04 0 15 ml g vss d respectively accounting for 27 1 1 4 8 6 0 1 3 5 0 1 and 3 0 0 1 as compared with group s0 135 38 4 29 ml g vss d group s0 vs any of the other group p 0 0001 one way anova with tukey s test it was also found that within groups s0 s3 similar ampr level was achieved by the end of each cycle for each group comparison between each cycle except for cycle 4 vs other cycles in group s3 p 0 05 suggesting a relatively comparable average methanogenic capacity of methanogens along the testing period in most of the groups the smpi which described the inhibition effect of per bes unit on methanogens as referred to group s0 demonstrated that 3 g l bes resulted in the most inhibition effect on methanogenic activity fig 1c by the end of cycle 1 the smpi level in group s1 achieved 8 04 ml g vss mm d which was 1 63 3 17 times of the other groups moreover for each group a slightly decreasing trend on the inhibition effect was observed along the experiment which was evidenced by 21 6 group s1 17 4 group s2 12 6 group s3 and 11 6 group s4 lower smpi levels on day 28 when compared with the same group on day 7 therefore it is concluded that bes could already obtain relatively high inhibitory effect on methanogenic activity at the initial stage of the experiment 3 2 effects on microbial communities and key enzymes in methanogens figure s2 illustrates the microbial dynamic variations in groups s0 and s4 at the genus level indicating that methanosaeta methanobacterium and methanolinea are the most abundant ones specifically the amount of methanobacterium which is a typical obligately hydrogenotrophic methanogen increased from 11663 otu number group s0 to 13356 group s4 fig 2 a and figure s2 with the overall percentage elevating from 39 3 group s0 to 56 5 group s4 fig 2b similar observation was also demonstrated in methanolinea a facultatively acetolactic and hydrogenotrophic methanogen with the otu number enhanced from 672 group s0 to 852 group s4 and the overall percentage from 2 8 group s0 to 3 6 group s4 fig 2a and 2b in contrast the otu level and overall percentage of methanosaeta an obligately acetolactic methanogen was 18 3 and 8 7 lower in groups s4 than group s0 respectively fig 2b interestingly bathyarchaeia a newly discovered archaea was also detected figure s2 bathyarchaeia contains key enzymes in methanogenesis such as methyl coenzyme m reductase mcr and dihydromethanophenazine coenzyme b cob com heterodesulfit reductase hdr however bathyarchaeia could not constitute a complete ch4 metabolism pathway in addition in bathyarchaeia the gene encoding mcr not only contributes to the synthesis of methane but also simultaneously plays a critical role in methane oxidation therefore bathyarchaeia could not be defined exactly as a methanogen and it is not included in fig 2 the bes impact on the methanogenic ack activity and the com and cof420 contents were evaluated ack is central to carbon and energy metabolism and is essential in archaeal acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway this enzyme catalyzes the formation of acetyl phosphate by reversibly transferring the Î³ phosphoryl group from atp to the carboxylate group in acetate as illustrated in fig 1d by the end of cycle 4 ack activity in group s4 was significantly lower than that in group s0 0 228 0 042 u mg prot and 2 287 0 000 u mg prot respectively p 0 001 t test indicating the retarded or inhibited acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway on the other hand com as a unique cofactor of methanogens is required for methanogenesis process including both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathways similar as ack activity group s4 also showed 66 1 0 8 reduced com level than group s0 18 43 0 41 ng g vss and 54 35 1 80 ng g vss respectively p 0 01 t test fig 1e as a component of electron transport chain the content of cof420 which plays an important role in two reduction steps in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway from methenyltetrahydromethanopterin to methyltetrahydromethanopterin achieving only 19 2 of group s0 fig 1f the predicted gene abundance of multiple key enzymes such as those involved in either hydrogenotrophic or acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway and those critical for both pathways were evaluated and compared fig 2c the gene abundance of ack phosphate acetyltransferase pta and acetyl coa synthetase acss which are only involved in acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway are all remarkably decreased in group s4 with ack and pta even presented an over 90 reduced level surprisingly the other enzymes such as formylmethanofuran tetrahydromethanopterin n formyltransferase ftr methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase mch and 5 10 methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase mer etc which are essential in the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway demonstrated an enhanced level with bes supplementation with the gene abundance increasing from 18449 23 to 19627 5 ftr 12612 85 to 12883 5 mch and 12618 83 to 12949 5 mer similarly bes also induced promoted levels of tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase mtr methyl coenzyme reductase mcr and heterodisulfide reductase hdr which are involved in both methanogenesis pathways to achieve a further understanding of the inhibitory mechanism the impact of bes on atp metabolism and electron transport was determined fig 2c the levels of the enzymes responsible for catalyzing atp consumption i e v type atpase and nitrogenase in groups s4 were remarkably promoted as expected while those involved in stimulating atp synthesis e g atp citrate synthase demonstrated lower abundance with exposure to bes regarding the electron transport process co dehydrogenase codh is involved in the reduction from co to co2 with co serving as an electron donor in this step furthermore nadh is generally regarded as one of the electron carriers and nadh ubiquinone reductase h translocating ndh is required for transporting electrons between electron carriers compared with group s0 the supplementation of bes in group s4 suppressed the gene abundance of both codh and ndh by 4 78 and 9 02 respectively indicating the detrimental effect of bes on electron transport 3 3 effects on eps contents and subtypes the contents of eps were evaluated among three selected groups i e groups s0 s2 and s4 as shown in fig 1g the supplementation of bes resulted in the reduced contents of both protein and carbohydrate eventually leading to the decreased total eps content for example the protein level in group s4 was less than half of group s0 while the carbohydrate content in group s4 was 35 8 lower as compared with group s0 however regarding to the overall contents of protein and carbohydrate bes concentration presented various impact on the eps subtypes s eps lb eps and tb eps specifically the tb eps content decreased with increased bes concentration with the protein contents in groups s2 and s4 accounting for only 65 7 and 50 4 of that in group s0 while the carbohydrate levels being 20 0 and 40 7 lower than group s0 however such trend was not evidently observed in s eps and lb eps this is supported by the 12 9 and 123 5 higher levels of s eps and lb eps respectively in group s2 as compared with group s0 fig 1h and fig 1i the s eps lb eps and tb eps in three groups were also evaluated by 3d eem fig 3 for the s eps both groups s2 and s4 had strong fluorescence peaks at ex em 270 280 340 350 nm and the intensities were strengthened with the increase of bes concentration implying the enhanced soluble microbial by product like substances for the lb eps there were strong fluorescence peaks obtained at both 270 280 340 350 nm and 220 230 330 340 nm in most of the groups but with opposite trend the intensity of the peak at 270 280 340 350 nm remarkably correlated well with the bes concentration offering evidence on the production of the soluble microbial by product like substances as well in contrast the increased bes concentration resulted in the reduced intensity of the peak at 220 230 330 340 nm indicating the enhanced secretion of tryptophan like aromatic proteins comparatively the bes supplementation presented no significant influence on the fluorescence intensities of the tb eps peaks at 270 280 330 370 nm 220 230 340 350 nm and 220 230 300 310 nm moreover the supplemented bes was likely to break the original rod shaped microbial consortium into small pieces leading to the formation of rougher granular surfaces with extensive pores figure s3 4 discussion methanogenesis is a series of metabolic processes involving multiple key enzymes and related biological chemical processes this study confirmed the dose dependent inhibitory effect of bes on methanogenesis and the underlying mechanism was investigated fig 4 illustrates the effect of bes on methanogenesis through two instinct metabolic pathways including acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathways specifically bes inhibited the acetoclastic methanogens and the enzymes involved in the acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway however surprisingly enhanced the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis by promoting the hydrogenotrophic methanogens and the corresponding enzymes moreover evidence from the aspect of related enzyme activities or gene abundance was provided in the support of inhibitory effect resulted from the structural analog competition bes vs methyl com com additionally bes reduced the levels of the genes or enzymes involved in atp synthesis and electron transport while enhancing those critical for atp consumption furthermore the eps secretion was also observed to be suppressed with the bes application 4 1 bes enriched hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis over acetoclastic one as shown in figs 2b and fig 4 the abundance of the enzymes e g ack acss pta crucial in acetoclastic methanogenesis was all suppressed in green while those involved in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis e g fmd ftr mch mtd mer frh were enhanced in red this was also supported by the variations of two microbial populations fig 2a obviously bes supplementation selectively enriched hydrogenotrophic methanogens while the obligately acetoclastic methanogen abundance was reduced for example methanobacterium a typical hydrogenotrophic methanogen in group s4 with bes applied became more abundant than those in group s0 otu number 13356 and 11663 respectively while the relative abundance of methanosaeta a typical acetoclastic methanogen in group s4 was 8 7 lower than group s0 therefore rather than resulting in the inhibition of both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens group s4 with 12 0 g l bes surprisingly stimulated the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis from the aspect of typical methanogen amount and unique enzyme gene abundance this challenges a previous report in which 50 mm 10 6 g l bes already completely inhibited hydrogenotrophic methanogens which might be due to the inconsistency between the two studies on multiple parameters such as bioreactor types temperature ph retention time and organic loading rate for example as one of the critical factors the thermophilic system 55 70 c presented lower methane yield as compared with the mesophilic system 37 c khan et al 2016 the enhanced hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis observed in this study might be explained by the highly expression of mrta gene which encodes for an isoenzyme of methyl coenzyme m reductase encoded by the mcra gene webster et al 2016 to be more specific the mrta gene has been identified in hydrogenotrophic methanogens such as methanobacterium however it has not been found in acetoclastic methanogens it is possible that the bes supplementation resulted in the up regulated expression of mrta which allows the methyl coenzyme m reductase in hydrogenotrophic methanogens to continue functioning additionally mrta is not well differentiated from the reported mcra gene sequence therefore it might give some insight in the elevated predicted abundance of mcr although the abundance of methanobacterium was enhanced in group s4 the overall otu level of all identified methanogens was 7 5 lower than that in group s0 this observation coincidentally agreed with the obvious reduction of com level in group s4 as com which is present in all methanogens is quantitatively correlated with the methanogen abundance and hence is sometimes regarded as a biomarker for quick estimation of methanogen levels elias et al 1999 despite that bes stimulated the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway while inhibited the acetoclastic one bes still showed a negative influence on the overall methane production considering that the methanogenesis is mostly dominated by acetoclastic methanogenesis with a ratio of approximately 2 1 for acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis 4 2 specific inhibitory induced by competition between the analog bes and methyl com com apart from the direct influence of bes on the enzymes and methanogens involved in both methanogenesis pathways bes is an analog of methyl com which might compete with methyl com in the methanogenic pathway resulting in the inactivation of mcr and hence inhibiting methane formation fig 4 specifically mcr is a nickel enzyme and the nickel is bound within the prosthetic group f430 the active mcr contains ni i f430 which catalyzes the reduction of methyl com with cob to methane and cob s s com however the competition between bes and methyl com could lead to the specific binding of bes to f430 at the central active site of mcr in this study when bes bound to the ni i f430 at the active site it was likely to oxidize the active ni i f430 to the inactive ni ii f430 bromide ethene and sulfite thereby interrupting the methanogenesis process boyd et al 2006 this was evidenced by a previous study demonstrating the decreased mcr activities with enhanced bes supplementation with 1 2 4 6 and 8 Î¼m bes resulting in 52 69 78 88 90 and 94 lower mcr activities as compared with the control salvador et al 2019 therefore it could explain the reduced amp and ampr levels with bes applied in this study although the predicted gene abundance of mcr was elevated in group s4 fig 2c this suggested that the impact of the suppressed mcr activity might outweigh the influence of the increased mcr gene abundance additionally bes is also a structural analog of com with a bromine atom replacing the thiol group in com and therefore bes might hinder methane production by competitively inhibiting methyl transfer reaction at the terminal reductive step boyd et al 2006 which is also illustrated in fig 4 interestingly the com content in group s4 was remarkably reduced as compared with group s0 fig 1e this might be mainly due to the suppressed production of cob s s com from reduced abudnacne methyl com which was potentially attributed to the reduced activity or gene abundance of the acetoclastic unique enzymes e g ack pta acss thus it eventually led to the subsequent hindered formation of com and cob from cob s s com 4 3 suppressed electron transport resulted from bes supplementation in the electron transport process h2 or carboxyl group converted from acetic acid is generally applied as the electron donor while co2 hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis or methyl acetoclastic one functions as the electron acceptor co2 or methyl is eventually reduced to ch4 with cof420 cytochrome cob and nadh working as electron carriers as shown in fig 1f when bes was applied in group s4 the cof420 level was remarkably decreased indicating a potential negative effect on electron carriers therefore it was relatively difficult for methyl to obtain sufficient electrons for further reduction to ch4 this seemingly contradicts the promoted abundance of both mtd and mer due to their contribution to the synthesis of cof420 however it is also worth nothing an enhanced level of frh which is involved in the reduction process from cof420 to reduced coenzyme f420 cof420h2 considering that the degree of increase in the cof420 consumption was significantly greater than that in the synthesis as illustrated in fig 2c it eventually resulted in the reduced content of cof420 moreover the decreased gene abundance of ndh in group s4 fig 2c demonstrated the suppressed electron transport induced by bes as ndh catalyzes the reversible electron transport from electron carrier nadh to membrane bound quinone brandt 2006 this is further supported by the reduced codh level fig 2c due to its contribution to the co2 production from co which indicated the reduced number of electrons provided by co as electron donors this is consistent with a previous study demonstrating that the inhibitory effect of cyanide on methanogenesis was also attributed to the inhibition of codh with electron paramagnetic resonance epr detectable changes in codh krzycki and prince 1990 4 4 suppressed atp synthesis and elevated abundance of v type atpase for bes stress adaptation considering that atp is essential for acetate utilization in acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway and archaea growth the phosphorylation of acetate was negatively influenced by insufficient atp as well as the reduced ack activities shown in fig 1d on the contrary the hydrogenotrophic methanogens do not require atp to activate the utilization of the substrates i e co2 and h2 this was consistent with a previous report showing the accumulation of acetate in the bes applied reactors chen et al 2007 moreover it is likely that bes directly has a detrimental effect on the atp synthase in methanogens in which a1ao atp synthase is a typical and essential one although few studies have confirmed the negative correlation between bes and a1ao atp synthase it has been reported in a recent study that excessive ammonia a well known inhibitor for methanogen activity led to the suppressed expression of genes encoding atp synthase xing et al 2021 additionally considering that the energy of the electron transport from nadh to quinone was coupled to the generation of a proton motive force pmf for atp synthesis brandt 2006 the reduced ndh level might also contribute to a suppression of sufficient energy supply the successive hydrolysis of atp triggered by elevated v type atpase level under bes stress resulted in the reduction of atp level v type atpase is an atp driven enzyme which converts the energy from atp hydrolysis to electrochemical potential differences of protons across membranes and further drives a variety of secondary active transport systems or channel mediated transport systems beyenbach and wieczorek 2006 as bes detoxicate activities are energy consumption processes the predicted abundance of the gene encoding v type atpase which is mainly expressed in archaea and responsible for the adaptation to stressful conditions dietz et al 2001 xing et al 2021 was also analyzed to clarify the inhibition interaction as illustrated in fig 2c v type atpase presented remarkably higher level in group s4 than that in group s0 indicating that the supplementation of bes stimulated up regulation of v type atpase gene abundance for the purpose of archaea survival or function maintenance multiple studies have reported the contribution of v type atpase in the stress adaptation such as salinity drought heavy metals cold stress and anoxia for example under salinity stress a pronounced increase in the v type atpase amount was found to be related to salinity level based on linear regression analysis ratajczak et al 1994 additionally with the supplementation of heavy metals the activity of antiporter responsible for metal transport depended on the presence of proton gradient and therefore was also related to the v atpase abundance chardonnens et al 1999 therefore it is reasonable to assume that efficient exclusion of excess bes from cytoplasmic compartment might be the main mechanism for the archaea adaptation which was energized by a proton motive force driven by v type atpase therefore enhanced v type atpase abundance might be required however the exact transport system for bes has not been defined yet 4 5 reduced eps secretion induced by bes and environmental significance the secretion of total eps was presented to be bes dose dependent and the bes level also showed obvious effect on the abundance of varied eps subtypes which was likely due to the mutual transformation among different subtypes specifically the overall amount of protein and carbohydrate in lb eps demonstrated a positive correlation with that in s eps for example s eps and lb eps levels in group s2 both ranked highest among the three tested groups while group s4 demonstrated the lowest amount of s eps and lb eps moreover bes supplementation might contribute to the conversion of non biodegradable substances to biodegradable ones based on the 3d eem spectroscopy observations the soluble microbial by product like substances in s eps and lb eps positively corresponded to the bes level while opposite trend was found regarding to the tryptophan like substances in lb eps in addition it was likely that the bes induced suppressed methane production was also partially attributed to the reduced overall eps secretion which was supported by the 83 5 increased cumulative methane yield after 0 50 g l eps addition hu et al 2020 similar observation also demonstrated that the addition of iron based conductive materials simultaneously enhanced eps contents in methanogenic biomass and methanogenesis rates ye et al 2018 it is worth noting that the bes application had a remarkable impact on the granular sludge morphology with distinct surface destruction such as pores and small debris which provided some degree of protection from bes stress this study identified the methanogenesis inhibitor bes that potentially contributed to the improved mcca synthesis in the ce bioreactors this is also the first report that systematically clarified the underlying mechanism from multiple perspectives including methanogenic community electron transport energy metabolism and extracellular substance secretions the bes based approach will be a beneficial complement to solve the challenges induced by the negative impact of methanogens on ce bacteria in ce bioreactors the integration of the proposed bes supplementation with other approaches such as involvement of the ph control and sludge optimization will further promote the development of ad system it should be noted that in this study it was difficult to evaluate the substrate acetate degradation profile for the establishment of cod or mass balance to better understand the substrate conversion to methane considering that bes itself as an organic substance made a significant contribution to cod in the system however this might be indirectly and roughly evaluated by the variations of ph values due to the consumption of h during the conversion of acetate to acetic acid which needs further investigations moreover the economic and environmental profits were not performed in this study further efforts are required to better understand the contributions of the intracellular bes acquisition and bes transport to methanogens applying bes with various parameters such as its existence form ionized or unionized salt or acid and feeding mode 5 conclusions this study investigated the unique ability to inhibit methanogenic metabolism of bes which is a specialized inhibitor of methanogens relatively low concentration of bes 3 g l could cause great inhibition effect on methanogens with 72 9 reduced methane production the bes supplementation resulted in the inhibited activities or reduced abundance of those enzymes critical for electron transport and atp synthesis moreover the acetoclastic methanogens were more likely to be inhibited while the hydrogenotrophic ones became the dominant bacteria in the archaeal community structures additionally bes also demonstrated a negative impact on the proteins and carbohydrate secreted in eps the observations in this study provided a technically applicable approach to inhibited methanogenesis and promoted mcca production paving the way for sustainable resource and energy recovery from ad system declaration of

15139,disinfecting reclaimed water for safe reuse can produce toxic disinfection by products such as adsorbable organic bromine aobr irradiating stored reclaimed water with sunlight is a green and free method for eliminating some toxic disinfection by products but the effects of irradiation with sunlight on ozonated reclaimed water containing bromide are not well understood in this study aobr was found at concentrations of 171 180 Âµg br l in ozonated reclaimed water containing bromide at a concentration of 2 mg br l and dissolved organic carbon at a concentration of 5 mg c l irradiation with sunlight degraded 53 74 of the aobr in two reclaimed water samples in 8 h and the pseudo first order rate constants k were 0 09 0 17 h 1 the concentration of tribromomethane a typical br containing disinfection by product was decreased by 96 by irradiation for 8 h k 0 42 0 47 h 1 irradiation with sunlight decreased the toxicity of ozonated reclaimed water to chinese hamster ovary cells irradiation with sunlight decreased the degree of intracellular oxidative stress and oxidative damage caused by ozonated reclaimed water irradiation with sunlight for 8 h decreased cytotoxicity of the ozonated reclaimed water samples by 79 and 65 the change in aobr concentration correlated with the change in toxicity r2 0 69 p 0 05 the relationships between sunlight wavelength and decreases in the aobr concentration and toxicity were assessed and it was found that uv in sunlight was predominantly responsible for decreasing the aobr concentration and toxicity by reclaimed water during irradiation for 8 h uv was responsible for 65 66 of the decrease in the aobr concentration and 65 79 of the decrease in reclaimed water induced cytotoxicity irradiation with sunlight is a promising method for degrading aobr and detoxifying ozonated reclaimed water during storage to allow the water to be reused keywords sunlight irradiation cytotoxicity intracellular oxidative stress oxidative damage organic bromine reclaimed water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction producing safe reclaimed water is an important problem reclaimed water is often used in artificial lakes and at aquatic recreation sites sun et al 2022 zheng et al 2022 reclaimed water is commonly disinfected before reuse but chlorination produces disinfection by products dbps that can pose risks to biota including humans jia et al 2015 wang et al 2021a wert et al 2007 smaller amounts of dbps are produced during ozonation than chlorination for example trihalomethane and haloacetic acid formation potentials are lower at high ozone doses than high chlorine doses gao et al 2021 hu et al 2021 krasner et al 2006 furthermore the toxicity of recycled water is lower after ozonation than chlorination lower mutagenic activities have been found for drinking water treated using ozone oxidation methods than chlorination methods nobukawa and sanukida 2000 ozonation does however pose potential risks because toxic transformation products can be produced at ozone doses 0 4 mg o3 mg dissolved organic carbon doc itzel et al 2017 lv et al 2017 therefore the risks posed by using 1 mg o3 mg doc the dose used in most ozonation systems in wastewater treatment plants should not be overlooked ozonation could pose risks if br is present because br dbps could form the br concentration in water is typically between 10 Î¼g l and thousands of Âµg l and br dbps are the dominant dbps produced during ozonation if the br concentration in the water is 650 Âµg l liu et al 2018 mackeown et al 2020 yang et al 2021 yu et al 2019 compared with cl dbps a common group of dbps produced in chlorination and chloramination but regarded to be less produced during ozonation huang et al 2012 lv et al 2017 wu et al 2019 br dbps are more toxic and therefore of more concern than cl dbps chromosome aberrations are about three times more likely to be induced by br dbps than cl dbps at the same hypohalous acid dose so stronger risks to the environment are posed by br dbps than cl dbps in disinfected water echigo et al 2004 wagner and plewa 2017 assessments of dbp mixtures in ozonated reclaimed water can indicate the general effects of dbps on the environment adsorbable organic halogens aox are adsorbable organic compounds that contain halogen atoms adsorbable organic chlorine aocl adsorbable organic bromine aobr and adsorbable organic iodine can form during ozonation hundreds to thousands of dbps can be present in ozonated reclaimed water and dbp assessments to meet current regulations are not sufficient to indicate water quality regarding aox lu et al 2021a zhang et al 2021 not every dbp can be quantified using currently available techniques so changes in some aox concentrations can be used to indicate dehalogenation of dbps in general irradiation with sunlight uv h2o2 treatments and uv cl2 treatments have been used to control dbps to allow water to be reused safely lin et al 2021 pai and wang 2022 wu et al 2016 xu et al 2019 xu et al 2020a zhang et al 2020 uv related treatment such as uv and uv h2o2 are safer than uv cl2 and uv nh2cl by degrading micropollutants and generating less dbps tian et al 2020 however unexpected dbps may form during these combined treatments for instance chloramphenicol treated with uv h2o2 generated dichloroacetonitrile during post chloramination yimeng et al 2017 besides only with high uv doses uv and the related treatments are capable to degrading iodide containing dbps ye et al 2021 sunlight is a green source of energy that includes uv at wavelengths of 290 400 nm and visible light at wavelengths of 400 800 nm irradiation with sunlight could improve the quality of reclaimed water by degrading organic micropollutants at concentrations between ng l and Î¼g l decreasing the dbp formation potential and decreasing cytotoxicity du et al 2018a wang et al 2021c wu et al 2016 xu et al 2020a more importantly sunlight or simulated sunlight degrades regulated dbps and aox by direct and indirect photolysis abusallout and hua 2016a b abusallout et al 2017 chen et al 2010 fang et al 2013 liu and zhang 2014 wang et al 2017 direct photolysis means photolysis of a pollutant through absorption of photons indirect photolysis means degradation assisted by radical species or triplet state species produced from photosensitive species reclaimed water is very complex so photosensitive species such as dissolved organic matter and nitrate could cause indirect photolysis of aobr these matrix components could enhance photolysis of aobr by forming radical species but could attenuate photolysis of aobr by light screening effects i e competing with aobr to absorb photons guo et al 2022 photolytic dehalogenation of aox is reported hardly affected by environmentally relevant nitrate and nitrite concentrations or ph values abusallout and hua 2016a b therefore aox in real water produced in disinfection is more applicable photodegradation of dbps in reclaimed water therefore markedly affects the suitability of the water for reuse unlike regulated tests of particular chemicals toxicity assays of reclaimed water are performed to evaluate overall potential risks conflicting toxicity assay results suggest that assessing mixtures rather than determining particular chemicals may give more reliable toxicity information the toxicities of various dbps to mammalian cells bacteria and marine polychaete species have been determined allen et al 2022 liu and zhang 2014 muellner et al 2007 yang and zhang 2013 aocl and aobr concentrations in real water have been found to significantly correlate with cytotoxicity r 0 94 p 0 01 but the concentrations of specific dbps in chlorinated real water have not been found to correlate with cytotoxicity allen et al 2022 aobr concentrations have been found to be related to the mutagenicity of chlorinated water and smaller amounts of aobr have been found to be produced while fewer chromosome aberrations occurred in slightly alkaline solutions than non alkaline solutions echigo et al 2004 bromide ions can affect the toxicity of disinfected reclaimed water by being involved in pharmaceuticals transformation pathways and causing br dbps to form during ozonation kim et al 2020 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 but few studies of the effects of sunlight on changes in toxicity in reclaimed water have been performed the aim of this study was to improve our understanding of the processes that occur during the solar irradiation of ozonated wastewater containing bromide and the risks posed by the products in the study 1 the effects of sunlight on aobr evolution were assessed 2 the effects of solar irradiation on toxicity to mammalian cells were determined and 3 the wavelength range s causing changes in the aobr concentrations and cytotoxicity were identified 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sampling and analysis water samples i and ii were effluents from secondary treatment systems in an anaerobic anoxic oxic process municipal sewage treatment plant in shenzhen china they were collected in april and august respectively to represent reclaimed water in summertime shenzhen each water sample was passed through a 0 45 Âµm cellulose acetate membrane filter and stored at 2 4 c the water quality of each sample was determined immediately after sampling the doc concentration was determined using a toc l total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu kyoto japan the bromide and bromate concentrations were determined using an ion chromatograph fitted with a dionex aquion ionpac as19 column thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa the bromide and bromate quantitation limits were 10 and 5 Âµg l respectively the nh4 concentration was determined using an hi96700 photometer hanna instruments italy one way analyses of variance two way analyses of variance and kruskal wallis tests were performed using origin 2022 software academic version the water quality data are shown in table 1 2 2 ozonation and simulated sunlight irradiation experiments ozonation experiments were performed by adding saturated ozonated ultrapure water generated using an atlas 30 ozone generator absoluteozone canada to aliquots of reclaimed water the ozone concentration in the saturated ozonated ultrapure water was determined using a pth 043 ozone analyzer palintest uk the ozone dose was 5 mg o3 l which was almost 1 mg o3 mg doc after 2 h ozonation the residual ozone was quenched by adding a 1 05 stoichiometric amount of ascorbic acid du et al 2017 kanofsky and sima 1995 an aliquot of reclaimed water was sealed in a quartz glass tube light transmittance 90 and placed in the water tank of a photochemical reactor equipped with an xpa 7 1000w xenon lamp xujiang nanjing china the water tank contained circulating water that was kept at 25 0 5 c the light intensity received by the water sample was similar to the natural light intensity in summertime shenzhen china the total simulated sunlight intensity was set to be 60 mw cm2 simulating the midday intensity accessed by pl mw2000 optical power meter perfect light china schematic diagrams of light intensity detection were shown in figure s1a and s1b the middle in the shaft section of quartz reactors directed to the xenon lamp was measured as a single point optical power then the light intensity was calculated by the single point optical power divided by the effective measure are of the optical power meter and adjust the light current to make the ultimate light power meet the set value the lit period was 8 h to mimic a natural daylight period of 09 00 to 17 00 which is the typical daylight period in southern china when the sky is clear the lamp emission spectrum was shown in figure s1c and the light relative intensity 290 nm was less than 5 therefore the light 290 nm was not considered to be blocked to investigate the effects of different wavelengths filters were placed between the light source and quartz glass tube to allow only 400 nm visible light or 365 nm uv to be transmitted the intensity of visible light and uv were measured under filters which were surrounded the xenon lamp at a distance of 1 cm and the results were 54 mw cm2 and 6 mw cm2 respectively by pl mw2000 optical power meter 2 3 determining aobr and br dbp concentrations the aobr concentration was determined by adsorption pyrolysis using a multi 2500 system analytik jena jena germany the sample was adjusted to ph 2 by adding hno3 before the test was performed and was then stored at 4 c the test was performed within 3 d of the ph being adjusted a sample was passed through an activated carbon column which was then rinsed with a nano3 solution containing 0 7 hno3 to remove inorganic halogen the activated carbon column was then combusted at 950 c for 15 min the hydrogen halide gas that was produced during combustion was dissolved in ultrapure water the bromide content of the solution was then determined by ion chromatography as described in section 2 1 and the aobr concentration was calculated the dibromo p benzoquinone aobr standard recovery was 92 each sample was analyzed in triplicate regulated br dbps were determined as described in a previous publication wang et al 2021b briefly a liquid liquid extraction was performed to concentrate the br dbps and then the br dbps were determined by gas chromatography with electron capture detection using a qp2010 plus system agilent technologies santa clara ca usa the tribromomethane retention time was 15 29 min db5 ms column agilent technologies 2 4 toxicity analysis water samples were prepared by performing solid phase extractions using a method described in a previous publication wu et al 2021 briefly the water sample were adjusted to ph 2 0 02 with 4 m hcl and passed through activated hlb cartridges oasis waters the cartridges were dried up by nitrogen gas and eluted with 5 ml methanol 2 ml acetone and 2 ml dichloromethane in order the eluted solution was dried by nitrogen gas and the concentrated samples were stored in 20 c waiting for toxicity assays the toxicity tests were performed using the chinese hamster ovary cell cho line cho k1 from the american type culture collection cho cells after two four passages were used in the toxicity assays species that cause intracellular oxidative stress reactive oxygen species ros and base oxidized modification products including 8 hydroxy deoxy guanosine 8 oh d g were determined using an imagexpress micro high content analysis system molecular devices sunnyvale ca usa as described in previous publications wu et al 2021 wu et al 2019 the details of 8 oh d g and ros bioassays can be found in text s2 the relative induction rate of 1 5 ir1 5 was calculated for each sample from dose response curves plotted using origin 2022 software the ir1 5 is the concentration factor giving 1 5 times the effect of the negative control the ir1 5 indicates clear ros and oxidative damage 8 oh d g responses in cells zhang et al 2021 the higher the ir1 5 the weaker the toxic effects cytotoxicity defined as the cell viability was determined using the cck 8 colorimetric method performed using a spectramax i3 system molecular devices as described in a previous publication wang et al 2021b the details of cytotoxicity bioassays can be found in text s2 the positive control was phenol and the cytotoxicity equivalent was calculated using the positive control results each toxicity assay was performed four six times the cytotoxicity equivalent was defined as the median lethal phenol positive control concentration 600 650 mg phenol l divided by the median lethal concentration of the sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 br dbp degradation during irradiation with sunlight 3 1 1 aobr as shown in fig 1 a and 1b the aobr concentrations in the ozonated water i and ii samples were similar 170 and 181 Âµg br l respectively solar irradiation degraded aobr in the ozonated reclaimed water irradiation with sunlight for 8 h decreased the aobr concentrations in the water i and ii samples by 53 and 74 respectively no marked change occurred in the dark control indicating that the effect of volatilization on the aobr concentration was negligible aocl concentration was around 10 Âµg cl l shown in figure s4 and did not change significantly during solar irradiation therefore we did not consider aocl in further study the bromide concentration in the raw reclaimed water was below the detection limit as shown in table 1 and br was spiked into the samples to give a concentration of 2 mg br l the organic bromine bromate and bromine residue concentrations are shown on a bromide basis in fig 1c and 1d during irradiation the main species for which the concentrations changed were aobr and bromide the bromate concentration did not markedly change the sum of the bromide bromate and aobr concentrations in each sample was similar to the total bromide dose indicating that bromide became detached from aobr through photolytic dehalogenation similarly in a previous study suwannee river fulvic acid at a concentration of 3 mg c l was oxidized by hbro at a concentration of 2 mg br l after 6 h of irradiation and the aobr concentration decreased from 270 to 108 Âµg br l abusallout and hua 2016a the pseudo first order rate constants k for aobr degradation through photolysis we found were 0 09 and 0 17 h 1 for water i and ii respectively the reclaimed water remained at ph 7 2 throughout the solar irradiation process the aobr photolysis rate constants were similar to the rate constant of 0 119 h 1 found at ph 7 in a previous study abusallout and hua 2016a as shown in fig 2 c our results indicated that aobr photolysis in reclaimed water were similar to that in ultrapure water formed from model organic matter the further study on the influence of reclaimed water matrix is suggested to be conducted 3 1 2 typical br dbps we tested the trihalomethanes bromodichloromethane chlorodibromomethane and tribromomethane we detected tribromomethane the detection limit was 0 1 Âµg l the tribromomethane concentrations were decreased from 21 to 22 to 0 8 0 6 Âµg l by 8 h of irradiation the results for the dark control indicated that negligible volatilization occurred the tribromomethane concentrations were in the low Âµg l range but 8 h irradiation degraded 97 and 96 of the tribromomethane in water i and ii respectively the calculated photolysis rate constants for water i and ii were 0 47 and 0 42 h 1 respectively these values were similar to the tribromomethane photolysis rate of 0 32 h 1 found for a natural sunlight intensity of 115 130 mw cm2 found between times of 11 00 and 15 00 in a previous study chen et al 2010 however a tribromomethane photolysis rate of 0 095 h 1 has been found for outdoor solar irradiation at between 108 7 and 113 9 mw cm2 abusallout and hua 2016b this would have been because dehalogenation kinetics reflect dehalogenation but not dbp transformations caused by irradiation with sunlight during dehalogenation for instance the halogen atoms can become associated with organic ligands in sea water and therefore increase the organic halogen concentration to 10 4 mol br mol c mÃ©ndez dÃ­az et al 2014 so specific dbps dehalogenation kinetics vary from degradation kinetics low photolysis rates have been found for tribromomethane 5 3 10 3 h 1 and tribromoacetic acid 6 9 10 4 h 1 lifongo et al 2004 the differences would have been caused by the mercury lamp emission 400 nm used in the study performed by lifongo et al 2004 not emitting uv even though the light intensity was the same as in the other study as shown in fig 2c the photolysis rates during solar irradiation decreased in the order i dbps br dbps cl dbps haloacetic acids and halomethanes are photolyzed faster the more cl br and i substituents are present a halomethane will be photolyzed 10 to 100 times faster than the halophenol or haloacetic acid with the same number of halogen substituents halomethane photolysis rates are similar to haloacetonitrile photolysis rates the residual dbps after irradiation may therefore include halophenols and haloacetic acids which are more photostable than halomethanes but at low concentrations e g tens of ng l zhang et al 2021 bromoform was taken as a proof that one of the br dbps was degraded under sunlight irradiation and further studies on bulk br dbps are suggested 3 2 effects of the sunlight wavelength on aobr elimination the results for photolysis of water i and ii by visible light only and uv only are shown in fig 3 the aobr concentrations in water i and ii decreased by 8 after 4 h of irradiation with visible light the aobr concentrations in water i and ii decreased by 29 and 17 respectively after 4 h of irradiation with uv this indicated that the aobr species in water i may have contained more uv sensitive components which would be photolyzed first than the aobr in water ii water i and water ii contained ammonia at a concentration of 0 23 and 0 35 mg n l respectively so n dbps including anilines e g bromoaniline were probably produced anilines were produced from suwannee river natural organic matter ozonated in the presence of bromide and ammonia determined in a study involving stable isotope labeling and high resolution mass spectrometry lu et al 2021b similarly bromophenylacetonitrile has been found at concentrations of 162 1221 ng l in ozonated wastewater treatment plant effluents by two dimensional gas chromatography quadrupole mass spectrometry and electron capture detection zhang et al 2021 uv alone has been found to degrade aniline k 0 6 h 1 uv intensity 12 85 mw cm2 and transform the aniline into various organic products zhao et al 2013 the induction effect of bromine decreases the electron cloud density of the phenol ring in bromoaniline meaning bromoaniline is less readily decomposed by uv at a low light intensity than a high light intensity bromophenylacetonitrile is expected to be photolyzed by uv more slowly than aniline because the cn bond energy is stronger than the c n bond energy meaning the cn bond is harder to break than the c n bond weast et al 1984 halonitromethanes are photolyzed quickly k 0 48 4 8 h 1 by uv 254 nm 0 153 w l as long as the ph is close to the pka of the halonitromethane 6 0 7 6 because uv is absorbed much more strongly by the deprotonated forms with conjugation systems than by the non deprotonated forms making the deprotonated forms more susceptible to photodegradation fang et al 2013 we speculated that the ph of 7 2 we used enhanced n dbp photolysis by uv the contributions of different sunlight wavelengths to aobr dehalogenation through photolysis in 8 h of irradiation are shown in fig 3c three times more aobr in both water i and ii was degraded by uv than visible light visible light contributed 25 27 and uv contributed 65 66 of photolysis of aobr in water i and ii by the full wavelength range see section 3 1 1 aobr was more strongly degraded by uv than visible light aox in chlorinated water was also found to be more strongly degraded by uv irradiation than visible light irradiation huang et al 2019 visible light affects 2 of the known dbp formation potential wu et al 2016 the uv contributions shown in fig 3c would have been caused by the water samples mainly absorbing uv light and barely absorbing visible light fig s2 the visible light and uv contributions would have had two main causes first the uv and sunlight irradiation results indicated that trihalomethanes and haloacetic acid are photolyzable by sunlight but barely degraded by uv trihalomethanes have been found to be hardly photolyzed by uv 254 nm which degraded 5 of chbr3 chcl2br chclbr2 and chcl3 at ph 7 5 nicole et al 1991 haloacetic acids are photolyzed slowly 10 2 h 1 by uv because uv photons are hardly absorbed and c c and c cl bonds are not readily broken wang et al 2020 second dbps were not completely degraded to inorganic matter by irradiation but dehalogenation by visible light may have occurred because visible light is nine times more intense than uv in sunlight photochemical reduction involving dehalogenation of amines occurs readily through electron donor acceptor complexes involving the substrate and reductant rather than photocatalysts rathnayake and weaver 2019 there remain unknown complex aobr mixtures but we concluded that uv most strongly contributes to aobr degradation through solar irradiation and visible light contributes less 3 3 evolution of toxicity during irradiation with sunlight 3 3 1 intracellular oxidative stress intracellular oxidative stress involving ros can occur through cell responses to toxic pollutants and is regarded as being a highly responsive mammalian cell defense mechanism deng et al 2022 escher et al 2014 the ros concentration effect curves for water i and ii irradiated for 8 h are shown in fig 4 the results at 0 and 8 h were used to assess intracellular ros and oxidative damage the results of the statistical analyses are shown in table s1 ozonation can decrease water sample effect on cho intracellular oxidative stress jia et al 2015 however ozonating reclaimed water in the presence of bromide induced intracellular ros in our study the ir1 5 values for water i and ii being 28 and 11 respectively in the dark tests the results were no different at 0 and 8 h exposure to sunlight caused the ir1 5 values for water i and ii to increase to 112 and 114 respectively which were 3 9 and 10 4 times higher respectively than the values for the initial samples this indicated that irradiation with sunlight strongly impacted reclaimed water to cause less intracellular ros solar irradiation also influences the effluent to induce decreased intracellular ros concentrations in cho cells in a previous study du et al 2018b intracellular ros delays mitophagy and results in cell death so the intracellular ros concentration is useful for predicting changes in cytotoxicity brambilla et al 2020 girard et al 2008 3 3 2 intracellular oxidative damage base modification is the most common type of dna damage and guanosine g is the most susceptible base to oxidation because it has a lower oxidative potential than adenine cytosine and thymine guanine is vulnerable to attack by radicals and is hydroxylated to 8 oh d g zhang et al 2021 reclaimed water has a complex composition and can induce 8 oh d g formation in dna and rna xu et al 2020b the concentration effect curves for 8 oh d g before and after 8 h of irradiation of water i and ii are shown in fig 5 water i and ii after solar irradiation decreased the amount of 8 oh d g in the cho cells the concentration effect curve shifted to the right after irradiation the curves were similar to the curves for the dark control and initial samples with solar irradiation reclaimed water caused the ir1 5 values for water i and ii to increase to 2 9 and 6 8 times respectively compared to the ir1 5 values for the initial samples i e at 0 h indicating that irradiation of the water prevented 8 oh d g forming in the cho cells these results were similar to the ros induction results the statistical analysis results are shown in table s1 water i and ii induced intracellular oxidative stress as mentioned in section 3 3 1 and 8 oh d g formation was a possible result the water irradiated with sunlight decreased the amount of 8 oh d g that formed by decreasing the intracellular ros concentration induced by toxic compounds degrading toxic compounds will decrease oxidative damage specifically removing furanone and other toxic compounds that are present in reclaimed water will decrease oxidative stress and cause less 8 oh d g to form assays using calf thymus dna indicated that 2 5 furanone caused hydroxyl radicals to be produced from hydrogen peroxide and enhanced 8 oh d g production murakami et al 2007 chlorinated furanone compounds are genotoxic to mammalian cells mÃ¤ki paakkanen et al 2004 the ros concentration was significantly higher in the presence of bromide than in the absence of bromide in reclaimed water in a previous study wu et al 2019 this indicated that aobr degradation by solar irradiation could decrease oxidative damage indicated by 8 oh d g 3 3 3 cytotoxicity the concentration effect curves for cytotoxicity for water i and ii are shown in fig 6 the ozonated reclaimed water was cytotoxic the lc50 being 24 0 34 3 mg phenol l as shown in fig 6a the concentration effect curves moved to the right and the lc50 increased as the irradiation time increased indicating that cytotoxicity decreased the concentration effect curves for the dark control samples did not markedly change over time the lc50 was converted into a phenol toxicity equivalent to indicate cytotoxicity and the results are shown in fig 6b the cytotoxicities for water i after exposure to sunlight for 0 2 4 and 8 h were 24 0 7 9 5 7 and 4 9 mg phenol l respectively i e exposure to sunlight for 2 4 and 8 h decreased the cytotoxicity by 66 7 76 5 and 79 3 respectively the one way analyses of variance results indicated that the cytotoxicities for water i after exposure to sunlight for 2 4 and 8 h were significantly different to the cytotoxicity before exposure to sunlight p 0 05 the decrease in toxicity caused by irradiation was very statistically significant p 0 001 but there were no significant differences between the toxicities after the different numbers of hours of irradiation 2 4 and 8 h kruskal wallis tests indicated that the difference between the toxicities after 8 h irradiation and no irradiation was more statistically significant p 0 0134 than the differences between the toxicities after 2 and 4 h irradiation and no irradiation the water ii results followed a similar trend it is possible that degradation of toxic dbps contributes to changes in toxicity through photolysis taking the results presented in section 3 1 into account we concluded that some less toxic dbps were photolyzed quickly and the remaining aobr species were photostable and toxic in a previous study it was found that halomethanes are two three orders of magnitude less toxic in terms of developmental toxicity than haloacetic acids and halophenols to the marine polychaete platynereis dumerilii yang and zhang 2013 halophenols are one three orders of magnitude more toxic than haloacetic acids to the autotrophic marine alga tetraselmis marina liu and zhang 2014 haloacetonitriles are generally more toxic than haloacetic acids and halonitromethanes to cho cells and haloacetonitriles should be of concern because their concentrations correlate with the toxicity of chlorinated water allen et al 2022 muellner et al 2007 it seems that photostable dbps halophenols and haloacetic acids are more toxic than photosensitive dbps halomethanes and haloacetonitriles irradiation with sunlight transforms dbp precursors and toxic compounds in reclaimed water and therefore decreases the toxicity for example the cytotoxicity of effluent to cho cells was decreased from 6 5 to 4 5 mg phenol l by irradiation with sunlight for 12 h du et al 2018a the dbp precursors tyrosine and tryptophan in reclaimed water are transformed into kynurenine and tryptamine respectively by irradiation with sunlight wu et al 2016 in our study exposure to sunlight made the ozonated reclaimed water less toxic to cho cells and this was positively related to decreases in the aobr concentration as shown in fig 6e r2 0 69 p 0 05 water i and ii followed the same trend and the proportion by which the aobr concentration decreased correlated with the proportion by which the cytotoxicity decreased it indicated that solar irradiation decreased the aobr concentration in the ozonated reclaimed water and the cytotoxicity induced by reclaimed water decreases proportionally photoconversion of dbps in chlorinated wastewater triggered by photonucleophilic substitution of chlorine atoms with hydroxide ions in the receiving seawater has been found to be a detoxification process liu et al 2017 dehalogenation through photolysis gives products that are less toxic than the original compounds we found that ozonation removed most of the species that fluoresced and absorbed uv at 254 nm from the reclaimed water as shown in figures s2 and s3 irradiation did not change the amount of fluorescence or absorbtion of uv at 254 nm 3 4 effects of sunlight in different wavelength ranges on decreases in toxicity as shown in fig 7 intracellular ros 8 oh d g and cytotoxicity induced by reclaimed water clearly decreased through irradiation with uv but did not decrease as much through irradiation with visible light the ir1 5 values for intracellular ros were 95 105 for reclaimed water irradiated with uv but 21 28 for reclaimed water irradiated with visible light the 8 oh d g results were similar the ir1 5 values being 106 84 for reclaimed water irradiated with uv and 11 18 for reclaimed water irradiated with visible light cytotoxicity was decreased 10 times more effectively by reclaimed water irradiated with uv than visible light the results of the statistical analyses are shown in table s2 these results confirmed that uv contributed much more than visible light to influence reclaimed water to induce less toxicity the lc50 and ir1 5 values for the dark controls and reclaimed water irradiated with visible light were similar indicating that visible light weakly affected reclaimed water induced toxicity intracellular ros and 8 oh d g were affected similarly by uv and sunlight irradiated reclaimed water we concluded that uv is the dominant wavelength range in sunlight that affects the water toxicity uv is the main wavelength range responsible for photolyzing dbps and other organic micropollutants that are toxic so irradiation with uv can strongly affect the toxicity of water as shown in section 3 2 uv rather than visible light was found to be mainly responsible for degrading aobr uv in sunlight converts triclosan the main absorbance wavelength range of which is 200 300 nm into 2 8 dichlorodibenzo p dioxin which is far more toxic than the parent molecule buth et al 2010 similarly pharmaceutical mixtures main absorbance wavelengths 400 nm are generally more toxic to the luminescent marine bacterium vibrio fischeri after than before solar irradiation wang and lin 2014 irradiation with uv decreases the toxicity of chlorinated reclaimed water to cho cells markedly huang et al 2019 lv et al 2017 the results of the studies mentioned above and our study indicate that uv in sunlight is the main wavelength range responsible for changing the toxicity of reclaimed water 4 conclusions solar irradiation degrades dbps and decreases the toxicity of reclaimed water however ozonation in the presence of bromide produces toxic aobr species that pose risks to aquatic organisms and humans when reclaimed water is recycled the results of this study improved our understanding of the effects of solar irradiation on ozonated reclaimed water by changing the aobr concentration and toxicity the main conclusions are shown below 1 sunlight decreased the aobr concentration through dehalogenation photolysis in the presence of bromide ozonation of reclaimed water caused aobr to form irradiation with sunlight decreased the aobr concentration in the reclaimed water through dehalogenation photolysis tribromomethane a regulated br dbp was found to be degraded by irradiation 2 irradiation with sunlight decreased the intracellular ros concentrations and oxidative damage 8 oh d g induced in mammalian cells by reclaimed water this indicated that reclaimed water irradiated with sunlight decreased intracellular oxidative dna damage 3 cytotoxicity the overall indicator of intracellular ros and oxidative damage was decreased by reclaimed water irradiated with sunlight the decreases in cytotoxicity were related to the decreases in aobr concentrations aobr degradation very likely results in a decrease in cytotoxicity 4 uv in sunlight is mainly responsible for decreasing aobr and decreasing reclaimed water induced toxicity during irradiation uv clearly contributes more than visible light to aobr photolysis declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

15139,disinfecting reclaimed water for safe reuse can produce toxic disinfection by products such as adsorbable organic bromine aobr irradiating stored reclaimed water with sunlight is a green and free method for eliminating some toxic disinfection by products but the effects of irradiation with sunlight on ozonated reclaimed water containing bromide are not well understood in this study aobr was found at concentrations of 171 180 Âµg br l in ozonated reclaimed water containing bromide at a concentration of 2 mg br l and dissolved organic carbon at a concentration of 5 mg c l irradiation with sunlight degraded 53 74 of the aobr in two reclaimed water samples in 8 h and the pseudo first order rate constants k were 0 09 0 17 h 1 the concentration of tribromomethane a typical br containing disinfection by product was decreased by 96 by irradiation for 8 h k 0 42 0 47 h 1 irradiation with sunlight decreased the toxicity of ozonated reclaimed water to chinese hamster ovary cells irradiation with sunlight decreased the degree of intracellular oxidative stress and oxidative damage caused by ozonated reclaimed water irradiation with sunlight for 8 h decreased cytotoxicity of the ozonated reclaimed water samples by 79 and 65 the change in aobr concentration correlated with the change in toxicity r2 0 69 p 0 05 the relationships between sunlight wavelength and decreases in the aobr concentration and toxicity were assessed and it was found that uv in sunlight was predominantly responsible for decreasing the aobr concentration and toxicity by reclaimed water during irradiation for 8 h uv was responsible for 65 66 of the decrease in the aobr concentration and 65 79 of the decrease in reclaimed water induced cytotoxicity irradiation with sunlight is a promising method for degrading aobr and detoxifying ozonated reclaimed water during storage to allow the water to be reused keywords sunlight irradiation cytotoxicity intracellular oxidative stress oxidative damage organic bromine reclaimed water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction producing safe reclaimed water is an important problem reclaimed water is often used in artificial lakes and at aquatic recreation sites sun et al 2022 zheng et al 2022 reclaimed water is commonly disinfected before reuse but chlorination produces disinfection by products dbps that can pose risks to biota including humans jia et al 2015 wang et al 2021a wert et al 2007 smaller amounts of dbps are produced during ozonation than chlorination for example trihalomethane and haloacetic acid formation potentials are lower at high ozone doses than high chlorine doses gao et al 2021 hu et al 2021 krasner et al 2006 furthermore the toxicity of recycled water is lower after ozonation than chlorination lower mutagenic activities have been found for drinking water treated using ozone oxidation methods than chlorination methods nobukawa and sanukida 2000 ozonation does however pose potential risks because toxic transformation products can be produced at ozone doses 0 4 mg o3 mg dissolved organic carbon doc itzel et al 2017 lv et al 2017 therefore the risks posed by using 1 mg o3 mg doc the dose used in most ozonation systems in wastewater treatment plants should not be overlooked ozonation could pose risks if br is present because br dbps could form the br concentration in water is typically between 10 Î¼g l and thousands of Âµg l and br dbps are the dominant dbps produced during ozonation if the br concentration in the water is 650 Âµg l liu et al 2018 mackeown et al 2020 yang et al 2021 yu et al 2019 compared with cl dbps a common group of dbps produced in chlorination and chloramination but regarded to be less produced during ozonation huang et al 2012 lv et al 2017 wu et al 2019 br dbps are more toxic and therefore of more concern than cl dbps chromosome aberrations are about three times more likely to be induced by br dbps than cl dbps at the same hypohalous acid dose so stronger risks to the environment are posed by br dbps than cl dbps in disinfected water echigo et al 2004 wagner and plewa 2017 assessments of dbp mixtures in ozonated reclaimed water can indicate the general effects of dbps on the environment adsorbable organic halogens aox are adsorbable organic compounds that contain halogen atoms adsorbable organic chlorine aocl adsorbable organic bromine aobr and adsorbable organic iodine can form during ozonation hundreds to thousands of dbps can be present in ozonated reclaimed water and dbp assessments to meet current regulations are not sufficient to indicate water quality regarding aox lu et al 2021a zhang et al 2021 not every dbp can be quantified using currently available techniques so changes in some aox concentrations can be used to indicate dehalogenation of dbps in general irradiation with sunlight uv h2o2 treatments and uv cl2 treatments have been used to control dbps to allow water to be reused safely lin et al 2021 pai and wang 2022 wu et al 2016 xu et al 2019 xu et al 2020a zhang et al 2020 uv related treatment such as uv and uv h2o2 are safer than uv cl2 and uv nh2cl by degrading micropollutants and generating less dbps tian et al 2020 however unexpected dbps may form during these combined treatments for instance chloramphenicol treated with uv h2o2 generated dichloroacetonitrile during post chloramination yimeng et al 2017 besides only with high uv doses uv and the related treatments are capable to degrading iodide containing dbps ye et al 2021 sunlight is a green source of energy that includes uv at wavelengths of 290 400 nm and visible light at wavelengths of 400 800 nm irradiation with sunlight could improve the quality of reclaimed water by degrading organic micropollutants at concentrations between ng l and Î¼g l decreasing the dbp formation potential and decreasing cytotoxicity du et al 2018a wang et al 2021c wu et al 2016 xu et al 2020a more importantly sunlight or simulated sunlight degrades regulated dbps and aox by direct and indirect photolysis abusallout and hua 2016a b abusallout et al 2017 chen et al 2010 fang et al 2013 liu and zhang 2014 wang et al 2017 direct photolysis means photolysis of a pollutant through absorption of photons indirect photolysis means degradation assisted by radical species or triplet state species produced from photosensitive species reclaimed water is very complex so photosensitive species such as dissolved organic matter and nitrate could cause indirect photolysis of aobr these matrix components could enhance photolysis of aobr by forming radical species but could attenuate photolysis of aobr by light screening effects i e competing with aobr to absorb photons guo et al 2022 photolytic dehalogenation of aox is reported hardly affected by environmentally relevant nitrate and nitrite concentrations or ph values abusallout and hua 2016a b therefore aox in real water produced in disinfection is more applicable photodegradation of dbps in reclaimed water therefore markedly affects the suitability of the water for reuse unlike regulated tests of particular chemicals toxicity assays of reclaimed water are performed to evaluate overall potential risks conflicting toxicity assay results suggest that assessing mixtures rather than determining particular chemicals may give more reliable toxicity information the toxicities of various dbps to mammalian cells bacteria and marine polychaete species have been determined allen et al 2022 liu and zhang 2014 muellner et al 2007 yang and zhang 2013 aocl and aobr concentrations in real water have been found to significantly correlate with cytotoxicity r 0 94 p 0 01 but the concentrations of specific dbps in chlorinated real water have not been found to correlate with cytotoxicity allen et al 2022 aobr concentrations have been found to be related to the mutagenicity of chlorinated water and smaller amounts of aobr have been found to be produced while fewer chromosome aberrations occurred in slightly alkaline solutions than non alkaline solutions echigo et al 2004 bromide ions can affect the toxicity of disinfected reclaimed water by being involved in pharmaceuticals transformation pathways and causing br dbps to form during ozonation kim et al 2020 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 but few studies of the effects of sunlight on changes in toxicity in reclaimed water have been performed the aim of this study was to improve our understanding of the processes that occur during the solar irradiation of ozonated wastewater containing bromide and the risks posed by the products in the study 1 the effects of sunlight on aobr evolution were assessed 2 the effects of solar irradiation on toxicity to mammalian cells were determined and 3 the wavelength range s causing changes in the aobr concentrations and cytotoxicity were identified 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sampling and analysis water samples i and ii were effluents from secondary treatment systems in an anaerobic anoxic oxic process municipal sewage treatment plant in shenzhen china they were collected in april and august respectively to represent reclaimed water in summertime shenzhen each water sample was passed through a 0 45 Âµm cellulose acetate membrane filter and stored at 2 4 c the water quality of each sample was determined immediately after sampling the doc concentration was determined using a toc l total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu kyoto japan the bromide and bromate concentrations were determined using an ion chromatograph fitted with a dionex aquion ionpac as19 column thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa the bromide and bromate quantitation limits were 10 and 5 Âµg l respectively the nh4 concentration was determined using an hi96700 photometer hanna instruments italy one way analyses of variance two way analyses of variance and kruskal wallis tests were performed using origin 2022 software academic version the water quality data are shown in table 1 2 2 ozonation and simulated sunlight irradiation experiments ozonation experiments were performed by adding saturated ozonated ultrapure water generated using an atlas 30 ozone generator absoluteozone canada to aliquots of reclaimed water the ozone concentration in the saturated ozonated ultrapure water was determined using a pth 043 ozone analyzer palintest uk the ozone dose was 5 mg o3 l which was almost 1 mg o3 mg doc after 2 h ozonation the residual ozone was quenched by adding a 1 05 stoichiometric amount of ascorbic acid du et al 2017 kanofsky and sima 1995 an aliquot of reclaimed water was sealed in a quartz glass tube light transmittance 90 and placed in the water tank of a photochemical reactor equipped with an xpa 7 1000w xenon lamp xujiang nanjing china the water tank contained circulating water that was kept at 25 0 5 c the light intensity received by the water sample was similar to the natural light intensity in summertime shenzhen china the total simulated sunlight intensity was set to be 60 mw cm2 simulating the midday intensity accessed by pl mw2000 optical power meter perfect light china schematic diagrams of light intensity detection were shown in figure s1a and s1b the middle in the shaft section of quartz reactors directed to the xenon lamp was measured as a single point optical power then the light intensity was calculated by the single point optical power divided by the effective measure are of the optical power meter and adjust the light current to make the ultimate light power meet the set value the lit period was 8 h to mimic a natural daylight period of 09 00 to 17 00 which is the typical daylight period in southern china when the sky is clear the lamp emission spectrum was shown in figure s1c and the light relative intensity 290 nm was less than 5 therefore the light 290 nm was not considered to be blocked to investigate the effects of different wavelengths filters were placed between the light source and quartz glass tube to allow only 400 nm visible light or 365 nm uv to be transmitted the intensity of visible light and uv were measured under filters which were surrounded the xenon lamp at a distance of 1 cm and the results were 54 mw cm2 and 6 mw cm2 respectively by pl mw2000 optical power meter 2 3 determining aobr and br dbp concentrations the aobr concentration was determined by adsorption pyrolysis using a multi 2500 system analytik jena jena germany the sample was adjusted to ph 2 by adding hno3 before the test was performed and was then stored at 4 c the test was performed within 3 d of the ph being adjusted a sample was passed through an activated carbon column which was then rinsed with a nano3 solution containing 0 7 hno3 to remove inorganic halogen the activated carbon column was then combusted at 950 c for 15 min the hydrogen halide gas that was produced during combustion was dissolved in ultrapure water the bromide content of the solution was then determined by ion chromatography as described in section 2 1 and the aobr concentration was calculated the dibromo p benzoquinone aobr standard recovery was 92 each sample was analyzed in triplicate regulated br dbps were determined as described in a previous publication wang et al 2021b briefly a liquid liquid extraction was performed to concentrate the br dbps and then the br dbps were determined by gas chromatography with electron capture detection using a qp2010 plus system agilent technologies santa clara ca usa the tribromomethane retention time was 15 29 min db5 ms column agilent technologies 2 4 toxicity analysis water samples were prepared by performing solid phase extractions using a method described in a previous publication wu et al 2021 briefly the water sample were adjusted to ph 2 0 02 with 4 m hcl and passed through activated hlb cartridges oasis waters the cartridges were dried up by nitrogen gas and eluted with 5 ml methanol 2 ml acetone and 2 ml dichloromethane in order the eluted solution was dried by nitrogen gas and the concentrated samples were stored in 20 c waiting for toxicity assays the toxicity tests were performed using the chinese hamster ovary cell cho line cho k1 from the american type culture collection cho cells after two four passages were used in the toxicity assays species that cause intracellular oxidative stress reactive oxygen species ros and base oxidized modification products including 8 hydroxy deoxy guanosine 8 oh d g were determined using an imagexpress micro high content analysis system molecular devices sunnyvale ca usa as described in previous publications wu et al 2021 wu et al 2019 the details of 8 oh d g and ros bioassays can be found in text s2 the relative induction rate of 1 5 ir1 5 was calculated for each sample from dose response curves plotted using origin 2022 software the ir1 5 is the concentration factor giving 1 5 times the effect of the negative control the ir1 5 indicates clear ros and oxidative damage 8 oh d g responses in cells zhang et al 2021 the higher the ir1 5 the weaker the toxic effects cytotoxicity defined as the cell viability was determined using the cck 8 colorimetric method performed using a spectramax i3 system molecular devices as described in a previous publication wang et al 2021b the details of cytotoxicity bioassays can be found in text s2 the positive control was phenol and the cytotoxicity equivalent was calculated using the positive control results each toxicity assay was performed four six times the cytotoxicity equivalent was defined as the median lethal phenol positive control concentration 600 650 mg phenol l divided by the median lethal concentration of the sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 br dbp degradation during irradiation with sunlight 3 1 1 aobr as shown in fig 1 a and 1b the aobr concentrations in the ozonated water i and ii samples were similar 170 and 181 Âµg br l respectively solar irradiation degraded aobr in the ozonated reclaimed water irradiation with sunlight for 8 h decreased the aobr concentrations in the water i and ii samples by 53 and 74 respectively no marked change occurred in the dark control indicating that the effect of volatilization on the aobr concentration was negligible aocl concentration was around 10 Âµg cl l shown in figure s4 and did not change significantly during solar irradiation therefore we did not consider aocl in further study the bromide concentration in the raw reclaimed water was below the detection limit as shown in table 1 and br was spiked into the samples to give a concentration of 2 mg br l the organic bromine bromate and bromine residue concentrations are shown on a bromide basis in fig 1c and 1d during irradiation the main species for which the concentrations changed were aobr and bromide the bromate concentration did not markedly change the sum of the bromide bromate and aobr concentrations in each sample was similar to the total bromide dose indicating that bromide became detached from aobr through photolytic dehalogenation similarly in a previous study suwannee river fulvic acid at a concentration of 3 mg c l was oxidized by hbro at a concentration of 2 mg br l after 6 h of irradiation and the aobr concentration decreased from 270 to 108 Âµg br l abusallout and hua 2016a the pseudo first order rate constants k for aobr degradation through photolysis we found were 0 09 and 0 17 h 1 for water i and ii respectively the reclaimed water remained at ph 7 2 throughout the solar irradiation process the aobr photolysis rate constants were similar to the rate constant of 0 119 h 1 found at ph 7 in a previous study abusallout and hua 2016a as shown in fig 2 c our results indicated that aobr photolysis in reclaimed water were similar to that in ultrapure water formed from model organic matter the further study on the influence of reclaimed water matrix is suggested to be conducted 3 1 2 typical br dbps we tested the trihalomethanes bromodichloromethane chlorodibromomethane and tribromomethane we detected tribromomethane the detection limit was 0 1 Âµg l the tribromomethane concentrations were decreased from 21 to 22 to 0 8 0 6 Âµg l by 8 h of irradiation the results for the dark control indicated that negligible volatilization occurred the tribromomethane concentrations were in the low Âµg l range but 8 h irradiation degraded 97 and 96 of the tribromomethane in water i and ii respectively the calculated photolysis rate constants for water i and ii were 0 47 and 0 42 h 1 respectively these values were similar to the tribromomethane photolysis rate of 0 32 h 1 found for a natural sunlight intensity of 115 130 mw cm2 found between times of 11 00 and 15 00 in a previous study chen et al 2010 however a tribromomethane photolysis rate of 0 095 h 1 has been found for outdoor solar irradiation at between 108 7 and 113 9 mw cm2 abusallout and hua 2016b this would have been because dehalogenation kinetics reflect dehalogenation but not dbp transformations caused by irradiation with sunlight during dehalogenation for instance the halogen atoms can become associated with organic ligands in sea water and therefore increase the organic halogen concentration to 10 4 mol br mol c mÃ©ndez dÃ­az et al 2014 so specific dbps dehalogenation kinetics vary from degradation kinetics low photolysis rates have been found for tribromomethane 5 3 10 3 h 1 and tribromoacetic acid 6 9 10 4 h 1 lifongo et al 2004 the differences would have been caused by the mercury lamp emission 400 nm used in the study performed by lifongo et al 2004 not emitting uv even though the light intensity was the same as in the other study as shown in fig 2c the photolysis rates during solar irradiation decreased in the order i dbps br dbps cl dbps haloacetic acids and halomethanes are photolyzed faster the more cl br and i substituents are present a halomethane will be photolyzed 10 to 100 times faster than the halophenol or haloacetic acid with the same number of halogen substituents halomethane photolysis rates are similar to haloacetonitrile photolysis rates the residual dbps after irradiation may therefore include halophenols and haloacetic acids which are more photostable than halomethanes but at low concentrations e g tens of ng l zhang et al 2021 bromoform was taken as a proof that one of the br dbps was degraded under sunlight irradiation and further studies on bulk br dbps are suggested 3 2 effects of the sunlight wavelength on aobr elimination the results for photolysis of water i and ii by visible light only and uv only are shown in fig 3 the aobr concentrations in water i and ii decreased by 8 after 4 h of irradiation with visible light the aobr concentrations in water i and ii decreased by 29 and 17 respectively after 4 h of irradiation with uv this indicated that the aobr species in water i may have contained more uv sensitive components which would be photolyzed first than the aobr in water ii water i and water ii contained ammonia at a concentration of 0 23 and 0 35 mg n l respectively so n dbps including anilines e g bromoaniline were probably produced anilines were produced from suwannee river natural organic matter ozonated in the presence of bromide and ammonia determined in a study involving stable isotope labeling and high resolution mass spectrometry lu et al 2021b similarly bromophenylacetonitrile has been found at concentrations of 162 1221 ng l in ozonated wastewater treatment plant effluents by two dimensional gas chromatography quadrupole mass spectrometry and electron capture detection zhang et al 2021 uv alone has been found to degrade aniline k 0 6 h 1 uv intensity 12 85 mw cm2 and transform the aniline into various organic products zhao et al 2013 the induction effect of bromine decreases the electron cloud density of the phenol ring in bromoaniline meaning bromoaniline is less readily decomposed by uv at a low light intensity than a high light intensity bromophenylacetonitrile is expected to be photolyzed by uv more slowly than aniline because the cn bond energy is stronger than the c n bond energy meaning the cn bond is harder to break than the c n bond weast et al 1984 halonitromethanes are photolyzed quickly k 0 48 4 8 h 1 by uv 254 nm 0 153 w l as long as the ph is close to the pka of the halonitromethane 6 0 7 6 because uv is absorbed much more strongly by the deprotonated forms with conjugation systems than by the non deprotonated forms making the deprotonated forms more susceptible to photodegradation fang et al 2013 we speculated that the ph of 7 2 we used enhanced n dbp photolysis by uv the contributions of different sunlight wavelengths to aobr dehalogenation through photolysis in 8 h of irradiation are shown in fig 3c three times more aobr in both water i and ii was degraded by uv than visible light visible light contributed 25 27 and uv contributed 65 66 of photolysis of aobr in water i and ii by the full wavelength range see section 3 1 1 aobr was more strongly degraded by uv than visible light aox in chlorinated water was also found to be more strongly degraded by uv irradiation than visible light irradiation huang et al 2019 visible light affects 2 of the known dbp formation potential wu et al 2016 the uv contributions shown in fig 3c would have been caused by the water samples mainly absorbing uv light and barely absorbing visible light fig s2 the visible light and uv contributions would have had two main causes first the uv and sunlight irradiation results indicated that trihalomethanes and haloacetic acid are photolyzable by sunlight but barely degraded by uv trihalomethanes have been found to be hardly photolyzed by uv 254 nm which degraded 5 of chbr3 chcl2br chclbr2 and chcl3 at ph 7 5 nicole et al 1991 haloacetic acids are photolyzed slowly 10 2 h 1 by uv because uv photons are hardly absorbed and c c and c cl bonds are not readily broken wang et al 2020 second dbps were not completely degraded to inorganic matter by irradiation but dehalogenation by visible light may have occurred because visible light is nine times more intense than uv in sunlight photochemical reduction involving dehalogenation of amines occurs readily through electron donor acceptor complexes involving the substrate and reductant rather than photocatalysts rathnayake and weaver 2019 there remain unknown complex aobr mixtures but we concluded that uv most strongly contributes to aobr degradation through solar irradiation and visible light contributes less 3 3 evolution of toxicity during irradiation with sunlight 3 3 1 intracellular oxidative stress intracellular oxidative stress involving ros can occur through cell responses to toxic pollutants and is regarded as being a highly responsive mammalian cell defense mechanism deng et al 2022 escher et al 2014 the ros concentration effect curves for water i and ii irradiated for 8 h are shown in fig 4 the results at 0 and 8 h were used to assess intracellular ros and oxidative damage the results of the statistical analyses are shown in table s1 ozonation can decrease water sample effect on cho intracellular oxidative stress jia et al 2015 however ozonating reclaimed water in the presence of bromide induced intracellular ros in our study the ir1 5 values for water i and ii being 28 and 11 respectively in the dark tests the results were no different at 0 and 8 h exposure to sunlight caused the ir1 5 values for water i and ii to increase to 112 and 114 respectively which were 3 9 and 10 4 times higher respectively than the values for the initial samples this indicated that irradiation with sunlight strongly impacted reclaimed water to cause less intracellular ros solar irradiation also influences the effluent to induce decreased intracellular ros concentrations in cho cells in a previous study du et al 2018b intracellular ros delays mitophagy and results in cell death so the intracellular ros concentration is useful for predicting changes in cytotoxicity brambilla et al 2020 girard et al 2008 3 3 2 intracellular oxidative damage base modification is the most common type of dna damage and guanosine g is the most susceptible base to oxidation because it has a lower oxidative potential than adenine cytosine and thymine guanine is vulnerable to attack by radicals and is hydroxylated to 8 oh d g zhang et al 2021 reclaimed water has a complex composition and can induce 8 oh d g formation in dna and rna xu et al 2020b the concentration effect curves for 8 oh d g before and after 8 h of irradiation of water i and ii are shown in fig 5 water i and ii after solar irradiation decreased the amount of 8 oh d g in the cho cells the concentration effect curve shifted to the right after irradiation the curves were similar to the curves for the dark control and initial samples with solar irradiation reclaimed water caused the ir1 5 values for water i and ii to increase to 2 9 and 6 8 times respectively compared to the ir1 5 values for the initial samples i e at 0 h indicating that irradiation of the water prevented 8 oh d g forming in the cho cells these results were similar to the ros induction results the statistical analysis results are shown in table s1 water i and ii induced intracellular oxidative stress as mentioned in section 3 3 1 and 8 oh d g formation was a possible result the water irradiated with sunlight decreased the amount of 8 oh d g that formed by decreasing the intracellular ros concentration induced by toxic compounds degrading toxic compounds will decrease oxidative damage specifically removing furanone and other toxic compounds that are present in reclaimed water will decrease oxidative stress and cause less 8 oh d g to form assays using calf thymus dna indicated that 2 5 furanone caused hydroxyl radicals to be produced from hydrogen peroxide and enhanced 8 oh d g production murakami et al 2007 chlorinated furanone compounds are genotoxic to mammalian cells mÃ¤ki paakkanen et al 2004 the ros concentration was significantly higher in the presence of bromide than in the absence of bromide in reclaimed water in a previous study wu et al 2019 this indicated that aobr degradation by solar irradiation could decrease oxidative damage indicated by 8 oh d g 3 3 3 cytotoxicity the concentration effect curves for cytotoxicity for water i and ii are shown in fig 6 the ozonated reclaimed water was cytotoxic the lc50 being 24 0 34 3 mg phenol l as shown in fig 6a the concentration effect curves moved to the right and the lc50 increased as the irradiation time increased indicating that cytotoxicity decreased the concentration effect curves for the dark control samples did not markedly change over time the lc50 was converted into a phenol toxicity equivalent to indicate cytotoxicity and the results are shown in fig 6b the cytotoxicities for water i after exposure to sunlight for 0 2 4 and 8 h were 24 0 7 9 5 7 and 4 9 mg phenol l respectively i e exposure to sunlight for 2 4 and 8 h decreased the cytotoxicity by 66 7 76 5 and 79 3 respectively the one way analyses of variance results indicated that the cytotoxicities for water i after exposure to sunlight for 2 4 and 8 h were significantly different to the cytotoxicity before exposure to sunlight p 0 05 the decrease in toxicity caused by irradiation was very statistically significant p 0 001 but there were no significant differences between the toxicities after the different numbers of hours of irradiation 2 4 and 8 h kruskal wallis tests indicated that the difference between the toxicities after 8 h irradiation and no irradiation was more statistically significant p 0 0134 than the differences between the toxicities after 2 and 4 h irradiation and no irradiation the water ii results followed a similar trend it is possible that degradation of toxic dbps contributes to changes in toxicity through photolysis taking the results presented in section 3 1 into account we concluded that some less toxic dbps were photolyzed quickly and the remaining aobr species were photostable and toxic in a previous study it was found that halomethanes are two three orders of magnitude less toxic in terms of developmental toxicity than haloacetic acids and halophenols to the marine polychaete platynereis dumerilii yang and zhang 2013 halophenols are one three orders of magnitude more toxic than haloacetic acids to the autotrophic marine alga tetraselmis marina liu and zhang 2014 haloacetonitriles are generally more toxic than haloacetic acids and halonitromethanes to cho cells and haloacetonitriles should be of concern because their concentrations correlate with the toxicity of chlorinated water allen et al 2022 muellner et al 2007 it seems that photostable dbps halophenols and haloacetic acids are more toxic than photosensitive dbps halomethanes and haloacetonitriles irradiation with sunlight transforms dbp precursors and toxic compounds in reclaimed water and therefore decreases the toxicity for example the cytotoxicity of effluent to cho cells was decreased from 6 5 to 4 5 mg phenol l by irradiation with sunlight for 12 h du et al 2018a the dbp precursors tyrosine and tryptophan in reclaimed water are transformed into kynurenine and tryptamine respectively by irradiation with sunlight wu et al 2016 in our study exposure to sunlight made the ozonated reclaimed water less toxic to cho cells and this was positively related to decreases in the aobr concentration as shown in fig 6e r2 0 69 p 0 05 water i and ii followed the same trend and the proportion by which the aobr concentration decreased correlated with the proportion by which the cytotoxicity decreased it indicated that solar irradiation decreased the aobr concentration in the ozonated reclaimed water and the cytotoxicity induced by reclaimed water decreases proportionally photoconversion of dbps in chlorinated wastewater triggered by photonucleophilic substitution of chlorine atoms with hydroxide ions in the receiving seawater has been found to be a detoxification process liu et al 2017 dehalogenation through photolysis gives products that are less toxic than the original compounds we found that ozonation removed most of the species that fluoresced and absorbed uv at 254 nm from the reclaimed water as shown in figures s2 and s3 irradiation did not change the amount of fluorescence or absorbtion of uv at 254 nm 3 4 effects of sunlight in different wavelength ranges on decreases in toxicity as shown in fig 7 intracellular ros 8 oh d g and cytotoxicity induced by reclaimed water clearly decreased through irradiation with uv but did not decrease as much through irradiation with visible light the ir1 5 values for intracellular ros were 95 105 for reclaimed water irradiated with uv but 21 28 for reclaimed water irradiated with visible light the 8 oh d g results were similar the ir1 5 values being 106 84 for reclaimed water irradiated with uv and 11 18 for reclaimed water irradiated with visible light cytotoxicity was decreased 10 times more effectively by reclaimed water irradiated with uv than visible light the results of the statistical analyses are shown in table s2 these results confirmed that uv contributed much more than visible light to influence reclaimed water to induce less toxicity the lc50 and ir1 5 values for the dark controls and reclaimed water irradiated with visible light were similar indicating that visible light weakly affected reclaimed water induced toxicity intracellular ros and 8 oh d g were affected similarly by uv and sunlight irradiated reclaimed water we concluded that uv is the dominant wavelength range in sunlight that affects the water toxicity uv is the main wavelength range responsible for photolyzing dbps and other organic micropollutants that are toxic so irradiation with uv can strongly affect the toxicity of water as shown in section 3 2 uv rather than visible light was found to be mainly responsible for degrading aobr uv in sunlight converts triclosan the main absorbance wavelength range of which is 200 300 nm into 2 8 dichlorodibenzo p dioxin which is far more toxic than the parent molecule buth et al 2010 similarly pharmaceutical mixtures main absorbance wavelengths 400 nm are generally more toxic to the luminescent marine bacterium vibrio fischeri after than before solar irradiation wang and lin 2014 irradiation with uv decreases the toxicity of chlorinated reclaimed water to cho cells markedly huang et al 2019 lv et al 2017 the results of the studies mentioned above and our study indicate that uv in sunlight is the main wavelength range responsible for changing the toxicity of reclaimed water 4 conclusions solar irradiation degrades dbps and decreases the toxicity of reclaimed water however ozonation in the presence of bromide produces toxic aobr species that pose risks to aquatic organisms and humans when reclaimed water is recycled the results of this study improved our understanding of the effects of solar irradiation on ozonated reclaimed water by changing the aobr concentration and toxicity the main conclusions are shown below 1 sunlight decreased the aobr concentration through dehalogenation photolysis in the presence of bromide ozonation of reclaimed water caused aobr to form irradiation with sunlight decreased the aobr concentration in the reclaimed water through dehalogenation photolysis tribromomethane a regulated br dbp was found to be degraded by irradiation 2 irradiation with sunlight decreased the intracellular ros concentrations and oxidative damage 8 oh d g induced in mammalian cells by reclaimed water this indicated that reclaimed water irradiated with sunlight decreased intracellular oxidative dna damage 3 cytotoxicity the overall indicator of intracellular ros and oxidative damage was decreased by reclaimed water irradiated with sunlight the decreases in cytotoxicity were related to the decreases in aobr concentrations aobr degradation very likely results in a decrease in cytotoxicity 4 uv in sunlight is mainly responsible for decreasing aobr and decreasing reclaimed water induced toxicity during irradiation uv clearly contributes more than visible light to aobr photolysis declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have
