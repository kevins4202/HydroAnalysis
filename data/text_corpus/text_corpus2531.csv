successfully fabricated by combining a high performance engineering polyarylene ether nitrile pen with polydopamine pda and silver nanoparticles ag nps the employed pen has comprehensive performance in thermoresistant anti corrode and mechanical properties which was expected to be a robust polymer matrix ag nps were loaded on pen electrospinning nanofibrous membranes via pda coating and in situ growth morphological measurements revealed a hierarchical structure of fabricated ag pda pen membrane with ag nps formed in situ covered on the surface the particle size of ag nps was mainly in the range of 50 85 nm and the diameter of pen fiber was located at 0 39 μm the water contact angle ca of membranes increased from 30o to 130o by the increasing ag nps formation as a result the prepared composite membranes reached 4978 71 l m2h and 99 for permeate flux and good retention rate for oil water emulsion separation respectively moreover the high performance pen further endowed the tough stability and durability of the obtained composite membranes which can tolerate corrosive emulsions resist high temperatures and maintain a high separation efficiency after cycle reuse furthermore the

provide the fabricated robust ag pda pen electrospinning nanofibrous membrane a broad prospect for purifying water resources especially industrial wastewater treatment under harsh conditions keywords oil water separation membrane based technology polyarylene ether nitrile anti bacterial harsh environment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction oil water sewage is discharged from various industrial factories including the petrochemical industry iron works and food processing which are usually polluted with corrosive high temperature biofouling and heavy metal ion pollution 1 2 therefore developing separation technology with superior performance has become an urgent requirement to address this complex wastewater treatment issue membrane based technologies have emerged as promising candidates 3 4 compared to traditional technologies such as ultrasonic separation 5 centrifugal separation adsorption method biological treatment and electrochemical treatment 6 7 membrane based separation technology stands out because of its high efficiency low cost rich raw materials diverse functions and large scale separation treatment ability 8 10 the separation membranes are produced using various techniques e g phase inversion melt blowing forcespinning and casting method 11 among them electrospinning technology has attracted much attention due to the features of effective fabrication morphology controllable high surface to volume ration polyporous and easy to be multi factionalized 10 12 generally the core membranes can be fabricated using ceramic metallic polymeric and composite materials 13 hereinto polymeric membranes are easier to process than ceramic membranes and are more resistant to acid and alkali corrosion than metallic membranes 1 14 as a result polymers with different surface wettabilities and characteristics such as polyether sulfone pes polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf polystyrene ps polyurethane pu polyvinyl alcohol pva and polydimethylsiloxane pdms have been employed to fabricate polymer or polymer based hybrid oil water separation membranes 14 21 compared to the widely studied polymeric membrane materials mentioned above polyarylene ether nitrile pen is an emerging high performance polymeric material with high tech fields requiring materials with excellent thermal stability high corrosion resistance oxidative stability low dielectric constant good mechanical properties and well processability 22 26 specifically common pens have glass transition temperatures located in 148 313 c and thermal decomposition temperatures beyond 450 c and casting film tensile strength over 80 mpa 27 28 therefore membrane materials prepared from pen are expected to be suitable for harsh environments with high temperature high pressures and strong acid and alkali corrosion recently pen has been fabricated as membrane using several strategies to explore its promising applications in membrane technology for example high quantum yields fluorescent membrane through electrospinning technology nanocomposites reinforced membrane by hybrid electrospinning technology organic dyes adsorption and degradation porous membrane via phase inversion method ultralow permittivity porous membrane though delayed phase inversion for 5g communication system and stable matrix via electrospinning technology for pollutant oil water separation 29 31 especially zhan et al provided a pen copolymer nanofiber coating with halloysite nanotubes intercalated graphene oxide and polydopamine which exhibited a flux of 1130 56 l m2h oil rejection over 99 tolerance corrosion and thermal stability 32 these studies depicted the possibility of pen as a candidate membrane material that can be applied in harsh environments after a widely rang of electrospinning oil water separation membrane research so far the focus has been tuned to the study of materials and preparation strategies with excellent comprehensive performance to adapt the complex water pollution especially some harsh environments current polymeric materials such as pvdf and pes have successfully been investigated to prepare robust durable membrane materials for water treatment in harsh environments because of their inherent thermal stability and corrosion resistance 21 33 however biofouling is a more widespread problem that requires attention in addition to corrosions and high temperatures the presence of microorganism colonies not only causes severe infections and is harmful to human health but also forms biofilms on the surface of the membrane hindering filtration 33 hence some separation membranes with antimicrobial behavior by introducing antimicrobial components such as silver nanoparticles ag nps and zinc oxide zno have been investigated 34 36 geng et al 37 prepared a unique pvdf electrospun membrane decorated by zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 zif8 with anti bacterial ability high separation efficiency 99 5 0 1 corrosive resistant ability ph 1 13 and salinity and emulsion flux above 1100 l m2h in the study of chen et al 34 pes employed to be modified by blend with poly acrylic acid paa and further decorated by ag nps the fabricate multifunctional membranes shown water flux up to 5142 l m2h and killing ratios of 93 4 and 95 7 to gram negative and gram positive bacterial as well as corrosive resistant however lack of evaluation of high temperature availability this may due to the employee of superhydrophilic paa blend to fabricate fibrous skeleton which reduces the thermoresistance to a certain extent in addition the anti bacterial components are usually metal based material some of them would be released into the treated water due to poor compatibility and cause secondary pollution the plugging of pores caused by anti bacterial ingredients as well as their general poor wettability to oil in water emulsions can lead to a significant decrease in permeation flux 38 at present the publish reports on fabrication comprehensive performance electrospinning membranes with overall evaluation are rare herein a multifunctional ag pda pen nanofibrous membrane was fabricated to tolerate the complex and harsh practical environment including acid and alkali corrosion long term resistance to bacterial contamination high temperature by combining a high performance pen electrospun support skeleton and anti bacterial ag nps a schematic diagram of the preparation and separation process is displayed in fig 1 we employed a commercial pen with comprehensive mechanical and chemical stability as the support skeleton via electrospinning technology and a hot pressing process to change the wettability of pen from hydrophobic to hydrophilic the electrospun membrane was immersed in a solution of dopamine and tris hcl before being adhered with polymeric dopamine polydopamine pda consequently the obtained preliminary composite pda pen became a water selective filter owing to its hydrophilic surface finally ag nps modification of the above membrane by the in situ reduction method further endowed the obtained membrane with anti bacterial properties after systematic evaluation the obtained composite membrane demonstrated high separation efficiency and oil rejection for oil water emulsions whether in a corrosive environment or high temperature with good reusability and excellent anti bacterial performance accordingly the fabricated ag pda pen composite membrane perform as a multifunctional water purification material with broad application prospects in harsh environments 2 experiment 2 1 materials the employed polyarylene ether nitrile pen was bisphenol a bpa type pen pen bpa which was obtained from sichuan energy investment

tested on a tensile strength test machine yh l 200a 2 3 preparation of pen electrospinning nanofibrous membrane pen nanofibrous membrane was prepared using electrospinning technology first 1 g of the pen bpa powder was dissolved in 5 ml of dmf the mixture was then heated and magnetically stirred for 2 h the homogeneous solution was then collected using a syringe and placed on an electrostatic spinning machine with a spinning voltage of 20 kv pushing speed of 0 0007 mm s and receiver speed of 300 rpm the distance between the receiver and needle was 18 cm an aluminum foil cover on the drum receiver collected the pen electrospun nanofibers electrostatic spinning was then continued for 10 h to ensure that the pen nanofibrous membrane on the aluminum foil reached a sufficient thickness subsequently the membrane was removed from the receiver and dried in an oven at 80 c for 24 h after drying the pen nanofibrous membrane was removed from the aluminum foil and hot pressed between two glass plates at 180 c for 15 min to obtain a pen nanofibrous membrane with a certain toughness 2 4 preparation of pda pen electrospinning nanofibrous membranes dopamine solids were dissolved in tris hcl buffer ph 8 5 at a concentration of 0 7 mg ml then a piece of pen nanofibrous membrane 5 5 cm was placed into the configured solution and removed after magnetic stirring at a constant temperature of 25 c in a water bath for 6 h subsequently 20 ml of polymerized polydopamine was filtered through a sand core extraction funnel the purpose was to load polydopamine into the pen nanofibrous membrane s interior further improving the s hydrophilicity of the membrane after filtration the membranes were placed in a water bath and magnetically stirred for 12 h finally the samples were rinsed with deionized water and dried in an oven at 80 c for 24 h to obtain the pda pen nanofibrous membranes for next process of ag nps modification 2 5 preparation of ag pda pen electrospinning nanofibrous membranes different concentrations of agno3 solutions were prepared in advance 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 5 1 2 5 and 5 mm the dried pda pen nanofibrous membranes were immersed in different concentrations of agno3 solutions and stirred at 30 c for 24 h in a water bath then the membranes have been loaded with ag ions ag then the pretreated membrane adsorbed with ag would be reduced by 0 1 mol l ascorbic acid solution aa to form ag nps in situ finally ag pda pen nanofibrous membranes fabricated from different concentrations of ag were obtained by drying them in an oven at 60 c for 24 h the ag pda pen electrospinning nanofibrous membranes prepared with ag tuned from 0 01 mm to 5 mm were named as follow m 1 for 0 01 mm m 2 for 0 05 mm m 3 for 0 1 mm m 4 for 0 5 mm m 5 for 1 mm m 6 for 2 5 mm and m 7 for 5 mm see more details and intuitive in table s1 2 6 oil water emulsion separation experiment before the separation experiment the oil water emulsion was prepared by blending the oil components n hexane and petroleum ether deionized water h2o and a surfactant stabilizer sodium dodecyl sulfate sds in particular the volume ratio of h2o to oil components was 100 1 while the sds concentration was 0 05 mg ml stable oil water emulsions were obtained via the sonication dispersion process for 30 min at room temperature subsequently the oil water emulsions with a specific volume 100 ml were poured into the solution reservoir of a dead end filtration system the separation process was started after the system s pressure reached 0 06 mpa and ran at room temperature finally calculated permeation flux j by the following eq 1 1 j v a t 100 where v is the volume through the membrane a is the effective filtration area t is the time of the oil water liquid assed through the membrane 2 7 evaluation of anti bacterial performance the bactericidal ability of the ag pda pen nanofibrous membranes was evaluated using e coli bacteria via the reverse laminating method pda pen was used as the control experiments before the start of the experiment the ag pda pen membrane was repeatedly rinsed with distilled water to remove surface debris and then dried for use the specific operation method is as follows typically ag pda pen nanofibrous membrane was inoculated with a certain amount of bacterial fluid and then covered with a polyethylene membrane to prevent liquid volatilization the cells were incubated for 24 h at 25 c the concentration of e coli bacteria in suspension was 6 7 105 cfu ml subsequently the bacteria solution was recovered and cultured in soya casein digest lecithin polysorbate broth scdlp the test membrane was washed four times with scdlp to thoroughly recover the bacterial liquid thoroughly before the viable count the bacteria suspension was diluted 10 times in phosphate buffer saline pbs then calculated the anti bacterial rate r by the following eq 2 2 r n 0 n n 0 100 where n0 is the number of live bacteria of blank and n is the number of live bacteria of testing samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of ag pda pen electrospinning nanofibrous membranes the employed electrospun polymer matrix was fabricated using pen bpa a relatively mature commercial pen type with comprehensive performance to evaluate the basic characteristics of pen bpa ft ir 1h nmr and molecular weight analyses were performed to determine its chemical structure thermogravimetric analysis tga and differential scanning calorimeter dsc were studied to analyze thermal resistance performance ft ir spectrum was shown as fig s1a in supplementary material the feature peak assignments of ether bond o were at 1250 cm 1 and 1028 cm 1 while feature peak of nitrile group cn was at 2240 cm 1 the peak at 2980 cm 1 was pertain to methyl ch3 in bpa monomer segment remain peaks 1610 cm 1 1585 cm 1 1510 cm 1 and 1468 cm 1 were belong to benzene ring skeleton based on 1h nmr spectrum revealed in fig s1b the corresponding formant analysis further provided the accurate chemical structure information of the employed pen bpa to some extent the polymer chain with no reactive functional groups established the basis of pen s ability to withstand harsh environments based on its unique chemical structure and stability meanwhile fig s1c indicates that the average molecular weight m n weight average molecular weight m w and polydispersity of pen bpa were 22 08 kda 54 78 kda and 2 48 respectively this sufficient molecular weight further ensures that the polymer is spinnable for fabricating electrospun membranes furthermore the thermal decomposition and differential scanning calorimetry curves fig s2 yielded a 5 weight loss decomposition temperature t 5 of 518 c while the glass transition temperature t g was 180 c above preliminary basic intrinsic results of the employed pen bpa guarantee that the fabricated polymer matrix with sufficient chemical stability and excellent thermal resistance is more likely to withstand subsequent experiments in a harsh environment first a pen nanofibrous membrane was fabricated by electrospinning followed by hot pressing process as mentioned in previous reports the purpose of post processing is to evaporate the remaining solvent and denser fluffy fibrous to enhance the mechanical strength 39 40 the prepared pen nanofibrous membrane continued to adhere to polydopamine to obtain a hydrophilic surface finally ag nps formed by the in situ reduction method were embedded on the membrane surface to endow bacteriostasis fig 2 displays sem images of the membranes at each stage to compare their morphologies as illustrated in fig 2a the prepared pen nanofibrous membrane without the hot pressing process was straight and slippy with an average diameter of 0 26 μm fig 2b after hot pressing the adjacent pen nanofibers are micro fused which changes the morphology of the fibers fig 2c consequently the nanofibrous membrane s morphology became flattened and bent slightly moreover the corresponding average diameter became larger to 0 39 μm fig 2d in terms of thickness variation after hot pressing the thickness of the membrane was compressed from 38 6 to 24 1 μm further confirming the membrane change from fluffy to dense by the hot pressing process after loading with polydopamine as displayed in fig 2e the surface of the modified pda pen nanofibrous membrane became rough owing to the attachment of the formed polydopamine it can be clearly observed that the dopamine coating on the fibers is patchy some sheet structures also appeared between adjacent fibers also appeared which were caused by the formation of polydopamine finally the sample was further modified by the in situ reduction reaction of agno3 at a concentration of 1 mm as a representative of ag pda pen when we investigated the surface of the membrane we found that some spheroidal particles were uniformly embedded in the fibers to further confirm that the particles loaded on the nanofibrous membrane surface were ag nps a part of the corresponding region fig 2g was measured using eds elemental mapping analysis the resulting image demonstrated in fig 2h verifies the presence and dispersion of ag indicating that ag nps with diameters mainly ranging from 50 to 85 nm were successfully deposited on the surface of the pen fibers fig 2i l depict the morphology images of ag nps loaded on pen fibers reduced by agno3 at concentrations of 0 1 0 5 2 5 and 5 mm respectively the number of ag nps on the fiber surface increased with increasing agno3 concentration ag nps were rare at concentrations as low as 0 01 and 0 05 mm of agno3 the presence of ag nps loaded onto the fiber surface was confirmed by further tests by spot scan of eds elemental analysis as indicated in fig s3 overall the ag nps were uniformly dispersed on the surface of each fiber on the other hand to observe the distribution of ag nps inside the fibrous membrane images of the cross section of m 7 were observed after the membrane was brittle with liquid nitrogen as shown in fig s4 the ag nps were mainly distributed on the surface layer because the pretreated pda pen floated on the solution of agno3 which caused the in situ reaction happened on the interface of the membrane the results of cross sectional results clearly show the hierarchical structure of the ag pda pen electrospinning nanofibrous membrane 3 2 wettability performance the wettability of the as prepared ag pda pen depends on several aspects including the hot pressing temperature hot pressing time dopamine concentration and ag concentration as a member of polyarylene either engineering polymer family enriched in benzene rings in the backbone such as polyarylene ether sulfone pes and polyarylene ether ketone pek pen is originally hydrophobic without being modified by the sulfonic acid group carboxyl group or other hydrophilic components 41 42 the hot processed pen nanofibrous membrane was initially hydrophobic with a water contact angle ca of 134o fig 3 because this work aimed to fabricate a water selective separation membrane polydopamine surface coating modification was employed to change the wettability of the polymer matrix moreover the pen nanofibrous membrane was pumped with da solution during the wettability modification not only does the polymerized pda firmly adhere to the surface but it also achieves the effect of embedding pda inside so more hydroxyl oh and amino groups nh nh2 were loaded onto the fiber membrane making the pen nanofibrous membrane more hydrophilic the final ca of pda pen was 19 fig 3 pda also served as a rough substrate for the attachment of the formed ag nps therefore the more pda coating the more ag nps attached however excess ag nps lead to the membrane becoming hydrophobic again then after several experimental investigations the optimal dopamine concentration was 0 7 mg ml which could endow the pen nanofibrous membrane with hydrophilic and ensure that the subsequent loading of ag nps will continue to maintain wettability after the ca value dropped from 134 drops to 20 due to pda modification the loading of ag nps increased again with increasing agno3 concentration from 0 01 to 5 mm the ca increased from 30 m 1 to 71 m 2 103 m 3 113 m 4 118 m 5 128 m 6 and 130 m 7 due to the construction of ag nps in addition the time dependent ca has been evaluated by taken m 3 m 5 and m 7 as typical samples as shown in fig s5 it can be observed that the ca of each sample tends to decrease to some extent however the fibrous membrane cannot be completely wetted in a short time which means the fabricated ag pda pen possess quite stable wettability the ca values were then tested for 200 s to study the time dependent properties of the prepared membranes the ca results of typical samples m 3 m 5 and m 7 showed 13 15 and 5 decrease in 200 s respectively consequently in the permeation test the fibrous membranes were completely wetted before use after the pre wetting process water flux data were obtained at 42 974 l m2l m 1 30 016 l m2l m 2 21 310 l m2l m 3 16 230 l m2l m 4 10 850 l m2l m 5 9 037 l m2l m 6 and 8 894 l m2l m 7 such excellent water flux results were comprehensively benefited by the hydrophilic modification of pda the porous structures constructed by pen nanofibrous membrane hierarchical structure fabricated via rough pda coating layer decorated with ag nps 43 3 3 oil water emulsion separation performance the separation performance of ag pda pen was tested using an oil water emulsion which is much more complex than an oil water mixture 44 the filtration results are exhibited in fig 4 the self made emulsion sample was a water packed n hexane emulsion volume ratio of n hexane to water was 1 100 fig 4a displays that the emulsion separation flux of ag pda pen was as high as 4978 71 l m2h prepared with the lowest agno3 concentration of 0 01 mm then the values gradually decrease with increasing concentration of agno3 from m 1 to m 7 and the trend matches the change in ca finally the emulsion separation flux of the ag pda pen prepared with the highest agno3 concentration reached 1863 47 l m2h meanwhile the oil water separation performance was further evaluated by observation of the test solutions and total organic carbon toc analysis first the colors of influent and effluent solutions were compared with the naked eye see the digital photograph of the as prepared n hexane water emulsion in fig 4b and the collected filtrate was separated by m 7 fig 4c the change from milky white to transparent indicates the successful separation of the oil water emulsion the naked eye can also easily observe the comparison of filtrates treated with other ag pda pen samples displayed in fig s6 more clearly the images observed by the electronic microscope are illustrated in fig 4b c influent emulsions had large numbers of oil droplets while no obvious droplets were present the toc test results were calculated as illustrated in fig 4d the rejection ratio of n hexane from n hexane water emulsion had reached 98 20 m 1 subsequently it was over 99 m 2 and gradually increased to as high as 99 28 m 7 the above high separation efficiencies were expected to be due to the high porosity of polymer matrix fabricated by electrospinning technology and the water selective permeability supported by the pda coating layer 12 38 concurrently the embedded ag nps on the fibers have a dual character on the one hand the blockage of surface pores attributed to the increasing amount of ag nps caused a decline in the emulsion flux on the other hand narrower pores hold more subtle oil droplets thus increasing the rejection ratio 3 4 durability performance in practical oil water separation applications which are often accompanied by acid base corrosive environments polar organic solvents high temperatures etc the fabricated composite membranes are expected to maintain stability in harsh environments to verify the durability of ag pda pen the rejection ratio results of the m 7 sample resisted strong acid ph 1 and strong alkali ph 14 emulsion petroleum ether water emulsions are demonstrated in fig 5a the separation efficiency of n hexane water emulsion maintained high performance with rejection ratios over than 99 for both corrosive emulsions precisely 99 37 at ph 1 and 99 67 at ph 14 meanwhile the corresponding composite membrane was also tested for its high rejection ratio 99 06 of petroleum ether ph 7 different ag pda pen membranes were employed for thermal resistant to separate n hexane water emulsions at 80 c fig s7 shows that the emulsion flux results ranged from 12 27 103 l m2h m 1 to 3 40 103 l m2h m 7 with a gradual decline the reason for the much higher emulsion flux at 80 c than at room temperature is probably due to the accelerated emulsion breaking caused by the high temperature in the separation process 45 the highly transparent collected effluent solution demonstrated that the ag pda pen membranes still possessed a high emulsion separation efficiency at high temperatures in addition the membrane is often contaminated during the oil water separation process which reduces the separation efficiency and reusability of the membrane 46 47 the n hexane water emulsion separation was repeated ten times on one m 7 membrane to demonstrate the robust durability of ag pda pen as displayed in fig 5b the rejection ratio tested after each time was above 99 and only decreased by 0 24 this indicates that ag pda pen maintained a high level efficiency after ten times separation meanwhile the corresponding fluxes of the n hexane water emulsions tested in the cycle also shown in fig 5b cycling tests showed that the separation membranes could be used at least ten times with 16 decline however the emulsion flux still maintains above 1624 l m2h above results exhibited the good recycling ability of fabricated ag pda pen electrospinning nanofibrous membrane in addition to study the physical stability of prepared membranes three samples of pen pen pda and m 5 were selected to test the tensile strength values and the influence of pda and ag nps modification due to the initial well mechanical of pen substrate and the adverse effect of porous structure pen exhibited a tensile strength at 4 82 mpa and with no significant changes after pda coating and ag nps loading fig s8 the corresponding results for pda pen and m 5 were 4 94 mpa and 4 53 mpa respectively as the tensile strength did not change significantly which indicates that the treated films still maintain mechanical properties to ensure the durability above results exhibited that ag pda pen nanofibrous membranes were durable with good chemical stability thermal resistance and reusability the convenient polymer chain of employed pen enriching aromatic rings ether bonds and nitrile groups results in excellent chemical thermal and dimensional stability the comprehensive performance of pen made itself suitable for acting as a fibrous support layer 48 49 in addition the covalent bonding and cross linking generated by the pda coating further improve the durability of membrane skeleton 50 51 the adhesive and metal binding ability of the phenolic hydroxyl groups in pda offers tight immobilization of ag nps redoubling the stability of the hierarchical structure 38 52 53 3 5 anti bacterial performance compared with other harsh environments biofouling is a broader issue in membrane based separation technologies the adhesion and subsequent reproduction of microorganisms are serious hazards to the long term use of membranes 54 in this case the ag pda pen membranes contain two components pda and ag nps which inhibit biofouling hereinto ag nps have been extensively used because they are easy to synthesize biologically harmless easy to control in topography and have a broad spectrum of anti bacterial activity 55 57 thus ag nps is an ideal candidate in the field of water treatment where bacterial contamination can be addressed 58 59 previous investigations demonstrated that pda acted as the hydrophilic layer and ag nps loading platform and proved anti adhesive properties upon microorganisms and anti bacterial properties in a certain way by endowing membrane surface with hydrophilicity and negative charge density 38 60 61 the main biofouling functionalization depends on ag nps which possess excellent anti bacterial activity but low toxicity to human cells 58 nevertheless the release of ag from ag pda pen membranes into filtrate during water treatment has been evaluated firstly the release of ag in water was examined on icp instrument after digestion with pure hno3 m 3 and m 5 were taken as the typical samples the levels of ag in water in the filtrates of m 3 and m 5 were 1 31 μg l and 2 23 μg l respectively the content of ag was very little which are far below the chinese standard of 50 μg l and the american standard of 100 μg l for ag in discharged wastewater in this study the anti bacterial performance of ag pda pen nanofibrous membranes was evaluated by counting the bactericidal ratio after contacting escherichia coli e coli photographs of the anti bacterial performance of ag pda pen constructed using agno3 at concentrations ranging from 0 01 to 5 mm were taken after a thousand fold dilution and 24 h of incubation as presented in fig 6a all ag pda pen nanofibrous membranes significantly differed in anti bacterial ability to inhibit e coli from the control group because of the intense anti bacterial activity of ag at low concentrations no colonies were observed on the plate and minimal ag nps were loaded on m 1 62 fig 6b illustrates the quantitative results and the rates of all membranes were above 99 99 the anti bacterial measurement in this study simulated the activity of bacteria on the surface of test membranes when the bacteria suspension covered the membrane s surface ag nps realized anti bacterial functionalization by adhering to the bacterial cell membrane and releasing silver ions leading to the damage of cellular membrane structure and activity of enzymes and finally causing apoptosis of bacteria 63 therefore the ag nps component immobilized on a fibrous membrane can kill bacteria in the oil water separation process promoting the long term performance of ag pda pen separation membrane furthermore when combined with previous permeation and separation performance the positive anti bacteria results demonstrated that ag pda pen with low silver content is a comprehensive one with high emulsion flux good rejection ratio and excellent anti bacterial performance in addition compared with other polymer based electronspun fibrous membranes see in table 1 the ag pda pen nanofibrous membranes exhibited quite comprehensive performance for oil water treatment the high efficiency of oil water emulsions separation thermal resistant corrosive resistant durability as well as high bacterial inhibition making ag pda pen show promise for applications in petroleum and industrial wastewater contaminated with microorganisms 4 conclusion a high performance engineering polymer pen was fabricated as a fibrous matrix using electrospinning technology and further modified with pda and ag nps to construct a multifunctional ag pda pen nanofibrous membrane for oil water emulsion separation the pda coating endowed the membrane with hydrophilicity achieving good permeability and separation ability for oil water emulsions depending on the initial chemical stability and thermal resistance of pen ag pda pen supported by polymer skeleton have sufficient toughness to suffer from strong acid ph 1 and alkali ph 14 emulsions polarity organic solvent water emulsions high temperature conditions and multiple reuses although ag nps generated in situ decreased the emulsion flux due to pore blockage they also improved oil rejection above all ag pda pen electrospinning nanofibrous membranes possessed strong bactericidal capacity 99 99 even with low content of ag nps which can resist biofouling in long term service based on these findings the developed long lasting ag pda pen electrospinning nanofibous membrane with anti corrosion anti heat and anti bacterial properties can be a potential high

to the features of effective fabrication morphology controllable high surface to volume ration polyporous and easy to be multi factionalized 10 12 generally the core membranes can be fabricated using ceramic metallic polymeric and composite materials 13 hereinto polymeric membranes are easier to process than ceramic membranes and are more resistant to acid and alkali corrosion than metallic membranes 1 14 as a result polymers with different surface wettabilities and characteristics such as polyether sulfone pes polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf polystyrene ps polyurethane pu polyvinyl alcohol pva and polydimethylsiloxane pdms have been employed to fabricate polymer or polymer based hybrid oil water separation membranes 14 21 compared to the widely studied polymeric membrane materials mentioned above polyarylene ether nitrile pen is an emerging high performance polymeric material with high tech fields requiring materials with excellent thermal stability high corrosion resistance oxidative stability low dielectric constant good mechanical properties and well processability 22 26 specifically common pens have glass transition temperatures located in 148 313 c and thermal decomposition temperatures beyond 450 c and casting film tensile strength over 80 mpa 27 28 therefore membrane materials prepared from pen are expected to be suitable for harsh environments with high temperature high pressures and strong acid and alkali corrosion recently pen has been fabricated as membrane using several strategies to explore its promising applications in membrane technology for example high quantum yields fluorescent membrane through electrospinning technology nanocomposites reinforced membrane by hybrid electrospinning technology organic dyes adsorption and degradation porous membrane via phase inversion method ultralow permittivity porous membrane though delayed phase inversion for 5g communication system and stable matrix via electrospinning technology for pollutant oil water separation 29 31 especially zhan et al provided a pen copolymer nanofiber coating with halloysite nanotubes intercalated graphene oxide and polydopamine which exhibited a flux of 1130 56 l m2h oil rejection over 99 tolerance corrosion and thermal stability 32 these studies depicted the possibility of pen as a candidate membrane material that can be applied in harsh environments after a widely rang of electrospinning oil water separation membrane research so far the focus has been tuned to the study of materials and preparation strategies with excellent comprehensive performance to adapt the complex water pollution especially some harsh environments current polymeric materials such as pvdf and pes have successfully been investigated to prepare robust durable membrane materials for water treatment in harsh environments because of their inherent thermal stability and corrosion resistance 21 33 however biofouling is a more widespread problem that requires attention in addition to corrosions and high temperatures the presence of microorganism colonies not only causes severe infections and is harmful to human health but also forms biofilms on the surface of the membrane hindering filtration 33 hence some separation membranes with antimicrobial behavior by introducing antimicrobial components such as silver nanoparticles ag nps and zinc oxide zno have been investigated 34 36 geng et al 37 prepared a unique pvdf electrospun membrane decorated by zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 zif8 with anti bacterial ability high separation efficiency 99 5 0 1 corrosive resistant ability ph 1 13 and salinity and emulsion flux above 1100 l m2h in the study of chen et al 34 pes employed to be modified by blend with poly acrylic acid paa and further decorated by ag nps the fabricate multifunctional membranes shown water flux up to 5142 l m2h and killing ratios of 93 4 and 95 7 to gram negative and gram positive bacterial as well as corrosive resistant however lack of evaluation of high temperature availability this may due to the employee of superhydrophilic paa blend to fabricate fibrous skeleton which reduces the thermoresistance to a certain extent in addition the anti bacterial components are usually metal based material some of them would be released into the treated water due to poor compatibility and cause secondary pollution the plugging of pores caused by anti bacterial ingredients as well as their general poor wettability to oil in water emulsions can lead to a significant decrease in permeation flux 38 at present the publish reports on fabrication comprehensive performance electrospinning membranes with overall evaluation are rare herein a multifunctional ag pda pen nanofibrous membrane was fabricated to tolerate the complex and harsh practical environment including acid and alkali corrosion long term resistance to bacterial contamination high temperature by combining a high performance pen electrospun support skeleton and anti bacterial ag nps a schematic diagram of the preparation and separation process is displayed in fig 1 we employed a commercial pen with comprehensive mechanical and chemical stability as the support skeleton via electrospinning technology and a hot pressing process to change the wettability of pen from hydrophobic to hydrophilic the electrospun membrane was immersed in a solution of dopamine and tris hcl before being adhered with polymeric dopamine polydopamine pda consequently the obtained preliminary composite pda pen became a water selective filter owing to its hydrophilic surface finally ag nps modification of the above membrane by the in situ reduction method further endowed the obtained membrane with anti bacterial properties after systematic evaluation the obtained composite membrane demonstrated high separation efficiency and oil rejection for oil water emulsions whether in a corrosive environment or high temperature with good reusability and excellent anti bacterial performance accordingly the fabricated ag pda pen composite membrane perform as a multifunctional water purification material with broad application prospects in harsh environments 2 experiment 2 1 materials the employed polyarylene ether nitrile pen was bisphenol a bpa type pen pen bpa which was obtained from sichuan energy investment

tested on a tensile strength test machine yh l 200a 2 3 preparation of pen electrospinning nanofibrous membrane pen nanofibrous membrane was prepared using electrospinning technology first 1 g of the pen bpa powder was dissolved in 5 ml of dmf the mixture was then heated and magnetically stirred for 2 h the homogeneous solution was then collected using a syringe and placed on an electrostatic spinning machine with a spinning voltage of 20 kv pushing speed of 0 0007 mm s and receiver speed of 300 rpm the distance between the receiver and needle was 18 cm an aluminum foil cover on the drum receiver collected the pen electrospun nanofibers electrostatic spinning was then continued for 10 h to ensure that the pen nanofibrous membrane on the aluminum foil reached a sufficient thickness subsequently the membrane was removed from the receiver and dried in an oven at 80 c for 24 h after drying the pen nanofibrous membrane was removed from the aluminum foil and hot pressed between two glass plates at 180 c for 15 min to obtain a pen nanofibrous membrane with a certain toughness 2 4 preparation of pda pen electrospinning nanofibrous membranes dopamine solids were dissolved in tris hcl buffer ph 8 5 at a concentration of 0 7 mg ml then a piece of pen nanofibrous membrane 5 5 cm was placed into the configured solution and removed after magnetic stirring at a constant temperature of 25 c in a water bath for 6 h subsequently 20 ml of polymerized polydopamine was filtered through a sand core extraction funnel the purpose was to load polydopamine into the pen nanofibrous membrane s interior further improving the s hydrophilicity of the membrane after filtration the membranes were placed in a water bath and magnetically stirred for 12 h finally the samples were rinsed with deionized water and dried in an oven at 80 c for 24 h to obtain the pda pen nanofibrous membranes for next process of ag nps modification 2 5 preparation of ag pda pen electrospinning nanofibrous membranes different concentrations of agno3 solutions were prepared in advance 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 5 1 2 5 and 5 mm the dried pda pen nanofibrous membranes were immersed in different concentrations of agno3 solutions and stirred at 30 c for 24 h in a water bath then the membranes have been loaded with ag ions ag then the pretreated membrane adsorbed with ag would be reduced by 0 1 mol l ascorbic acid solution aa to form ag nps in situ finally ag pda pen nanofibrous membranes fabricated from different concentrations of ag were obtained by drying them in an oven at 60 c for 24 h the ag pda pen electrospinning nanofibrous membranes prepared with ag tuned from 0 01 mm to 5 mm were named as follow m 1 for 0 01 mm m 2 for 0 05 mm m 3 for 0 1 mm m 4 for 0 5 mm m 5 for 1 mm m 6 for 2 5 mm and m 7 for 5 mm see more details and intuitive in table s1 2 6 oil water emulsion separation experiment before the separation experiment the oil water emulsion was prepared by blending the oil components n hexane and petroleum ether deionized water h2o and a surfactant stabilizer sodium dodecyl sulfate sds in particular the volume ratio of h2o to oil components was 100 1 while the sds concentration was 0 05 mg ml stable oil water emulsions were obtained via the sonication dispersion process for 30 min at room temperature subsequently the oil water emulsions with a specific volume 100 ml were poured into the solution reservoir of a dead end filtration system the separation process was started after the system s pressure reached 0 06 mpa and ran at room temperature finally calculated permeation flux j by the following eq 1 1 j v a t 100 where v is the volume through the membrane a is the effective filtration area t is the time of the oil water liquid assed through the membrane 2 7 evaluation of anti bacterial performance the bactericidal ability of the ag pda pen nanofibrous membranes was evaluated using e coli bacteria via the reverse laminating method pda pen was used as the control experiments before the start of the experiment the ag pda pen membrane was repeatedly rinsed with distilled water to remove surface debris and then dried for use the specific operation method is as follows typically ag pda pen nanofibrous membrane was inoculated with a certain amount of bacterial fluid and then covered with a polyethylene membrane to prevent liquid volatilization the cells were incubated for 24 h at 25 c the concentration of e coli bacteria in suspension was 6 7 105 cfu ml subsequently the bacteria solution was recovered and cultured in soya casein digest lecithin polysorbate broth scdlp the test membrane was washed four times with scdlp to thoroughly recover the bacterial liquid thoroughly before the viable count the bacteria suspension was diluted 10 times in phosphate buffer saline pbs then calculated the anti bacterial rate r by the following eq 2 2 r n 0 n n 0 100 where n0 is the number of live bacteria of blank and n is the number of live bacteria of testing samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of ag pda pen electrospinning nanofibrous membranes the employed electrospun polymer matrix was fabricated using pen bpa a relatively mature commercial pen type with comprehensive performance to evaluate the basic characteristics of pen bpa ft ir 1h nmr and molecular weight analyses were performed to determine its chemical structure thermogravimetric analysis tga and differential scanning calorimeter dsc were studied to analyze thermal resistance performance ft ir spectrum was shown as fig s1a in supplementary material the feature peak assignments of ether bond o were at 1250 cm 1 and 1028 cm 1 while feature peak of nitrile group cn was at 2240 cm 1 the peak at 2980 cm 1 was pertain to methyl ch3 in bpa monomer segment remain peaks 1610 cm 1 1585 cm 1 1510 cm 1 and 1468 cm 1 were belong to benzene ring skeleton based on 1h nmr spectrum revealed in fig s1b the corresponding formant analysis further provided the accurate chemical structure information of the employed pen bpa to some extent the polymer chain with no reactive functional groups established the basis of pen s ability to withstand harsh environments based on its unique chemical structure and stability meanwhile fig s1c indicates that the average molecular weight m n weight average molecular weight m w and polydispersity of pen bpa were 22 08 kda 54 78 kda and 2 48 respectively this sufficient molecular weight further ensures that the polymer is spinnable for fabricating electrospun membranes furthermore the thermal decomposition and differential scanning calorimetry curves fig s2 yielded a 5 weight loss decomposition temperature t 5 of 518 c while the glass transition temperature t g was 180 c above preliminary basic intrinsic results of the employed pen bpa guarantee that the fabricated polymer matrix with sufficient chemical stability and excellent thermal resistance is more likely to withstand subsequent experiments in a harsh environment first a pen nanofibrous membrane was fabricated by electrospinning followed by hot pressing process as mentioned in previous reports the purpose of post processing is to evaporate the remaining solvent and denser fluffy fibrous to enhance the mechanical strength 39 40 the prepared pen nanofibrous membrane continued to adhere to polydopamine to obtain a hydrophilic surface finally ag nps formed by the in situ reduction method were embedded on the membrane surface to endow bacteriostasis fig 2 displays sem images of the membranes at each stage to compare their morphologies as illustrated in fig 2a the prepared pen nanofibrous membrane without the hot pressing process was straight and slippy with an average diameter of 0 26 μm fig 2b after hot pressing the adjacent pen nanofibers are micro fused which changes the morphology of the fibers fig 2c consequently the nanofibrous membrane s morphology became flattened and bent slightly moreover the corresponding average diameter became larger to 0 39 μm fig 2d in terms of thickness variation after hot pressing the thickness of the membrane was compressed from 38 6 to 24 1 μm further confirming the membrane change from fluffy to dense by the hot pressing process after loading with polydopamine as displayed in fig 2e the surface of the modified pda pen nanofibrous membrane became rough owing to the attachment of the formed polydopamine it can be clearly observed that the dopamine coating on the fibers is patchy some sheet structures also appeared between adjacent fibers also appeared which were caused by the formation of polydopamine finally the sample was further modified by the in situ reduction reaction of agno3 at a concentration of 1 mm as a representative of ag pda pen when we investigated the surface of the membrane we found that some spheroidal particles were uniformly embedded in the fibers to further confirm that the particles loaded on the nanofibrous membrane surface were ag nps a part of the corresponding region fig 2g was measured using eds elemental mapping analysis the resulting image demonstrated in fig 2h verifies the presence and dispersion of ag indicating that ag nps with diameters mainly ranging from 50 to 85 nm were successfully deposited on the surface of the pen fibers fig 2i l depict the morphology images of ag nps loaded on pen fibers reduced by agno3 at concentrations of 0 1 0 5 2 5 and 5 mm respectively the number of ag nps on the fiber surface increased with increasing agno3 concentration ag nps were rare at concentrations as low as 0 01 and 0 05 mm of agno3 the presence of ag nps loaded onto the fiber surface was confirmed by further tests by spot scan of eds elemental analysis as indicated in fig s3 overall the ag nps were uniformly dispersed on the surface of each fiber on the other hand to observe the distribution of ag nps inside the fibrous membrane images of the cross section of m 7 were observed after the membrane was brittle with liquid nitrogen as shown in fig s4 the ag nps were mainly distributed on the surface layer because the pretreated pda pen floated on the solution of agno3 which caused the in situ reaction happened on the interface of the membrane the results of cross sectional results clearly show the hierarchical structure of the ag pda pen electrospinning nanofibrous membrane 3 2 wettability performance the wettability of the as prepared ag pda pen depends on several aspects including the hot pressing temperature hot pressing time dopamine concentration and ag concentration as a member of polyarylene either engineering polymer family enriched in benzene rings in the backbone such as polyarylene ether sulfone pes and polyarylene ether ketone pek pen is originally hydrophobic without being modified by the sulfonic acid group carboxyl group or other hydrophilic components 41 42 the hot processed pen nanofibrous membrane was initially hydrophobic with a water contact angle ca of 134o fig 3 because this work aimed to fabricate a water selective separation membrane polydopamine surface coating modification was employed to change the wettability of the polymer matrix moreover the pen nanofibrous membrane was pumped with da solution during the wettability modification not only does the polymerized pda firmly adhere to the surface but it also achieves the effect of embedding pda inside so more hydroxyl oh and amino groups nh nh2 were loaded onto the fiber membrane making the pen nanofibrous membrane more hydrophilic the final ca of pda pen was 19 fig 3 pda also served as a rough substrate for the attachment of the formed ag nps therefore the more pda coating the more ag nps attached however excess ag nps lead to the membrane becoming hydrophobic again then after several experimental investigations the optimal dopamine concentration was 0 7 mg ml which could endow the pen nanofibrous membrane with hydrophilic and ensure that the subsequent loading of ag nps will continue to maintain wettability after the ca value dropped from 134 drops to 20 due to pda modification the loading of ag nps increased again with increasing agno3 concentration from 0 01 to 5 mm the ca increased from 30 m 1 to 71 m 2 103 m 3 113 m 4 118 m 5 128 m 6 and 130 m 7 due to the construction of ag nps in addition the time dependent ca has been evaluated by taken m 3 m 5 and m 7 as typical samples as shown in fig s5 it can be observed that the ca of each sample tends to decrease to some extent however the fibrous membrane cannot be completely wetted in a short time which means the fabricated ag pda pen possess quite stable wettability the ca values were then tested for 200 s to study the time dependent properties of the prepared membranes the ca results of typical samples m 3 m 5 and m 7 showed 13 15 and 5 decrease in 200 s respectively consequently in the permeation test the fibrous membranes were completely wetted before use after the pre wetting process water flux data were obtained at 42 974 l m2l m 1 30 016 l m2l m 2 21 310 l m2l m 3 16 230 l m2l m 4 10 850 l m2l m 5 9 037 l m2l m 6 and 8 894 l m2l m 7 such excellent water flux results were comprehensively benefited by the hydrophilic modification of pda the porous structures constructed by pen nanofibrous membrane hierarchical structure fabricated via rough pda coating layer decorated with ag nps 43 3 3 oil water emulsion separation performance the separation performance of ag pda pen was tested using an oil water emulsion which is much more complex than an oil water mixture 44 the filtration results are exhibited in fig 4 the self made emulsion sample was a water packed n hexane emulsion volume ratio of n hexane to water was 1 100 fig 4a displays that the emulsion separation flux of ag pda pen was as high as 4978 71 l m2h prepared with the lowest agno3 concentration of 0 01 mm then the values gradually decrease with increasing concentration of agno3 from m 1 to m 7 and the trend matches the change in ca finally the emulsion separation flux of the ag pda pen prepared with the highest agno3 concentration reached 1863 47 l m2h meanwhile the oil water separation performance was further evaluated by observation of the test solutions and total organic carbon toc analysis first the colors of influent and effluent solutions were compared with the naked eye see the digital photograph of the as prepared n hexane water emulsion in fig 4b and the collected filtrate was separated by m 7 fig 4c the change from milky white to transparent indicates the successful separation of the oil water emulsion the naked eye can also easily observe the comparison of filtrates treated with other ag pda pen samples displayed in fig s6 more clearly the images observed by the electronic microscope are illustrated in fig 4b c influent emulsions had large numbers of oil droplets while no obvious droplets were present the toc test results were calculated as illustrated in fig 4d the rejection ratio of n hexane from n hexane water emulsion had reached 98 20 m 1 subsequently it was over 99 m 2 and gradually increased to as high as 99 28 m 7 the above high separation efficiencies were expected to be due to the high porosity of polymer matrix fabricated by electrospinning technology and the water selective permeability supported by the pda coating layer 12 38 concurrently the embedded ag nps on the fibers have a dual character on the one hand the blockage of surface pores attributed to the increasing amount of ag nps caused a decline in the emulsion flux on the other hand narrower pores hold more subtle oil droplets thus increasing the rejection ratio 3 4 durability performance in practical oil water separation applications which are often accompanied by acid base corrosive environments polar organic solvents high temperatures etc the fabricated composite membranes are expected to maintain stability in harsh environments to verify the durability of ag pda pen the rejection ratio results of the m 7 sample resisted strong acid ph 1 and strong alkali ph 14 emulsion petroleum ether water emulsions are demonstrated in fig 5a the separation efficiency of n hexane water emulsion maintained high performance with rejection ratios over than 99 for both corrosive emulsions precisely 99 37 at ph 1 and 99 67 at ph 14 meanwhile the corresponding composite membrane was also tested for its high rejection ratio 99 06 of petroleum ether ph 7 different ag pda pen membranes were employed for thermal resistant to separate n hexane water emulsions at 80 c fig s7 shows that the emulsion flux results ranged from 12 27 103 l m2h m 1 to 3 40 103 l m2h m 7 with a gradual decline the reason for the much higher emulsion flux at 80 c than at room temperature is probably due to the accelerated emulsion breaking caused by the high temperature in the separation process 45 the highly transparent collected effluent solution demonstrated that the ag pda pen membranes still possessed a high emulsion separation efficiency at high temperatures in addition the membrane is often contaminated during the oil water separation process which reduces the separation efficiency and reusability of the membrane 46 47 the n hexane water emulsion separation was repeated ten times on one m 7 membrane to demonstrate the robust durability of ag pda pen as displayed in fig 5b the rejection ratio tested after each time was above 99 and only decreased by 0 24 this indicates that ag pda pen maintained a high level efficiency after ten times separation meanwhile the corresponding fluxes of the n hexane water emulsions tested in the cycle also shown in fig 5b cycling tests showed that the separation membranes could be used at least ten times with 16 decline however the emulsion flux still maintains above 1624 l m2h above results exhibited the good recycling ability of fabricated ag pda pen electrospinning nanofibrous membrane in addition to study the physical stability of prepared membranes three samples of pen pen pda and m 5 were selected to test the tensile strength values and the influence of pda and ag nps modification due to the initial well mechanical of pen substrate and the adverse effect of porous structure pen exhibited a tensile strength at 4 82 mpa and with no significant changes after pda coating and ag nps loading fig s8 the corresponding results for pda pen and m 5 were 4 94 mpa and 4 53 mpa respectively as the tensile strength did not change significantly which indicates that the treated films still maintain mechanical properties to ensure the durability above results exhibited that ag pda pen nanofibrous membranes were durable with good chemical stability thermal resistance and reusability the convenient polymer chain of employed pen enriching aromatic rings ether bonds and nitrile groups results in excellent chemical thermal and dimensional stability the comprehensive performance of pen made itself suitable for acting as a fibrous support layer 48 49 in addition the covalent bonding and cross linking generated by the pda coating further improve the durability of membrane skeleton 50 51 the adhesive and metal binding ability of the phenolic hydroxyl groups in pda offers tight immobilization of ag nps redoubling the stability of the hierarchical structure 38 52 53 3 5 anti bacterial performance compared with other harsh environments biofouling is a broader issue in membrane based separation technologies the adhesion and subsequent reproduction of microorganisms are serious hazards to the long term use of membranes 54 in this case the ag pda pen membranes contain two components pda and ag nps which inhibit biofouling hereinto ag nps have been extensively used because they are easy to synthesize biologically harmless easy to control in topography and have a broad spectrum of anti bacterial activity 55 57 thus ag nps is an ideal candidate in the field of water treatment where bacterial contamination can be addressed 58 59 previous investigations demonstrated that pda acted as the hydrophilic layer and ag nps loading platform and proved anti adhesive properties upon microorganisms and anti bacterial properties in a certain way by endowing membrane surface with hydrophilicity and negative charge density 38 60 61 the main biofouling functionalization depends on ag nps which possess excellent anti bacterial activity but low toxicity to human cells 58 nevertheless the release of ag from ag pda pen membranes into filtrate during water treatment has been evaluated firstly the release of ag in water was examined on icp instrument after digestion with pure hno3 m 3 and m 5 were taken as the typical samples the levels of ag in water in the filtrates of m 3 and m 5 were 1 31 μg l and 2 23 μg l respectively the content of ag was very little which are far below the chinese standard of 50 μg l and the american standard of 100 μg l for ag in discharged wastewater in this study the anti bacterial performance of ag pda pen nanofibrous membranes was evaluated by counting the bactericidal ratio after contacting escherichia coli e coli photographs of the anti bacterial performance of ag pda pen constructed using agno3 at concentrations ranging from 0 01 to 5 mm were taken after a thousand fold dilution and 24 h of incubation as presented in fig 6a all ag pda pen nanofibrous membranes significantly differed in anti bacterial ability to inhibit e coli from the control group because of the intense anti bacterial activity of ag at low concentrations no colonies were observed on the plate and minimal ag nps were loaded on m 1 62 fig 6b illustrates the quantitative results and the rates of all membranes were above 99 99 the anti bacterial measurement in this study simulated the activity of bacteria on the surface of test membranes when the bacteria suspension covered the membrane s surface ag nps realized anti bacterial functionalization by adhering to the bacterial cell membrane and releasing silver ions leading to the damage of cellular membrane structure and activity of enzymes and finally causing apoptosis of bacteria 63 therefore the ag nps component immobilized on a fibrous membrane can kill bacteria in the oil water separation process promoting the long term performance of ag pda pen separation membrane furthermore when combined with previous permeation and separation performance the positive anti bacteria results demonstrated that ag pda pen with low silver content is a comprehensive one with high emulsion flux good rejection ratio and excellent anti bacterial performance in addition compared with other polymer based electronspun fibrous membranes see in table 1 the ag pda pen nanofibrous membranes exhibited quite comprehensive performance for oil water treatment the high efficiency of oil water emulsions separation thermal resistant corrosive resistant durability as well as high bacterial inhibition making ag pda pen show promise for applications in petroleum and industrial wastewater contaminated with microorganisms 4 conclusion a high performance engineering polymer pen was fabricated as a fibrous matrix using electrospinning technology and further modified with pda and ag nps to construct a multifunctional ag pda pen nanofibrous membrane for oil water emulsion separation the pda coating endowed the membrane with hydrophilicity achieving good permeability and separation ability for oil water emulsions depending on the initial chemical stability and thermal resistance of pen ag pda pen supported by polymer skeleton have sufficient toughness to suffer from strong acid ph 1 and alkali ph 14 emulsions polarity organic solvent water emulsions high temperature conditions and multiple reuses although ag nps generated in situ decreased the emulsion flux due to pore blockage they also improved oil rejection above all ag pda pen electrospinning nanofibrous membranes possessed strong bactericidal capacity 99 99 even with low content of ag nps which can resist biofouling in long term service based on these findings the developed long lasting ag pda pen electrospinning nanofibous membrane with anti corrosion anti heat and anti bacterial properties can be a potential high

12656,this study aimed to investigate the effect of the high ph of constructed wetlands cws with that use waste concrete as a substrate on pollutant removal efficiency and to identify whether this high ph effect can be mitigated by adjusting the influent ph laboratory scale vertical flow constructed wetland vfcw simulators in batch feeding mode were established with waste concrete waste bricks and common gravel as the substrates at a hydraulic retention time of 24 h and an influent of ph 7 98 an average ph of 11 28 was observed for the effluent of the waste concrete treatment while cws with waste brick treatment or common gravel treatment exhibited an effluent ph of 7 57 0 03 and 7 57 0 14 respectively compared with common gravel or waste brick waste concrete treatment led to a significantly lower cod removal efficiency 72 09 0 21 and a significantly higher effluent no2 n concentration 6 62 0 15 mg l with the effluent ph decreasing to 8 15 through influent ph adjustment waste concrete treatment exhibited a better cod removal efficiency 81 60 0 03 and a lower effluent no2 n concentration 4 08 0 11 mg l without a significant influence on the no3 n nh4 n and phosphorus removal efficiencies the high ph of waste concrete had a positive effect on amoa and nirs nirk expression and a negative effect on anammox and nxra expression which could be mitigated by decreasing the influent ph therefore waste concrete is suitable for the treatment of acid wastewater while for non acid wastewater additional measures such as mixing with other substrates should be taken to avoid the too high ph induced by waste concrete graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords constructed wetlands waste concrete ph nitrite accumulation n cycle data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction substrates are a vital component in constructed wetlands cws providing attachment sites for biofilm growth and supporting macrophytes 1 there are many types of substrates applied in cws such as natural gravel 2 zeolites 3 biological ceramsite 4 slag 5 biochar 6 activated carbon coal slag and woodchips 7 among which natural gravel is most common because of its outstanding cost advantage however with urban development and the wide application of large scale cws in china cw substrates are becoming increasingly in short supply 8 moreover the mining of natural gravel is increasingly being rigorously regulated with the implementation of new environmental policies 9 due to which its cost advantage is gradually decreasing it is necessary to find new cost effective and environmentally friendly substrates for cws construction waste is expected to be an ideal alternative to gravel as a substrate for cws with the acceleration of china s urbanization especially with the rapid development of the real estate industry cities in china are being replaced at an extremely rapid pace which has led to the generation of excessive construction waste 10 moreover due to its large output the lack of landfill sites 11 its low utilization rate 12 and other problems construction waste has caused severe pollution in the overall ecological environment in china studies have shown that in china construction waste accounts for nearly 40 of the total municipal waste 13 and the recycling of construction waste is a challenge that must be addressed for high quality urban development numerous types of resource utilization methods have been developed for construction waste including amending soil producing new construction materials treating with gases sequestering co2 and purifying wastewater 14 the construction waste recycling rate needs to be greatly improved especially in countries such as china 15 due to their specific chemical compounds high absorptivity and porous structure construction waste materials such as concrete and bricks have the potential to be used as cost effective and environmentally friendly substrates for cws which would not only promote the recycling of construction waste to reduce environmental pressure but also increase pollutant removal efficiency re in cws at a low cost 8 14 waste based materials such as recycled concrete aggregates rca recycled brick aggregates rba light expanded clay porcelain tiles and clay bricks could be used as cw substrates and showed good performance in the removal of chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and emerging contaminants 16 even better than that of natural aggregates 17 scanning electron microscope sem measurements suggested that the surface of construction waste blocks was generally coarse and thus could provide a large surface for biological adhesion growth zhang et al 18 multiple studies have shown that construction wastes especially those containing waste concrete are effective in removing phosphorous 17 19 saeed and hossain 19 found that compared with organic medium based cws cws with construction waste as the substrate exhibited lower removal efficiencies for nitrogen and cod and higher removal efficiency for tp the mass percentage of calcium quantified through energy dispersive spectrometry eds analyses showed that the calcium content of the concrete blocks was high and the calcium content of the used concrete blocks used was higher than that of the unused concrete blocks adsorption into media composed of ca al fe ingredients often accelerates p removal 20 however construction waste derived from cement containing building materials such as waste concrete and cement bricks is the most abundant type of construction waste this waste is usually strongly alkaline 14 and thus could have a potential negative effect on the environment when widely applied as a cw substrate in particular with the implementation of environmental protection policies and the change in building materials and technology the amount of construction waste derived from cement containing building materials is greatly increasing compared with that from traditional sintered bricks thus sufficient cement containing construction waste is available for use in cws while traditional sintered brick waste is probably limited in supply currently the high calcium content is regarded as an advantage of cement containing construction waste as it has been shown to improve tp removal in cws 12 21 however few studies have been conducted on the possible negative effect of the strong alkalinity of cement containing construction waste on pollutant removal in cws and there have also been few studies on the recovery process of the negative effect this study was conducted at the laboratory scale with vertical flow constructed wetlands vfcws utilizing common gravel wg waste concrete wc or waste bricks traditional clay sintered bricks wb as the substrate to identify the effect of strongly alkaline construction waste on pollutant removal the subobjectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the effect of the strong alkalinity of waste concrete on the removal of different pollutants 2 clarify the recovery of pollutant removal by adjusting the influent ph and 3 explore the possible mechanism by which strongly alkaline waste concrete affects n removal by measuring n cycle functional genes 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of experimental materials waste concrete and waste bricks clay sintered bricks were obtained from jiangsu shunjia construction engineering co ltd an enterprise specializing in construction waste recycling in addition common gravel widely used for simulating cw systems 22 was obtained and used as the reference considering the anti clogging factors and the specific surface area of the substrate a substrate with a diameter of 10 20 mm was finally chosen 23 24 the collected substrates were sieved using 20 mm and 10 mm screens sequentially and thus substrate particles with a diameter of 10 20 mm were obtained then the substrate particles were washed and dried the synthetic wastewater used in this experiment was mainly composed of a solution of sucrose hoagland kno3 and nh4 2so4 the pollutant concentrations were established on the basis of item 1a in gb 18918 2002 discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plants mee gov cn china i e the concentrations of cod tp nh4 n no3 n and tn were 50 0 5 5 10 and 15 mg l respectively 2 2 design and operation of the experimental units the vfcw simulation systems were established in a laboratory on the xianlin campus of nanjing university jiangsu province china longitude 32 1216 latitude 118 9494 the system was operated from august 10 2020 to december 17 2020 during which the environmental temperature was maintained at 25 5 c a total of nine simulation systems were established including three treatments i e simulated cws with common gravel wg waste concrete wc and waste bricks wb as the substrate with triplicate experiments for each treatment the systems were established in plexiglass cylinders with an inner diameter of 0 1 m a height of 0 6 m and a total volume of 0 019 m3 each device was filled with only one of the three substrates forming a 48 cm high substrate layer the systems employed a sequential batch feeding mode with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 h and the water level in the cylinders was maintained at 0 5 m with a working volume of 0 016 m3 to prevent the growth of algae the outside of the device was wrapped in tin foil to create a dark environment in the cylinders in the first three days of operation of the system the supernatant of the sewage treatment plant aerobic tank sludge was added to the influent for bacterial inoculation and adaptation to the environment to focus on the comparison of pollutant removal between substrates no plants were included in the cws in this study in fact plants generally have little direct effect on pollutant removal for subsurface or vertical flow cws with large amounts of efficient substrates 25 the effects of plants on nitrogen and phosphorus removal are 10 and 5 respectively 26 therefore pilot scale cws without plants have also been widely used in related studies 27 for wc treatment the experimental period included two stages i e the normal stage and the acid stage at the normal stage of wc treatment from august 10 to october 18 nearly neutral synthetic wastewater was fed to the systems while at the acid stage from november 2 to december 17 dilute hydrochloric acid was gradually added to the synthetic wastewater to adjust the ph until the effluent of the wc was nearly neutral the period between the normal stage and the acid stage i e from october 19 to november 1 was the adaptation stage for wc with acidic influent and the effluent ph of the wc treatment was adjusted by decreasing the influent ph for the wg and wb treatments nearly neutral synthetic wastewater was fed to the cws over the whole experimental period however for a better comparison between the wc treatment and the wg and wb treatments the experimental period of the wg and wb treatments was also divided into two stages i e the normal stage and acid stage as described for the wc treatment 2 3 sampling and analysis 2 3 1 measurement of water quality and ph water samples from the influent and effluent of each treatment were collected and chemical parameters were determined in the laboratory every 3 7 days the water quality parameters cod tn tp nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were measured by the hach assay kit they were analyzed using a water quality analysis system drb200 and dr2800 hach usa according to standard analytical procedures 28 the ph values of the influent and effluent were measured by a ph meter phs 3c nanjing kehuan china the results were processed by origin 2021b and spss statistics 25 2 3 2 microbial analysis microbial samples from the substrate surface were collected twice at the end of the normal stage ens day 65 and the end of the acid stage eas day 125 substrate samples were collected at a depth of approximately 10 cm from the top of the substrate layer in the device approximately 20 30 g of the substrate was collected in each device and placed into a sterile centrifuge tube fifty milliliters of sterile phosphoric acid buffer was added to each centrifuge tube and the biofilm was removed from the substrate surface by using an ultrasonic washing machine kh 250 db hechuang china two times for 5 min each time microbe samples were stored at 40 c for further analysis 2 3 2 1 quantitative analysis of the n cycle functional genes real time pcr was conducted to determine the absolute abundance of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox related 16s rrna and n cycle genes including anammox genes ammonia monooxygenase amoa nitrite reductase genes nirs and nirk and nitrite oxidoreductase alpha subunit nxra qpcr was performed on an abi 7300 real time pcr system applied biosystems usa each 20 μl reaction mixture contained

analyzed in triplicate the forward and reverse primers for target genes and the corresponding reaction protocols were described by zhang et al 29 all plasmids containing the target genes were provided by majorbio bio pharm technology company shanghai china the data for these genes were normalized to copies per cubic centimeter of the substrate sample 2 3 2 2 bacterial community structure analysis

taxonomic units otus by uparse version 7 0 1090 http drive5 com uparse 30 the qiime online analysis system version 4 1 http www majorbio com was used to obtain the bacterial ace index shannon index observed species and substrate bacterial community composition 3 results and discussion 3 1 ph dynamics at the normal stage the ph values varied from neutral to slightly alkaline in the influent water samples fluctuating between 7 64 and 8 17 with an average of 7 98 0 14 for the wg and wb treatments the corresponding average ph in the effluent was 7 57 0 03 and 7 57 0 14 respectively fig 1 a showing a very slight ph alteration for the nearly neutral ph influent in contrast the wc treatment produced a strongly alkaline effluent i e the effluent ph fluctuated from 11 01 to 11 46 with an average of 11 28 0 14 fig 1 b this result was related to the hydrated cement in concrete which contained alkaline calcium compounds such as ca oh 2 and calcium silicate hydrates ceseh 31 at the acid stage the influent and effluent of the wg and wb treatments remained nearly neutral with average ph values of 7 86 0 05 7 48 0 05 and 7 13 0 05 for the influent of both treatments wg effluent and wb effluent respectively for the wc treatment when the influent ph was first adjusted to 3 76 fluctuating between 3 56 and 4 02 the effluent ph decreased to 9 40 when the influent ph was then decreased to 2 77 fluctuating between 2 68 and 2 87 the effluent ph decreased to 8 15 compared with other experiments with waste concrete or other cement containing construction waste as cw substrates in which the effluent of cws generally exhibited a ph ranging from 8 5 to 10 4 6 17 20 the average ph of the wc treatment in this study was substantially higher at 11 28 there are two possible reasons for this observation first in this study only waste concrete was used as the substrate for the wc treatment while in other studies in addition to waste concrete or other cement containing construction waste other substrate materials were also used 6 20 the materials used in most experiments have been unscreened mixed construction waste such as fly ash bricks 12 and crushed cement mortar 32 the materials used in this experiment were screened waste concrete materials second cement the main component of concrete responsible for the high ph of cw effluent is available in many types of which portland cement is the most widely applied in common building and road engineering applications while other types of cement have more components and are mostly used in special situations compared with other types of cement portland cement which was used in this experiment has the potential to release more alkaline substances and raise the ph of the environment with regard to the availability of sufficient substrate for cws studies using waste concrete composed of portland cement are representative of common application scenarios ph values that are too high or too low in aquatic ecosystems can lead to a series of negative consequences and thus an effluent ph that is too high or too low in cws generally needs to be adjusted before the effluent is discharged into rivers or lakes 33 according to chinese national environmental quality standards for surface water the ph of the surface water should be controlled between 6 and 9 therefore a ph value that is too high due to a concrete substrate probably either causes negative consequences or results in additional costs due to ph adjustment in fact the buffering ability of cws has long been recognized 34 35 in cws a ph that is too high or too low can cause problems related to plant tolerance and weakening of the purification function 33 the excessively high or low ph induced by the substrate instead of the influent would probably lead to even more serious consequences related to pollutant removal than the condition induced by the influent at the same ph of effluent because the released acidic or alkaline substances from the substrate first pass by the biofilms attached to the substrate surface and then diffuse into the water thus the biofilm was probably subjected to a more extreme ph than that of the water therefore the high ph problem related to cement containing construction waste such as waste concrete and cement brick deserves additional attention 3 2 pollutant removal 3 2 1 nh4 n during the start up period of the normal stage 0 42 days the nh4 n removal efficiencies were unstable fig 2 a reflecting the variation in the dominant removal pathways including substrate absorption and saturation and microbial activity for the wg and wb treatments at the beginning of the normal stage the substrate had a good adsorption capacity for nh4 n however the adsorption of the substrate to pollutants is a limited process 36 and the nh4 n re decreased with time following the saturation of the substrate adsorption meanwhile a stable biofilm gradually developed on the surface of the substrate and the nh4 n removal efficiencies of wg and wb gradually stabilized the best performance was observed for the wb treatment which was probably related to the higher cation exchange capacity of bricks 37 as well as the polyporous structure and relatively large external specific surface area of waste brick for the enrichment of microorganisms 12 38 wg and wb were more stable in removing nh4 n than wc at the beginning of the normal stage the ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency of wc was significantly lower than that of the other two treatments for wc treatment in the phase where adsorption is the main removal pathway nh4 n easily combined with oh to form free ammonia fa due to the high ph which weakened the cation exchange capacity and reduced the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen 39 nh 4 oh nh 3 h 2 o it has been shown that the initial inhibitory concentration of fa on ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob was 10 to 150 mg l 1 while that on nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob was 0 1 to 1 0 mg l 1 40 the total ammonia nitrogen concentration of wc in this experiment was 10 mg l which had little effect on aob although the optimum ph for nitrification is weakly alkaline aob are still active in alkaline environments 41 moreover the increase in fa concentration provided more sufficient substrate for aob leading to the gradual increase in aob activity and the reaction rate 42 therefore the nh4 n re of the wc treatment gradually increased with increasing microbial activity during the stable period of the normal stage 43 64 days the wc treatment exhibited the highest nh4 n re the average nh4 n res were 48 10 0 50 66 36 1 48 and 56 71 1 28 for the wg wc and wb treatments respectively the best performance was observed for the wc treatment which can be explained by the positive ammonia oxidation process as well as the ammonia volatilization under alkaline conditions induced by waste concrete 43 at the acid stage the nh4 n re of the wc treatment first decreased and then gradually increased and was the highest among the three treatments the decrease in this re is probably related to the decrease in ammonia volatilization with decreasing ph while the gradual increase can be explained by the mitigation of the inhibitory effect of alkaline conditions 41 on microbial activity 3 2 2 no3 n and no2 n the wc treatment retained a significantly higher no3 n re than the wg and wb treatments during the whole experiment p 0 001 fig 2 b during the stable period of the normal stage i e 43 64 days the average no3 n res were 85 21 0 40 72 50 2 24 and 73 49 1 88 for the wc wg and wb treatments respectively while the average values were 82 92 1 35 68 37 0 84 and 69 33 0 86 for the wc wg and wb treatments respectively at the acid stage during the whole experiment continuously high concentrations of no2 n were observed in wc effluent with average concentrations of 6 62 0 15 and 4 08 0 11 mg l during the stable period of the normal stage and the acid stage respectively fig 2 e in contrast the average concentrations in the wg and wb effluents were 3 26 0 17 and 3 49 0 22 mg l respectively during the stable period of the normal stage while at the acid stage the average concentrations were 2 84 0 26 and 2 31 0 14 mg l for the wg and wb treatments respectively the results suggested that wc could improve no3 n removal compared with wg and wb which was achieved at the cost of no2 n accumulation decreasing the influent ph could decrease the effluent no2 n concentration with little influence on no3 n re the high ph could explain the high no3 n re and high no2 n concentration in the wc effluent which has been reported by several studies 44 45 and the possible reasons involving both nitrification and denitrification are as follows first during nitrification the high ph caused an increase in the free ammonia fa concentration in the water which strongly inhibited the activity of nitrite oxidoreductase and thus resulted in the accumulation of no2 n and a decrease in no3 n 46 high ph also has a negative influence on the activity of nitrite oxidizing bacteria in this study the good biodegradability of cod i e glucose in synthetic wastewater led to a relatively low dissolved oxygen do level below 1 mg l 47 which resulted in the preferential use of oxygen in ammoxidation while nitrite oxidation was inhibited 48 49 under the interaction of high fa limited do and alkaline ph in the wc treatment 49 partial nitrification was promoted and thus the no2 n content increased second during denitrification high ph has a strong inhibitory effect on the activity of nitrite reductase 50 the nitrite reduction process is an acid consumption reaction and a high ph inhibits the nitrite reduction reaction concurrently 51 0 37 5ch 3 coo 1no 2 0 62 5h 0 75 hco 3 0 5 n 2 0 5h 2 o in addition nitrite reductase has a lag period when nitrate and alkaline ph coexist which also leads to the inhibition of nitrite reduction this is due to the competition for the flow of electrons to nitrate reductase in an alkaline environment 51 53 because the rate of nitrate reduction seems to be greater than that of nitrite reduction electron flow to nitrite reductase may be temporarily shut off leading to the accumulation of nitrite in the periplasmic space of denitrifying bacteria 54 the competition is enhanced and nitrite reduction is further suppressed at high ph 51 therefore due to the harmfulness of nitrite in aquatic ecosystems 55 the ecological risk of no2 n accumulation due to high ph needs to be considered when waste concrete is widely used as the main substrate of cws and this effect can be alleviated by ph regulation 3 2 3 cod and tp during the whole experimental period significantly lower cod res were observed in the wc treatment than in the wg and wb treatments p 0 001 fig 2 c during the stable period of the normal stage the average cod res were 72 09 0 21 82 37 0 39 and 84 81 0 80 for the wc wg and wb treatments respectively while the average values were 81 60 0 03 85 22 0 13 and 87 76 0 11 for the wc wg and wb treatments respectively at the acid stage the artificial regulation of influent ph could significantly increase the cod re p 0 001 in cws cod removal is mainly accomplished by aerobic or anaerobic heterotrophic microbial metabolism 47 however alkaline conditions and the accumulation of nitrite affect bacterial processes inhibiting microbial metabolism 56 thus the high ph caused by waste concrete can result in a decrease in the cod re although the cod re could be improved by influent ph regulation wc treatment led to the lowest cod re compared with the wg and wb treatments this result can be explained by the fact that the high ph in the wc treatment was caused by the release of alkaline substances from the substrate which first pass by the biofilms on the substrate surface thus the biofilm was probably subjected to alkaline stress that was greater than the measured ph in the effluent contrary to the published literature 12 21 the wc treatment did not result in a significantly higher tp re than the wg or wb treatment fig 2 d during both the stable period in the normal stage and the acid stage wg produced the highest tp re a slightly higher tp re was observed with the wc treatment than with the wb treatment with influent ph regulation in the wc treatment the tp re first decreased from 82 71 to 76 05 and then gradually recovered to 84 68 at the late acid stage when all three treatments produced relatively high tp res i e 84 68 92 70 and 89 98 for the wc wg and wb treatments respectively the results suggested that artificial influent ph regulation had little effect on tp removal in cws with waste concrete as the substrate p 0 252 phosphorus removal mainly depends on physical and chemical adsorption there have been many relevant studies on finding cement concrete fly ash and other cement containing substances for the efficient removal of phosphorus 21 57 the cement contained in waste concrete is almost completely insoluble in water and is rich in calcium ions which can react with phosphorus to form precipitates 58 the product of the cement and phosphorus reaction does not produce flocculation which indicates that cement is an ideal phosphorus removal material 21 some studies have shown that a relatively high ph is favorable for the chemical precipitation of calcium phosphate 59 60 however as the ph increased the concentration of oh in the solution gradually increased and oh could compete with po4 3 for adsorption sites in addition with increasing ph the oxides dissolved slower and to a lesser extent severely limiting the precipitation process these two negative effects outweighed the positive effect 61 thus tp removal was promoted slightly after the ph decreased in the wc treatment the bricks contain aluminum ions are porous 62 and have a good phosphorus removal effect in this experiment the influent phosphorus concentration was low and effective tp removal was achieved in each device this study indicated that when the influent ph in the wc system was adjusted to an average of 2 77 the ph of the effluent was 8 15 it is estimated that to achieve a near neutral effluent when using wc the ph of the influent should be adjusted to 2 or even lower however this strategy i e decreasing influent ph to a strongly acidic value potentially both leads to new ecological risks and increases cw operational costs the results showed that waste concrete is very suitable for the treatment of acidic sewage and can not only adjust the effluent ph but also increase the pollutant re however when waste concrete cws are used to treat near neutral sewage more efficient and safer strategies should be developed mixing waste concrete with substrates that have buffer capacities on ph such as pumice diatomite pyrite and volcanic rocks and controlling the amount of waste concrete may be a better strategy which needs more study in the future 3 3 microbial diversity the shannon index sni and abundance based coverage estimator ace were calculated to compare the bacterial α diversity variation between treatments fig 3 at the ens wc exhibited significantly lower sni and ace values than wg p 0 001 and wb p 0 001 with influent ph regulation the sni in wc increased from 2 71 0 05 to 3 56 0 05 while the ace increased from 292 62 60 80 to 391 37 89 4 therefore it can be inferred that the continuous strongly alkaline environment fig 1 b caused by the alkaline substances in concrete over time with wc treatment probably places pressure on microbial community diversity and richness which is consistent with the results of previous reports 63 after this alkalinity was alleviated the pressure on the microbial community diversity was also alleviated which manifested as an increase in the sni however the ace did not significantly recover which indicated that the strong alkalinity of waste concrete may have an irreversible effect on microbial community richness 3 4 microbial compositions at the phylum level proteobacteria patescibacteria actinobacteriota chloroflexi and bacteroidota were detected on each substrate surface fig 4 a and are commonly found in sewage treatment systems 64 65 at the ens the microbial community structure at the phylum level in wc was significantly different from that in the other two treatments and was dominated by proteobacteria the relative abundance of proteobacteria in wc reached 81 28 while that in wg and wb was 28 26 and 24 29 respectively after the acidity of the influent increased the community structure of wc changed tending to approach that of the other two treatments at the phylum level the relative abundance of proteobacteria was reduced to 43 04 while that of patescibacteria and actinobacteriota increased to 24 77 and 22 75 respectively the variation in proteobacteria abundance with ph regulation is consistent with a previous study showing that γ proteobacteria account for a large proportion of haloalkaliphilic microorganisms 66 at the family level the microbial composition of wc was quite different from those of wg and wb fig 4 b at the ens rhodocyclaceae and rhodobacteraceae were the most dominant families of wc accounting for 34 32 and 22 99 of the total abundance respectively and these bacteria have been confirmed to often participate in nitrate removal 67 68 and exhibit salt tolerance 69 in addition the relative abundance of comamonadaceae in wc 13 19 was slightly higher than that in wg 10 89 and wb 9 70 and comamonadaceae species are capable of nitrate removal 68 at ens norank o saccharimonadales was the dominant population in wg and wb and the microbial compositions of wg and wb were similar at the eas the relative abundance advantage of rhodocyclaceae and rhodobacteraceae was reduced in wc but rhodocyclaceae was still the dominant population the abundances of saccharimonadaceae propionibacteriaceae and micrococcaceae in wc increased and these bacteria may be sensitive to alkaline conditions wg and wb showed little change in microbial composition at the eas compared with the ens 3 5 n cycle genes at the ens the abundance of anammox genes in wc was 4 55 107 copies cm3 only 11 81 of the average of that in wg and wb fig 5 the abundance of anammox genes in wc increased significantly p 0 001 after the decrease in influent ph rising to 84 40 of the mean of that in wg and wb at the ens wc produced the highest abundance of amoa 4 15 times higher than the mean of that produced by wg and wb amoa is a gene encoding the key enzyme ammonia monooxygenase amo α subgene in the process of ammonia oxidation 70 with the influent ph regulation in wc the abundance of amoa decreased to 2 32 times the mean of that in wg and wb at the ens and eas the nxra abundance in wc was 0 24 and 1 60 times that in wg and wb respectively the abundance of nirs nirk was highest in wc at ens among the three treatments reaching 1 51 times the mean in wg and wb and the value decreased to 0 78 times that in eas the inhibition of anammox gene expression by the strong alkalinity of wc is consistent with the results of tomaszewski et al 71 who suggested that when the ph value was higher than the optimal range the anammox activity was strongly inhibited the stimulation of amoa by the alkalinity of wc was probably related to ammonia oxidizing archaea which exhibited stronger alkali resistance than ammonia oxidizing bacteria 72 73 while the stimulation of nirs nirk by the alkaline conditions was probably related to the increase in the amount of reaction substrate i e no2 n a similar result was observed by 74 the pathway related to the effect of the alkaline conditions in wc was established fig 6 the combined effects of the inhibition of nxra and anammox expression and the stimulation of amoa induced the accumulation of no2 n in the effluent of wc due to the great potential ecological risks related to the high no2 n effluent it is necessary to decrease the no2 n concentration in the effluent before it is dumped into natural aquatic ecosystems our results suggested the effectiveness of ph adjustment of the influent of the cws in addition there exists an alternative strategy i e two stage cw systems in which the effluent of wc is pumped into other cws in second stage cws shortcut nitrification denitrification and anammox can be enhanced by optimizing a series of design parameters such as do ph c n ratio and organic loading rate 75 76 this enhancement is relatively easy to achieve because the substrate of no2 n is generally one of the most important limiting factors 77 4 conclusion with waste concrete as a substrate the cws produced strongly alkaline effluent which had a significantly negative effect on cod and no2 n removal this negative effect could be significantly mitigated by decreasing the influent ph the strong alkalinity resulting from the use of waste concrete significantly decreased the α diversity of the bacterial community on substrate biofilms which could be mitigated by adjusting the influent ph a decrease in influent ph balanced the positive and negative effects of the high ph of waste concrete on the abundance of microbial n cycle genes e g the positive effects on amoa and nirs nirk and the negative effects on anammox genes and nxra therefore adjusting the ph is an effective strategy to alleviate the negative effects caused by the high ph of cws with waste concrete as the substrate such as a low cod re and high no2 n accumulation however this strategy may raise new ecological risks as the influent ph needs to be adjusted to high acidity therefore more feasible and effective mitigation strategies such as mixing substrates should be developed declaration of

12656,this study aimed to investigate the effect of the high ph of constructed wetlands cws with that use waste concrete as a substrate on pollutant removal efficiency and to identify whether this high ph effect can be mitigated by adjusting the influent ph laboratory scale vertical flow constructed wetland vfcw simulators in batch feeding mode were established with waste concrete waste bricks and common gravel as the substrates at a hydraulic retention time of 24 h and an influent of ph 7 98 an average ph of 11 28 was observed for the effluent of the waste concrete treatment while cws with waste brick treatment or common gravel treatment exhibited an effluent ph of 7 57 0 03 and 7 57 0 14 respectively compared with common gravel or waste brick waste concrete treatment led to a significantly lower cod removal efficiency 72 09 0 21 and a significantly higher effluent no2 n concentration 6 62 0 15 mg l with the effluent ph decreasing to 8 15 through influent ph adjustment waste concrete treatment exhibited a better cod removal efficiency 81 60 0 03 and a lower effluent no2 n concentration 4 08 0 11 mg l without a significant influence on the no3 n nh4 n and phosphorus removal efficiencies the high ph of waste concrete had a positive effect on amoa and nirs nirk expression and a negative effect on anammox and nxra expression which could be mitigated by decreasing the influent ph therefore waste concrete is suitable for the treatment of acid wastewater while for non acid wastewater additional measures such as mixing with other substrates should be taken to avoid the too high ph induced by waste concrete graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords constructed wetlands waste concrete ph nitrite accumulation n cycle data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction substrates are a vital component in constructed wetlands cws providing attachment sites for biofilm growth and supporting macrophytes 1 there are many types of substrates applied in cws such as natural gravel 2 zeolites 3 biological ceramsite 4 slag 5 biochar 6 activated carbon coal slag and woodchips 7 among which natural gravel is most common because of its outstanding cost advantage however with urban development and the wide application of large scale cws in china cw substrates are becoming increasingly in short supply 8 moreover the mining of natural gravel is increasingly being rigorously regulated with the implementation of new environmental policies 9 due to which its cost advantage is gradually decreasing it is necessary to find new cost effective and environmentally friendly substrates for cws construction waste is expected to be an ideal alternative to gravel as a substrate for cws with the acceleration of china s urbanization especially with the rapid development of the real estate industry cities in china are being replaced at an extremely rapid pace which has led to the generation of excessive construction waste 10 moreover due to its large output the lack of landfill sites 11 its low utilization rate 12 and other problems construction waste has caused severe pollution in the overall ecological environment in china studies have shown that in china construction waste accounts for nearly 40 of the total municipal waste 13 and the recycling of construction waste is a challenge that must be addressed for high quality urban development numerous types of resource utilization methods have been developed for construction waste including amending soil producing new construction materials treating with gases sequestering co2 and purifying wastewater 14 the construction waste recycling rate needs to be greatly improved especially in countries such as china 15 due to their specific chemical compounds high absorptivity and porous structure construction waste materials such as concrete and bricks have the potential to be used as cost effective and environmentally friendly substrates for cws which would not only promote the recycling of construction waste to reduce environmental pressure but also increase pollutant removal efficiency re in cws at a low cost 8 14 waste based materials such as recycled concrete aggregates rca recycled brick aggregates rba light expanded clay porcelain tiles and clay bricks could be used as cw substrates and showed good performance in the removal of chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and emerging contaminants 16 even better than that of natural aggregates 17 scanning electron microscope sem measurements suggested that the surface of construction waste blocks was generally coarse and thus could provide a large surface for biological adhesion growth zhang et al 18 multiple studies have shown that construction wastes especially those containing waste concrete are effective in removing phosphorous 17 19 saeed and hossain 19 found that compared with organic medium based cws cws with construction waste as the substrate exhibited lower removal efficiencies for nitrogen and cod and higher removal efficiency for tp the mass percentage of calcium quantified through energy dispersive spectrometry eds analyses showed that the calcium content of the concrete blocks was high and the calcium content of the used concrete blocks used was higher than that of the unused concrete blocks adsorption into media composed of ca al fe ingredients often accelerates p removal 20 however construction waste derived from cement containing building materials such as waste concrete and cement bricks is the most abundant type of construction waste this waste is usually strongly alkaline 14 and thus could have a potential negative effect on the environment when widely applied as a cw substrate in particular with the implementation of environmental protection policies and the change in building materials and technology the amount of construction waste derived from cement containing building materials is greatly increasing compared with that from traditional sintered bricks thus sufficient cement containing construction waste is available for use in cws while traditional sintered brick waste is probably limited in supply currently the high calcium content is regarded as an advantage of cement containing construction waste as it has been shown to improve tp removal in cws 12 21 however few studies have been conducted on the possible negative effect of the strong alkalinity of cement containing construction waste on pollutant removal in cws and there have also been few studies on the recovery process of the negative effect this study was conducted at the laboratory scale with vertical flow constructed wetlands vfcws utilizing common gravel wg waste concrete wc or

bricks clay sintered bricks were obtained from jiangsu shunjia construction engineering co ltd an enterprise specializing in construction waste recycling in addition common gravel widely used for simulating cw systems 22 was obtained and used as the reference considering the anti clogging factors and the specific surface area of the substrate a substrate with a diameter of 10 20 mm was finally chosen 23 24 the collected substrates were sieved using 20 mm and 10 mm screens sequentially and thus substrate particles with a diameter of 10 20 mm were obtained then the substrate particles were washed and dried the synthetic wastewater used in this experiment was mainly composed of a solution of sucrose hoagland kno3 and nh4 2so4 the pollutant concentrations were established on the basis of item 1a in gb 18918 2002 discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plants mee gov cn china i e the concentrations of cod tp nh4 n no3 n and tn were 50 0 5 5 10 and 15 mg l respectively 2 2 design and operation of the experimental units the vfcw simulation systems were established in a laboratory on the xianlin campus of nanjing university jiangsu province china longitude 32 1216 latitude 118 9494 the system was operated from august 10 2020 to december 17 2020 during which the environmental temperature was maintained at 25 5 c a total of nine simulation systems were established including three treatments i e simulated cws with common gravel wg waste concrete wc and waste bricks wb as the substrate with triplicate experiments for each treatment the systems were established in plexiglass cylinders with an inner diameter of 0 1 m a height of 0 6 m and a total volume of 0 019 m3 each device was filled with only one of the three substrates forming a 48 cm high substrate layer the systems employed a sequential batch feeding mode with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 h and the water level in the cylinders was maintained at 0 5 m with a working volume of 0 016 m3 to prevent the growth of algae the outside of the device was wrapped in tin foil to create a dark environment in the cylinders in the first three days of operation of the system the supernatant of the sewage treatment plant aerobic tank sludge was added to the influent for bacterial inoculation and adaptation to the environment to focus on the comparison of pollutant removal between substrates no plants were included in the cws in this study in fact plants generally have little direct effect on pollutant removal for subsurface or vertical flow cws with large amounts of efficient substrates 25 the effects of plants on nitrogen and phosphorus removal are 10 and 5 respectively 26 therefore pilot scale cws without plants have also been widely used in related studies 27 for wc treatment the experimental period included two stages i e the normal stage and the acid stage at the normal stage of wc treatment from august 10 to october 18 nearly neutral synthetic wastewater was fed to the systems while at the acid stage from november 2 to december 17 dilute hydrochloric acid was gradually added to the synthetic wastewater to adjust the ph until the effluent of the wc was nearly neutral the period between the normal stage and the acid stage i e from october 19 to november 1 was the adaptation stage for wc with acidic influent and the effluent ph of the wc treatment was adjusted by decreasing the influent ph for the wg and wb treatments nearly neutral synthetic wastewater was fed to the cws over the whole experimental period however for a better comparison between the wc treatment and the wg and wb treatments the experimental period of the wg and wb treatments was also divided into two stages i e the normal stage and acid stage as described for the wc treatment 2 3 sampling and analysis 2 3 1 measurement of water quality and ph water samples from the influent and effluent of each treatment were collected and chemical parameters were determined in the laboratory every 3 7 days the water quality parameters cod tn tp nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were measured by the hach assay kit they were analyzed using a water quality analysis system drb200 and dr2800 hach usa according to standard analytical procedures 28 the ph values of the influent and effluent were measured by a ph meter phs 3c nanjing kehuan china the results were processed by origin 2021b and spss statistics 25 2 3 2 microbial analysis microbial samples from the substrate surface were collected twice at the end of the normal stage ens day 65 and the end of the acid stage eas day 125 substrate samples were collected at a depth of approximately 10 cm from the top of the substrate layer in the device approximately 20 30 g of the substrate was collected in each device and placed into a sterile centrifuge tube fifty milliliters of sterile phosphoric acid buffer was added to each centrifuge tube and the biofilm was removed from the substrate surface by using an ultrasonic washing machine kh 250 db hechuang china two times for 5 min each time microbe samples were stored at 40 c for further analysis 2 3 2 1 quantitative analysis of the n cycle functional genes real time pcr was conducted to determine the absolute abundance of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox related 16s rrna and n cycle genes including anammox genes ammonia monooxygenase amoa nitrite reductase genes nirs and nirk and nitrite oxidoreductase alpha subunit nxra qpcr was performed on an abi 7300 real time pcr system applied biosystems usa each 20 μl reaction mixture contained 10 μl of chamq sybr color qpcr master mix 2 qpcr kit reagent vazyme china 1 μl of genomic dna 0 8 μl of each relevant forward and reverse primer and 7 4 μl of sterile water all the samples were analyzed in triplicate the forward and reverse primers for target genes and the corresponding reaction protocols were described by zhang et al 29 all plasmids containing the target genes were provided by majorbio bio pharm technology company shanghai china the data for these genes were normalized to copies per cubic centimeter of the substrate sample 2 3 2 2 bacterial community structure analysis substrate microbial samples were sequenced on the majorbio cloud platform majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china and sequences with 97 similarity were assigned to the same operational taxonomic units otus by uparse version 7 0 1090 http drive5 com uparse 30 the qiime online analysis system version 4 1 http www majorbio com was used to obtain the bacterial ace index shannon index observed species and substrate bacterial community composition 3 results and discussion 3 1 ph dynamics at the normal stage the ph values varied from neutral to slightly alkaline in the influent water samples fluctuating between 7 64 and 8 17 with an average of 7 98 0 14 for the wg and wb treatments the corresponding average ph in the effluent was 7 57 0 03 and 7 57 0 14 respectively fig 1 a showing a very slight ph alteration for the nearly neutral ph influent in contrast the wc treatment produced a strongly alkaline effluent i e the effluent ph fluctuated from 11 01 to 11 46 with an average of 11 28 0 14 fig 1 b this result was related to the hydrated cement in concrete which contained alkaline calcium compounds such as ca oh 2 and calcium silicate hydrates ceseh 31 at the acid stage the influent and effluent of the wg and wb treatments remained nearly neutral with average ph values of 7 86 0 05 7 48 0 05 and 7 13 0 05 for the influent of both treatments wg effluent and wb effluent respectively for the wc treatment when the influent ph was first adjusted to 3 76 fluctuating between 3 56 and 4 02 the effluent ph decreased to 9 40 when the influent ph was then decreased to 2 77 fluctuating between 2 68 and 2 87 the effluent ph decreased to 8 15 compared with other experiments with waste concrete or other cement containing construction waste as cw substrates in which the effluent of cws generally exhibited a ph ranging from 8 5 to 10 4 6 17 20 the average ph of the wc treatment in this study was substantially higher at 11 28 there are two possible reasons for this observation first in this study only waste concrete was used as the substrate for the wc treatment while in other studies in addition to waste concrete or other cement containing construction waste other substrate materials were also used 6 20 the materials used in most experiments have been unscreened mixed construction waste such as fly ash bricks 12 and crushed cement mortar 32 the materials used in this experiment were screened waste concrete materials second cement the main component of concrete responsible for the high ph of cw effluent is available in many types of which portland cement is the most widely applied in common building and road engineering applications while other types of cement have more components and are mostly used in special situations compared with other types of cement portland cement which was used in this experiment has the potential to release more alkaline substances and raise the ph of the environment with regard to the availability of sufficient substrate for cws studies using waste concrete composed of portland cement are representative of common application scenarios ph values that are too high or too low in aquatic ecosystems can lead to a series of negative consequences and thus an effluent ph that is too high or too low in cws generally needs to be adjusted before the effluent is discharged into rivers or lakes 33 according to chinese national environmental quality standards for surface water the ph of the surface water should be controlled between 6 and 9 therefore a ph value that is too high due to a concrete substrate probably either causes negative consequences or results in additional costs due to ph adjustment in fact the buffering ability of cws has long been recognized 34 35 in cws a ph that is too high or too low can cause problems related to plant tolerance and weakening of the purification function 33 the excessively high or low ph induced by the substrate instead of the influent would probably lead to even more serious consequences related to pollutant removal than the condition induced by the influent at the same ph of effluent because the released acidic or alkaline substances from the substrate first pass by the biofilms attached to the substrate surface and then diffuse into the water thus the biofilm was probably subjected to a more extreme ph than that of the water therefore the high ph problem related to cement containing construction waste such as waste concrete and cement brick deserves additional attention 3 2 pollutant removal 3 2 1 nh4 n during the start up period of the normal stage 0 42 days the nh4 n removal efficiencies were unstable fig 2 a reflecting the variation in the dominant removal pathways including substrate absorption and saturation and microbial activity for the wg and wb treatments at the beginning of the normal stage the substrate had a good adsorption capacity for nh4 n however the adsorption of the substrate to pollutants is a limited process 36 and the nh4 n re decreased with time following the saturation of the substrate adsorption meanwhile a stable biofilm gradually developed on the surface of the substrate and the nh4 n removal efficiencies of wg and wb gradually stabilized the best performance was observed for the wb treatment which was probably related to the higher cation exchange capacity of bricks 37 as well as the polyporous structure and relatively large external specific surface area of waste brick for the enrichment of microorganisms 12 38 wg and wb were more stable in removing nh4 n than wc at the beginning of the normal stage the ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency of wc was significantly lower than that of the other two treatments for wc treatment in the phase where adsorption is the main removal pathway nh4 n easily combined with oh to form free ammonia fa due to the high ph which weakened the cation exchange capacity and reduced the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen 39 nh 4 oh nh 3 h 2 o it has been shown that the initial inhibitory concentration of fa on ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob was 10 to 150 mg l 1 while that on nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob was 0 1 to 1 0 mg l 1 40 the total ammonia nitrogen concentration of wc in this experiment was 10 mg l which had little effect on aob although the optimum ph for nitrification is weakly alkaline aob are still active in alkaline environments 41 moreover the increase in fa concentration provided more sufficient substrate for aob leading to the gradual increase in aob activity and the reaction rate 42 therefore the nh4 n re of the wc treatment gradually increased with increasing microbial activity during the stable period of the normal stage 43 64 days the wc treatment exhibited the highest nh4 n re the average nh4 n res were 48 10 0 50 66 36 1 48 and 56 71 1 28 for the wg wc and wb treatments respectively the best performance was observed for the wc treatment which can be explained by the positive ammonia oxidation process as well as the ammonia volatilization under alkaline conditions induced by waste concrete 43 at the acid stage the nh4 n re of the wc treatment first decreased and then gradually increased and was the highest among the three treatments the decrease in this re is probably related to the decrease in ammonia volatilization with decreasing ph while the gradual increase can be explained by the mitigation of the inhibitory effect of alkaline conditions 41 on microbial activity 3 2 2 no3 n and no2 n the wc treatment retained a significantly higher no3 n re than the wg and wb treatments during the whole experiment p 0 001 fig 2 b during the stable period of the normal stage i e 43 64 days the average no3 n res were 85 21 0 40 72 50 2 24 and 73 49 1 88 for the wc wg and wb treatments respectively while the average values were 82 92 1 35 68 37 0 84 and 69 33 0 86 for the wc wg and wb treatments respectively at the acid stage during the whole experiment continuously high concentrations of no2 n were observed in wc effluent with average concentrations of 6 62 0 15 and 4 08 0 11 mg l during the stable period of the normal stage and the acid stage respectively fig 2 e in contrast the average concentrations in the wg and wb effluents were 3 26 0 17 and 3 49 0 22 mg l respectively during the stable period of the normal stage while at the acid stage the average concentrations were 2 84 0 26 and 2 31 0 14 mg l for the wg and wb treatments respectively the results suggested that wc could improve no3 n removal compared with wg and wb which was achieved at the cost of no2 n accumulation decreasing the influent ph could decrease the effluent no2 n concentration with little influence on no3 n re the high ph could explain the high no3 n re and high no2 n concentration in the wc effluent which has been reported by several studies 44 45 and the possible reasons involving both nitrification and denitrification are as follows first during nitrification the high ph caused an increase in the free ammonia fa concentration in the water which strongly inhibited the activity of nitrite oxidoreductase and thus resulted in the accumulation of no2 n and a decrease in no3 n 46 high ph also has a negative influence on the activity of nitrite oxidizing bacteria in this study the good biodegradability of cod i e glucose in synthetic wastewater led to a relatively low dissolved oxygen do level below 1 mg l 47 which resulted in the preferential use of oxygen in ammoxidation while nitrite oxidation was inhibited 48 49 under the interaction of high fa limited do and alkaline ph in the wc treatment 49 partial nitrification was promoted and thus the no2 n content increased second during denitrification high ph has a strong inhibitory effect on the activity of nitrite reductase 50 the nitrite reduction process is an acid consumption reaction and a high ph inhibits the nitrite reduction reaction concurrently 51 0 37 5ch 3 coo 1no 2 0 62 5h 0 75 hco 3 0 5 n 2 0 5h 2 o in addition nitrite reductase has a lag period when nitrate and alkaline ph coexist which also leads to the inhibition of nitrite reduction this is due to the competition for the flow of electrons to nitrate reductase in an alkaline environment 51 53 because the rate of nitrate reduction seems to be greater than that of nitrite reduction electron flow to nitrite reductase may be temporarily shut off leading to the accumulation of nitrite in the periplasmic space of denitrifying bacteria 54 the competition is enhanced and nitrite reduction is further suppressed at high ph 51 therefore due to the harmfulness of nitrite in aquatic ecosystems 55 the ecological risk of no2 n accumulation due to high ph needs to be considered when waste concrete is widely used as the main substrate of cws and this effect can be alleviated by ph regulation 3 2 3 cod and tp during the whole experimental period significantly lower cod res were observed in the wc treatment than in the wg and wb treatments p 0 001 fig 2 c during the stable period of the normal stage the average cod res were 72 09 0 21 82 37 0 39 and 84 81 0 80 for the wc wg and wb treatments respectively while the average values were 81 60 0 03 85 22 0 13 and 87 76 0 11 for the wc wg and wb treatments respectively at the acid stage the artificial regulation of influent ph could significantly increase the cod re p 0 001 in cws cod removal is mainly accomplished by aerobic or anaerobic heterotrophic microbial metabolism 47 however alkaline conditions and the accumulation of nitrite affect bacterial processes inhibiting microbial metabolism 56 thus the high ph caused by waste concrete can result in a decrease in the cod re although the cod re could be improved by influent ph regulation wc treatment led to the lowest cod re compared with the wg and wb treatments this result can be explained by the fact that the high ph in the wc treatment was caused by the release of alkaline substances from the substrate which first pass by the biofilms on the substrate surface thus the biofilm was probably subjected to alkaline stress that was greater than the measured ph in the effluent contrary to the published literature 12 21 the wc treatment did not result in a significantly higher tp re than the wg or wb treatment fig 2 d during both the stable period in the normal stage and the acid stage wg produced the highest tp re a slightly higher tp re was observed with the wc treatment than with the wb treatment with influent ph regulation in the wc treatment the tp re first decreased from 82 71 to 76 05 and then gradually recovered to 84 68 at the late acid stage when all three treatments produced relatively high tp res i e 84 68 92 70 and 89 98 for the wc wg and wb treatments respectively the results suggested that artificial influent ph regulation had little effect on tp removal in cws with waste concrete as the substrate p 0 252 phosphorus removal mainly depends on physical and chemical adsorption there have been many relevant studies on finding cement concrete fly ash and other cement containing substances for the efficient removal of phosphorus 21 57 the cement contained in waste concrete is almost completely insoluble in water and is rich in calcium ions which can react with phosphorus to form precipitates 58 the product of the cement and phosphorus reaction does not produce flocculation which indicates that cement is an ideal phosphorus removal material 21 some studies have shown that a relatively high ph is favorable for the chemical precipitation of calcium phosphate 59 60 however as the ph increased the concentration of oh in the solution gradually increased and oh could compete with po4 3 for adsorption sites in addition with increasing ph the oxides dissolved slower and to a lesser extent severely limiting the precipitation process these two negative effects outweighed the positive effect 61 thus tp removal was promoted slightly after the ph decreased in the wc treatment the bricks contain aluminum ions are porous 62 and have a good phosphorus removal effect in this experiment the influent phosphorus concentration was low and effective tp removal was achieved in each device this study indicated that when the influent ph in the wc system was adjusted to an average of 2 77 the ph of the effluent was 8 15 it is estimated that to achieve a near neutral effluent when using wc the ph of the influent should be adjusted to 2 or even lower however this strategy i e decreasing influent ph to a strongly acidic value potentially both leads to new ecological risks and increases cw operational costs the results showed that waste concrete is very suitable for the treatment of acidic sewage and can not only adjust the effluent ph but also increase the pollutant re however when waste concrete cws are used to treat near neutral sewage more efficient and safer strategies should be developed mixing waste concrete with substrates that have buffer capacities on ph such as pumice diatomite pyrite and volcanic rocks and controlling the amount of waste concrete may be a better strategy which needs more study in the future 3 3 microbial diversity the shannon index sni and abundance based coverage estimator ace were calculated to compare the bacterial α diversity variation between treatments fig 3 at the ens wc exhibited significantly lower sni and ace values than wg p 0 001 and wb p 0 001 with influent ph regulation the sni in wc increased from 2 71 0 05 to 3 56 0 05 while the ace increased from 292 62 60 80 to 391 37 89 4 therefore it can be inferred that the continuous strongly alkaline environment fig 1 b caused by the alkaline substances in concrete over time with wc treatment probably places pressure on microbial community diversity and richness which is consistent with the results of previous reports 63 after this alkalinity was alleviated the pressure on the microbial community diversity was also alleviated which manifested as an increase in the sni however the ace did not significantly recover which indicated that the strong alkalinity of waste concrete may have an irreversible effect on microbial community richness 3 4 microbial compositions at the phylum level proteobacteria patescibacteria actinobacteriota chloroflexi and bacteroidota were detected on each substrate surface fig 4 a and are commonly found in sewage treatment systems 64 65 at the ens the microbial community structure at the phylum level in wc was significantly different from that in the other two treatments and was dominated by proteobacteria the relative abundance of proteobacteria in wc reached 81 28 while that in wg and wb was 28 26 and 24 29 respectively after the acidity of the influent increased the community structure of wc changed tending to approach that of the other two treatments at the phylum level the relative abundance of proteobacteria was reduced to 43 04 while that of patescibacteria and actinobacteriota increased to 24 77 and 22 75 respectively the variation in proteobacteria abundance with ph regulation is consistent with a previous study showing that γ proteobacteria account for a large proportion of haloalkaliphilic microorganisms 66 at the family level the microbial composition of wc was quite different from those of wg and wb fig 4 b at the ens rhodocyclaceae and rhodobacteraceae were the most dominant families of wc accounting for 34 32 and 22 99 of the total abundance respectively and these bacteria have been confirmed to often participate in nitrate removal 67 68 and exhibit salt tolerance 69 in addition the relative abundance of comamonadaceae in wc 13 19 was slightly higher than that in wg 10 89 and wb 9 70 and comamonadaceae species are capable of nitrate removal 68 at ens norank o saccharimonadales was the dominant population in wg and wb and the microbial compositions of wg and wb were similar at the eas the relative abundance advantage of rhodocyclaceae and rhodobacteraceae was reduced in wc but rhodocyclaceae was still the dominant population the abundances of saccharimonadaceae propionibacteriaceae and micrococcaceae in wc increased and these bacteria may be sensitive to alkaline conditions wg and wb showed little change in microbial composition at the eas compared with the ens 3 5 n cycle genes at the ens the abundance of anammox genes in wc was 4 55 107 copies cm3 only 11 81 of the average of that in wg and wb fig 5 the abundance of anammox genes in wc increased significantly p 0 001 after the decrease in influent ph rising to 84 40 of the mean of that in wg and wb at the ens wc produced the highest abundance of amoa 4 15 times higher than the mean of that produced by wg and wb amoa is a gene encoding the key enzyme ammonia monooxygenase amo α subgene in the process of ammonia oxidation 70 with the influent ph regulation in wc the abundance of amoa decreased to 2 32 times the mean of that in wg and wb at the ens and eas the nxra abundance in wc was 0 24 and 1 60 times that in wg and wb respectively the abundance of nirs nirk was highest in wc at ens among the three treatments reaching 1 51 times the mean in wg and wb and the value decreased to 0 78 times that in eas the inhibition of anammox gene expression by the strong alkalinity of wc is consistent with the results of tomaszewski et al 71 who suggested that when the ph value was higher than the optimal range the anammox activity was strongly inhibited the stimulation of amoa by the alkalinity of wc was probably related to ammonia oxidizing archaea which exhibited stronger alkali resistance than ammonia oxidizing bacteria 72 73 while the stimulation of nirs nirk by the alkaline conditions was probably related to the increase in the amount of reaction substrate i e no2 n a similar result was observed by 74 the pathway related to the effect of the alkaline conditions in wc was established fig 6 the combined effects of the inhibition of nxra and anammox expression and the stimulation of amoa induced the accumulation of no2 n in the effluent of wc due to the great potential ecological risks related to the high no2 n effluent it is necessary to decrease the no2 n concentration in the effluent before it is dumped into natural aquatic ecosystems our results suggested the effectiveness of ph adjustment of the influent of the cws in addition there exists an alternative strategy i e two stage cw systems in which the effluent of wc is pumped into other cws in second stage cws shortcut nitrification denitrification and anammox can be enhanced by optimizing a series of design parameters such as do ph c n ratio and organic loading rate 75 76 this enhancement is relatively easy to achieve because the substrate of no2 n is generally one of the most important limiting factors 77 4 conclusion with waste concrete as a substrate the cws produced strongly alkaline effluent which had a significantly negative effect on cod and no2 n removal this negative effect could be significantly mitigated by decreasing the influent ph the strong alkalinity resulting from the use of waste concrete significantly decreased the α diversity of the bacterial community on substrate biofilms which could be mitigated by adjusting the influent ph a decrease in influent ph balanced the positive and negative effects of the high ph of waste concrete on the abundance of microbial n cycle genes e g the positive effects on amoa and nirs nirk and the negative effects on anammox genes and nxra therefore adjusting the ph is an effective strategy to alleviate the negative effects caused by the high ph of cws with waste concrete as the substrate such as a low cod re and high no2 n accumulation however this strategy may raise new ecological risks as the influent ph needs to be adjusted to high acidity therefore more feasible and effective mitigation strategies such as mixing substrates should be developed declaration of

12657,high demand of an efficient photocatalyst to degrade the antibiotics is one of the major challenges for industrial applications herein the cqds sensitized nife2o4 spheres anchored cocr2o4 moo3 x nss with high doxycycline doxy photodegradation efficiency were successfully prepared via co precipitation hydrothermal calcination assisted methods the abundant oxygen defects and synergistic effect of the photocatalyst contributed to its excellent photodegradation efficiency 99 70 at ph 6 with a rate constant of 0 0388 min 1 under visible light irradiation the kinetic study revealed that the interfacial engineered nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite have 13 30 5 87 and 7 05 times greater efficiency than the pristine moo3 cco and nfo respectively the n p n heterojunction formed under the action of internal electric field at the interface have greatly suppressed the charge carrier recombination meanwhile the enlarged specific surface area 342 70 m2 g provided more active sites to improve the reaction the superoxide radical o2 and hydroxyl radical oh played crucial role in the doxy degradation process as affirmed by radical trapping experiment and esr analysis moreover the crystalline structure bonding energy and photodegradation ability remained unchanged after six consecutive cycles indicating excellent recyclability and stability for practical applications the toxicity of the end products was investigated against e coli and s epidermis revealing the complete mineralization of the antibiotics and further confirmed by ecotoxicity analysis the dual vacancy enriched surface decorated and intrinsic o vacancies nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite exhibited remarkable stability structural and catalytic properties providing an insight into the efficient photocatalytic degradation of pharmaceutical pollutants graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords oxygen vacancy defect doxycycline photodegradation toxicity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antibiotics are the drugs widely used to prevent infections and it is frequently used in aquaculture pharmaceutical and animal husbandry industries and so on 1 3 the rapid increase in emerging pollutant from pharmaceutical and chemical industries have raised concerns about the ecosystem sustainability 4 5 the wastewater being mostly discharged into the natural ecosystem where the self purification capacity of nature has been exceeded leading to a tremendous effect on ecological environment and human health the antibiotics are released without complete metabolism as faeces and urine into the water bodies daily the starting dose administrated in human by both orally and intravenously is 200 mg doxycycline doxy is one of the most widely used emerging antibiotics to control and treat various infectious diseases in humans as well as animals 6 also it is used worldwide as agricultural feed additive and in animal husbandry recently doxy was used for the treatment of covid 19 positive patients who are affected with pulmonary disease for improvising them clinically 7 within the 72 h of administration 90 of the doxy dose is eliminated from the human body 8 antibiotics emerged from effluent treatment plants poultry waste live stock discharge and domestic wastewater entering the water bodies also cause adverse effects even at minimal concentrations 9 the wastewater treatment plants do not completely remove the antibiotic residues the doxycycline presence in the surface water of poyang lake reported to be at maximum of 39 7 ng l in china 10 thus the increase in concern related to quality of water and public health the effective removal of doxy from water is necessary by using the advanced oxidation processes aops aops received more attention because of its high degradation efficiency and non selective attack on pollutants by the generation of reactive oxygen species ros 11 13 the uv visible light irradiated onto the semiconductor material generates electron hole e h pairs in the cb conduction band and vb valence band respectively the migration of e h pairs from the bulk semiconductor to its surface is crucial to improve the photocatalytic performance the two methods involved in the attack of adsorbed pollutants i direct method the e h attacks the pollutant and begin their oxidation and reduction process ii indirect method the generated e h reacts with the molecular oxygen and hydroxyl ions dissolved in water and converts it into hydroxyl and superoxide ions which in turn involves in the degradation of the pollutant 14 16 finally the pollutants are degraded into smaller fragments and converted into co2 and water although there exists a columbic force between the photogenerated e h causing the recombination of e h suppressing the efficiency of the photocatalyst 17 various methods are adopted to inhibit the e h recombination such as the doping of metallic or non metallic species heterojunction formation of two or more semiconductor with suitable band gap potentials the coupling of semiconductor forming an n p n heterojunction are the most effective method the strong electric field strength of the coupled semiconductor prevents the e h recombination owing to the enhanced photodegradation process among the family of semiconductor moo3 an n type semiconductor considered to be star materials because of its abundant source chemical stability and non toxic nature it is widely used in the wastewater treatment 18 photovoltaics 19 sodium ion batteries heterojunction cathode material for lithium 20 electrocatalytic materials 21 and capacitors 22 the α moo3 with a uniform thickness or width and in a rectangular cross section are of particular interest because of its structure in anisotropic form the crystal facets are exposed due to the large surface to volume ratio the large band gap of moo3 2 7 3 2 ev makes it unsuitable for photocatalytic application and it is employed as an efficient adsorbent 23 to utilize the moo3 nanomaterials for photocatalytic degradation effectively the interfacing it with a semiconductor material with suitable band gap energy could improve its performance cobalt chromite cocr2o4 is a p type semiconductor with unique multi ferroic features such as rapid magnetization with electric polarization it proves to be a promising catalyst for the nox removal and diesel soot oxidation of toluene and water gas shift reaction cocr2o4nanoparticles nps exhibited good photocatalytic degradation with eriochrome black t dye 90 as model dye under visible light illumination 24 another interesting ferroic material is nife2o4 a fantastic magnetic material with a band gap of 1 7 ev 25 it exhibits good visible light harvesting capability in few studies the introduction of nife2o4 into bivo4 gc3n4 photocatalyst has greatly enhanced the photodegradation of ppcps under visible light 26 additionally the reusability of the catalyst needs to be realized for practical application magnetic catalyst is much attracted where it can be effectively utilised for practical application by decreasing the cost of the material the coupling of nife2o4 with the binary heterojunction significantly increases the recyclability where it also shows high curie temperature chemical stability and low cost 27 28 the iron based catalyst aids in the production of hydroxyl radicals under visible light in recent times quantum dots are considered as an excellent choice for increasing specific surface areas enhancing the light absorption capacity for facilitation of the transmission of charge carriers and its separation ability 29 carbon quantum dots cqds possesses low cytotoxicity good biocompatibility and dispersibility where it can be utilised effectively in the photocatalytic process as a co catalyst to improve the solar light harvesting ability the absorbability of the catalyst is enhanced by increasing the contact areas between the target compound and nanomaterials 30 the combination of cqds with the ternary heterojunction can modulate the photocatalyst system with a greater synergetic photocatalytic activity and enhanced stability the oxygen vacancy introduction promotes the separation of charge carriers and ability of interfacial charge transfer the distinct properties exhibited by the metal oxide supported catalysts possessing oxygen vacancy as affirmed with the theoretical and experimental studies where these lattices act as active sites for the catalytic reactions the oxygen deficient moo3 x can absorb photons efficiently and release of trapped electrons with the transfer of electrons to connected hetero component in the photocatalytic reaction system the crucial part of this study is the oxygen vacancy

material fig s1b the cluster of nanospheres is clearly observed in supplementary material fig s1c confirming the morphology of nife2o4 nfo the supplementary material fig s1d represents the sem image of nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco the decoration of nife2o4 on the sheets is seen and the tiny dots upon the nanospheres confirm the decoration of cqds the tightly coupled moo3 x cco nss with huge surface areas and numerous active sites facilitate the dispersion of nfo nanospheres and further doping of cqds the contact established between moo3 x cco nss and nfo to form the ternary heterojunction increasing the active sites of the catalyst and thus improving the photocatalytic performance the evenly distribution of the elements has been confirmed by the elemental analysis as

obtained from saed patterns of 511 040 021 and 440 belonging to cco moo3 x cqds and nfo respectively fig 2c the morphology of the nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite are successfully confirmed by tem and sem analysis the crystal structure phase purity and constituents of the prepared samples were examined by xrd fig 3a depicts the xrd patterns of the prepared samples the peaks correspond to orthorhombic phase of moo3 with a lattice constant of a b c is 3 962 å 13 858 å and 3 697 å where other phases were not identified the 2ɵ values at 12 94 23 66 26 24 27 72 30 26 34 31 39 43 46 42 49

moo3 x 20 cco diffraction pattern with lower intensity confirming the assembly of cco ns upon the moo3 ns the diffraction peaks at 36 42 41 77 54 58 and 63 9 corresponds to 311 400 422 and 440 hkl planes of nfo nanospheres 38 the decoration of nfo upon the binary heterojunction caused the disappearance of peak at 19 02 belonging to the hkl planes of cco the peaks at 35 77 55 07 found in the moo3 x 20 cco 5 nfo corresponds to the 311 and 422 hkl planes of nfo confirming the decoration of nfo nanospheres on the moo3 x cco nss further the deposition of cqds upon the ternary heterojunction has decreased the intensity of the peaks the diffraction peaks of the ncs at the 040 and 021 facets there is an obvious shift to lower angles compared to pristine moo3 fig 3b this shift could be attributed to lattice expansion upon decoration of a few co and cr ions on the lattice site of moo3 32 contrarily an obvious right shift of moo3 peaks was observed in the composite in compared to pristine moo3 the peak shift of the 040 facet from 23 62 to 23 52 23 46 23 34 confirming the interlayer space expansion improving the photocatalytic performance with the decoration of cco ns nfo and cqds this peak shift correlates well with the drs results where the bandgap of composite decreases upon further decoration these results confirm the oxygen vacancy enrichment by the cco nanosheets grown over the moo3 x the further decoration has improved the oxygen vacancies in the prepared composite the crystalline size of the prepared samples was calculated by using the equation provided below eq 2 2 d kλ βcosθ where k is the constant λ is the cu kα1 radiation which is equivalent to 1 54 å β refers to diffraction peak full width at half maximum ɵ refers to diffraction angles the calculated crystalline size of moo3 x cco nfo are 3 07 å 2 55 å and 1 94 å the scherrer equation is suitable only for the nps with crystalline size 100 nm the crystalline strain created during the

nife2o4 moo3 x 20 cco moo3 x 20 cco 5 nfo and moo3 x 20 cco 5 nfo 1 cqds a comparison between the results shows different crystallite sizes obtained by the scherer and w h equations confirming the effects of both crystallite size and strain on the peak broadening for the samples especially for the composite sample 3 1 2 xps spectra xps spectra were investigated to understand chemical

octahedral environment fig 4g as shown in fig 4h the c 1s xps spectra exhibits one signal at 283 6 ev where it is attributed to cc bond aroused due to c pollution from the instrument 49 the xps results affirmed the successful fabrication of nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite 3 1 3 nitrogen adsorption and desorption studies to explore the important role of surface areas pore volume pore radius of as synthesised composite on the photodegradation performance n2 adsorption and desorption isotherms and bjh pore distribution were investigated in detail the bath temperature for analysis was 77 5 k fig 5a depicts the n2 adsorption and desorption isotherm with an inset pore size distribution curve for the prepared samples it is clear from the figure that surface area of nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite are much greater than moo3 x cco nfo the optimal surface area was observed due to the unification of the individual particles the surface area of composite 342

fig 5a it is classified as type iv isotherm for the moo3 x cco nfo and nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite the supplementary material table s1 displays the results of the surface area pore volume and pore size of the prepared samples the higher surface area and pores were due to the rich oxygen vacancies the higher surface areas of the composite can provide higher active sites and hence leading to enhancement of the photocatalytic performance of the composite 3 1 4 uv visible diffuse reflectance uv vis drs studies the uv vis drs analysis were carried out to determine the optical characteristics of the prepared photocatalyst the band energy eg the difference between the vb and cb potential is one of the crucial parameters to estimate the region of sample absorption on using

first ionization energy and the electron affinity of the element the results are summarized in table 2 the band gap energy of the prepared samples is summarized in table 3 the narrow band gap of the composite could have higher visible light harvesting capability which favours the photocatalytic degradation of doxy 3 1 5 raman spectra the physical properties of the nanomaterials are determined based on the interaction between the vibrational modes of molecules or lattices the raman spectra of the prepared samples are provided in fig 5c the raman band observed in the region from 1000 to 600 cm 1 corresponds to moo6 octahedral stretching modes and the bands in the region from 200 to 400 cm 1 and the lower bands below 200 cm 1 are attributed to the moo6 octahedral bending modes in case of cco the raman bands observed at 195 21 cm 1 f2g for the polycrystalline materials and it is well consistent with the previous study 52 53 the intensity of the raman spectra decreased for the nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite where it indicates that the raman modes are affected where the moo3 x cco and nfo bands are present in the nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite thus the results confirm the successful fabrication of the nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite 3 2 photocatalytic degradation the photocatalytic performance of the prepared samples was evaluated by the degradation of doxy as a representative antibiotic contaminant under visible light the doxy concentration of 100 mg l was degraded using 15 mg l of composite ph 7 the blank experiment was performed to verify that doxy would be decomposed without the photocatalysts indicating that the photolysis of doxy could be ignored supplementary material fig s2 the degradation of doxy was very hard without catalysts indicating the presence and higher stability in water bodies the reason for designing targeted cqds modified nfo nanospheres decorated moo3 x cco composite are investigated in detail in this study firstly the study focused to choose the best dopant percentage of cco ns on the moo3 x ns the uv vis absorption spectra of photodegradation of doxy by nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite under visible light irradiation are represented in fig 6a the λmax at 274 nm for doxy has decreased with increase of irradiation time the intensity of the peak decreases with increase in irradiation time affirming the photodegradation of doxy under visible light 3 2 1 effect of different photocatalyst fig 6b depicts the effect of photocatalyst for the photodegradation of doxy under visible light irradiation the combination of semiconductors with different mass ratio are investigated in detail as it plays a crucial role in improving the efficiency of the photocatalysts the different mass ratios of cco 0 01 m 10 0 02 m 20 and 0 03 m 30 deposited on the moo3 x where it can be clearly observed that moo3 x 20 cco concentration 74 62 at 280 min showed better degradation ability than the other dopant concentrations 10 cco 30 cco upon moo3 x thus the moo3 x 20 cco was selected for further studies paris et al 54 studied the effect of different mass ratio zns nis composite on the photocatalytic degradation of 2 nitrotoluene similar to the previous study the incorrect mass ratio showed lower activity of the heterojunctions to further enhance the photodegradation performance of the binary n p heterojunction the n nfo was selected to form a ternary heterojunction with n moo3 x and p cco next we also examined the effect of loading different decorant of nfo nanospheres 5 10 and 15 on the moo3 x 20 cco ns for the photodegradation of doxy the best condition for the effective electron transfer is provided with the 5 nfo interfaced with moo3 x 20 cco ns as shown in fig 6c the decorant concentration of 5 nfo showed improved degradation efficiency 77 05 the first order kinetic degradation rate was 1 18 1 45 and 1 21 times greater than 10 nfo 15 nfo and nfo respectively the best catalytic activity were exhibited with the 5 nfo decorant concentration and this is selected for further studies fig 6c the results reveal that in addition to the matching band gap energy between the semiconductors the mole ratio also plays a vital role in the photocatalytic performance and the charge carrier separation the different mass ratios of cqds 1 2 5 were loaded on the optimized n p n ternary heterojunction and the kinetic study results are depicted in fig 6d the k value of the degradation of doxy in presence of different cqds of 1 2 and 5 loaded onto the optimized composite were 0 0141 0 0120 and 0 0107 min 1 the degradation rate decreased with increasing the loading percentage of cqds the degradation efficiency of moo3 x cco nfo cqds 1 moo3 x cco nfo cqds 2 and moo3 cco nfo cqds 5 were 93 94 90 80 87 7 respectively the loaded cqds acts as active sites and enhances the visible light absorption by separating the photogenerated electron and hole pairs efficiently however the higher dosage of loading cqds inhibited the surface active sites of the composite and the adsorption of o2 55 hence the optimized nfo cqds 1 co decorated moo3 x cco composite demonstrated 13 3 5 87 and 7 05 times greater than moo3 x cco and nfo respectively the supplementary material table s2 represents the overall kinetic study details of the prepared samples yan et al 56 prepared nife2o4 mwcnts bioi composite and achieved a degradation percentage of 92 18 with 45 mg l of dox concentration the mlg zno composite were used for the degradation of doxy and it showed 95 of degradation after 300 min 57 li et al 58 synthesised il mil 68 in nh2 composite for the photodegradation of doxh and it showed a removal rate of 92 the comparative study of the degradation efficiency of prepared photocatalyst with the previously reported studies for the photodegradation of antibiotics is represented in table 1 3 2 2 effect of ph different doxy and composite concentration the surface charge of the photocatalyst adsorption capacity ionization state of the pollutant changes because of the change in ph value the ph value plays most important role in the photodegradation process the influence of ph on the photodegradation process was investigated in detail the supplementary material fig s4a represents the photodegradation efficiency of the photocatalyst at wide range of ph 5 0 9 0 the rate of photodegradation was greater at ph 6 99 70 the rate of degradation at ph 6 was 1 88 2 39 3 84 and 7 51 times greater than ph 5 ph 7 ph 8 and ph 9 respectively the degradation efficiency was greatly affected even in slightly acidic or strongly alkaline conditions at a strong alkaline condition the rate of degradation was 57 79 and degradation rate 0 0045 cm 1 were very low 66 67 the doxy is an amphoteric molecule where it shows different electrostatic forces of interaction as a function of ph as reported in previous studies 59 when ph value is less than 6 the doxy is mostly in its protonated form when the ph value is between 5 0 and 9 0 it is in zwitter ionic form is predominant where there is no electrostatic repulsion between the deprotonated doxy and the photocatalyst owing to good photocatalytic performance here it can be concluded that the ph 6 favours the photodegradation of doxy by the nfo cqds 1 co decorated moo3 cco composite the degradation efficiency and the kinetic study of the prepared samples under different ph are provided in the supplementary materials table s3 the influence of different composite dosages on the photodegradation process at 100 mg l doxy concentration was also examined the supplementary material fig s4b depicts the c c0 vs time min plot at different concentration of composite from 5 to 25 mg l at 100 mg l of doxy dosage the photodegradation process has been decreased with increase or decrease in the composite concentration the degradation efficiency at 5 10 15 20 and 25 mg l of the composite were 58 23 80 86 93 94 68 45 and 58 71 respectively the optimized concentration of composite showed greater degradation efficiency at 15 mg l the rate constant k of the composite at 15 mg l was 0 0141 min 1 which was 3 13 1 41 2 23 and 2 82 times higher than 5 10 20 and 25 mg l respectively the excessive dosage of the catalyst might inhibit the absorption of visible light and hence weakening the photocatalyst this phenomenon is called as scattering effect where the accumulation of the catalyst causes a decrease in penetration of light and opacity and hence the energy decreases 66 thus the degradation efficiency was higher at 15 mg l of composite the supplementary material table s4 shows the kinetic study and degradation at different composite dosages the effect of doxy concentration on the photocatalytic degradation is depicted in supplementary material fig s4c the concentration of doxy from 50 to 250 mg l was chosen to study the effect on the photodegradation performance of the composite 15 mg l the photodegradation efficiency was excellent at 50 mg l of doxy concentration the degradation efficiency of the composite decreased with increase in concentration of doxy the active site of the catalyst is blocked by the doxy which is covered on the surface of the catalyst this leads to decrease in generation of reactive oxygen species ros the degradation efficiency at 250 mg l concentration of doxy was 51 05 and the degradation efficiency was 99 99 at 50 mg l the supplementary material table s5 represents the degradation efficiency and kinetic study data at different doxy dosages the origins of the superior photocatalytic performance of nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite were further investigated by eis pl spectra the eis spectra of all the prepared samples were investigated and the results are depicted in fig 5d generally the smaller nyquist arc radius corresponds to lower carrier transfer resistance the eis nyquist curves for the composite are relatively much lesser compared to other samples indicating that the composite possesses greater charge carrier separation and transfer of the charge carriers at the interface 68 71 the bode plots of the prepared samples are depicted in fig s3 the phase angles are found to appear at the long range of frequency for the composite affirming the good charge transfer compared to the bode plot of moo3 x cco and moo3 x cco nfo it can be concluded that the charge transfer ability has increased with the formation of heterojunction 71 the pl spectra of the moo3 x cco nfo and nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite are shown in fig 5f it s universally accepted that the higher pl signal corresponds to higher recombination of charge carriers the nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite exhibited lower pl intensity which corresponds to higher separation of charge carriers the effective separation of charge carriers ascribes to the improved photocatalytic performance of the nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite it can be concluded that the modification of cqds on moo3 x cco nfo have relatively showed lower pl intensity the eis and pl spectra have agreed well with each other that the nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite are highly efficient when compared with the bare nps 3 3 photocatalytic radical species the photocatalytic effect was realized through the redox reaction occurred due to the photogenerated electrons and holes on the surface of the catalyst 50 in previous studies the photodegradation mechanism was focused mainly on the band structure of the photocatalyst and the intermediates formed during the degradation of the pollutants 51 the foremost intermediates of the photocatalytic reactions are the reactive species where the identification and evaluation of these reactive species are of most significance to understand and improve the photocatalytic mechanism and its practical applications the photocatalytic active species were investigated by performing the radical trapping experiments the free radical generated during the photodegradation process were confirmed by addition of quenching agents such as tert butyl alcohol t buoh for oh ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid edta for h agno3 for e and p benzoquinone p bzq for o2 supplementary material fig s5a these quenching agents were added under the same experimental conditions it can be observed that on addition of t buoh and p bzq the degradation rate has significantly reduced indicating that the oh and o2 were the major species involved in the photodegradation process the redox active species evolved during the photodegradation process were measured using esr analysis it is carried out to confirm the oh and o2 existence electron spin resonance esr spectra are obtained through variation in the external magnetic field with constant frequency the dmpo 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline were employed as a spin trapping reagent to capture oh and o2 the main active species involved in the photodegradation process were done using dmpo the characteristics peaks of the nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite showed relatively stronger with high intensity when compared with the moo3 x cco and moo3 x cco nfo the relatively weaker peaks indicating that hydroxyl radicals oh are less generated wherein the higher intensity corresponds to more hydroxyl radical generation fig 5e the esr analysis confirmed the production of free radicals during the photodegradation process 3 4 stability experiment the reusability is a crucial factor for evaluating whether the photocatalyst can be utilised for practical application or not the cycle experiments were carried out and the results are depicted in the supplementary material fig s5b the photodegradation rate of doxy by nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite decreases from 93 94 to 93 37 after six cycle experiments a little decline in the degradation efficiency was observed during photodegradation process the cycle test revealed that the prepared composite is extremely stable the xrd analysis after photodegradation process was performed supplementary material fig s5c the crystalline planes are retained as such and there is not much difference revealing that the nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite are structurally stable the xps spectra of the reused composite were also investigated all the elements were present in the full spectrum after six cycles fig 3 the contents of the elements decreased very slightly after the photodegradation process the hr xps spectra of all the states were fitted as before the cycles test it is demonstrated that the internal structure of the composite is not affected an excellent recyclability enabled the prepared nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite with great potential for wastewater treatment 3 5 photocatalytic mechanism the possible mechanism of the photodegradation process were deduced based on the radical trapping experiment type of semiconductor and the band gap positions of the samples the proposed photocatalytic mechanism is depicted in fig 7 the cb 3 45 and vb 0 34 of the moo3 x and the cb 0 80 vb 1 22 of cco and cb 0 46 vb 2 21 of nfo was calculated using uv vis drs analysis before the contact establishment the cb potential of moo3 x and cco are not suitable for the reduction of o2 to o2 further the vb potential of cco is less positive for the reduction of hydroxyl ion to hydroxyl radical the three semiconductors moo3 x cco and nfo which are n p and n type interfaced to form n p n heterojunction after interfacing the cb and vb positions of the semiconductors are altered until its fermi level reaches equilibrium the moo3 x ns assembled on cco ns and nfo nanospheres are decorated to modulate the 2d2d heterojunction the nfo were decorated on the ternary heterojunction to enhance the separation of electrons and hole pairs the cqds loaded on the ternary photocatalyst have boosted the charge carrier density the semiconductors interfaced forms a heterojunction results in rearrangement of electron due to the difference in fermi level energy the equilibrium is reached during the interface formation and the e transfers from higher energy level to lower energy level to maintain equilibrium the difference in the fermi energy levels of moo3 x and nfo the electrons are diffused from moo3 x and cco to nfo this results in the formation of positive sections in moo3 x and nfo whereas negative charge accumulates near cco at its interface which results in the generation of two internal electric fields at the interface meanwhile the fermi level of cco moves upward and moo3 x and nfo moves downward and an equilibrium state is attained upon visible light irradiation the semiconductors are photo excited to produce photogenerated e and h 72 76 the e present in the cb of cco are transferred to the cb of moo3 x and nfo and the holes of moo3 x and nfo are transfer to the vb of cco under the action of internal electric fields the electron is migrated to cqds wherein the electron rich cqds reduces the electron transfers resistance this aids in the effective separation of the photogenerated charge carriers while the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst is promoted the cqds has an excellent reservoir transfer property hence the internal electric field established which separates the electrons and holes are effectively where it further improves the photocatalytic efficiency of composite 3 6 photodegradation pathway the photodegradation process of doxy and the intermediates formed investigated and identified using gc ms ms analysis the photodegradation pathway is displayed in fig 8 firstly the doxy undergoes demethylation deaminocarbonylation to form p1 m z 342 then it undergoes delamination dihydroxylation and decarbonylation to subsequently form an open ring structure 52 subsequently np2 m z 338 were formed by loop bonds breakage through dehydration and demethylation 53 furthermore these are degraded into smaller fragments p3 m z 224 with the removal phenol acid group another possible degradation pathway also possible as follows in pathway ii the doxy molecule was broken down by lose of a hydroxyl and n methyl group to form p4 m z 430 then the dehydration dealkylation and ring open reaction occurred where the p4 m z 430 transformed to p5 m 363 through further dealkylation dehydration and ring opening reaction subsequently the amidogen and hydroxyl were attacked by radicals resulting in generation of p6 m z 227 and p7 m z 183 then the cleavage leads to formation of p8 m z 179 further the total organic carbon toc was measured to evaluate the complete mineralization of doxy during the degradation process the toc removal was similar to that of the dox degradation the toc removal at the end of the process was 90 12 which is nearly equal to the degradation of doxy the smaller fragment intermediates are further completely mineralised into co2 and h2o 3 6 1 toxicity assessment of

and green algae are predicted using ecological structure activity relationships ecosar program 54 based on the classification by globally harmonised system the toxicity of the intermediates is divided into four levels as follows very toxic toxic harmful and not harmful as depicted in fig 9 the results reveals that the toxic reaction of p6 p7 and p8 are all belongs to harm less level for the three kinds of organisms which is similar to doxy in both chronic and acute toxicity the p1 p4 are in toxic and harmful level to fish daphnid and green algae the p5 intermediates are under very toxic level in case of all organisms the p6 intermediates are harmless to fish daphnid and algae the final products formed after p6 are belong to harmless therefore the degradation products are relatively safe

calcination methods the material characterization study revealed that the nfo nanospheres are embedded on the moo3 x cco nss with evenly loaded cqds the several optimization studies were performed to successfully fabricate the nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite where it facilitated the separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes and strengthening the visible light harvesting capacity the rate of photodegradation of doxy by the nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite showed 13 3 5 87 and 7 05 times greater than moo3 cco and nfo respectively the different optimization studies were performed to selectively enhance the photodegradation efficiency of the photocatalyst the photodegradation pathway was elucidated based on the gc ms ms analysis the reactive species involved in the photodegradation process are the o2 and oh and the primary contributors were confirmed by the esr analysis the toxicity assessment for the end product after degradation against e coli

efficient photocatalytic degradation of pharmaceutical pollutants graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords oxygen vacancy defect doxycycline photodegradation toxicity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antibiotics are the drugs widely used to prevent infections and it is frequently used in aquaculture pharmaceutical and animal husbandry industries and so on 1 3 the rapid increase in emerging pollutant from pharmaceutical and chemical industries have raised concerns about the ecosystem sustainability 4 5 the wastewater being mostly discharged into the natural ecosystem where the self purification capacity of nature has been exceeded leading to a tremendous effect on ecological environment and human health the antibiotics are released without complete metabolism as faeces and urine into the water bodies daily the starting dose administrated in human by both orally and intravenously is 200 mg doxycycline doxy is one of the most widely used emerging antibiotics to control and treat various infectious diseases in humans as well as animals 6 also it is used worldwide as agricultural feed additive and in animal husbandry recently doxy was used for the treatment of covid 19 positive patients who are affected with pulmonary disease for improvising them clinically 7 within the 72 h of administration 90 of the doxy dose is eliminated from the human body 8 antibiotics emerged from effluent treatment plants poultry waste live stock discharge and domestic wastewater entering the water bodies also cause adverse effects even at minimal concentrations 9 the wastewater treatment plants do not completely remove the antibiotic residues the doxycycline presence in the surface water of poyang lake reported to be at maximum of 39 7 ng l in china 10 thus the increase in concern related to quality of water and public health the effective removal of doxy from water is necessary by using the advanced oxidation processes aops aops received more attention because of its high degradation efficiency and non selective attack on pollutants by the generation of reactive oxygen species ros 11 13 the uv visible light irradiated onto the semiconductor material generates electron hole e h pairs in the cb conduction band and vb valence band respectively the migration of e h pairs from the bulk semiconductor to its surface is crucial to improve the photocatalytic performance the two methods involved in the attack of adsorbed pollutants i direct method the e h attacks the pollutant and begin their oxidation and reduction process ii indirect method the generated e h reacts with the molecular oxygen and hydroxyl ions dissolved in water and converts it into hydroxyl and superoxide ions which in turn involves in the degradation of the pollutant 14 16 finally the pollutants are degraded into smaller fragments and converted into co2 and water although there exists a columbic force between the photogenerated e h causing the recombination of e h suppressing the efficiency of the photocatalyst 17 various methods are adopted to inhibit the e h recombination such as the doping of metallic or non metallic species heterojunction formation of two or more semiconductor with suitable band gap potentials the coupling of semiconductor forming an n p n heterojunction are the most effective method the strong electric field strength of the coupled semiconductor prevents the e h recombination owing to the enhanced photodegradation process among the family of semiconductor moo3 an n type semiconductor considered to

effectively in the photocatalytic process as a co catalyst to improve the solar light harvesting ability the absorbability of the catalyst is enhanced by increasing the contact areas between the target compound and nanomaterials 30 the combination of cqds with the ternary heterojunction can modulate the photocatalyst system with a greater synergetic photocatalytic activity and enhanced stability the oxygen vacancy introduction promotes the separation of charge carriers and ability of interfacial charge transfer the distinct properties exhibited by the metal oxide supported catalysts possessing oxygen vacancy as affirmed with the theoretical and experimental studies where these lattices act as active sites for the catalytic reactions the oxygen deficient moo3 x can absorb photons efficiently and release of trapped electrons with the transfer of electrons to connected hetero component in the photocatalytic reaction system the crucial part of this study is the oxygen vacancy enrichment in moo3 x occurs via the growth of cocr2o4 nanosheets through facile approach in moo3 x the surface passivation of oxygen vacancy is inhibited wherein the active sites present in the

degradation of doxy as a representative antibiotic contaminant under visible light the doxy concentration of 100 mg l was degraded using 15 mg l of composite ph 7 the blank experiment was performed to verify that doxy would be decomposed without the photocatalysts indicating that the photolysis of doxy could be ignored supplementary material fig s2 the degradation of doxy was very hard without catalysts indicating the presence and higher stability in water bodies the reason for designing targeted cqds modified nfo nanospheres decorated moo3 x cco composite are investigated in detail in this study firstly the study focused to choose the best dopant percentage of cco ns on the moo3 x ns the uv vis absorption spectra of photodegradation of doxy by nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite under visible light irradiation are represented in fig 6a the λmax at 274 nm for doxy has decreased with increase of irradiation time the intensity of the peak decreases with increase in irradiation time affirming the photodegradation of doxy under visible light 3 2 1 effect of different photocatalyst fig 6b depicts the effect of photocatalyst for the photodegradation of doxy under visible light irradiation the combination of semiconductors with different mass ratio are investigated in detail as it plays a crucial role in improving the efficiency of the photocatalysts the different mass ratios of cco 0 01 m 10 0 02 m 20 and 0 03 m 30 deposited on the moo3 x where it can be clearly observed that moo3 x 20 cco concentration 74 62 at 280 min showed better degradation ability than the other dopant concentrations 10 cco 30 cco upon moo3 x thus the moo3 x 20 cco was selected for further studies paris et al 54 studied the effect of different mass ratio zns nis composite on the photocatalytic degradation of 2 nitrotoluene similar to the previous study the incorrect mass ratio showed lower activity of the heterojunctions to further enhance the photodegradation performance of the binary n p heterojunction the n nfo was selected to form a ternary heterojunction with n moo3 x and p cco next we also examined the effect of loading different decorant of nfo nanospheres 5 10 and 15 on the moo3 x 20 cco ns for the photodegradation of doxy the best condition for the effective electron transfer is provided with the 5 nfo interfaced with moo3 x 20 cco ns as shown in fig 6c the decorant concentration of 5 nfo showed improved degradation efficiency 77 05 the first order kinetic degradation rate was 1 18 1 45 and 1 21 times greater than 10 nfo 15 nfo and nfo respectively the best catalytic activity were exhibited with the 5 nfo decorant concentration and this is selected for further studies fig 6c the results reveal that in addition to the matching band gap energy between the semiconductors the mole ratio also plays a vital role in the photocatalytic performance and the charge carrier separation the different mass ratios of cqds 1 2 5 were loaded on the optimized n p n ternary heterojunction and the kinetic study results are depicted in fig 6d the k value of the degradation of doxy in presence of different cqds of 1 2 and 5 loaded onto the optimized composite were 0 0141 0 0120 and 0 0107 min 1 the degradation rate decreased with increasing the loading percentage of cqds the degradation efficiency of moo3 x cco nfo cqds 1 moo3 x cco nfo cqds 2 and moo3 cco nfo cqds 5 were 93 94 90 80 87 7 respectively the loaded cqds acts as active sites and enhances the visible light absorption by separating the photogenerated electron and hole pairs efficiently however the higher dosage of loading cqds inhibited the surface active sites of the composite and the adsorption of o2 55 hence the optimized nfo cqds 1 co decorated moo3 x cco composite demonstrated 13 3 5 87 and 7 05 times greater than moo3 x cco and nfo respectively the supplementary material table s2 represents the overall kinetic study details of the prepared samples yan et al 56 prepared nife2o4 mwcnts bioi composite and achieved a degradation percentage of 92 18 with 45 mg l of dox concentration the mlg zno composite were used for the degradation of doxy and it showed 95 of degradation after 300 min 57 li et al 58 synthesised il mil 68 in nh2 composite for the photodegradation of doxh and it showed a removal rate of 92 the comparative study of the degradation efficiency of prepared photocatalyst with the previously reported studies for the photodegradation of antibiotics is represented in table 1 3 2 2 effect of ph different doxy and composite concentration the surface charge of the photocatalyst adsorption capacity ionization state of the pollutant changes because of the change in ph value the ph value plays most important role in the photodegradation process the influence of ph on the photodegradation process was investigated in detail the supplementary material fig s4a represents the photodegradation efficiency of the photocatalyst at wide range of ph 5 0 9 0 the rate of photodegradation was greater at ph 6 99 70 the rate of degradation at ph 6 was 1 88 2 39 3 84 and 7 51 times greater than ph 5 ph 7 ph 8 and ph 9 respectively the degradation efficiency was greatly affected even in slightly acidic or strongly alkaline conditions at a strong alkaline condition the rate of degradation was 57 79 and degradation rate 0 0045 cm 1 were very low 66 67 the doxy is an amphoteric molecule where it shows different electrostatic forces of interaction as a function of ph as reported in previous studies 59 when ph value is less than 6 the doxy is mostly in its protonated form when the ph value is between 5 0 and 9 0 it is in zwitter ionic form is predominant where there is no electrostatic repulsion between the deprotonated doxy and the photocatalyst owing to good photocatalytic performance here it can be concluded that the ph 6 favours the photodegradation of doxy by the nfo cqds 1 co decorated moo3 cco composite the degradation efficiency and the kinetic study of the prepared samples under different ph are provided in the supplementary materials table s3 the influence of different composite dosages on the photodegradation process at 100 mg l doxy concentration was also examined the supplementary material fig s4b depicts the c c0 vs time min plot at different concentration of composite from 5 to 25 mg l at 100 mg l of doxy dosage the photodegradation process has been decreased with increase or decrease in the composite concentration the degradation efficiency at 5 10 15 20 and 25 mg l of the composite were 58 23 80 86 93 94 68 45 and 58 71 respectively the optimized concentration of composite showed greater degradation efficiency at 15 mg l the rate constant k of the composite at 15 mg l was 0 0141 min 1 which was 3 13 1 41 2 23 and 2 82 times higher than 5 10 20 and 25 mg l respectively the excessive dosage of the catalyst might inhibit the absorption of visible light and hence weakening the photocatalyst this phenomenon is called as scattering effect where the accumulation of the catalyst causes a decrease in penetration of light and opacity and hence the energy decreases 66 thus the degradation efficiency was higher at 15 mg l of composite the supplementary material table s4 shows the kinetic study and degradation at different composite dosages the effect of doxy concentration on the photocatalytic degradation is depicted in supplementary material fig s4c the concentration of doxy from 50 to 250 mg l was chosen to study the effect on the photodegradation performance of the composite 15 mg l the photodegradation efficiency was excellent at 50 mg l of doxy concentration the degradation efficiency of the composite decreased with increase in concentration of doxy the active site of the catalyst is blocked by the doxy which is covered on the surface of the catalyst this leads to decrease in generation of reactive oxygen species ros the degradation efficiency at 250 mg l concentration of doxy was 51 05 and the degradation efficiency was 99 99 at 50 mg l the supplementary material table s5 represents the degradation efficiency and kinetic study data at different doxy dosages the origins of the superior photocatalytic performance of nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite were further investigated by eis pl spectra the eis spectra of all the prepared samples were investigated and the results are depicted in fig 5d generally the smaller nyquist arc radius corresponds to lower carrier transfer resistance the eis nyquist curves for the composite are relatively much lesser compared to other samples indicating that the composite possesses greater charge carrier separation and transfer of the charge carriers at the interface 68 71 the bode plots of the prepared samples are depicted in fig s3 the phase angles are found to appear at the long range of frequency for the composite affirming the good charge transfer compared to the bode plot of moo3 x cco and moo3 x cco nfo it can be concluded that the charge transfer ability has increased with the formation of heterojunction 71 the pl spectra of the moo3 x cco nfo and nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite are shown in fig 5f it s universally accepted that the higher pl signal corresponds to higher recombination of charge carriers the nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite exhibited lower pl intensity which corresponds to higher separation of charge carriers the effective separation of charge carriers ascribes to the improved photocatalytic performance of the nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite it can be concluded that the modification of cqds on moo3 x cco nfo have relatively showed lower pl intensity the eis and pl spectra have agreed well with each other that the nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite are highly efficient when compared with the bare nps 3 3 photocatalytic radical species the photocatalytic effect was realized through the redox reaction occurred due to the photogenerated electrons and holes on the surface of the catalyst 50 in previous studies the photodegradation mechanism was focused mainly on the band structure of the photocatalyst and the intermediates formed during the degradation of the pollutants 51 the foremost intermediates of the photocatalytic reactions are the reactive species where the identification and evaluation of these reactive species are of most significance to understand and improve the photocatalytic mechanism and its practical applications the photocatalytic active species were investigated by performing the radical trapping experiments the free radical generated during the photodegradation process were confirmed by addition of quenching agents such as tert butyl alcohol t buoh for oh ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid edta for h agno3 for e and p benzoquinone p bzq for o2 supplementary material fig s5a these quenching agents were added under the same experimental conditions it can be observed that on addition of t buoh and p bzq the degradation rate has significantly reduced indicating that the oh and o2 were the major species involved in the photodegradation process the redox active species evolved during the photodegradation process were measured using esr analysis it is carried out to confirm the oh and o2 existence electron spin resonance esr spectra are obtained through variation in the external magnetic field with constant frequency the dmpo 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline were employed as a spin trapping reagent to capture oh and o2 the main active species involved in the photodegradation process were done using dmpo the characteristics peaks of the nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite showed relatively stronger with high intensity when compared with the moo3 x cco and moo3 x cco nfo the relatively weaker peaks indicating that hydroxyl radicals oh are less generated wherein the higher intensity corresponds to more hydroxyl radical generation fig 5e the esr analysis confirmed the production of free radicals during the photodegradation process 3 4 stability experiment the reusability is a crucial factor for evaluating whether the photocatalyst can be utilised for practical application or not the cycle experiments were carried out and the results are depicted in the supplementary material fig s5b the photodegradation rate of doxy by nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite decreases from 93 94 to 93 37 after six cycle experiments a little decline in the degradation efficiency was observed during photodegradation process the cycle test revealed that the prepared composite is extremely stable the xrd analysis after photodegradation process was performed supplementary material fig s5c the crystalline planes are retained as such and there is not much difference revealing that the nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite are structurally stable the xps spectra of the reused composite were also investigated all the elements were present in the full spectrum after six cycles fig 3 the contents of the elements decreased very slightly after the photodegradation process the hr xps spectra of all the states were fitted as before the cycles test it is demonstrated that the internal structure of the composite is not affected an excellent recyclability enabled the prepared nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite with great potential for wastewater treatment 3 5 photocatalytic mechanism the possible mechanism of the photodegradation process were deduced based on the radical trapping experiment type of semiconductor and the band gap positions of the samples the proposed photocatalytic mechanism is depicted in fig 7 the cb 3 45 and vb 0 34 of the moo3 x and the cb 0 80 vb 1 22 of cco and cb 0 46 vb 2 21 of nfo was calculated using uv vis drs analysis before the contact establishment the cb potential of moo3 x and cco are not suitable for the reduction of o2 to o2 further the vb potential of cco is less positive for the reduction of hydroxyl ion to hydroxyl radical the three semiconductors moo3 x cco and nfo which are n p and n type interfaced to form n p n heterojunction after interfacing the cb and vb positions of the semiconductors are altered until its fermi level reaches equilibrium the moo3 x ns assembled on cco ns and nfo nanospheres are decorated to modulate the 2d2d heterojunction the nfo were decorated on the ternary heterojunction to enhance the separation of electrons and hole pairs the cqds loaded on the ternary photocatalyst have boosted the charge carrier density the semiconductors interfaced forms a heterojunction results in rearrangement of electron due to the difference in fermi level energy the equilibrium is reached during the interface formation and the e transfers from higher energy level to lower energy level to maintain equilibrium the difference in the fermi energy levels of moo3 x and nfo the electrons are diffused from moo3 x and cco to nfo this results in the formation of positive sections in moo3 x and nfo whereas negative charge accumulates near cco at its interface which results in the generation of two internal electric fields at the interface meanwhile the fermi level of cco moves upward and moo3 x and nfo moves downward and an equilibrium state is attained upon visible light irradiation the semiconductors are photo excited to produce photogenerated e and h 72 76 the e present in the cb of cco are transferred to the cb of moo3 x and nfo and the holes of moo3 x and nfo are transfer to the vb of cco under the action of internal electric fields the electron is migrated to cqds wherein the electron rich cqds reduces the electron transfers resistance this aids in the effective separation of the photogenerated charge carriers while the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst is promoted the cqds has an excellent reservoir transfer property hence the internal electric field established which separates the electrons and holes are effectively where it further improves the photocatalytic efficiency of composite 3 6 photodegradation pathway the photodegradation process of doxy and the intermediates formed investigated and identified using gc ms ms analysis the photodegradation pathway is displayed in fig 8 firstly the doxy undergoes demethylation deaminocarbonylation to form p1 m z 342 then it undergoes delamination dihydroxylation and decarbonylation to subsequently form an open ring structure 52 subsequently np2 m z 338 were formed by loop bonds breakage through dehydration and demethylation 53 furthermore these are degraded into smaller fragments p3 m z 224 with the removal phenol acid group another possible degradation pathway also possible as follows in pathway ii the doxy molecule was broken down by lose of a hydroxyl and n methyl group to form p4 m z 430 then the dehydration dealkylation and ring open reaction occurred where the p4 m z 430 transformed to p5 m 363 through further dealkylation dehydration and ring opening reaction subsequently the amidogen and hydroxyl were attacked by radicals resulting in generation of p6 m z 227 and p7 m z 183 then the cleavage leads to formation of p8 m z 179 further the total organic carbon toc was measured to evaluate the complete mineralization of doxy during the degradation process the toc removal was similar to that of the dox degradation the toc removal at the end of the process was 90 12 which is nearly equal to the degradation of doxy the smaller fragment intermediates are further completely mineralised into co2 and h2o 3 6 1 toxicity assessment of intermediates the toxicity of the intermediates are categorised based on its exposure acute and chronic toxicity here the effect of the intermediates causing acute and chronic toxicity in fish daphnid and green algae are predicted using ecological structure activity relationships ecosar program 54 based on the classification by globally harmonised system the toxicity of the intermediates is divided into four levels as follows very toxic toxic harmful and not harmful as depicted in fig 9 the results reveals that the toxic reaction of p6 p7 and p8 are all belongs to harm less level for the three kinds of organisms which is similar to doxy in both chronic and acute toxicity the p1 p4 are in toxic and harmful level to fish daphnid and green algae the p5 intermediates are under very toxic level in case of all organisms the p6 intermediates are harmless to fish daphnid and algae the final products formed after p6 are belong to harmless therefore the degradation products are relatively safe and are non toxic in nature 3 7 end product toxicity assessment the photocatalytic degradation of doxy by the prepared photocatalyst was 93 94 the end product toxicity was performed towards e coli 0157h7 gram negative and s epidermis nc1m2493 gram positive and it is represented in supplementary material fig s5d the bacterial inhibition was quantified based on broth dilution method the toxicity investigation was done for the untreated and irradiated samples the toxicity of the degraded product was 9 9 and 8 6 for e coli and s epidermis respectively the end product toxicity assessment affirmed that the end product is non toxic 4 conclusion in this work nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite was successfully constructed though a co precipitation sole gel assisted hydrothermal calcination methods the material characterization study revealed that the nfo nanospheres are embedded on the moo3 x cco nss with evenly loaded cqds the several optimization studies were performed to successfully fabricate the nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite where it facilitated the separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes and strengthening the visible light harvesting capacity the rate of photodegradation of doxy by the nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite showed 13 3 5 87 and 7 05 times greater than moo3 cco and nfo respectively the different optimization studies were performed to selectively enhance the photodegradation efficiency of the photocatalyst the photodegradation pathway was elucidated based on the gc ms ms analysis the reactive species involved in the photodegradation process are the o2 and oh and the primary contributors were confirmed by the esr analysis the toxicity assessment for the end product after degradation against e coli and s epidermis confirmed the end products are non toxic the ecotoxicity studies also confirmed that the end products are harmless although the intermediates formed are very toxic overall the nfo cqds co decorated moo3 x cco composite has the great potential for the removal of the emerging contaminants in the water bodies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

into non toxic pollutants is an essential need 17 according to the previous literature semiconductor nanomaterial was widely used in the photocatalytic application on the removal of toxic pollutant

acid assisted au nanoparticle au nps synthesis briefly 1 ml of haucl4 10 mm and 0 5 ml of mgso4 10 mm were dissolved in 10 ml of distilled h2o and the solution was stirred for 15 min thereafter 40 μl of ascorbic acid 20 mm was added to the above solution and the mixture was kept for 30 mins to change to purple colour which indicate the formation of bimetallic au mg nanospheres 2 3 photocatalytic degradation of ps the photocatalytic degradation of ps 20 mg l was performed by irradiation of au mg nanosphere 50 mg l under 1000 w halogen lamp in presence of cl ion 1 mm here ps solution was prepared by addition of 20 mg of ps in 20 ml ethanol and stirred for 30 min at room temperature then diluted in distilled h2o for the effective formation of reactive oxygen species the photocatalytic degradation of ps was determined by performing total organic compound toc analysis every 20 min 10 ml of the reaction mixture was collected and toc was performed to determine by presence of ps similarly the photocatalytic degradation was performed in presence of various metal ions cl so4 no3 po4 and co3 1 mm and the degradation of ps was determined in addition the photocatalytic degradation of ps was also performed in absence of metal ions by varying the nanomaterial concentration 10 to 100 mg l by varying the ps concentration 5 to 25 mg l and by varying ph 4 to 9 20 mg l ps and 50 mg l au mg to determine the reusability of the au mg nanosphere the six cycle photodegradation test was performed radical scavenging experiment was performed in presence of isopropyl alcohol ipa 1 ml benzoquinone bq 1 mm 1 ml nitrobenzene nb 1 ml ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta 1 mm 1 ml and agno3 for quenching of oh o2 ocl h and e respectively 26 28 the photocorrosion of au mg nanosphere was determined by xrd and xps analysis after irradiation 2 4 spectrophotometric sensing of cef the spectrophotometric sensing of cef by au mg nanosphere was performed by the addition of equal volume 1 ml

of bimetallic au mg nanospheres fig 1 a shows the xrd spectrum of au mg nanosphere which shows the particles are crystalline in nature the xrd pattern of au mg nanosphere showed peaks at 11 6 27 38 1 44 4 64 7 and 77 8 the peaks at 38 1 44 4 64 7 and 77 8 correspond to au nps 36 whereas the peak at 11 6 27 44 4 and 77 8 corresponds to mg 37 thus the xrd results show similar peak at 44 4 and 77 8 for both mg and au which shows the effective formation of au shell and mg core 29 the average crystalline size of au mg nanosphere was calculated by williamson hall wh equation and the average particle size was calculated to be 82 nm 38 39 the williamson hall analysis wh plot of au mg nanospheres is displayed in supplementary material fig s1 wh plot is to determine the triple junction developed in the nanocrystals due to the point defect intrinsic strain and stacking faults here the plot shows that there is no extension or deformation occurred between au and mg which further confirms the formation of nanospheres fig 1b shows the ftir spectrum of au mg nanosphere before and after interaction with cef the ftir spectrum of au mg nanosphere shows vibration stretching from 500 to 400 cm 1 which corresponds to the metal au and mg peaks 37 here ftir spectrum showed peak at 3620 and 1552 cm 1 which was due to the oh group stretching 40 the vibration stretching at 2452 and 1187 cm 1 corresponds to the ch and cc stretching 40 the presence of vibration stretching of both metal and organic group shows the effective interaction of cef with au mg nanospheres the uv visible absorption spectra of au mg nanospheres was recorded in the range of 300 to 700 nm and showed λmax at 557 nm which was due the electronic excitation of π electron to π fig 1c fig 2 a b shows the tem image of au mg which shows that prepared particle was spherical in shape the back shade indicates the mg core and grey colour indicates the au shell which shows the effective formation of au mg nanospheres the selected area electron diffraction saed pattern of au mg nanosphere shows that the particles are crystalline and polydisperse in nature and it is in accordance with xrd pattern of au mg nanospheres fig 2c the d spacing values in saed with corresponding hkl plane further confirm the formation of au mg nanospheres sem image of au mg nanosphere after the interaction of cef was depleted in fig 2d which confirms the aggregation of the nanomaterial the band gap energy of the nanomaterial was determined by uv visible drs spectrum of the nanomaterial the band gap of the nanomaterial was determined by kubelka munk plot by the eq 2 41 42 2 f r hv 2 a hv e g where eg represents optical bandgap v represents frequency of light h represents planck constant a represent frequency of light and f represent kubelka munk function the band gap of au mg nanospheres was found to be 2 59 ev fig 3a illustrates the xps spectra of au mg nanospheres which demonstrates spectrum of au and mg this seems to be well correlated to the tem and xrd the xps spectrum of au showed sharp peak at 88 3 and 82 4 ev which corresponds to spin 4f7 2 and 4f5 2 respectively 33 the xps spectrum of mg showed sharp peak at 1304 1 ev of corresponding spin 1s of bang gap energy of 3 2 ev 43 the result shows the effective formation of au mg nanosphere fig 3b1 shows the raman spectrum of au mg nanospheres the spectrum showed peaks at 260 cm 1 indicated the vibration spectrum of au and the broad spectrum at 1036 cm 1 indicate the vibration spectrum of mg 44 45 thus lower in the peak intensity of mg than au shows the effective formation of au mg core shell nanosphere the raman spectrum of au mg cef showed peaks at 1036 1352 1529 and 2135 cm 1 which represents the stretching of metal mg and organic group ch cc and no fig 3b2 45 the id ig before and after interaction with cef were found to be 0 24 and 0 86 respectively thus the results conclude the effective interaction of cef with mg 3 2 photocatalytic degradation of ps the photocatalytic degradation of ps by au mg nanosphere was performed in presence of various ion and the results shows that the ps degradation was effective in presence of cl ion 97 2 than so4 no3 po4 and co3 ion fig 4a here the degradation efficiency of ps in presence of no3 po4 and co3 ion showed better performance than in the absence of ions which seems to contribute to formation of oh by undergoing protonation 46 47 hence the higher degradation efficiency of ps was due to the formation of ocl the degradation of ps was determined by toc analysis toc analysis showed the gradual reduction of carbon present in the reaction mixture nevertheless the photocatalytic degradation of ps was comparatively lower in absence of ions fig 4c the rate kinetic of the reaction mixture was determined by the following reaction equ 3 3 in ct co kt ln ct co kt where c0 and ct represent the initial concentration and final concentration at time t the rate constant and the regression coefficient of au mg on photocatalytic degradation of ps in presence of cl ions was 0 008 and 0 993 respectively fig 4b here rate constant of photodegradation of ps by au mg nanosphere in presence of ion mixture follows pseudo first order reaction 48 49 according to the previous literature the photocatalytic degradation of ps was found to less than 85 supplementary material table s1 here the prepared nanomaterial was found to be effective for the complete mineralization of ps the photocatalytic degradation of ps was performed under various ph conditions from 5 to 9 was adjusted by using 0 1 naoh and 0 1 hcl and the degradation was effective at ph 2 supplementary material fig s2a1 a2 the lower in the ph enable the effective protonation of the nanomaterial on the effective interaction with ps and thus enables the effective oxidation of organic complex for the complete mineralization of ps in addition the acidic ph boost the charge separation due to higher protonation which interact with cl ions resulting in the formation of ocl this radical thereby contributes for the degradation of plastic similarly the photocatalytic reaction was carried out by varying the nanomaterial concentration 10 to 100 mg l the results indicate that increasing the nanomaterial concentration enhances the photocatalytic efficiency supplementary material fig s2b1 b2 the photocatalytic experiment was repeated in presence of varying ps concentration and the results showed that the lower ps concentration exhibited better performance supplementary material fig s2c1 c2 the reusability of the au mg nanosphere was determined by six cycle test and the degradation efficiency was found to be 99 5 the difference in the degradation of ps on first and sixth cycle was 0 41 supplementary material fig s3a the radical scavenging experiment was performed in presence of ipa nb bq agno3 and edta and the results shows that ocl and oh plays a major role in the effective

mechanism of au mg nanosphere for the degradation of ps is illustrated in supplementary material fig s6 the plasmonic excitation of electron occurs on au causing the formation of hot electron and hole pair upon the visible light irradiation 45 parallelly the electron form mg gets excited and transferred to au and thus causes the electron hole on au the reduction in the oxidation power of au was mainly due to hot electron and hole pair relax ultrafast for recombination 100 fs to 1ps in absence of h2 or h2o due to its electron electron scattering 50 however when au was introduced in h2o it enables the migration of hot holes to the hybrid thereby leading to the formation of auh resulting in lower recombination rate the reason for the effective trapping of hot hole and electron pair on inhibiting the oxidation power as follow 1 the freely localized hot hole is highly delocalized in the mean path range of 20 150nm 51 the migration of the hot holes generated by au to form auh hybrid is to form low coordinated positions by the formation of interface or defect this interface thereby restricts the recombination and results in better photocatalytic performance 2 according the previous literature the relaxation of hot holes near to fermi level energy ef is extremely fast 52 as the hot holes are not thermodynamically favourable they can uphill the photocatalytic degradation of ps as the d s antibonding orbital auh hybridization was lower than the ef of au 0 6 ev 53 the effective trapping of the hot hole on the migration of auh enables the effective photocatalytic

nps with ps eabs of nps which shows the effective formation of charge density here the radical attack and chloride radical occurs on the c2 and c4 of ps the radical attack on the degradation of ps causes the formation of intermediate methyl acetophenone hydroquinone formic acid acetophenone phenol phenylpropionic acid and methylbenzaldehyde and further oxidizes to form co2 and h2o further the radical and nucleophilic attack cleaves the benzene ring resulting in the formation of the intermediates and the extensive interaction of the radical on ps causes the formation of intermediates the

augmented and irradiated under visible light then the irradiated reaction mixture was centrifuged the nanospheres were collected and the cytotoxicity of the degraded product was performed against a cepa the results show that the cytotoxicity of ps before degradation was significantly higher than after degradation supplementary material tables s3 and s4 the formation of the disturbed interference on mitosis cycle causes the inhibition of dna and protein synthesis and thus cytotoxicity of the nanocomposite was determined 48 the micronuclei index of ps after degradation was comparatively lower than that of before degradation the higher in the micronuclei index indicate the higher in the genotoxicity against a cepa the lower in the toxicity of ps contaminated water after degradation was due

shaker for 30 min the residual concentrations of no3 were filtered with 0 22 μm membrane and the amount of nitrate remaining in the water phase was measured with an ultraviolet spectrophotometer 100 ml of no3 solution with different initial concentrations of 10 20 40 50 100 mg l were mixed with 0 5 g nip and 10 20 40 50 100 800 1000 2000 2600 mg l were mixed with 0 5 g iip no3 then oscillated for 30 min at a constant temperature of 25 c to investigate the adsorption isotherm of the imprinting polymer 100 ml of no3 solution with an initial concentration of 50 mg l and 0 5 g of iip no3 were used for adsorption experiments and the mixed system was oscillated at a constant temperature of 25 c for the certain interval to investigate the adsorption kinetics of the adsorbent the above solution was filtered with 0 22 μm membrane and the amount of nitrate remaining in the water phase was measured with an ultraviolet spectrophotometer the removal rate and adsorption capacity were calculated according to the eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 η c 0 c e c 0 100 2 q c 0 c e v w where c 0 mg l and c e mg l are the initial concentration and equilibrium concentration of nitrate respectively v l and w g are the volume of the solution and the dose of the adsorbent respectively the adsorption equilibrium data was fitted with langmuir isotherm model taking ρ e as the abscissa and q e as the ordinate for nonlinear fitting the r 2 value of the langmuir adsorption isotherm can be obtained 20 21 the langmuir adsorption isotherm equation can be calculated as eq 3 3 ρ e q ρ e q m 1 bq m where q m mg g is the maximum adsorption capacity of the solid surface monolayer ρ e mg l is the mass concentration of no3 at adsorption equilibrium b l mg is the parameter of the isotherm equation the kinetic data obtained in the experiment was fitted with the pseudo two stage adsorption kinetic equation 22 the linear form of the pseudo secondary adsorption kinetic equation can be calculated as eq 4 4 t q t 1

constants which can be obtained from the intercept and slope of the straight line obtained by plotting t qt against t 2 5 selective and competitive adsorption in order to further investigate the recognition characteristics of the imprinting polymer to no3 ions selective and competitive adsorption experiments were carried out respectively 17 iip no3 was used to conduct a competitive adsorption experiment on no3 no2 hco3 and so4 2 a mixed solution of no3 no2 hco3 and so4 2 was prepared with a concentration of 100 66 127 155 mg l respectively and the 100 ml of the mixed solution was added

were mixed with 1 g of iip no3 and oscillated for 30 min at a constant temperature of 25 c then the nitrate in iip no3 was eluted with the saturated sodium chloride solution until nitrate was no longer detectable by double wavelength ultraviolet spectrophotometry and washed with deionized water the adsorption desorption cycle was lasted for five times to evaluate the iip no3 regeneration of the adsorbents the adsorption amount of nitrate was measured each time for analyzing the removal rate change 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of iip no3 3 1 1 sem analysis fig 1 shows the sem of the imprinting polymer the prepared iip no3 has an irregular porous structure fig 1d different to nip fig 1a there were obviously a lot of pores on the surface of iip no3 fig 1d the pores of iip no3 fig 1h decreased after adsorption reaction compared to no used iip no3 iip nu fig 1d and this indicated that no3 imprinting pores are formed at eluting template ions compared to nip the pores of iip no3 made the imprinted polymer possess greater number of imprinting sites in subsequent adsorption experiments it showed that the presence of pores increased the adsorption capacity of the imprinting polymer 3 1 2 elemental analysis the elemental analysis of the iip no3 was carried out to measure the proportion of the main elements in different polymers table 1 lists the elemental analysis consequences of the no used iip no3 iip nu iip no3 after absorption reaction iip a and nip the content of nitrogen and oxygen increased from 1 22 nip to 1 83 iip nu and 21 27 nip 27 82 iip nu respectively indicating that dmdaac and am are successfully polymerized to form a new copolymer the chlorine content in the iip a decreased and the content percent of nitrogen oxygen increased in the iip a which indicates that the template ion nitrate in the place replaces cl and the adsorption principle of iip no3 is mainly the ion exchange between no3 and cl and nitrate forms an ionic bond with ammonium in the copolymer 3 1 3 ftir analysis beside sem and elemental analysis the functional group in no3 imprinted polymers was confirmed by the ft ir spectrum of the nip iip nu and iip a in fig 2 according to the ft ir spectrum of the iip nu and iip a the absorption bands at 1730 1660 cm 1 corresponded to the co stretching vibration of saturated fat aldehydes and carbonyl in acrylamide respectively 23 25 the absorption bands at around 2957 cm 1 corresponded to the oh 22 the absorption band at around 1420 cm 1 was related to the cn bonds 22 25 and the absorption band at 1150 cm 1 and around 750 cm 1 was related to the nh bonds of primary amide according to the results it can be concluded that the expected reaction successfully occurred compared to the spectrum of the iip no3 the spectrum of the nip expressed some different but crucial messages it can be clearly observed that iip nu iip a and nip spectrum have similar location and major bands indicating that the imprint process has nearly no influence on the main polymer network structure which is in accordance with previously reported results 24 however the adsorption bands for the co 1730 1660 cm 1 are weak and the adsorption bands for oh 2957 cm 1 are strengthened from nip to iip nu the result state that oxygen of nitrate combines to the aldehyde groups to weaken the intensity of co to hydrogen to strengthen the intensity of oh in iip no3 which may indicate that the hydrogen and aldehyde groups are the recognition sites in iip no3 besides compared to the nip the strengthen of peak in the iip no3 bands r nh3 after adsorption 26 indicates that the polymerization reaction does not destroy the ammonium base group in the functional molecules and forms more r nh3 the results show that no3 ion participate the synthesis and adsorption of the iip no3 3 2 effect of preparation conditions of iip no3 on adsorption capacity 3 2 1 the influence of pre assembly time on polymers the fig 3 presents the effect of pre assembly time of template ion and functional monomers on the adsorption of nitrate by iip no3 the results showed that a certain amount of template ions were unfilled at the effective sites of functional monomers at the shorter pre assembly time 2 h due to the short binding time of the imprinted template and the functional molecule and no adsorption cavities formed which resulted in a low adsorption capacity of the ion imprinted polymer with increased pre assembly time of the two components the adsorption capacity of the final imprinting polymer was increasing however the adsorption capacity of the polymers increased slowly while the pre assembly time was over 12 h the difference in adsorption capacity between 12 h and 18 h was 0 2 mg g therefore the subsequent pre assembly time is determined to be 12 h for comprehensive consideration of improving the adsorption capacity of imprinting polymer and the efficiency of polymer preparation 3 2 2 the effect of the ratio of functional monomers to cross linkers on polymers fig 4 showed that the adsorption capacity of the imprinting polymer decreased from 11 71 to 4 96 mg g as the ratio of functional monomers to cross linker changed from 2 1 to 2 7 under the unchanged ratio of template ion to functional monomers 1 2 the result indicated that excess cross linker is disadvantageous to the adsorption capacity of the polymers which resulted from the excessive of cross linker degree 27 the cross linking degree ensures the formation of the imprinting cavities after removal step of the template 28 while excessive of it will hinder the mass transfer of template protein and thus reduce the imprinting cavities with adsorption capacity in the final polymers however the polymerization reaction cannot occur to generate ion imprinted polymer with the further reduced of the cross linker proportion therefore the molar ratio of functional monomers and cross linker is determined to be 2 1 the ratio of functional monomers to cross liker will remain unchanged under 2 1 in next experiment of the effect of the molar ratio of template ions to functional monomers 3 2 3 the effect of the molar ratio of template ions to functional monomers on materials fig 5 showed that the adsorption capacity of the imprinting polymer for no3 decreased from 14 876 to 10 977 mg g as the ratio of template ions to functional monomers changed from 1 10 to 1 1 under the unchanged ratio of functional monomers to cross linker 2 1 the functional monomers are extremely significant for the adsorption property of imprinted polymers 29 functional monomers provide the adsorption cavities for the template ions 30 thus the adsorption capacity increased with the increasing of functional monomers ratio however the adsorption capacity of the formed polymer was significantly reduced without the template molecules no3 in the template ion during the polymerization process thus the ratio of template ion to functional monomers is set to 1 10 according to the analysis of the three influencing factors in the preparation process of the above imprinting polymer the preparation conditions of the iip no3 was finally determined the pre assembled time of template ion and the functional molecule is 12 h the molar ratio of the template ion the functional molecule and the cross linker is 1 10 5 after synthesis the ion imprinted polymer was cooled to room temperature and washed and then dried in a vacuum oven at 45 c for 12 h subsequently it was transferred to a freeze drying oven for 12 h finally the iip no3 was prepared after above processes 3 3 effect of ph the binding adsorption of ion imprinted polymers for ions is affected by the ph of the solution 15 31 protons and hydroxide may also compete for adsorption sites with target ions during imprinted adsorption 15 thus hydrogen will impact the adsorption capacity in this study fig 6 showed the maximum adsorption amount when the ph was neutral when the ph is acidic the adsorption amount decreased slightly indicating that the hydrogen ions do not compete with the nitrate for the adsorption sites however when ph rises from neutral to strongly alkaline the adsorption amount decreases significantly indicating that hydroxide occupies an amount of adsorption sites in the alkaline solution oh plays the most important role of competitive ion and directly affects the adsorption capacity 20 32 because a number of imprinted sites could be occupied by oh in the solution the interaction between iip no3 and no3 is not sufficient to break the binding of oh on the imprinted sites 3 4 adsorption isotherm adsorption isotherms are often utilized for describing the interaction of the adsorbate adsorbent and the adsorption capacity of adsorbents here two different isotherm models were employed to fit data from adsorption value of no3 on the iip no3 and nip the fitting curves of adsorption isotherm of iip no3 to no3 were presented in fig 7 the specific parameters were listed in table 2 obviously compared to the freundlich isotherm r2 iip no3 nip 0 8741 0 8932 respectively langmuir isotherms r2 iip no3 nip 0 9947 0 9897 respectively is suitable for explaining the behavior of this adsorption process the results show that the langmuir equation can better describe the sorption isotherm behavior giving a higher correlation coefficient it indicated that adsorption of no3 by iip no3 was the monolayer adsorption on the surface of the imprinting polymer 21 which put down to the fact that iip no3 exposes more active sites on the surface of cavities of iip no3 the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity by iip no3 and nip are 48 486 and 3 450 mg g respectively 3 5 adsorption kinetics the fig 8 showed the adsorption kinetics curves of iip no3 and nip no3 to no3 and the adsorption kinetic constants of iip no3 and nip no3 were listed in table 3 it can be observed that the adsorption of no3 by iip no3 and nip no3 both follows the pseudo secondary order kinetics r2 0 99 which illustrates that the pseudo second order kinetic equations are suitable for describing the adsorption kinetic behavior of iip no3 and nip no3 to no3 thus it can be concluded that the main control process of iip no3 on the adsorption of no3 is adsorption rather than diffusion and the chemical adsorption is regard as the rate controlling step in this experiment furthermore the adsorption capacity of iip no3 to no3 was 8 155 mg g greater than that of nip no3 at the same time it demonstrated that the special binding sites were formed at iip no3 during the process of imprinted polymer synthesis and thus the adsorption performance of iip no3 was improved 3 6 iip no3 selection and competitive adsorption the table 4 listed the values of the distribution coefficients k d of the no2 hco3 so4 2 in the mixed system as well as the selectivity coefficient of the imprinting polymer related to no2 hco3 so4 2 k the results showed that the distribution coefficient of iip no3 to no3 was 0 119 and the distribution coefficient of nip to no3 ions is 0 026 the selectivity coefficient k of the imprinting polymer related to no2 hco3 so4 2 k was 2 839 6 450 1 773 respectively were all 1 23 which clearly indicated that the no3 ion imprinted polymer iip no3 possessed the specific binding selectivity for no3 ions and this specific binding selectivity was not possessed by nip the main reason is that the nip does not form specific pores of no3 ion during the polymer synthesis stage and the no3 ion vacancies on the surface of the imprinted polymer cannot accommodate no2 hco3 so4 2 ions due to the different ionic radius and chemical valence between the no3 and competition ion therefore iip no3 can specifically identify and bind no3 ions the experimental results fully showed that the ion imprinted polymer prepared by the new ion imprinting technology established in this research can selectively recognize and adsorb no3 ions 3 7 adsorption regeneration reusability is an important aspect of evaluating the practical applicability of imprinted polymers the fig 9 showed the cycled adsorption results of iip no3 for no3 in the five adsorption desorption cycles the five times removal efficiencies were 84 463 84 572 85 384 83 282 and 83 320 respectively the results demonstrated that the adsorption sites in iip no3 were not destroyed by multiple usage indicating the iip no3 possesses good regeneration when adsorbing no3 4 conclusion in this study a novel no3 ion imprinted polymer was successfully synthesized with no3 anions as template ions and cationic monomers dmdaac and am as functional monomers the optimal preparation conditions of the imprinting polymer were finally determined the adsorption of no3 by iip no3 is a single reaction that occurs on the surface of the ion imprinted polymer the maximum single molecular layer adsorption capacity was 48 486 mg g the adsorption process can reach equilibrium within 5 min and the main control rate of adsorption is adsorption process rather than diffusion process moreover the adsorption capacity of iip no3 to no3 was 8 155 mg g greater than that of nip no3 at the same time the recognition selectivity coefficient of iip no3 for no3 ions with common anion no2 hco3 so4 2 ion in groundwater pollution were 2 839 6 450 1 773 respectively ion imprinting holes on the surface of iip no3 leads to the recognition selectivity and excellent binding affinity for no3 ions the imprinted polymer can be combined with other nitrate removal methods to improve the selectivity of the method for nitrate thereby improving the removal efficiency of the method for nitrate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interests we do not

filtered with 0 22 μm membrane and the amount of nitrate remaining in the water phase was measured with an ultraviolet spectrophotometer the removal rate and adsorption capacity were calculated according to the eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 η c 0 c e c 0 100 2 q c 0 c e v w where c 0 mg l and c e mg l are the initial concentration and equilibrium concentration of nitrate respectively v l and w g are the volume of the solution and the dose of the adsorbent respectively the adsorption equilibrium data was fitted with langmuir isotherm model taking ρ e as the abscissa and q e as the ordinate for nonlinear fitting the r 2 value of the langmuir adsorption isotherm can be obtained 20 21 the langmuir adsorption isotherm equation can be calculated as eq 3 3 ρ e q ρ e q m 1 bq m where q m mg g is the maximum adsorption capacity of the solid surface monolayer ρ e mg l is the mass concentration of no3 at adsorption equilibrium b l mg is the parameter of the isotherm equation the kinetic data obtained in the experiment was fitted with the pseudo two stage adsorption kinetic equation 22 the linear form of the pseudo secondary adsorption kinetic equation can be calculated as eq 4 4 t q t 1 kq e 2 t q where q e mg g and q t mg g are respectively the adsorption capacity at adsorption equilibrium and the adsorption capacity at time t k g mg min is respectively the second order rate constants which can be obtained from the intercept and slope of the straight line obtained by plotting t qt against t 2 5 selective and competitive adsorption in order to further investigate the recognition characteristics of the imprinting polymer to no3 ions selective and competitive adsorption experiments were carried out respectively 17 iip no3 was used to conduct a competitive adsorption experiment on no3 no2 hco3 and so4 2 a mixed solution of no3 no2 hco3 and so4 2 was prepared with a concentration of 100 66 127 155 mg l respectively and the 100 ml of the mixed solution was added with 1 g of the imprinting polymer iip no3 and then the competitive adsorption in a thermostatic water bath shaker for 30 min after that the reaction solution was filtered with 0 22 μm membrane and then no3 and no2 was measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometer hco3 was measured by hydrochloric acid titration and so4 2 was measured by ion chromatography according to the eqs 5 and 6 the distribution coefficient k d selectivity coefficient k 5 k d q e c e 6 k k d n k d s where q e mg g and c e mg l are the equilibrium adsorption capacity and the equilibrium concentration of nitrate and sulfate k d n and k d s are the distribution coefficients of the template ion no3 and the competitive ion 2 6 adsorption regeneration 100 ml of no3 solution with initial concentrations 100 mg l were mixed with 1 g of iip no3 and oscillated for 30 min at a constant temperature of 25 c then the nitrate in iip no3 was eluted with the saturated sodium chloride solution until nitrate was no longer detectable by double wavelength ultraviolet spectrophotometry and washed with deionized water the adsorption desorption cycle was lasted for five times to evaluate the iip no3 regeneration of the adsorbents the adsorption amount of nitrate was measured each time for analyzing the removal rate change 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of iip no3 3 1 1 sem analysis fig 1 shows the sem of the imprinting polymer the prepared iip no3 has an irregular porous structure fig 1d different to nip fig 1a there were obviously a lot of pores on the surface of iip no3 fig 1d the pores of iip no3 fig 1h decreased after adsorption reaction compared to no used iip no3 iip nu fig 1d and this indicated that no3 imprinting pores are formed at eluting template ions compared to nip the pores of iip no3 made the imprinted polymer possess greater number of imprinting sites in subsequent adsorption experiments it showed that the presence of pores increased the adsorption capacity of the imprinting polymer 3 1 2 elemental analysis the elemental analysis of the iip no3 was carried out to measure the proportion of the main elements in different polymers table 1 lists the elemental analysis consequences of the no used iip no3 iip nu iip no3 after absorption reaction iip a and nip the content of nitrogen and oxygen increased from 1 22 nip to 1 83 iip nu and 21 27 nip 27 82 iip nu respectively indicating that dmdaac and am are successfully polymerized to form a new copolymer the chlorine content in the iip a decreased and the content percent of nitrogen oxygen increased in the iip a which indicates that the template ion nitrate in the place replaces cl and the adsorption principle of iip no3 is mainly the ion exchange between no3 and cl and nitrate forms an ionic bond with ammonium in the copolymer 3 1 3 ftir analysis beside sem and elemental analysis the functional group in no3 imprinted polymers was confirmed by the ft ir spectrum of the nip iip nu and iip a in fig 2 according to the ft ir spectrum of the iip nu and iip a the absorption bands at 1730 1660 cm 1 corresponded to the co stretching vibration of saturated fat aldehydes and carbonyl in acrylamide respectively 23 25 the absorption bands at around 2957 cm 1 corresponded to the oh 22 the absorption band at around 1420 cm 1 was related to the cn bonds 22 25 and the absorption band at 1150 cm 1 and around 750 cm 1 was related to the nh bonds of primary amide according to the results it can be concluded that the expected reaction successfully occurred compared to the spectrum of the iip no3 the spectrum of the nip expressed some different but crucial messages it can be clearly observed that iip nu iip a and nip spectrum have similar location and major bands indicating that the imprint process has nearly no influence on the main polymer network structure which is in accordance with previously reported results 24 however the adsorption bands for the co 1730 1660 cm 1 are weak and the adsorption bands for oh 2957 cm 1 are strengthened from nip to iip nu the result state that oxygen of nitrate combines to the aldehyde groups to weaken the intensity of co to hydrogen to strengthen the intensity of oh in iip no3 which may indicate that the hydrogen and aldehyde groups are the recognition sites in iip no3 besides compared to the nip the strengthen of peak in the iip no3 bands r nh3 after adsorption 26 indicates that the polymerization reaction does not destroy the ammonium base group in the functional molecules and forms more r nh3 the results show that no3 ion participate the synthesis and adsorption of the iip no3 3 2 effect of preparation conditions of iip no3 on adsorption capacity 3 2 1 the influence of pre assembly time on polymers the fig 3 presents the effect of pre assembly time of template ion and functional monomers on the adsorption of nitrate by iip no3 the results showed that a certain amount of template ions were unfilled at the effective sites of functional monomers at the shorter pre assembly time 2 h due to the short binding time of the imprinted template and the functional molecule and no adsorption cavities formed which resulted in a low adsorption capacity of the ion imprinted polymer with increased pre assembly time of the two components the adsorption capacity of the final imprinting polymer was increasing however the adsorption capacity of the polymers increased slowly while the pre assembly time was over 12 h the difference in adsorption capacity between 12 h and 18 h was 0 2 mg g therefore the subsequent pre assembly time is determined to be 12 h for comprehensive consideration of improving the adsorption capacity of imprinting polymer and the efficiency of polymer preparation 3 2 2 the effect of the ratio of functional monomers to cross linkers on polymers fig 4 showed that the adsorption capacity of the imprinting polymer decreased from 11 71 to 4 96 mg g as the ratio of functional monomers to cross linker changed from 2 1 to 2 7 under the unchanged ratio of template ion to functional monomers 1 2 the result indicated that excess cross linker is disadvantageous to the adsorption capacity of the polymers which resulted from the excessive of cross linker degree 27 the cross linking degree ensures the formation of the imprinting cavities after removal step of the template 28 while excessive of it will hinder the mass transfer of template protein and thus reduce the imprinting cavities with adsorption capacity in the final polymers however the polymerization reaction cannot occur to generate ion imprinted polymer with the further reduced of the cross linker proportion therefore the molar ratio of functional monomers and cross linker is determined to be 2 1 the ratio of functional monomers to cross liker will remain unchanged under 2 1 in next experiment of the effect of the molar ratio of template ions to functional monomers 3 2 3 the effect of the molar ratio of template ions to functional monomers on materials fig 5 showed that the adsorption capacity of the imprinting polymer for no3 decreased from 14 876 to 10 977 mg g as the ratio of template ions to functional monomers changed from 1 10 to 1 1 under the unchanged ratio of functional monomers to cross linker 2 1 the functional monomers are extremely significant for the adsorption property of imprinted polymers 29 functional monomers provide the adsorption cavities for the template ions 30 thus the adsorption capacity increased with the increasing of functional monomers ratio however the adsorption capacity of the formed polymer was significantly reduced without the template molecules no3 in the template ion during the polymerization process thus the ratio of template ion to functional monomers is set to 1 10 according to the analysis of the three influencing factors in the preparation process of the above imprinting polymer the preparation conditions of the iip no3 was finally determined the pre assembled time of template ion and the functional molecule is 12 h the molar ratio of the template ion the functional molecule and the cross linker is 1 10 5 after synthesis the ion imprinted polymer was cooled to room temperature and washed and then dried in a vacuum oven at 45 c for 12 h subsequently it was transferred to a freeze drying oven for 12 h finally the iip no3 was prepared after above processes 3 3 effect of ph the binding adsorption of ion imprinted polymers for ions is affected by the ph of the solution 15 31 protons and hydroxide may also compete for adsorption sites with target ions during imprinted adsorption 15 thus hydrogen will impact the adsorption capacity in this study fig 6 showed the maximum adsorption amount when the ph was neutral when the ph is acidic the adsorption amount decreased slightly indicating that the hydrogen ions do not compete with the nitrate for the adsorption sites however when ph rises from neutral to strongly alkaline the adsorption amount decreases significantly indicating that hydroxide occupies an amount of adsorption sites in the alkaline solution oh plays the most important role of competitive ion and directly affects the adsorption capacity 20 32 because a number of imprinted sites could be occupied by oh in the solution the interaction between iip no3 and no3 is not sufficient to break the binding of oh on the imprinted sites 3 4 adsorption isotherm adsorption isotherms are often utilized for describing the interaction of the adsorbate adsorbent and the adsorption capacity of adsorbents here two different isotherm models were employed to fit data from adsorption value of no3 on the iip no3 and nip the fitting curves of adsorption isotherm of iip no3 to no3 were presented in fig 7 the specific parameters were listed in table 2 obviously compared to the freundlich isotherm r2 iip no3 nip 0 8741 0 8932 respectively langmuir isotherms r2 iip no3 nip 0 9947 0 9897 respectively is suitable for explaining the behavior of this adsorption process the results show that the langmuir equation can better describe the sorption isotherm behavior giving a higher correlation coefficient it indicated that adsorption of no3 by iip no3 was the monolayer adsorption on the surface of the imprinting polymer 21 which put down to the fact that iip no3 exposes more active sites on the surface of cavities of iip no3 the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity by iip no3 and nip are 48 486 and 3 450 mg g respectively 3 5 adsorption kinetics the fig 8 showed the adsorption kinetics curves of iip no3 and nip no3 to no3 and the adsorption kinetic constants of iip no3 and nip no3 were listed in table 3 it can be observed that the adsorption of no3 by iip no3 and nip no3 both follows the pseudo secondary order kinetics r2 0 99 which illustrates that the pseudo second order kinetic equations are suitable for describing the adsorption kinetic behavior of iip no3 and nip no3 to no3 thus it can be concluded that the main control process of iip no3 on the adsorption of no3 is adsorption rather than diffusion and the chemical adsorption is regard as the rate controlling step in this experiment furthermore the adsorption capacity of iip no3 to no3 was 8 155 mg g greater than that of nip no3 at the same time it demonstrated that the special binding sites were formed at iip no3 during the process of imprinted polymer synthesis and thus the adsorption performance of iip no3 was improved 3 6 iip no3 selection and competitive adsorption the table 4 listed the values of the distribution coefficients k d of the no2 hco3 so4 2 in the mixed system as well as the selectivity coefficient of the imprinting polymer related to no2 hco3 so4 2 k the results showed that the distribution coefficient of iip no3 to no3 was 0 119 and the distribution coefficient of nip to no3 ions is 0 026 the selectivity coefficient k of the imprinting polymer related to no2 hco3 so4 2 k was 2 839 6 450 1 773 respectively were all 1 23 which clearly indicated that the no3 ion imprinted polymer iip no3 possessed the specific binding selectivity for no3 ions and this specific binding selectivity was not possessed by nip the main reason is that the nip does not form specific pores of no3 ion during the polymer synthesis stage and the no3 ion vacancies on the surface of the imprinted polymer cannot accommodate no2 hco3 so4 2 ions due to the different ionic radius and chemical valence between the no3 and competition ion therefore iip no3 can specifically identify and bind no3 ions the experimental results fully showed that the ion imprinted polymer prepared by the new ion imprinting technology established in this research can selectively recognize and adsorb no3 ions 3 7 adsorption regeneration reusability is an important aspect of evaluating the practical applicability of imprinted polymers the fig 9 showed the cycled adsorption results of iip no3 for no3 in the five adsorption desorption cycles the five times removal efficiencies were 84 463 84 572 85 384 83 282 and 83 320 respectively the results demonstrated that the adsorption sites in iip no3 were not destroyed by multiple usage indicating the iip no3 possesses good regeneration when adsorbing no3 4 conclusion in this study a novel no3 ion imprinted polymer was successfully synthesized with no3 anions as template ions and cationic monomers dmdaac and am as functional monomers the optimal preparation conditions of the imprinting polymer were finally determined the adsorption of no3 by iip no3 is a single reaction that occurs on the surface of the ion imprinted polymer the maximum single molecular layer adsorption capacity was 48 486 mg g the adsorption process can reach equilibrium within 5 min and the main control rate of adsorption is adsorption process rather than diffusion process moreover the adsorption capacity of iip no3 to no3 was 8 155 mg g greater than that of nip no3 at the same time the recognition selectivity coefficient of iip no3 for no3 ions with common anion no2 hco3 so4 2 ion in groundwater pollution were 2 839 6 450 1 773 respectively ion imprinting holes on the surface of iip no3 leads to the recognition selectivity and excellent binding affinity for no3 ions the imprinted polymer can be combined with other nitrate removal methods to improve the selectivity of the method for nitrate thereby improving the removal efficiency of the method for nitrate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interests we do not
