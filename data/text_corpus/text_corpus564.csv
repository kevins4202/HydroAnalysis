2820,this study covers the application of sim heuristics to simulate and optimise the klang gate dam kgd operating rule curve using the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 climate scenarios this research aims to examine future climate change impacts on the kgd reservoir water resources first based on model institution location and data availability a few general circulation models gcms under the cmip5 were chosen most earlier studies had solely examined the impact of climate change on future reservoir operations using a single gcm the ensemble of gcms for precipitation temperature maximum minimum and mean and solar radiation for the base period 1991 2005 and future climatic scenarios under the representative concentration pathways rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 were downscaled trained and tested using data driven techniques namely the artificial neural network ann and the support vector regression svr during the base period the svr poly function achieved r performance values of 0 6201 0 5743 0 6926 and 0 6073 for the respective predictant variables upon addressing for rainfall runoff the turc radiation evaporation strategy was utilised at this study location since it was suitable for the tropical humid or sub humid region few scenarios were developed to forecast water demand scenario 1 was based on the base period 1991 2005 of water demand whereas scenarios 2 and 3 were based on maximum and mean temperatures respectively 2020 2099 the results were then evaluated in terms of storage failure reliability resilience and vulnerability overall scenario 3 showed the greatest reliability in satisfying exact demand with 93 54 as well as the least shortage index and length of water deficit under rcp 4 5 keywords cmip5 downscaling simulation metaheuristics klang gate dam optimisation data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction global warming leads to the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases ghgs terzi manolis 2020 human activities are most probably the cause of the transition causing greenhouse gas increases akbary et al 2019 climate change affects temperature rainfall and wind additionally climate change is influenced by differences in the intensity of sunlight and the direction of the earth coelho et al 2020 these significant changes also impact human health poverty and well being yalew et al 2020 changes in climate intensify extreme weather events katelaris 2021 and ultimately affects reservoir operations as well madadi et al 2015 heat waves are anticipated to increase as climate change progresses this will cause many droughts these occurrences jeopardise the water supply systems that were initially designed for a different environment thus climate change adaptation has ramifications for water resources projects e g dam or reservoir few recent studies on the adaptation strategies or policies in response to climate change events for reservoir operation management have been mentioned zahabiyoun et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 jaiswal et al 2021 thomas et al 2021 furthermore temperature and precipitation are expected to have a considerable impact on the prospective water resources thus sustainable water management should take climate change into account in all aspects of water management according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc technical paper presented by bates et al 2008 the current water management practices are insufficient and are incapable of mitigating the effects of climate change thus identifying that the hydrology changes at the local and regional scale is crucial for creating the water resource adjustments there are three ways to generate future climate scenarios using observable data using synthetic climate scenarios or general circulation model output gcms according to wilby and harris 2006 using the gcm output delivers the most reliable outcomes and is thus the focus of this paper the ipcc s fifth assessment report ar5 replaced the cmip3 with phase 5 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 cmip5 will incorporate new and more comprehensive gcms with better spatial resolution as well as different greenhouse gas emission scenarios these new and more complete gcms will be coupled with more sophisticated circulation patterns in the region sachindra et al 2014 to replace the older emission scenarios a2 b1 etc in the ipcc ar4 a new set of ghgs scenarios termed the representative concentration pathways rcps has been developed to aid in the assessment of the effectiveness of various policy and adaptation solutions in minimising the effects of climate change van vuuren et al 2011 as indicated in table 1 the comparison between special report on emissions scenarios sres ar4 and rcps ar5 was based on their concentration pathways which corresponded to their respective approximate radioactive forcing levels wm 2 a reservoir dam s purpose is to provide the basic water demands needed and then store excess water to prevent downstream flooding eum and simonovic 2010 chen et al 2016 recently several studies on reservoir optimisation have been developed and a thorough review can be found in lai et al 2022 these studies typically start with the traditional optimisation approaches like the stochastic dynamic programming sdp soleimani et al 2016 el shafie et al 2018 zeng et al 2019 then move on to the heuristic algorithms like the genetic algorithm ga azamathulla et al 2008 hossain and el shafie 2013 evolutionary based algorithm zatarain salazar et al 2017 and lastly applying the swarm intelligence heuristic algorithms such as the artificial bee colony abc hossain and el shafie 2014 choong et al 2016 based on these ideas the nature inspired metaheuristic algorithms such as the shark optimisation algorithms ehteram et al 2017 whale optimisation algorithms lai et al 2021 ezzeldin and djebedjian 2020 gravity search algorithm bozorg haddad et al 2016 and the krill algorithms ehteram et al 2017 karami et al 2018 etc have evolved several studies were conducted for trade off reservoir benefits through the execution of the optimisation process for instance the stabilising of the water demand and ecosystem protection ren et al 2019 the balancing between hydropower generation and the biodiversity conservation at downstream wetland xu et al 2020 the reducing of water level of a lake for the stability of navigation the water supply and ecological services li et al 2020 the minimising the gap between water supply and demand allawi et al 2019 are some interesting examples however these optimised rules were usually produced by applying observed inflows reservoir inflow runoff precipitation temperature and evaporation are all hydro climatic variables that may affect the benefits from the reservoirs forecasting runoff accurately is critical for the effective water resource management and planning to estimate river streamflow mohammadi et al 2020 integrated the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and the shuffling frog leaping algorithm sfla the results of this integration approach were superior to those of yaseen et al 2017 and the standard anfis however the authors suggested that to reduce the training time the number of input variables ought be reduced in order to make this model suitable for real time implementation several hydro climatic studies utilising the gcms and rcp scenarios as future climate scenarios in various sectors of water resources have also been carried out for the purpose of planning and management raje and mujumdar 2010 tan et al 2014 tan et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 tan et al 2019 jamshidpey and shourian 2021 wilby and harris 2006 stated that the incorporation of gcms into the reservoir operation yields more reliable results in this regard zhou and guo 2013 conducted studies to incorporate the ecological requirement into a multipurpose reservoir under climate change by optimising reservoir operation rules using an integrated adaptive optimisation model iaom their findings indicated a high probability of reducing the negative impact of a dam on a river system under the scenarios of climate change ouyang et al 2015 reported that future streamflow in the huangnizhuang catchment in china would decline under the three rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios using an ensemble of six gcms ho et al 2016 examined streamflow variations at the tocantins araguaia brazil basin using the rcp 4 5 climate projections and discovered significant losses in streamflow during the yearly and dry season periods for the future period 2071 2100 turner et al 2017 investigated the climatic effects of hydroelectricity in order to invest in the world s power supply the results indicated that climate change has shifted energy demand away from hydropower generation and toward high carbon technologies even though it appears irrelevant to irrigation this study was addressed since it significant impact on the co2 emissions in the energy sector and the risk of investing is higher in countries where water resources are more vulnerable to climate change abera et al 2018 chose the hec resprm model to optimise a hydropower reservoir at the tekeze reservoir eastern nile under the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 also the simulated future inflows were obtained from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment over the african domain cordex africa the findings indicated that the production of power could be increased due to the effects of climate change there are almost 200 hydroelectric plants in brazil thus it is essential to forecast future energy needs and manage the timing of new generation projects silveira et al 2019 investigated the seasonal and multi annual variability of precipitation of multi gcms in cmip5 under the rcp 8 5 for the hydropower sector in brazil the authors concluded the analysis by stating that some gcms were unable to perform satisfactorily in hydropower estimates under the rcp 8 5 moreover there were a few studies that were demonstrated by nourani et al 2020 huangpeng et al 2021 and shrestha et al 2021 on the future reservoir optimisation based on the rcps scenarios nourani et al 2020 suggested utilising a mathematical model to optimise the shahrchay reservoir s operation rule from 2020 to 2060 three gcms were implemented under the a1b b1 rcp 4 5 and 8 5 projections the simulation algorithm used a feedforward neural network while the optimisation applied ga the authors stated that the findings aided in water resource management and planning and that future climate change projections should be investigated in order to establish better reservoir management practices huangpeng et al 2021 examined the hydropower generation with three gcms under the rcp 2 6 45 and 8 5 at the jinanqiao dam china by utilising the developed crow search algorithm dcsa the results showed a decrease of energy production under the rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 thus these outputs can aid in better management and planning before the problem arises however these studies were demonstrated with a single gcm for the investigation of the future reservoir optimisation reservoir for which tan et al 2014 suggested that an ensemble of gcms would provide more reliable outputs in hydrology management compared to a single gcm a the klang gate dam kgd there is limited information on the investigation of the climate change impact on the future reservoir operations hence this study examines the climate change impact on the future kgd s operation under an ensemble gcms of the cmip5 by utilising simulation and metaheuristic algorithms also known as the sim heuristic approach furthermore there were two methods of prediction of evaporation named as scenario a and scenario b respectively by mimicking the determined factors or variables involved in the temperature based and the turc radiation evaporation method respectively the scenario a and b were conducted by utilising the svr in order to validate the results obtained in the empirical evaporation method section 2 outlines the study area datasets flowchart statistical gcm downscaling methods evaporation methods rainfall runoff calculation water demand prediction under various climate scenarios statistical evaluation conceptual elaboration of the proposed algorithm and reservoir risk performance section 3 gives the results and discussion section 4 ends with a summary and future recommendations 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the klang gate dam kgd is located at taman melawati kuala lumpur s kl gombak district it is also referred to as the bukit tabur dam and its rainfall station id is 3217002 source luas as illustrated in fig 1 the dam was constructed at latitude 3 degrees 13 58 north 3 233 degrees and longitude 101 degrees 45 0 east 101 75 degrees the kgd s primary purpose is to supply water to the city of kuala lumpur s bukit nanas and wangsa maju water treatment facilities wtps the illustration of kgd is shown in fig 2 the entire capacity of the kgd is approximately 32 02 million cubic metres mcm which includes inactive storage conservation storage and flood control storage it is recommended that the storage level in fig 2 not to exceed the level of conservation storage or inactive storage as sediment obstructions may affect the kgd s operation due to the high inflow rates into the kgd the storage level may increase suddenly to the flood control storage zone where the maximum limit is at 23 44 mcm further details of the kgd features are available in dashti latif et al 2020 2 2 datasets the base period from the year 1991 to 2005 and the future climatic data from the year 2020 to 2099 were obtained for the cmip5 based on the gcms of miroc esm chem miroc esm miroc 5 and csiro mk 3 6 respectively these gcms are in finer resolution compared to other models in the cmip5 also the closest locations of the respective models to the kgd are shown in fig 1 as well as the selection coordinates depicted in table 3 the monthly average data obtained in the 15 years of the base period is shown in table 2 the parameters involved in the investigation under climate change impact to the base period and future period for the reservoir optimisation operation include the monthly average of the precipitation inflow evaporation water demand maximum temperature mean temperature and minimum temperature the proposed strategy employed in this work is summarised as a series of selection processes that include gcms for the base and future periods under the rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 following that was to investigate the correlation between the predictors and predictants precipitation and temperature via statistical downscaling approaches the artificial neural network ann and the support vector regression svr radial basis function and polynomial kernel function were implemented for the downscaling process in order to validate the correlation values down to the kgd s station next was to compute the rainfall runoff relationship as well as the estimation of the evaporation under the future periods based on the temperature and radiation method lastly the investigation of the reservoir optimisation operation under the base period and future period categorised into three scenarios namely scenario 1 simulation under base period vs simulation optimisation under base period scenario 2 simulation under rcps vs simulation optimisation under rcps for maximum temperature of water demand scenario 3 simulation under rcps vs simulation optimisation under rcps for mean temperature of water demand for a better understanding fig 3 illustrates the flowchart of the study 2 3 statistical gcm downscaling methods this statistical downscaling models in this study were introduced using the artificial neural networks ann and the support vector regression svr with the radial basis function and the polynomial kernel functions respectively the downscaling method was not used in the sdsm approach because the base period and future data were both in a monthly timeline whereas the sdsm required daily data due to course resolution restrictions and intermodal uncertainty in dynamic downscaling the gcms were unable to resolve regional climate change ning and bradley 2016 marotzke et al 2017 moise et al 2015 hence statistical downscaling is more popular than the dynamic option since it requires less computational work relatively simple to operate with sufficient amount of observed data as a result data driven techniques such as the ann and the svr were chosen for this study previous studies had been conducted using these methods nourani et al 2020 okkan and kirdemir 2018 khashei et al 2018 prior to statistical downscaling using the ann and the svr the data standardisation was performed as a bias correction method to reduce the systematic error in the average of the variables in the base period and future period relative to the observational data okkan and inan 2015 the ann and the svr were applied to downscale the gcm predictants variables precipitation and temperature for the base period and the future period rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 under the cmip5 in order to reach out for the overall best results several downscale parameters in the ann and the svr had been fixed as can be seen in table 4 fig 4 illustrated the basic architecture of the ann and the svr respectively the downscaling models were trained to analyse the correlation between the observed variables and base period baseline followed by the future period of the predictants predictors variables fig 5 illustrates the baseline of the climatic variables from 1991 2005 table 5 presents the potential combination of the predictants predictors variables executed during the downscaling process of the model training and testing via the ann and svr initially the various predictors in table 5 were executed during the base period to determine the highest r2 value corresponding to the correlation between both predictants according to jaiswal et al 2021 and nourani et al 2020 this strategy has been widely utilised by various researchers according to chu et al 2010 there is no specified number of predictor selections for the downscaling of gcms however one to three predictors are typically sufficient for determining the correlation between model predictants and predictors as indicated by these authors by assessing the precipitation predictors it can be concluded that precipitation depends on and is influenced by gravity fall winds and temperature fig 6 depicts the monthly predictant variables under the cmip5 at kgd for the rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 from 2020 to 2099 2 4 evaporation methods when designing for hydrology and irrigation planning evaporation or potential evaporation is a critical parameter despite the fact that this is such an important parameter no concrete highly accurate method for determining it has been developed to date furthermore no single method is universally accurate thus rather the best suited models for a specific geographic study area must be identified as a result this article proposed two evaporation empirical methods for the future rcps temperature based radiation based and finally a data driven technique was employed to predict in terms for two of the scenarios which is for scenario a temperature variables as the determining factor and for scenario b integration of temperature and solar radiation variables in order to validate to the outperformed empirical method the correlation between empirical evaporation methods and prediction by utilising data driven techniques wherein the term values of r mae and rmse in model training and testing are tabulated in table 8 the outperforming results will then be implemented for the future reservoir optimisation operations a kharrufa method kharrufa 1985 it is crucial to estimate evaporation losses while managing and optimising reservoirs numerous ways exist each requiring a unique set of data and equations nourani et al 2020 presented the work by utilising a temperature based method the kharrufa method to estimate monthly evaporation at the shahchay dam in northwestern iran for both the base and future years the equation denoted by eq 1 1 e d 0 34 x p x t mean 1 3 in which ed is the monthly reservoir evaporation in depth at the kgd mm month p and tmean denote the ratio of total monthly daytime hours used to total yearly daytime hours 12 x 365 and the mean monthly temperature c respectively kharuffa 1985 and xu and singh 2001 has provided the p values of different months and latitudes despite the results of r shown in table 8 having attained the highest the reason for not choosing this method is that the mae was also the highest as compared to the other methods also this method was commonly applied in arid or semi arid regions whereas malaysia s weather is humid and tropical region lian et al 2019 thus in this study the second proposed method based on radiation the turc method was executed for the evaporation under future rcps scenario furthermore past studies that had been conducted in the same study area had proven that this method is suitable to be implemented in malaysia as being more reliable for humid goh et al 2021 tukimat harun and shahid 2012 jensen burmann and allen 1990 and sub humid regions birara et al 2021 there were findings reported that the turc radiation method was found to be more consistent than those of the temperature based methods which were conducted in peninsular malaysia muhammad et al 2019 muniandy yusop and askari 2016 tukimat harun and shahid 2012 b turc method the turc model is a radiation based evaporation technique incorporating mean temperature solar radiation and relative humidity to estimate the evaporation rate for the rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 following is the equation involved for rh 50 2 e d 0 013 t mean t mean 15 r s x 23 8846 50 1 50 r h 70 for rh 50 3 e d t mean t mean 15 r s x 23 8846 50 in which ed is the monthly reservoir evaporation in depth at kgd mm month t mean is the monthly mean temperature c rh is the relative air humidity and r s is the solar radiation of the crop surface wm 2 c prediction of evaporation under rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the following equations represent possible combinations of the prediction for future evaporation based on temperature and radiation concepts scenario a more likely temperature based concept 4 stnd p r e d i c t i o n o f e v a p o r a t i o n x 1 s t n d t

of ed mm month for scenario a and b respectively in order to obtain monthly volumetric units of evaporation ev m3 month the conversion is by multiplying with the surface area of the reservoir m2 for both the empirical methods and data driven technique scenario a and b 2 5 rainfall runoff calculation the rainfall runoff r r relationship was determined using the design flood hydrograph estimation for rural catchments in malaysia hydrological procedure hp 11 section 3 3 1 as the latest revision is in 2018 the following are the equations 6 q 0 33 p p 75 m m 7 q p 2 p 150 p 75 m m in which p represents the precipitation value unit in mm the results obtained were then executed as the inflow mcm for the reservoir optimisation operation 2 6 prediction of water demand under the rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 according to anang et al 2017 climate change s impact on water resources alters the availability quantity and quality of water during the water supply cycle also it impacts the demand pattern for water for instance the downstream necessitates increased water consumption during the dry season hence in this study the impact of climatic variables in temperature as major determining factor to water demand has been predicted by utilising ann as following equations 8 stndpredictionmax t e m p e r a t u r e o f w a t e r d e m a n d x stndwaterdemand obs s t n d i n f l o w x

the future climate scenario in rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 stnd represents the standardisation for each of the variables and obs is observation data for water demand as shown in table 2 the primary reason of choosing two various water demand was that the monthly average temperature for maximum temperature during the base period was the highest value among the temperature variables i e mean and minimum temperatures additionally the mean temperature of water demand was a more significant and stable factor in the investigation of future climate impacts on reservoir operation than the minimum temperature of water demand however the minimum temperature of water demand can work as the future recommendation 2 7 statistical evaluation for downscaling methods and evaporation methods these statistical analyses were applied to compare between the ann and the svr in order to determine accuracy and validate the findings of both techniques the mean absolute error mae is the absolute value

x represent the values in the x variable y i is the values of the y variables in a sample and y represent the values in the y variable 2 8 harris hawks optimisation hho algorithm intelligent and distinguished predators such as the harris hawks can track surround flush out and catch the prey for example rabbits in a group the population of hawks is assumed to be a group of hawks that each utilises seven different killing strategies to hunt down the target rabbit the answer in the optimisation problem in the beginning the hawk that leads the group will attempt to capture the prey if the prey s dynamic nature and escape behaviour prevent the hawk from capturing it another tactic will be used known as switching tactics the rest of the group the hawks will attack the prey until it is captured by puzzling and exhausting the prey the hawks are able to pursue the evading prey harris hawks are considered candidate solutions in the hho whereas the intended prey is the optimal or global solution as a result the hho goes through exploratory and exploitative phases heidari et al 2019 the following is an elaboration of the strategy phases in the hho islam et al 2020 which goes through exploratory and exploitative phases strategy 1 phase of exploration the harris hawks conduct the monitoring and discovery process during this phase most often harris hawks would plummet at higher levels to stalk their prey eq 13 is the mathematical expression that stimulates harris hawks search process if q 0 5 the harris hawks will perch near to the hunting area but if it is more than 0 5 they will likely find a high tree and remain on it where q is a non negative integer ranging from 0 to 1 x iter 1 13 x rand i t e r r 1 x rand i t e r 2 r 2 i t e r i f q 0 5 x rabbit i t e r x m i t t e r r 3 l b r 4 u b l b i f q 0 5 where x iter is the current applicant solution position hawks xrand is the hawk randomly selected from the population available x rabbit denotes the rabbit s current position iter denotes the current repetition and r1 r2 r3 and r4 are random numbers between 0 1 lb and ub represent the minimum and maximum values of the xm variables which represent the current hawks median location as measured as follows 14 x m 1 n i 1 n x i i t e r in which x i denotes the position of each hawk and n denotes the population size of hawks strategy 2 phase of transition from phases of exploration to exploitation t denotes the maximum number of iterations and e0 denotes the initial energy exploration and exploitation have the potential to alter the running energy 15 e 2 e 0 1 iter t the iteration e which indicates that escaping energy varies randomly between 1 and 1 after which it is changing from 2 to 2 but it is decreasing during the process as in equation 15 if e is greater than one then the harris hawks are in the stage of looking for prey a likely explanation is that the harris hawks are hunting rabbits as they are exhausted which indicates e is less than one exploitation stage strategy 3 phase of exploitation four potential solutions have been achieved based on escape from rabbit states and various hawk monitoring plans both options have improved by adjusting the bait s running energy and the hawk s attack tactics the hawks may render a soft or serious assault in a different direction to hunt the lure the r defines the bait s running opportunity if the bait runs at less than r 0 5 the bait escapes safely otherwise the bait would be trapped in addition if the bait s running energy e and r is greater and equal to 0 5 the hho carries out a soft siege movement and vice versa condition the hard siege would conduct the good running of the bait is not only dependent on the escaping resources but also on the running chance in the meantime the trapping phase relies both on the hunting escape technique and the hawk siege strategy heidari et al 2019 strategy 4 soft siege the rabbit retains sufficient energy and attempts to flee through some random deceptive jumps while the hawks gently surround it the following rules is modelled by the elaboration 16 x t 1 δ x t e j x rabbit t x t 17 δ x t x rabbit t x t in which x t the gap of the rabbit s position vector and its current location during iteration t r 5 a random number inside 0 1 j 2 1 r 5 the rabbit s random jump strength is constantly fluctuating throughout the escape process each iteration the j value is changed randomly to simulate the movement of a rabbit strategy 5 hard siege the rabbit has now reached its limits and is almost completely depleted the hawks quickly encircle it and execute the mystery sneak up the position is updated by the below description 18 x t 1 x rabbit t e δ x t strategy 6 soft siege with continuous rapid dives it can be concluded that the rabbit is still full of energy and keeps trying to get away the fact that e 0 5 and r 0 5 illustrates this soft siege must first be employed before the hawks can attempt a surprise pounce strategy 6 is better than strategy 4 because of the initiation of the lévy flight concept which hawks use for making soft sieges as shown below 19 y x rabbit t e j x rabbit t x t the dive of the hawks was conducted few attempts to compare each movement with the previous dive to determine the diving attempt was good or bad hence the hawks dive based on lévy flight is given as follows 20 z y s x l f d in which d dimension of the problem s random vector of size 1 x d lf the lévy flight function can be demonstrated as follows 21 l f x 0 01 x u x σ v 1 β 22 σ 1 β x sin π β 2 1 β 2 x β x 2 β 1 2 1 β in which u and v are identical values lying in the range of 0 1 and β is an assumed constant equal to 1 5 thus the final updating rule of hawks in this strategy 6 is expressed below 23 x t 1 y i f f y f x t z i f f z f x t y in which y and z are calculated using eqns 19 and 20 strategy 7 hard siege with continuous rapid dives when the condition of e 0 5 and r 0 5 show that the rabbit lost its energy the hawks use the hard siege to reduce the distance between them and the rabbit which allows them to kill the rabbit this strategy s updating rule is specified as below 24 x t 1 y i f f y f x t z i f f z f x t y 25 y x rabbit t e j x rabbit t x m t 26 z y s x l f d in eqns 20 and 21 the y and z variables represent the next iteration locations until the optimal solution is obtained 2 9 performance of reservoir optimisation operation a minimisation of water deficit the objective function is to minimise the monthly water deficit the difference between demand and supply as defined in eq 27 27 minz t 1 12 d t r t 2 where t denotes the number of the months in a year while d t and r t denote monthly demand and release for that month respectively b thresholds in order to achieve optimal reservoir operation every reservoir system must adhere to the constraints and penalty functions the upper and lower boundary limits of the static penalty function also known as the threshold were used to achieve optimum reservoir operation without jeopardising the objective function zhai et al 2020 i equality of continuity threshold eq 28 gives the continuity threshold 28 s t 1 s t i t r

represents the evaporation ii threshold of inequality i the reservoir storage capacity threshold is as follows 29 6 24 m c m s t 23 44 m c m for t j a n f e b d e c ii the following is the release

storage while s min and s max are minimum and maximum storage value respectively d finalised objective function the values of these two penalty coefficients are chosen empirically to represent the objective function s tolerance for its final value as a result the final objective function modification for optimisation operation rule at the kgd on a monthly basis has been rewritten in eq 33

minimisation in dam construction and maximise the benefits of the dam res refers to the maximum duration of water deficit throughout the analysis also the reliability factor is implicitly part of the

performance of downscaling method table 6 displays the statistical performances of the respective predictants precipitation mean temperature maximum temperature minimum temperature and solar radiation obtained during the downscaling process for the ann and svr poly kernel and rbf functions from 1991 to 2005 base period the highest coefficient r obtained during model training was 0 6201 and which was under the precipitation predictant variable in the svr poly kernel function while for this predictant mthe ann and svr rbf kernel function obtained 0 4926 and 0 2841 respectively furthermore the predictant variables mean temperature maximum temperature and minimum temperature were found to have the highest correlation r in the svr poly kernel function at 0 5743 0 6926 and 0 6073 respectively the ann on the other hand achieved the highest correlation during the model training process for the solar radiation predictant variable as a result the model testing process of the svr poly kernel function provided the validation purpose as the rmse and mae in the solar radiation predictant were the least error obtained when compared to the ann overall the statistical downscaling results demonstrated that the downscaling approach in the svr poly kernel function provided more reliable results as the model testing provided the least error of value in rmse and mae respectively even though the overall ann provided the best r during the model testing process finally for the downscaling process during the base period the svr poly kernel function was chosen for the following rcps downscaling approach table 7 depicts the statistical performance obtained for the svr poly kernel function for the rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 from 2020 to 2099 respectively overall the downscaling statistical results obtained during the model training and testing process provided a good r value which was on average greater than 0 7 while the rmse and mae were on average of 0 5 3 2 statistical performance of evaporation values table 8 shows the statistical model performance for the evaporation using the various evaporation methods as described in section 2 5 the turc radiation based evaporation method had the highest coefficient 0 8453 in the model training process compared to the kharuffa temperature based evaporation method 0 7408 furthermore the turc radiation based model achieved a stable coefficient of r 0 8468 with little difference in the model training process in addition the prediction based methods based on the svr were used to validate the empirical evaporation based methods the kharuffa and the turc as a result the formulation of the svr based prediction was based on the combination shown in eqs 4 and 5 after validating with the prediction based approach the turc radiation based approach still provided the overall best coefficient and this method was implemented for the reservoir optimisation operation under climate change scenarios 3 3 optimisation of reservoirs in perspective of climate change scenarios tan et al 2014 stated that for future water management planning an ensemble of gcms could provide more reliable results following this recommendation in this study four ensembles of gcms were implemented as shown in table 4 another study which was conducted by nourani et al 2020 had only executed a single or individual gcm table 9 shows the average percentage of predictant variables in the rcps compared to the base period generally there is an 11 88 increase in precipitation under the rcp 2 6 when compared to the base period indicating that the inflow to the kgd is the most significant contributor factor when compared to the other predictant variables even the following contributor factor mean temperature is believed to have only an average influence on the prediction of water demand as shown in eq 8 furthermore when comparing the climate scenario under the rcp 4 5 to the base period the lowest average percentage obtained was 4 39 under minimum temperature followed by mean temperature and precipitation 2 26 and 2 12 respectively for the sake of validation the minimum temperature was used in the temperature based prediction of water demand similar to the rcp 2 6 the average percentage under the rcp 8 5 compared to the base period has attained the highest contribution of 7 87 for precipitation and 3 52 for mean temperature with both predictant variables showing the strongest influence on the reservoir optimisation operation in order to compute inflow and predict water demand fig 7 depicts the average monthly inflow mcm between the base period and the rcps while fig 8 depicts the inflow variation under the rcps versus the base period i benchmark test functions faris et al 2016 proposed three benchmark functions in the evolopy as shown in eqs 34 36 they can be used to evaluate the hho to find the best solutions to optimisation problems the characteristics of the hho used in this study is tabulated in table 10 there are two function groups unimodal for eq 34 and multimodal for eqns 35 36 qaddoura et al 2020 khurma et al 2020 the fitness level obtained was tabulated in table 12 34 f 1 x i 1 n j 1 i x j 2 35 f 2 x i 1 n x i s i n x i 36 f 3 x i 1 n x i 2 10 cos 2 π x i 10 as shown in table 10 the hho was evaluated using both the unimodal and multimodal models using a variety of benchmark functions in this phase of the studies the suggested hho is utilised to study scalable unimodal f1 and multimodal test functions f2 f3 with dimension spaces of 30 the hho ran 500 iterations of each benchmark function on m 10 separate runs epoch table 11 displays the fitness level obtained and summarises the mean and standard deviation of the results obtained by using three test functions the fitness value also known as the level of accuracy in hho used in this study for the following reservoir case study optimisation is f 1 0 e 05 ii scenario 1 actual observed period vs simulation vs simulation optimisation under base period fig 9 a depicts scenario 1 of the average monthly release for the base period from 1991 to 2005 the dotted line depicts the monthly average demand for the base period scenario 1 was conducted by utilising the ann to simulate the reservoir operation while the hho was used to optimise the reservoir operation the average monthly release curves and storage obtained from both simulated and optimised processes respectively were then compared with release curve and storage in actual observed period fig 9 a depicts the optimisation process during the base period where most of the months average releases throughout the year were able to meet the demand despite this an average excess of releases occurred from february to may and from august to october possibly due to the rainy or monsoon season at the kgd as a result there would be a monthly average excess release during these periods of time aside from that the monthly average excess releases during the base period for the simulation process was more than the optimisation process also the monthly average release curve for actual observed period only managed to meet the exact water demand for october and november further to this fig 9 b presents the storage condition at the kgd for the base period from 1991 to 2005 the illustration provides a vivid trend line that at the very beginning of the year 1991 the simulation process in the ann has failed to maintain the storage level unlike the optimisation process conducted by the hho the reservoir optimisation operation process in the hho had by then begun to fail from the third quarter of the year in 1994 until the beginning of the year 2000 however for the actual observed period the storagine level was shown within the boundary as such with the inclusion of an ensembly of gcms during the base period there was an impact shown vividly on the reservoir average monthly release policy as well as the reservoir storage hence this climatic scenario provides a more relevant and practical example to gain a strong foundation in order to investigate the impact of the future reservoir optimisation operations under various climate change scenarios rcps as shown in the following figures in scenario 2 and scenario 3 iii scenario 2 simulation vs simulation optimisation under rcps for maximum temperature of water demand the following discussion is based on scenario 2 investigating the future reservoir simulation and optimisation operation at the kgd under climatic scenarios of the rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively for maximum temperature of water demand as illustrated in figs 10 12 the timeline of these future climatic scenarios is divided into three groups a 2020 2049 near future b 2050 2079 mid future and c 2080 2099 far future fig 10 a depicts the trend line pattern of monthly average release curve as both reservoir optimisation and simulation achieved the excessive releases under the rcp 2 6 throughout the year 2020 2099 this is supported by the evidence in table 10 which shows that the rcp 2 6 gained the highest average percentage of precipitation compared to the base period this indicates that when compared to the other two rcps the inflow under the rcp 2 6 yielded more fluctuated inflow conditions as a result the excessive release action for reservoir optimisation operations at the kgd under the rcp 2 6 may have seemed to be comparatively higher than in the base period despite this the optimisation process conducted by the hho was still closer to the maximum temperature water demand than the simulation process in the ann which resulted in the pessimistic outcome of the release additionally the storage at the kgd was able to maintain its safety levels as illustrated in fig 10 b despite the fact that it failed after several years in the mid future the optimisation process in the hho kept the reservoir storage level between the maximum and minimum storage levels from 2020 to 2075 whereas the simulation process in the ann breached the storage level in early 2021 the average monthly release for maximum temperature water demand under the rcp 4 5 is depicted in fig 11 a the figures showed that both the simulation and optimisation processes resulted in excessive releases but the optimisation process in the hho resulted in a trend line that was closer to the water demand trend line this scenario occurred because the variation in inflow into the reservoir at the kgd as shown in table 10 indicated that the main contributing factor was not precipitation even though the minimum temperature was the main primary variable contributing to the reservoir operation under the rcp 4 5 the effect is still much lesser than the precipitation variable despite this fig 11 b indicated that reservoir optimisation utilising the hho resulted in the safest design and planning up to the mid future time zone according to table 10 the simulation process has broken the safety storage level since the beginning of the year 2023 resulting in a level that decreases below the lowest storage level indicating that excessive releases produced negative storage and this would result in the severe draught scenario occurring in the mid and far future as temperature was the primary contributing factor under the rcp 4 5 accordingly in table 10 the precipitation is the most significant contributor factor to the reservoir optimisation operation at the kgd and a similar circumstance in the rcp 2 6 occurred under the rcp 8 5 for maximum temperature water demand as the oscillation of the severe inflow into the kgd primarily the excessive discharges occurred from the very beginning of the near future until the far future in order to reduce the risk of storage overflow as indicated in fig 12 a the simulation process in the ann was unable to accomplish the near close to the maximum temperature water demand whereas optimisation in the hho achieved the closest to the demand line however because of the significant fluctuation inflow into the kgd under the rcp 8 5 the storage level is unable to achieve a safe design since it would violate the storage constraints for both the simulation and optimisation processes beginning in the near future when a sudden event of heavy pouring occurs the awareness necessary under the rcp 8 5 is to be more vigilant policymakers and reservoir managers are expected to develop a mitigation strategy in order to avoid fatalities and damage to public property fig 12 b indicated that reservoir optimisation utilising the hho resulted in the safest design and planning up to the year 2073 iv scenario 3 simulation vs simulation optimisation under rcps for mean temperature of water demand the trend line patterns depicted in figs 13 15 indicates that scenario 3 of both the reservoir optimisation and simulation accomplished in monthly average release curve and storage under the rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively for mean temperature water demand from 2020 to 2099 this is reflected by the findings in table 10 which demonstrates an inclining trend of average precipitation and mean temperature under the rcp 2 6 compared to the base period this suggests that when compared to the other two rcps the inflow under the rcp 2 6 produced a varied inflow state as a result the excessive release action for reservoir optimisation operations at the kgd under the rcp 2 6 may have appeared to be significantly more than it was during the base period as illustrated in fig 13 a the optimisation process in the hho despite this was still significantly closer to the mean temperature water demand than the simulation process in ann which produced the worst results of the entire release additionally as demonstrated in fig 13 b the storage at kgd was able to maintain its safety levels despite the fact that it failed in the mid future after several years the optimisation process in the hho held the reservoir storage level between the maximum and minimum storage levels from 2020 to 2077 but the simulation procedure in the ann violated the storage level in early 2021 fig 14 a depicts the average monthly discharge for mean temperature water demand under the rcp 4 5 the figure demonstrated that the simulation method resulted in excessive water releases but the optimisation process in the hho resulted in water releases that were exactly in accordance with the water demand trend line despite this fig 14 b demonstrated that the reservoir optimisation operation using the hho provided the safest design and planning as the storage level did not fail in any time zone throughout the year from near future to far future however the simulation process in the ann has breached the safety storage level since the beginning of the year 2021 as the level drops to the minimum storage level indicating that excessive releases caused negative storage and this would lead to the critical draught scenario to occur in the mid and far future as temperature was the main contributing factor under the rcp 4 5 as shown in table 10 fig 15 a and b depicted the same conditions that existed in maximum temperature water demand however when compared to the simulation process the optimisation process for the releases was shown to be critical this was because of the significant inflow event and mean temperature contribution as shown in table 10 with both conditions the reservoir may be unable to operate normally table 12 presents the periodic reliability results for the maximum and mean temperatures of water demand under the various rcp scenarios as scenario 2 and scenario 3 respectively the total number of releases ranges from near future to far future is 960 times 2020 2099 scenarios 2 demonstrated the incline trend of the shortage period under the rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively by getting 4 90 9 58 and 21 35 this result graphically highlighted the impact of the reservoir system in maximum temperature of water demand functioning under the rcps over an extended period of time additionally there is no obvious upward or downward trend for the aspect of shortage time in scenario 3 particularly under the rcp 8 5 no contribution of any percentage as well in meeting the exact water demand the major conclusion depicted in table 12 was the surplus period attaining the 100 under rcp 8 5 in scenario 3 this phenomenon implies that the reservoir received much more inflows than any other rcps event in scenario 3 as a result if this catastrophe occurs scenario 3 requires further attention especially under the rcp 8 5 furthermore in scenario 2 the rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 showed no significant change in the surplus period with 71 88 and 76 46 respectively however the rcp 8 5 indicated a decrease in the surplus event proportion with 61 15 additionally the rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 assigned a surplus event weighting of 71 77 and 3 54 respectively in scenario 3 overall table 12 demonstrated the reliability of meeting the exact water demand in scenario 2 is not optimal particularly under the rcp 4 5 where it achieved only 13 96 whereas 23 23 and 17 50 under the rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 respectively on the other hand scenario 3 periodic reliability was more persuasive at the rcp 4 5 reaching 93 54 whereas under the rcp 2 6 it was only capable of reaching 18 54 consequently the decision maker at kgd should be aware of these situations to minimise and be well prepared if future kgd operations face the concerns which closely related to scenarios 2 and 3 under all rcps the reservoir performance for maximum temperature of water demand shown in table 13 was set as scenario 2 the maximum temperature of water demand all the rcps experienced overall average of 34 20 storage failure in the optimisation process whereas an overall average of 97 33 storage failure in the simulation process for all the rcps respectively this indicates that the reservoir simulation results had the critical storage failure compared to the reservoir optimisation process thus optimisation in reservoir operation is essential for reservoir managers to understand the optimal operation of the reservoir and to minimise any unnecessary risk or loss during the operation period there were two criteria of evaluation in resilience metric the most significant results shown in table 13 were the resiliency under the rcp 8 5 the maximum water deficit occurred was happened for 205 months the results obtained in terms of average wsr the reservoir system under all the rcps obtained negative values for scenario 2 indicating reservoir system failure as evidenced by fig 10 b 12 b the least shortage index was happened under the rcp 8 5 with value of 0 0003 in scenario 2 table 14 depicts reservoir performance for mean temperature water demand in scenario 3 under the various rcp scenarios the average percentage of storage failure obtained for optimisation and simulation was 51 97 and 98 09 respectively furthermore under the rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 the resilience measures in scenario 3 showed negative values in average wsr this scenario produced a convincing result when analysed contemporaneously with fig 13 b 15 b which indicate that the reservoir system s storage would breach in a specific time as shown in the respective figures particularly under the rcp 8 5 where the reservoir system demonstrated zero month of water deficit as this provided information that the rcp 8 5 was facing surplus release in the very beginning of the near future whereas under the rcp 4 5 the average wsr showed a positive value and the shortest maximum duration of water deficit in 28 months also the least shortage index was happened under the rcp 4 5 in summary when tables 13 and 14 were compared in terms of vulnerability under the rcp 2 6 scenario 2 obtained 0 507 while scenario 3 obtained 0 534 indicating that the hho in scenario 2 performed slightly more robustly the similar condition scenario 2 showed more robustness than scenario 3 under the rcp 8 5 with value of 0 191 and 0 611 respectively however scenario 3 performed better than scenario 2 under the rcp 4 5 with values of 0 00177 and 0 478 respectively all reservoir simulation and optimisation processes are essentially informative and aid reservoir managers or policymakers in planning their reservoir system ahead of time 4 conclusions in this study the sim heuristic concepts were applied to examine several climate scenarios under the cmip5 for reservoir operating at the kgd to achieve reliable and accurate downscaling findings several gcms were integrated into an ensembly of gmcs the ann and svr poly kernel and radial basis functions were used to build a data driven downscaling approach with the svr poly kernel function the highest coefficient r attained during model training for the base period was 0 6201 table 6 shows with similar predictant that the r for ann and svr rbf kernel function were 0 4926 and 0 2841 respectively the predictant variables mean temperature maximum temperature and minimum temperature had the highest correlation in the svr poly kernel function at 0 5743 0 6926 and 0 6073 respectively the ann acquired the highest correlation during model training for solar radiation predictant variables model testing was performed for the base period to validate training results even though the r obtained in model training and testing indicated that the ann was more consistent than the other svr the downscaling results showed that the svr poly kernel function provided the most reliable performances in terms of the least error found in rmse and mae during the model testing processes during the base period as a result the svr poly kernel function was used to downscale under various rcps as indicated in table 7 the rainfall runoff was computed using following the hydrological procedure hp 11 2018 design flood hydrograph estimation for rural catchments in malaysia next empirical evaporation methods were conducted to validate the empirical evaporation results a comparison was made between the outperformed empirical evaporation method and forecast temperature based evaporation maximum minimum and mean temperature as scenario a and solar radiation and temperature based evaporation as scenario b for the evaporation methods the empirical turc radiation method was chosen for the following analysis of reservoir operation as the correlation was the highest among the methods and the evaporation obtained with the turc radiation method was more reliable and practical than the kharuffa method for this study area in malaysia as a tropical location scenario 1 is the base period water demand whereas scenarios 2 and 3 focus on maximum and mean temperature these are the main contributors because climate change could cause significant changes in water demand prior to the reservoir operation analysis benchmark tests were performed the best fitness level or accuracy level was then implemented in reservoir operation analysis the simulation and optimisation or sim heuristic of kgd reservoir operations was performed throughout two time periods a base period 1991 2005 and b future climatic scenario under rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 near future to far future from year 2020 2099 for both timelines the ann was used for simulation while the hho was used for reservoir optimisation scenario 3 achieved 93 54 of the exact demand under rcp 4 5 and had the lowest shortage index and duration of water deficit in rcp 4 5 scenario 3 the hho reservoir model was most effective the robustness of the hho was shown in various rcps under scenario 2 indicating its capabilities and functionality to solve reservoir operation under climatic impact tables 13 and 14 illustrate that storage constraints can be easily breached utilising reservoir simulation analyses despite the violation occurring in the mid future due to climate scenarios the reservoir optimisation study still capable of minimising the release deficit and managed storage efficiency in summary this study has demonstrated an investigation of the objectives to examine kgd operation under various rcps in cmip5 future studies should take into account other various metaheuristic optimisation algorithms e g whale optimisation algorithm and lévy flight rather than concentrating solely on reservoir simulation in order to validate these circumstances particularly future climatic change impact on reservoir operation due to the water demand changes will be the main significant concern using a minimum temperature in water demand or considering land use land cover change versus population would be among the options to further investigate the climate change impact onto the future kgd s operations a suitable evaporation method specific to the study area should also be considered at other study

2820,this study covers the application of sim heuristics to simulate and optimise the klang gate dam kgd operating rule curve using the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 climate scenarios this research aims to examine future climate change impacts on the kgd reservoir water resources first based on model institution location and data availability a few general circulation models gcms under the cmip5 were chosen most earlier studies had solely examined the impact of climate change on future reservoir operations using a single gcm the ensemble of gcms for precipitation temperature maximum minimum and mean and solar radiation for the base period 1991 2005 and future climatic scenarios under the representative concentration pathways rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 were downscaled trained and tested using data driven techniques namely the artificial neural network ann and the support vector regression svr during the base period the svr poly function achieved r performance values of 0 6201 0 5743 0 6926 and 0 6073 for the respective predictant variables upon addressing for rainfall runoff the turc radiation evaporation strategy was utilised at this study location since it was suitable for the tropical humid or sub humid region few scenarios were developed to forecast water demand scenario 1 was based on the base period 1991 2005 of water demand whereas scenarios 2 and 3 were based on maximum and mean temperatures respectively 2020 2099 the results were then evaluated in terms of storage failure reliability resilience and vulnerability overall scenario 3 showed the greatest reliability in satisfying exact demand with 93 54 as well as the least shortage index and length of water deficit under rcp 4 5 keywords cmip5 downscaling simulation metaheuristics klang gate dam optimisation data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction global warming leads to the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases ghgs terzi manolis 2020 human activities are most probably the cause of the transition causing greenhouse gas increases akbary et al 2019 climate change affects temperature rainfall and wind additionally climate change is influenced by differences in the intensity of sunlight and the direction of the earth coelho et al 2020 these significant changes also impact human health poverty and well being yalew et al 2020 changes in climate intensify extreme weather events katelaris 2021 and ultimately affects reservoir operations as well madadi et al 2015 heat waves are anticipated to increase as climate change progresses this will cause many droughts these occurrences jeopardise the water supply systems that were initially designed for a different environment thus climate change adaptation has ramifications for water resources projects e g dam or reservoir few recent studies on the adaptation strategies or policies in response to climate change events for reservoir operation management have been mentioned zahabiyoun et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 jaiswal et al 2021 thomas et al 2021 furthermore temperature and precipitation are expected to have a considerable impact on the prospective water resources thus sustainable water management should take climate change into account in all aspects of water management according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc technical paper presented by bates et al 2008 the current water management practices are insufficient and are incapable of mitigating the effects of climate change thus identifying that the hydrology changes at the local and regional scale is crucial for creating the water resource adjustments there are three ways to generate future climate scenarios using observable data using synthetic climate scenarios or general circulation model output gcms according to wilby and harris 2006 using the gcm output delivers the most reliable outcomes and is thus the focus of this paper the ipcc s fifth assessment report ar5 replaced the cmip3 with phase 5 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 cmip5 will incorporate new and more comprehensive gcms with better spatial resolution as well as different greenhouse gas emission scenarios these new and more complete gcms will be coupled with more sophisticated circulation patterns in the region sachindra et al 2014 to replace the older emission scenarios a2 b1 etc in the ipcc ar4 a new set of ghgs scenarios termed the representative concentration pathways rcps has been developed to aid in the assessment of the effectiveness of various policy and adaptation solutions in minimising the effects of climate change van vuuren et al 2011 as indicated in table 1 the comparison between special report on emissions scenarios sres ar4 and rcps ar5 was based on their concentration pathways which corresponded to their respective approximate radioactive forcing levels wm 2 a reservoir dam s purpose is to provide the basic water demands needed and then store excess water to prevent downstream flooding eum and simonovic 2010 chen et al 2016 recently several studies on reservoir optimisation have been developed and a thorough review can be found in lai et al 2022 these studies typically start with the traditional optimisation approaches like the stochastic dynamic programming sdp soleimani et al 2016 el shafie et al 2018 zeng et al 2019 then move on to the heuristic algorithms like the genetic algorithm ga azamathulla et al 2008 hossain and el shafie 2013 evolutionary based algorithm zatarain salazar et al 2017 and lastly applying the swarm intelligence heuristic algorithms such as the artificial bee colony abc hossain and el shafie 2014 choong et al 2016 based on these ideas the nature inspired metaheuristic algorithms such as the shark optimisation algorithms ehteram et al 2017 whale optimisation algorithms lai et al 2021 ezzeldin and djebedjian 2020 gravity search algorithm bozorg haddad et al 2016 and the krill algorithms ehteram et al 2017 karami et al 2018 etc have evolved several studies were conducted for trade off reservoir benefits through the execution of the optimisation process for instance the stabilising of the water demand and ecosystem protection ren et al 2019 the balancing between hydropower generation and the biodiversity conservation at downstream wetland xu et al 2020 the reducing of water level of a lake for the stability of navigation the water supply and ecological services li et al 2020 the minimising the gap between water supply and demand allawi et al 2019 are some interesting examples however these optimised rules were usually produced by applying observed inflows reservoir inflow runoff precipitation temperature and evaporation are all hydro climatic variables that may affect the benefits from the reservoirs forecasting runoff accurately is critical for the effective water resource management and planning to estimate river streamflow mohammadi et al 2020 integrated the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and the shuffling frog leaping algorithm sfla the results of this integration approach were superior to those of yaseen et al 2017 and the standard anfis however the authors suggested that to reduce the training time the number of input variables ought be reduced in order to make this model suitable for real time implementation several hydro climatic studies utilising the gcms and rcp scenarios as future climate scenarios in various sectors of water resources have also been carried out for the purpose of planning and management raje and mujumdar 2010 tan et al 2014 tan et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 tan et al 2019 jamshidpey and shourian 2021 wilby and harris 2006 stated that the incorporation of gcms into the reservoir operation yields more reliable results in this regard zhou and guo 2013 conducted studies to incorporate the ecological requirement into a multipurpose reservoir under climate change by optimising reservoir operation rules using an integrated adaptive optimisation model iaom their findings indicated a high probability of reducing the negative impact of a dam on a river system under the scenarios of climate change ouyang et al 2015 reported that future streamflow in the huangnizhuang catchment in china would decline under the three rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios using an ensemble of six gcms ho et al 2016 examined streamflow variations at the tocantins araguaia brazil basin using the rcp 4 5 climate projections and discovered significant losses in streamflow during the yearly and dry season periods for the future period 2071 2100 turner et al 2017 investigated the climatic effects of hydroelectricity in order to invest in the world s power supply the results indicated that climate change has shifted energy demand away from hydropower generation and toward high carbon technologies even though it appears irrelevant to irrigation this study was addressed since it significant impact on the co2 emissions in the energy sector and the risk of investing is higher in countries where water resources are more vulnerable to climate change abera et al 2018 chose the hec resprm model to optimise a hydropower reservoir at the tekeze reservoir eastern nile under the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 also the simulated future inflows were obtained from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment over the african domain cordex africa the findings indicated that the production of power could be increased due to the effects of climate change there are almost 200 hydroelectric plants in brazil thus it is essential to forecast future energy needs and manage the timing of new generation projects silveira et al 2019 investigated the seasonal and multi annual variability of precipitation of multi gcms in cmip5 under the rcp 8 5 for the hydropower sector in brazil the authors concluded the analysis by stating that some gcms were unable to perform satisfactorily in hydropower estimates under the rcp 8 5 moreover there were a few studies that were demonstrated by nourani et al 2020 huangpeng et al 2021 and shrestha et al 2021 on the future reservoir optimisation based on the rcps scenarios nourani et al 2020 suggested utilising a mathematical model to optimise the shahrchay reservoir s operation rule from 2020 to 2060 three gcms were implemented under the a1b b1 rcp 4 5 and 8 5 projections the simulation algorithm used a feedforward neural network while the optimisation applied ga the authors stated that the findings aided in water resource management and planning and that future climate change projections should be investigated in order to establish better reservoir management practices huangpeng et al 2021 examined the hydropower generation with three gcms under the rcp 2 6 45 and 8 5 at the jinanqiao dam china by utilising the developed crow search algorithm dcsa the results showed a decrease of energy production under the rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 thus these outputs can aid in better management and planning before the problem arises however these studies were demonstrated with a single gcm for the investigation of the future reservoir optimisation reservoir for which tan et al 2014 suggested that an ensemble of gcms would provide more reliable outputs in hydrology management compared to a single gcm a the klang gate dam kgd there is limited information on the investigation of the climate change impact on the future reservoir operations hence this study examines the climate change impact on the future kgd s operation under an ensemble gcms of the cmip5 by utilising simulation and metaheuristic algorithms also known as the sim heuristic approach furthermore there were two methods of prediction of evaporation named as scenario a and scenario b respectively by mimicking the determined factors or variables involved in the temperature based and the turc radiation evaporation method respectively the scenario a and b were conducted by utilising the svr in order to validate the results obtained in the empirical evaporation method section 2 outlines the study area datasets flowchart statistical gcm downscaling methods evaporation methods rainfall runoff calculation water demand prediction under various climate scenarios statistical evaluation conceptual elaboration of the proposed algorithm and reservoir risk performance section 3 gives the results and discussion section 4 ends with a summary and future recommendations 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the klang gate dam kgd is located at taman melawati kuala lumpur s kl gombak district it is also referred to as the bukit tabur dam and its rainfall station id is 3217002 source luas as illustrated in fig 1 the dam was constructed at latitude 3 degrees 13 58 north 3 233 degrees and longitude 101 degrees 45 0 east 101 75 degrees the kgd s primary purpose is to supply water to the city of kuala lumpur s bukit nanas and wangsa maju water treatment facilities wtps the illustration of kgd is shown in fig 2 the entire capacity of the kgd is approximately 32 02 million cubic metres mcm which includes inactive storage conservation storage and flood control storage it is recommended that the storage level in fig 2 not to exceed the level of conservation storage or inactive storage as sediment obstructions may affect the kgd s operation due to the high inflow rates into the kgd the storage level may increase suddenly to the flood control storage zone where the maximum limit is at 23 44 mcm further details of the kgd features are available in dashti latif et al 2020 2 2 datasets the base period from the year 1991 to 2005 and the future climatic data from the year 2020 to 2099 were obtained for the cmip5 based on the gcms of miroc esm chem miroc esm miroc 5 and csiro mk 3 6 respectively these gcms are in finer resolution compared to other models in the cmip5 also the closest locations of the respective models to the kgd are shown in fig 1 as well as the selection coordinates depicted in table 3 the monthly average data obtained in the 15 years of the base period is shown in table 2 the parameters involved in the investigation under climate change impact to the base period and future period for the reservoir optimisation operation include the monthly average of the precipitation inflow evaporation water demand maximum temperature mean temperature and minimum temperature the proposed strategy employed in this work is summarised as a series of selection processes that include gcms for the base and future periods under the rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 following that was to investigate the correlation between the predictors and predictants precipitation and temperature via statistical downscaling approaches the artificial neural network ann and the support vector regression svr radial basis function and polynomial kernel function were implemented for the downscaling process in order to validate the correlation values down to the kgd s station next was to compute the rainfall runoff relationship as well as the estimation of the evaporation under the future periods based on the temperature and radiation method lastly the investigation of the reservoir optimisation operation under the base period and future period categorised into three scenarios namely scenario 1 simulation under base period vs simulation optimisation under base period scenario 2 simulation under rcps vs simulation optimisation under rcps for maximum temperature of water demand scenario 3 simulation under rcps vs simulation optimisation under rcps for mean temperature of water demand for a better understanding fig 3 illustrates the flowchart of the study 2 3 statistical gcm downscaling methods this statistical downscaling models in this study were introduced using the artificial neural networks ann and the support vector regression svr with the radial basis function and the polynomial kernel functions respectively the downscaling method was not used in the sdsm approach because the base period and future data were both in a monthly timeline whereas the sdsm required daily data due to course resolution restrictions and intermodal uncertainty in dynamic downscaling the gcms were unable to resolve regional climate change ning and bradley 2016 marotzke et al 2017 moise et al 2015 hence statistical downscaling is more popular than the dynamic option since it requires less computational work relatively simple to operate with sufficient amount of observed data as a result data driven techniques such as the ann and the svr were chosen for this study previous studies had been conducted using these methods nourani et al 2020 okkan and kirdemir 2018 khashei et al 2018 prior to statistical downscaling using the ann and the svr the data standardisation was performed as a bias correction method to reduce the systematic error in the average of the variables in the base period and future period relative to the observational data okkan and inan 2015 the ann and the svr were applied to downscale the gcm predictants variables precipitation and temperature for the base period and the future period rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 under the cmip5 in order to reach out for the overall best results several downscale parameters in the ann and the svr had been fixed as can be seen in table 4 fig 4 illustrated the basic architecture of the ann and the svr respectively the downscaling models were trained to analyse the correlation between the observed variables and base period baseline followed by the future period of the predictants predictors variables fig 5 illustrates the baseline of the climatic variables from 1991 2005 table 5 presents the potential combination of the predictants predictors variables executed during the downscaling process of the model training and testing via the ann and svr initially the various predictors in table 5 were executed during the base period to determine the highest r2 value corresponding to the correlation between both predictants according to jaiswal et al 2021 and nourani et al 2020 this strategy has been widely utilised by various researchers according to chu et al 2010 there is no specified number of predictor selections for the downscaling of gcms however one to three predictors are typically sufficient for determining the correlation between model predictants and predictors as indicated by these authors by assessing the precipitation predictors it can be concluded that precipitation depends on and is influenced by gravity fall winds and temperature fig 6 depicts the monthly predictant variables under the cmip5 at kgd for the rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 from 2020 to 2099 2 4 evaporation methods when designing for hydrology and irrigation planning evaporation or potential evaporation is a critical parameter despite the fact that this is such an important parameter no concrete highly accurate method for determining it has been developed to date furthermore no single method is universally accurate thus rather the best suited models for a specific geographic study area must be identified as a result this article proposed two evaporation empirical methods for the future rcps temperature based radiation based and finally a data driven technique was employed to predict in terms for two of the scenarios which is for scenario a temperature variables as the determining factor and for scenario b integration of temperature and solar radiation variables in order to validate to the outperformed empirical method the correlation between empirical evaporation methods and prediction by utilising data driven techniques wherein the term values of r mae and rmse in model training and testing are tabulated in table 8 the outperforming results will then be implemented for the future reservoir optimisation operations a kharrufa method kharrufa 1985 it is crucial to estimate evaporation losses while managing and optimising reservoirs numerous ways exist each requiring a unique set of data and equations nourani et al 2020 presented the work by utilising a temperature based method the kharrufa method to estimate monthly evaporation at the shahchay dam in northwestern iran for both the base and future years the equation denoted by eq 1 1 e d 0 34 x p x t mean 1 3 in which ed is the monthly reservoir evaporation in depth at the kgd mm month p and tmean denote the ratio of total monthly daytime hours used to total yearly daytime hours 12 x 365 and the mean monthly temperature c respectively kharuffa 1985 and xu and singh 2001 has provided the p values of different months and latitudes despite the results of r shown in table 8 having attained the highest the reason for not choosing this method is that the mae was also the highest as compared to the other methods also this method was commonly applied in arid or semi arid regions whereas malaysia s weather is humid and tropical region lian et al 2019 thus in this study the second proposed method based on radiation the turc method was executed for the evaporation under future rcps scenario furthermore past studies that had been conducted in the same study area had proven that this method is suitable to be implemented in malaysia as being more reliable for humid goh et al 2021 tukimat harun and shahid 2012 jensen burmann and allen 1990 and sub humid regions birara et al 2021 there were findings reported that the turc radiation method was found to be more consistent than those of the temperature based methods which were conducted in peninsular malaysia muhammad et al 2019 muniandy yusop and askari 2016 tukimat harun and shahid 2012 b turc method the turc model is a radiation based evaporation technique incorporating mean temperature solar radiation and relative humidity to estimate the evaporation rate for the rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 following is the equation involved for rh 50 2 e d 0 013 t mean t mean 15 r

represents the precipitation value unit in mm the results obtained were then executed as the inflow mcm for the reservoir optimisation operation 2 6 prediction of water demand under the rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 according to anang et al 2017 climate change s impact on water resources alters the availability quantity and quality of water during the water supply cycle also it impacts the demand pattern for water for instance the downstream necessitates increased water consumption during the dry season hence in this study the impact of climatic variables in temperature as major determining factor to water demand has been predicted by utilising ann as following equations 8 stndpredictionmax t e m p e r a t u r e o f w a t e r d e m a n d x stndwaterdemand obs s t n d i n f l o w x

the future climate scenario in rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 stnd represents the standardisation for each of the variables and obs is observation data for water demand as shown in table 2 the primary reason of choosing two various water demand was that the monthly average temperature for maximum temperature during the base period was the highest value among the temperature variables i e mean and minimum temperatures additionally the mean temperature of water demand was a more significant and stable factor in the investigation of future climate impacts on reservoir operation than the minimum temperature of water demand however the minimum temperature of water demand can work as the future recommendation 2 7 statistical evaluation for downscaling methods and evaporation methods these statistical analyses were applied to compare between the ann and the svr in order to determine accuracy and validate the findings of both techniques the mean absolute error mae is the absolute value

x represent the values in the x variable y i is the values of the y variables in a sample and y represent the values in the y variable 2 8 harris hawks optimisation hho algorithm intelligent and distinguished predators such as the harris hawks can track surround flush out and catch the prey for example rabbits in a group the population of hawks is assumed to be a group of hawks that each utilises seven different killing strategies to hunt down the target rabbit the answer in the optimisation problem in the beginning the hawk that leads the group will attempt to capture the prey if the prey s dynamic nature and escape behaviour prevent the hawk from capturing it another tactic will be used known as switching tactics the rest of the group the hawks will attack the prey until it is captured by puzzling and exhausting the prey the hawks are able to pursue the evading prey harris hawks are considered candidate solutions in the hho whereas the intended prey is the optimal or global solution as a result the hho goes through exploratory and exploitative phases heidari et al 2019 the following is an elaboration of the strategy phases in the hho islam et al 2020 which goes through exploratory and exploitative phases strategy 1 phase of exploration the harris hawks conduct the monitoring and discovery process during this phase most often harris hawks would plummet at higher levels to stalk their prey eq 13 is the mathematical expression that stimulates harris hawks search process if q 0 5 the harris hawks will perch near to the hunting area but if it is more than 0 5 they will likely find a high tree and remain on it where q is a non negative integer ranging from 0 to 1 x iter 1 13 x rand i t e r r 1 x rand i t e r 2 r 2 i t e r i f q 0 5 x rabbit i t e r x m i t t e r r 3 l b r 4 u b l b i f q 0 5 where x iter is the current applicant solution position hawks xrand is the hawk randomly selected from the population available x rabbit denotes the rabbit s current position iter denotes the current repetition and r1 r2 r3 and r4 are random numbers between 0 1 lb and ub represent the minimum and maximum values of the xm variables which represent the current hawks median location as measured as follows 14 x m 1 n i 1 n x i i t e r in which x i denotes the position of each hawk and n denotes the population size of hawks strategy 2 phase of transition from phases of exploration to exploitation t denotes the maximum number of iterations and e0 denotes the initial energy exploration and exploitation have the potential to alter the running energy 15 e 2 e 0 1 iter t the iteration e which indicates that escaping energy varies randomly between 1 and 1 after which it is changing from 2 to 2 but it is decreasing during the process as in equation 15 if e is greater than one then the harris hawks are in the stage of looking for prey a likely explanation is that the harris hawks are hunting rabbits as they are exhausted which indicates e is less than one exploitation stage strategy 3 phase of exploitation four potential solutions have been achieved based on escape from rabbit states and various hawk monitoring plans both options have improved by adjusting the bait s running energy and the hawk s attack tactics the hawks may render a soft or serious assault in a different direction to hunt the lure the r defines the bait s running opportunity if the bait runs at less than r 0 5 the bait escapes safely otherwise the bait would be trapped in addition if the bait s running energy e and r is greater and equal to 0 5 the hho carries out a soft siege movement and vice versa condition the hard siege would conduct the good running of the bait is not only dependent on the escaping resources but also on the running chance in the meantime the trapping phase relies both on the hunting escape technique and the hawk siege strategy heidari et al 2019 strategy 4 soft siege the rabbit retains sufficient energy and attempts to flee through some random deceptive jumps while the hawks gently surround it the following rules is modelled by the elaboration 16 x t 1 δ x t e j x rabbit t x t 17 δ x t x rabbit t x t in which x t the gap of the rabbit s position vector and its current location during iteration t r 5 a random number inside 0 1 j 2 1 r 5 the rabbit s random jump strength is constantly fluctuating throughout the escape process each iteration the j value is changed randomly to simulate the movement of a rabbit strategy 5 hard siege the rabbit has now reached its limits and is almost completely depleted the hawks quickly encircle it and execute the mystery sneak up the position is updated by the below description 18 x t 1 x rabbit t e δ x t strategy 6 soft siege with continuous rapid dives it can be concluded that the rabbit is still full of energy and keeps trying to get away the fact that e 0 5 and r 0 5 illustrates this soft siege must first be employed before the hawks can attempt a surprise pounce strategy 6 is better than strategy 4 because of the initiation of the lévy flight concept which hawks use for making soft sieges as shown below 19 y x rabbit t e j x rabbit t x t the dive of the hawks was conducted few attempts to compare each movement with the previous dive to determine the diving attempt was good or bad hence the hawks dive based on lévy flight is given as follows 20 z y s x l f d in which d dimension of the problem s random vector of size 1 x d lf the lévy flight function can be demonstrated as follows 21 l f x 0 01 x u x σ v 1 β 22 σ 1 β x sin π β 2 1 β 2 x β x 2 β 1 2 1 β in which u and v are identical values lying in the range of 0 1 and β is an assumed constant equal to 1 5 thus the final updating rule of hawks in this strategy 6 is expressed below 23 x t 1 y i f f y f x t z i f f z f x t y in which y and z are calculated using eqns 19 and 20 strategy 7 hard siege with continuous rapid dives when the condition of e 0 5 and r 0 5 show that the rabbit lost its energy the hawks use the hard siege to reduce the distance between them and the rabbit which allows them to kill the rabbit this strategy s updating rule is specified as below 24 x t 1 y i f f y f x t z i f f z f x t y 25 y x rabbit t e j x rabbit t x m t 26 z y s x l f d in eqns 20 and 21 the y and z variables represent the next iteration locations until the optimal solution is obtained 2 9 performance of reservoir optimisation operation a minimisation of water deficit the objective function is to minimise the monthly water deficit the difference between demand and supply as defined in eq 27 27 minz t 1 12 d t r t 2 where t denotes the number of the months in a year while d t and r t denote monthly demand and release for that month respectively b thresholds in order to achieve optimal reservoir operation every reservoir system must adhere to the constraints and penalty functions the upper and lower boundary limits of the static penalty function also known as the threshold were used to achieve optimum reservoir operation without jeopardising the objective function zhai et al 2020 i equality of continuity threshold eq 28 gives the continuity threshold 28 s t 1 s t i t r

objective function s tolerance for its final value as a result the final objective function modification for optimisation operation rule at the kgd on a monthly basis has been rewritten in eq 33

performance of downscaling method table 6 displays the statistical performances of the respective predictants precipitation mean temperature maximum temperature minimum temperature and solar radiation obtained during the downscaling process for the ann and svr poly kernel and rbf functions from 1991 to 2005 base period the highest coefficient r obtained during model training was 0 6201 and which was under the precipitation predictant variable in the svr poly kernel function while for this predictant mthe ann and svr rbf kernel function obtained 0 4926 and 0 2841 respectively furthermore the predictant variables mean temperature maximum temperature and minimum temperature were found to have the highest correlation r in the svr poly kernel function at 0 5743 0 6926 and 0 6073 respectively the ann on the other hand achieved the highest correlation during the model training process for the solar radiation predictant variable as a result the model testing process of the svr poly kernel function provided the validation purpose as the rmse and mae in the solar radiation predictant were the least error obtained when compared to the ann overall the statistical downscaling results demonstrated that the downscaling approach in the svr poly kernel function provided more reliable results as the model testing provided the least error of value in rmse and mae respectively even though the overall ann provided the best r during the model testing process finally for the downscaling process during the base period the svr poly kernel function was chosen for the following rcps downscaling approach table 7 depicts the statistical performance obtained for the svr poly kernel function for the rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 from 2020 to 2099 respectively overall the downscaling statistical results obtained during the model training and testing process provided a good r value which was on average greater than 0 7 while the rmse and mae were on average of 0 5 3 2 statistical performance of evaporation values table 8 shows the statistical model performance for the evaporation using the various evaporation methods as described in section 2 5 the turc radiation based evaporation method had the highest coefficient 0 8453 in the model training process compared to the kharuffa temperature based evaporation method 0 7408 furthermore the turc radiation based model achieved a stable coefficient of r 0 8468 with little difference in the model training process in addition the prediction based methods based on the svr were used to validate the empirical evaporation based methods the kharuffa and the turc as a result the formulation of the svr based prediction was based on the combination shown in eqs 4 and 5 after validating with the prediction based approach the turc radiation based approach still provided the overall best coefficient and this method was implemented for the reservoir optimisation operation under climate change scenarios 3 3 optimisation of reservoirs in perspective of climate change scenarios tan et al 2014 stated that for future water management planning an ensemble of gcms could provide more reliable results following this recommendation in this study four ensembles of gcms were implemented as shown in table 4 another study which was conducted by nourani et al 2020 had only executed a single or individual gcm table 9 shows the average percentage of predictant variables in the rcps compared to the base period generally there is an 11 88 increase in precipitation under the rcp 2 6 when compared to the base period indicating that the inflow to the kgd is the most significant contributor factor when compared to the other predictant variables even the following contributor factor mean temperature is believed to have only an average influence on the prediction of water demand as shown in eq 8 furthermore when comparing the climate scenario under the rcp 4 5 to the base period the lowest average percentage obtained was 4 39 under minimum temperature followed by mean temperature and precipitation 2 26 and 2 12 respectively for the sake of validation the minimum temperature was used in the temperature based prediction of water demand similar to the rcp 2 6 the average percentage under the rcp 8 5 compared to the base period has attained the highest contribution of 7 87 for precipitation and 3 52 for mean temperature with both predictant variables showing the strongest influence on the reservoir optimisation operation in order to compute inflow and predict water demand fig 7 depicts the average monthly inflow mcm between the base period and the rcps while fig 8 depicts the inflow variation under the rcps versus the base period i benchmark test functions faris et al 2016 proposed three benchmark functions in the evolopy as shown in eqs 34 36 they can be used to evaluate the hho to find the best solutions to optimisation problems the characteristics of the hho used in this study is tabulated in table 10 there are two function groups unimodal for eq 34 and multimodal for eqns 35 36 qaddoura et al 2020 khurma et al 2020 the fitness level obtained was tabulated in table 12 34 f 1 x i 1 n j 1 i x j 2 35 f 2 x i 1 n x i s i n x i 36 f 3 x i 1 n x i 2 10 cos 2 π x i 10 as shown in table 10 the hho was evaluated using both the unimodal and multimodal models using a variety of benchmark functions in this phase of the studies the suggested hho is utilised to study scalable unimodal f1 and multimodal test functions f2 f3 with dimension spaces of 30 the hho ran 500 iterations of each benchmark function on m 10 separate runs epoch table 11 displays the fitness level obtained and summarises the mean and standard deviation of the results obtained by using three test functions the fitness value also known as the level of accuracy in hho used in this study for the following reservoir case study optimisation is f 1 0 e 05 ii scenario 1 actual observed period vs simulation vs simulation optimisation under base period fig 9 a depicts scenario 1 of the average monthly release for the base period from 1991 to 2005 the dotted line depicts the monthly average demand for the base period scenario 1 was conducted by utilising the ann to simulate the reservoir operation while the hho was used to optimise the reservoir operation the average monthly release curves and storage obtained from both simulated and optimised processes respectively were then compared with release curve and storage in actual observed period fig 9 a depicts the optimisation process during the base period where most of the months average releases throughout the year were able to meet the demand despite this an average excess of releases occurred from february to may and from august to october possibly due to the rainy or monsoon season at the kgd as a result there would be a monthly average excess release during these periods of time aside from that the monthly average excess releases during the base period for the simulation process was more than the optimisation process also the monthly average release curve for actual observed period only managed to meet the exact water demand for october and november further to this fig 9 b presents the storage condition at the kgd for the base period from 1991 to 2005 the illustration provides a vivid trend line that at the very beginning of the year 1991 the simulation process in the ann has failed to maintain the storage level unlike the optimisation process conducted by the hho the reservoir optimisation operation process in the hho had by then begun to fail from the third quarter of the year in 1994 until the beginning of the year 2000 however for the actual observed period the storagine level was shown within the boundary as such with the inclusion of an ensembly of gcms during the base period there was an impact shown vividly on the reservoir average monthly release policy as well as the reservoir storage hence this climatic scenario provides a more relevant and practical example to gain a strong foundation in order to investigate the impact of the future reservoir optimisation operations under various climate change scenarios rcps as shown in the following figures in scenario 2 and scenario 3 iii scenario 2 simulation vs simulation optimisation under rcps for maximum temperature of water demand the following discussion is based on scenario 2 investigating the future reservoir simulation and optimisation operation at the kgd under climatic scenarios of the rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively for maximum temperature of water demand as illustrated in figs 10 12 the timeline of these future climatic scenarios is divided into three groups a 2020 2049 near future b 2050 2079 mid future and c 2080 2099 far future fig 10 a depicts the trend line pattern of monthly average release curve as both reservoir optimisation and simulation achieved the excessive releases under the rcp 2 6 throughout the year 2020 2099 this is supported by the evidence in table 10 which shows that the rcp 2 6 gained the highest average percentage of precipitation compared to the base period this indicates that when compared to the other two rcps the inflow under the rcp 2 6 yielded more fluctuated inflow conditions as a result the excessive release action for reservoir optimisation operations at the kgd under the rcp 2 6 may have seemed to be comparatively higher than in the base period despite this the optimisation process conducted by the hho was still closer to the maximum temperature water demand than the simulation process in the ann which resulted in the pessimistic outcome of the release additionally the storage at the kgd was able to maintain its safety levels as illustrated in fig 10 b despite the fact that it failed after several years in the mid future the optimisation process in the hho kept the reservoir storage level between the maximum and minimum storage levels from 2020 to 2075 whereas the simulation process in the ann breached the storage level in early 2021 the average monthly release for maximum temperature water demand under the rcp 4 5 is depicted in fig 11 a the figures showed that both the simulation and optimisation processes resulted in excessive releases but the optimisation process in the hho resulted in a trend line that was closer to the water demand trend line this scenario occurred because the variation in inflow into the reservoir at the kgd as shown in table 10 indicated that the main contributing factor was not precipitation even though the minimum temperature was the main primary variable contributing to the reservoir operation under the rcp 4 5 the effect is still much lesser than the precipitation variable despite this fig 11 b indicated that reservoir optimisation utilising the hho resulted in the safest design and planning up to the mid future time zone according to table 10 the simulation process has broken the safety storage level since the beginning of the year 2023 resulting in a level that decreases below the lowest storage level indicating that excessive releases produced negative storage and this would result in the severe draught scenario occurring in the mid and far future as temperature was the primary contributing factor under the rcp 4 5 accordingly in table 10 the precipitation is the most significant contributor factor to the reservoir optimisation operation at the kgd and a similar circumstance in the rcp 2 6 occurred under the rcp 8 5 for maximum temperature water demand as the oscillation of the severe inflow into the kgd primarily the excessive discharges occurred from the very beginning of the near future until the far future in order to reduce the risk of storage overflow as indicated in fig 12 a the simulation process in the ann was unable to accomplish the near close to the maximum temperature water demand whereas optimisation in the hho achieved the closest to the demand line however because of the significant fluctuation inflow into the kgd under the rcp 8 5 the storage level is unable to achieve a safe design since it would violate the storage constraints for both the simulation and optimisation processes beginning in the near future when a sudden event of heavy pouring occurs the awareness necessary under the rcp 8 5 is to be more vigilant policymakers and reservoir managers are expected to develop a mitigation strategy in order to avoid fatalities and damage to public property fig 12 b indicated that reservoir optimisation utilising the hho resulted in the safest design and planning up to the year 2073 iv scenario 3 simulation vs simulation optimisation under rcps for mean temperature of water demand the trend line patterns depicted in figs 13 15 indicates that scenario 3 of both the reservoir optimisation and simulation accomplished in monthly average release curve and storage under the rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively for mean temperature water demand from 2020 to 2099 this is reflected by the findings in table 10 which demonstrates an inclining trend of average precipitation and mean temperature under the rcp 2 6 compared to the base period this suggests that when compared to the other two rcps the inflow under the rcp 2 6 produced a varied inflow state as a result the excessive release action for reservoir optimisation operations at the kgd under the rcp 2 6 may have appeared to be significantly more than it was during the base period as illustrated in fig 13 a the optimisation process in the hho despite this was still significantly closer to the mean temperature water demand than the simulation process in ann which produced the worst results of the entire release additionally as demonstrated in fig 13 b the storage at kgd was able to maintain its safety levels despite the fact that it failed in the mid future after several years the optimisation process in the hho held the reservoir storage level between the maximum and minimum storage levels from 2020 to 2077 but the simulation procedure in the ann violated the storage level in early 2021 fig 14 a depicts the average monthly discharge for mean temperature water demand under the rcp 4 5 the figure demonstrated that the simulation method resulted in excessive water releases but the optimisation process in the hho resulted in water releases that were exactly in accordance with the water demand trend line despite this fig 14 b demonstrated that the reservoir optimisation operation using the hho provided the safest design and planning as the storage level did not fail in any time zone throughout the year from near future to far future however the simulation process in the ann has breached the safety storage level since the beginning of the year 2021 as the level drops to the minimum storage level indicating that excessive releases caused negative storage and this would lead to the critical draught scenario to occur in the mid and far future as temperature was the main contributing factor under the rcp 4 5 as shown in table 10 fig 15 a and b depicted the same conditions that existed in maximum temperature water demand however when compared to the simulation process the optimisation process for the releases was shown to be critical this was because of the significant inflow event and mean temperature contribution as shown in table 10 with both conditions the reservoir may be unable to operate normally table 12 presents the periodic reliability results for the maximum and mean temperatures of water demand under the various rcp scenarios as scenario 2 and scenario 3 respectively the total number of releases ranges from near future to far future is 960 times 2020 2099 scenarios 2 demonstrated the incline trend of the shortage period under the rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively by getting 4 90 9 58 and 21 35 this result graphically highlighted the impact of the reservoir system in maximum temperature of water demand functioning under the rcps over an extended period of time additionally there is no obvious upward or downward trend for the aspect of shortage time in scenario 3 particularly under the rcp 8 5 no contribution of any percentage as well in meeting the exact water demand the major conclusion depicted in table 12 was the surplus period attaining the 100 under rcp 8 5 in scenario 3 this phenomenon implies that the reservoir received much more inflows than any other rcps event in scenario 3 as a result if this catastrophe occurs scenario 3 requires further attention especially under the rcp 8 5 furthermore in scenario 2 the rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 showed no significant change in the surplus period with 71 88 and 76 46 respectively however the rcp 8 5 indicated a decrease in the surplus event proportion with 61 15 additionally the rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 assigned a surplus event weighting of 71 77 and 3 54 respectively in scenario 3 overall table 12 demonstrated the reliability of meeting the exact water demand in scenario 2 is not optimal particularly under the rcp 4 5 where it achieved only 13 96 whereas 23 23 and 17 50 under the rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 respectively on the other hand scenario 3 periodic reliability was more persuasive at the rcp 4 5 reaching 93 54 whereas under the rcp 2 6 it was only capable of reaching 18 54 consequently the decision maker at kgd should be aware of these situations to minimise and be well prepared if future kgd operations face the concerns which closely related to scenarios 2 and 3 under all rcps the reservoir performance for maximum temperature of water demand shown in table 13 was set as scenario 2 the maximum temperature of water demand all the rcps experienced overall average of 34 20 storage failure in the optimisation process whereas an overall average of 97 33 storage failure in the simulation process for all the rcps respectively this indicates that the reservoir simulation results had the critical storage failure compared to the reservoir optimisation process thus optimisation in reservoir operation is essential for reservoir managers to understand the optimal operation of the reservoir and to minimise any unnecessary risk or loss during the operation period there were two criteria of evaluation in resilience metric the most significant results shown in table 13 were the resiliency under the rcp 8 5 the maximum water deficit occurred was happened for 205 months the results obtained in terms of average wsr the reservoir system under all the rcps obtained negative values for scenario 2 indicating reservoir system failure as evidenced by fig 10 b 12 b the least shortage index was happened under the rcp 8 5 with value of 0 0003 in scenario 2 table 14 depicts reservoir performance for mean temperature water demand in scenario 3 under the various rcp scenarios the average percentage of storage failure obtained for optimisation and simulation was 51 97 and 98 09 respectively furthermore under the rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 the resilience measures in scenario 3 showed negative values in average wsr this scenario produced a convincing result when analysed contemporaneously with fig 13 b 15 b which indicate that the reservoir system s storage would breach in a specific time as shown in the respective figures particularly under the rcp 8 5 where the reservoir system demonstrated zero month of water deficit as this provided information that the rcp 8 5 was facing surplus release in the very beginning of the near future whereas under the rcp 4 5 the average wsr showed a positive value and the shortest maximum duration of water deficit in 28 months also the least shortage index was happened under the rcp 4 5 in summary when tables 13 and 14 were compared in terms of vulnerability under the rcp 2 6 scenario 2 obtained 0 507 while scenario 3 obtained 0 534 indicating that the hho in scenario 2 performed slightly more robustly the similar condition scenario 2 showed more robustness than scenario 3 under the rcp 8 5 with value of 0 191 and 0 611 respectively however scenario 3 performed better than scenario 2 under the rcp 4 5 with values of 0 00177 and 0 478 respectively all reservoir simulation and optimisation processes are essentially informative and aid reservoir managers or policymakers in planning their reservoir system ahead of time 4 conclusions in this study the sim heuristic concepts were applied to examine several climate scenarios under the cmip5 for reservoir operating at the kgd to achieve reliable and accurate downscaling findings several gcms were integrated into an ensembly of gmcs the ann and svr poly kernel and radial basis functions were used to build a data driven downscaling approach with the svr poly kernel function the highest coefficient r attained during model training for the base period was 0 6201 table 6 shows with similar predictant that the r for ann and svr rbf kernel function were 0 4926 and 0 2841 respectively the predictant variables mean temperature maximum temperature and minimum temperature had the highest correlation in the svr poly kernel function at 0 5743 0 6926 and 0 6073 respectively the ann acquired the highest correlation during model training for solar radiation predictant variables model testing was performed for the base period to validate training results even though the r obtained in model training and testing indicated that the ann was more consistent than the other svr the downscaling results showed that the svr poly kernel function provided the most reliable performances in terms of the least error found in rmse and mae during the model testing processes during the base period as a result the svr poly kernel function was used to downscale under various rcps as indicated in table 7 the rainfall runoff was computed using following the hydrological procedure hp 11 2018 design flood hydrograph estimation for rural catchments in malaysia next empirical evaporation methods were conducted to validate the empirical evaporation results a comparison was made between the outperformed empirical evaporation method and forecast temperature based evaporation maximum minimum and mean temperature as scenario a and solar radiation and temperature based evaporation as scenario b for the evaporation methods the empirical turc radiation method was chosen for the following analysis of reservoir operation as the correlation was the highest among the methods and the evaporation obtained with the turc radiation method was more reliable and practical than the kharuffa method for this study area in malaysia as a tropical location scenario 1 is the base period water demand whereas scenarios 2 and 3 focus on maximum and mean temperature these are the main contributors because climate change could cause significant changes in water demand prior to the reservoir operation analysis benchmark tests were performed the best fitness level or accuracy level was then implemented in reservoir operation analysis the simulation and optimisation or sim heuristic of kgd reservoir operations was performed throughout two time periods a base period 1991 2005 and b future climatic scenario under rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 near future to far future from year 2020 2099 for both timelines the ann was used for simulation while the hho was used for reservoir optimisation scenario 3 achieved 93 54 of the exact demand under rcp 4 5 and had the lowest shortage index and duration of water deficit in rcp 4 5 scenario 3 the hho reservoir model was most effective the robustness of the hho was shown in various rcps under scenario 2 indicating its capabilities and functionality to solve reservoir operation under climatic impact tables 13 and 14 illustrate that storage constraints can be easily breached utilising reservoir simulation analyses despite the violation occurring in the mid future due to climate scenarios the reservoir optimisation study still capable of minimising the release deficit and managed storage efficiency in summary this study has demonstrated an investigation of the objectives to examine kgd operation under various rcps in cmip5 future studies should take into account other various metaheuristic optimisation algorithms e g whale optimisation algorithm and lévy flight rather than concentrating solely on reservoir simulation in order to validate these circumstances particularly future climatic change impact on reservoir operation due to the water demand changes will be the main significant concern using a minimum temperature in water demand or considering land use land cover change versus population would be among the options to further investigate the climate change impact onto the future kgd s operations a suitable evaporation method specific to the study area should also be considered at other study

2821,the steady overexploitation of the ogallala aquifer underlying the u s high plains region has put irrigated crop production at risk particularly in the southern and central high plains to manage this issue properly a data driven modeling framework is developed and tested that is fast to employ and yet provides reliable long term groundwater level gwl forecasts as a function of climatological and anthropogenic factors the modeling framework uses the random forests rf technique in combination with ordinary kriging and is tested in finney county in southwest kansas the introduction of groundwater withdrawal potential as a new surrogate for pumping intensity enables the rf model to capture decline in groundwater depletion rate as the system progresses towards aquifer depletion and or as a result of well retirement policies the rf model is executed from 2017 to 2099 for 20 different downscaled global climate models gcms for the two representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios of 4 5 and 8 5 the results show the aquifer will cease to support irrigated agriculture in most of the county by 2060 under status quo management and average climate conditions moreover climate will likely shift the aquifer s depletion time frame by 15 years or less in most of the study area the long term combined impact of well retirement plans and climate conditions on groundwater depletion trends imply well retirement policies do not lead to sustained groundwater savings this study demonstrates the capacity of machine learning models to serve as a rapid assessment tool informing policymakers about future groundwater availability in intensively irrigated regions and under different climate and management conditions keywords ogallala aquifer groundwater depletion machine learning irrigation climate change groundwater management data availability the python programming language scripts plus the required data for running the scripts are available on hydroshare at http www hydroshare org resource eefb75d6189940d0a683291600a81cfb 1 introduction many critical aquifers for irrigated agriculture are undergoing unsustainable depletion gleeson et al 2012 konikow 2015 the ogallala aquifer which consists of the neogene period ogallala formation is the dominant constituent of the high plains aquifer system with about 77 areal coverage of the whole system gutentag et al 1984 and is known as one of the largest and most heavily utilized freshwater aquifers worldwide gowda et al 2019 haacker et al 2019 in the ogallala aquifer groundwater is generally under unconfined conditions and crop and livestock production in the u s high plains region rely heavily on this exhaustible resource steward et al 2013 gowda et al 2019 the ogallala aquifer has been undergoing depletion since at least the middle of the 20th century gutentag et al 1984 scanlon et al 2012 mcguire 2017 and with current rates of extraction portions of the aquifer in the southern and central high plains will cease to support irrigated agriculture within the next few decades scanlon et al 2012 steward et al 2013 haacker et al 2016 deines et al 2020 compounding this challenge drought severity frequency and persistence are expected to increase with climate change throughout the high plains region harding and snyder 2012 amplifying groundwater demand to support crop production and likely shortening the timeline to depletion cotterman et al 2018 on the other hand the implementation of management strategies such as pumping reduction and water rights retirement could possibly extend the aquifer lifespan butler et al 2016 manning et al 2020 to manage this complex situation federal and state organizations as well as local groundwater management districts are interested in the possible impacts of climate change and conservation policies on future water levels and depletion time frames across the ogallala aquifer developing a tool capable of rapid long term forecasting of groundwater levels gwls as a function of climatological and anthropogenic factors at the regional scale i e county level is an important step forecasting tools include both physically based hydrologic models and data driven statistical models in contrast to physically based models that solve governing mass balance equations to simulate groundwater storage and flow in aquifer system data driven models use soft computing and machine learning ml techniques solomatine and ostfeld 2008 amaranto et al 2018 these techniques capture nonlinear hidden patterns in historical data and use those patterns to forecast future gwls in aquifers without imposing rules for any underlying physical processes sahoo et al 2017 and can be a suitable alternative to physically based models daliakopoulos et al 2005 adamowski and chan 2011 over the last two decades the number of studies using ml methods in gwl modeling has steadily increased due to their ease of application and relatively short run time along with desirable performance among different ml and soft computing techniques in groundwater modeling some of the more commonly used ones are artificial neural network ann guo et al 2021 anshuman and eldho 2022 hakim et al 2022 nourani et al 2022b extreme learning machine elm alizamir et al 2018 natarajan and sudheer 2020 genetic programming gp shiri and kişi 2011 fallah mehdipour et al 2013 and support vector machine svm yoon et al 2011 guzman et al 2019 mohapatra et al 2021 in addition to the widely used methods in gwl modeling the application of ensemble learning algorithms such as random forests rf amaranto et al 2018 sahoo et al 2018 wang et al 2018 koch et al 2019 gradient boosting machine gbm sharafati et al 2020 and extreme gradient boosting xgb rahman et al 2020 has become more popular in recent years while the number of studies regarding development and testing data driven models for accurate gwl forecasting at a monthly or sub monthly time step has increased in recent years rajaee et al 2019 only a few studies have attempted to utilize such models for either long term gwl prediction or the projection of groundwater depletion time frame haacker et al 2016 steward and allen 2016 salem et al 2018 however these existing studies either ignored the exogenous factors e g climate condition affecting future gwls or groundwater depletion rate was substantially smaller than in the case of the ogallala aquifer furthermore only a few studies to date have evaluated the impact of policy makers decisions on gwls using either data driven models feng et al 2008 or semi statistical water balance approaches butler et al 2020a a review of the literature reveals that ml has yet to be employed to assess the long term impacts of management strategies on groundwater resources considering climate variability in the work reported here we develop and evaluate a data driven modeling architecture for long term gwl forecasting in groundwater irrigated agricultural regions the main components of the architecture are an ensemble learning model and a geostatistical interpolation technique rf random forests and ordinary kriging respectively rf simulates annual gwl change in measurement points and these discrete gwl change forecasts are spatially distributed using kriging the combination of ml and geostatistical methods has been applied in a number of studies simulating gwl spatiotemporally nourani et al 2011 tapoglou et al 2014 however we include aquifer saturated thickness i e vertical distance from water table to bedrock and the number of active high production wells which have not been incorporated in previous studies enabling our model to capture decline in groundwater depletion rate as storage conditions evolve closer to complete depletion moreover the input data equip the model with the capability to quantify the impacts of water conservation policies namely well retirement plans on future gwls by employing the developed data driven modeling framework in an intensively irrigated area overlying the ogallala aquifer this study primarily aims to 1 introduce a new input variable named groundwater withdrawal potential gwwp which is the product of aquifer saturated thickness and number of active high production wells as a proxy for unavailable pumping data in long term gwl projections 2 evaluate the long term impacts of climatological factors on groundwater availability and depletion time frames and 3 assess the efficacy of well retirement policies in prolonging the lifetime of the aquifer under different climate conditions while the proposed modeling framework is tested for the ogallala aquifer in finney county in southwest kansas it can be applied to other stressed aquifers worldwide where groundwater pumping is a significant factor in gwl decline 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area finney county in southwest kansas is one of the most intensively irrigated areas across the high plains region owing to the great saturated thickness within the underlying ogallala aquifer fig 1 groundwater development in the county began before the 1940 s in garden city and surrounding areas to the north of the arkansas river over the next decades as a result of advances in irrigation and drilling technologies groundwater development rapidly expanded to the rest of the county and reached its peak in 1980 fig s1 and the video file in supplementary material according to the water information management and analysis system wimas kansas geological survey 2019a 2534 irrigation wells were active in finney county in 1980 and between 24 and 31 of the county s area has been irrigated since then there are some areas along the arkansas river and mainly northwest of garden city that historically were irrigated by diverting water from the river into unlined irrigation ditches fig 1b and c however the river went dry in the region in the early 2000 s leading to the dependence of ditch service areas on groundwater as the main source of irrigation the ogallala aquifer in finney county has been over exploited over the past several decades resulting in nearly 30 m decrease in average saturated thickness between 1952 and 2017 unsustainable groundwater withdrawals high dependence on the aquifer for irrigated agriculture and the implementation of the conservation reserve enhancement program crep have drawn researchers attention to finney county in recent years rouhi rad et al 2020 xiang et al 2020 the reason for selecting finney county as our study region in addition to already mentioned reasons is the abundance of annual gwl measurements from a network of 165 wells fig 1c the high variability of saturated thickness across the county area providing the opportunity to train the model with data in a variety of depletion stages and the availability of geologic data from well logs moreover we do not expect a significant increase in the number of high production wells in the future due to the decreasing trend of active high production wells in the county since 1980 supplementary material fig s1 making long term gwl projections more reliable 2 2 random forests model development in this study the rf technique is used to forecast gwl variations and subsequently gwl values i e water table elevation values in measurement points the rf method is selected because despite its relatively simple structure and ease of calibration it is resistant to outliers noise and redundant data and can handle complex data of different statistical distributions with no need for data scaling breiman 2001 rodriguez galiano et al 2014 tyralis et al 2019 moreover as suggested by galelli and castelletti 2013 the rf method can be used directly for input ranking thanks to its intrinsic ability to quantify the relative importance of input variables we have leveraged this capability of the rf technique to find the best subset of input variables without using any external algorithms moreover the internal measurement of input variable importance makes the rf models more comprehensible compared to other black box ml models such as svm rahman et al 2020 here we present steps taken toward rf model development and evaluation 2 2 1 random forests random forests rf is an ensemble learning algorithm introduced by breiman 2001 for both classification and regression problems the rf method employs an ensemble of classification and regression trees carts breiman et al 1984 using bootstrapping and bagging methods breiman 1996 to rectify the overfitting problem of individual trees attributed to their excessive flexibility biau and scornet 2016 since gwl forecasting is a regression problem the developed rf model in our study consists of an ensemble of single regression trees in each regression tree the bootstrapped sample of the original dataset is recursively partitioned at a series of internal split nodes each node is split into two subsets of data called child nodes by a split value at each node the algorithm searches through a random subset of input variables features to find the best split leading to minimum impurity in resultant child nodes to calculate impurity at each node the algorithm fits a constant regression model to the data and computes regression error the constant value is calculated as the mean of target variables labels at each node and the common measure for regression error is mean square error mse the best split at each node is found by maximizing the information gain g which is defined as the difference between parent node s impurity and the weighted sum of child nodes impurity 1 g q m θ h q m n l n m h q l n r n m h q r where q represents dataset at each node θ represents the candidate split h is impurity function n represents the size of dataset at each node m denotes parent node l denotes left child node and r represents right child node the impurity function h at node m is defined as 2 h q m 1 n m y q m y y m 2 where y denotes target variables and y m is the mean of target variables at node m the same process is repeated for each child node and each tree keeps growing until a stopping criterion is reached loh 2011 at terminal leaf nodes the output of rf is the arithmetic average aggregation of all trees outputs in this study the scikit learn library pedregosa et al 2011 of the python programming language is used to construct the rf model 2 2 2 data description and input variable selection annual gwl measurements in finney county spanning from 1980 to 2017 were obtained from the wizard water well levels database kansas geological survey 2019b in addition to all gwl measurement points in finney county we included a few points located within the immediate proximity of the county border to increase forecast accuracy in boundary areas fig 1c since the target variable is gwl variations gwl measurements were converted to annual gwl changes for water years 1980 to 2016 we have considered water year october through september instead of calendar year for our analysis as it starts with the aquifer recovery period october through april and ends with the irrigation period may through september gwl data were filtered in a three step process first gwl measurements during the irrigation period were ignored as they are prone to drawdown effects from pumping multiple measurements from a single well in the recovery period were averaged to provide one estimate per well for each water year second gwl changes beyond 1 96 standard deviations from the mean incorporating all gwl variation data were considered as outliers and removed third the investigation of available satellite based data deines et al 2019 earth resources observation and science eros center 2020 reveals the majority of croplands in the study area were converted to center pivots by 1980 with the exception of the croplands located within the irrigation ditch companies service area marked by red polygon in fig 1c in this region groundwater irrigated agriculture using center pivots has become prevalent since 2003 therefore all pre 2003 gwl variations in this region were excluded due to inconsistency in irrigation system as well as irrigation water source emphasizing the importance of historical analysis in data driven modeling efforts after the three steps of filtering 2 438 annual gwl change records from 165 wells were available for training and testing the rf model the number of records in individual wells ranged from 2 to 37 with a median of 12 based on previous knowledge of the groundwater system in the study area we initially incorporated a wide range of input variables into the rf model that could possibly affect gwls on annual basis table 1 presents the list of initial input variables their importance rank time scale category and the source of basic data used to obtain quantify them some of the input variables are among the most commonly used input variables in previous gwl forecasting studies as indicated by rajaee et al 2019 that is to say groundwater depth gwd water year total precipitation p average daily mean temperature in irrigation season t and water year mean river flow f the gwd is an indicator of groundwater depletion intensity the p is a measure of soil moisture replenishment and groundwater recharge the t represents soil moisture loss through evapotranspiration and the f is a measure of aquifer recharge through the infiltration of a portion of stream flow if there is any into the river bed and banks the rest of the variables have either never been considered or been considered in a few studies to date and will be briefly explained here in agricultural regions pumping significantly influences gwl variations and should be included as a model input however pumping data is seldom available in these regions in lieu of unavailable groundwater extraction data previous studies have attempted to use other variables as a proxy for pumping such as irrigation demand of major crops sahoo et al 2017 salem et al 2018 amaranto et al 2019 in the current study we introduce groundwater withdrawal potential gwwp as a new measure of pumping intensity that can be calculated at gwl measurement point i as follows 3 gwwp b i w i where b i is saturated thickness at location i and w i is the number of active high production wells within a 3000 m radius of i the radius value was selected through a search of values ranging from 50 to 3500 m a given well is considered as high production if it is being used for irrigation industrial or municipal demands the status of high production wells during the 1980 2016 period was obtained by analyzing water rights data we evaluated the relevance of the gwwp compared to b and w by constructing an rf model with these three inputs and measuring their impurity based importance the term of impurity based importance will be explained later in this section the results show the superiority of the gwwp with the importance value of 0 49 over b and w with the importance value of 0 40 and 0 11 respectively since well capacity defined as the maximum pumping rate that could be sustained throughout the irrigation season is partly a function of aquifer saturated thickness harman 1966 one may interpret the gwwp as an indicator of total maximum pumping rate in the vicinity of a given gwl measurement point while the gwwp represents regional groundwater extraction intensity distance to the closest active high production well dcw is included to capture the local impacts of pumping the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 is a normalized drought index that fits aggregated differences between monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet to a three parameter log logistic distribution to quantify departures from normal conditions and has been used in the u s great plains region zambreski et al 2018 we already have considered the t and the p as two climatic variables but neither is able to solely represent soil moisture deficit which is a determinant of pumping intensity in each year on the other hand afshar et al 2022 have shown the spei has a high correlation with a soil moisture drought index namely the standardized soil moisture index ssmi in the u s high plains therefore the spei can be used as an indicator of soil moisture deficit in our study area moreover the spei has been utilized as a surrogate for total annual pumping in a recent data driven gwl modeling study in the southern high plains of texas and had the highest relative contribution among the model inputs ghaseminejad and uddameri 2020 in the current study gridded estimates of historical monthly accumulated precipitation and pet based on the penman monteith methodology were retrieved from gridmet abatzoglou 2013 for the 1980 2016 period these variables were used to derive the spei with the aggregation time step of three months spei 3 at each grid cell since the spei 3 is more closely related to agricultural drought zambreski et al 2018 we used the gridded spei 3 values to get water year mean spei wy as well as irrigation period s mean spei irr of the spei 3 at gwl measurement points from 1980 to 2016 the spei irr is a measure of crop irrigation demand whereas the spei wy represents soil moisture depletion and replenishment mechanisms throughout a given water year the state of kansas has a comprehensive database of well logs kansas geological survey 2019c therefore we examined the relevance of hydrogeological parameters in data driven gwl models by incorporating aquifer specific yield at gwl sy as a model input since such category of data has been considered only in a few studies tsanis et al 2008 koch et al 2019 to estimate sy we compiled a well log dataset of 603 boreholes in finney county and its vicinity supplementary material fig s2a initially the well logs were used to make the bedrock elevation raster which is required for the calculation of saturated thickness at gwl measurement points supplementary material fig s2a additionally we used the well logs along with historical water table elevation rasters to estimate sy at each borehole from 1980 to 2016 by finding the lithology layers located within the gwl 2 35 gwl 1 08 interval and calculating the interval s weighted average specific yield based on the suggested values in liu et al 2010 the values of 2 35 and 1 08 correspond to the 2 5th and 97 5th percentiles of historical gwl changes distribution respectively the sy values were then interpolated using ordinary kriging with an exponential semivariogram model to generate gridded estimates of sy supplementary material fig s2b see section 2 3 for more details on kriging the resultant grids were used to estimate sy at gwl measurement points sy calculations were performed using the python arcpy package while the rf method is susceptible to low dimensional rather than high dimensional input data wang et al 2018 it is appropriate to reduce high dimensionality by finding the most relevant input variables we have used the rf algorithm to rank the input variables and consequently have selected the best subset of them in the rf algorithm the total information gain g see eq 1 attained by each input variable in a given tree is normalized by total g at all nodes of the tree resulting in a feature s relative importance in a single tree the relative importance of each feature in the rf model is obtained by averaging a feature s relative importance in all individual trees this measure of feature importance is called the impurity based importance we have selected the best subset of input variables through an iterative process in this process an rf model with 500 trees was constructed and trained using historical data from 1980 to 2011 at each iteration and the feature with the least impurity based importance was omitted from the succeeding iteration since our single goal during the input variable selection process was to quantify the relative importance of model inputs the rf models were parameterized in such a way that all available input variables at a given iteration were explored to find the best split at each node rather than searching through a random subset of them the procedure was repeated until all remaining input variables attained an impurity based importance value of greater than or equal to 0 1 which was met in the fourth iteration fig s3 in supplementary material the final input variables are gwwp spei irr gwd p spei wy and sy table 1 we selected an annual time step for the rf model with the assumption that input variables influence gwl change within the same time step thereby removing the need to perform the time lag analysis of input variables as has been performed in previous studies e g amaranto et al 2019 the gwl forecasting scheme of the rf model in this study is the one step ahead forecasting approach i e the model utilizes input data in year t to forecast gwl change in year t and subsequently gwl value in year t 1 2 2 3 random forests model training testing and evaluation the common procedure in constructing data driven gwl models is that a separate model is built and calibrated for each gwl measurement point with a long record of historical data sahoo et al 2017 amaranto et al 2019 while this procedure yields high levels of accuracy at measurement points it ignores a considerable portion of measured data at wells with a rather short record of gwl measurements the procedure also leads to noticeable interpolation errors in creating gridded gwl data due to the scarcity of long record wells moreover the rf model needs to be trained with a wide range of gwwp values in order to capture decline in groundwater depletion rate as the system evolves closer to complete depletion therefore in this study historical model inputs and outputs at all gwl measurement points are lumped together and a single rf model is developed for all the points the historical data were split into the two temporal periods of training 1980 to 2011 and testing 2012 to 2016 the training dataset was used to construct and calibrate the rf model the k fold cross validation technique k 10 was adopted to calibrate the model hyperparameters and bias and root mean square error rmse were used as model performance metrics in cross validation the hyperparameters chosen for calibration were the number of trees the number of input variables considered at each split the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node and the minimum number of samples required to be at a terminal node with the final values of 600 2 4 and 2 respectively after training and calibration the rf model performance is independently examined by running the model for the testing period and comparing its outputs with measured data via four different model performance metrics namely bias root mean square error rmse the pearson correlation coefficient r and the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 in model testing we only consider gwl measurement points with available records over the entire testing period that is to say 52 points in total the performance metrics are calculated based on the two categories of residuals defined as the modeled gwl subtracted from the measured gwl namely discrete and cumulative residuals the metrics calculated based on discrete residuals measure model performance in one year ahead gwl forecasting i e model performance in each year is independent of its performance in previous years on the other hand the metrics computed based on cumulative residuals demonstrate the long term forecast capabilities of the model since errors in a given year will propagate into the next years the performance metrics were computed for the rf model as well as a set of simpler data driven models that is to say multiple linear regression mlr multiple 2nd order non linear regression mnlr 2nd and multiple 3rd order non linear regression mnlr 3rd in addition to these simpler techniques we developed and calibrated an svm model which is a robust and commonly used ml method in gwl modeling and compared its performance with the rf model all these additional modeling techniques were used as reference points for the evaluation of the rf model s forecast skill in the testing period to develop the svm model the input variables were scaled to have unit variance and zero mean except for spei irr and spei wy which are scaled intrinsically similar to recent gwl forecasting studies amaranto et al 2018 rahman et al 2020 radial basis function kernel is selected for the svm model the svm model was calibrated using the grid search cross validation technique and by finding the values of three hyperparameters namely cost epsilon and gamma we employed the scikit learn library pedregosa et al 2011 of the python programming language to develop and calibrate the svm model the details of the svm method are presented in vapnik 1999 to further evaluate the rf model performance we compared annual reported total groundwater use in the county kansas geological survey 2019a with model estimated annual decrease in total groundwater storage the rf model outputs along with the ordinary kriging technique can be used to generate gridded saturated thickness values as well as gridded weighted average specific yield values of all lithology layers located below gwl these two grids then can be used to estimate total groundwater storage v in the study area as follows 4 v c 1 c n b c sy c δ x δ y where b c is saturated thickness in cell c sy c represents weighted average specific yield in cell c n denotes the total number of cells δ x is cell size in x direction and δ y is cell size in y direction 2 2 4 relative importance of input variables we quantified the relative importance of input variables via the two approaches of impurity based see section 2 2 2 and permutation based feature importance to understand underlying non linear interactions between model inputs and outputs the impurity based importance values were derived from the calibrated rf model where a random subset of features with a size of two was considered at each tree node to find the best split the permutation based feature importance is defined as decrease in a model s skill score caused by random permutation of a given input variable or a group of variables for a number of times while the rest of the input variables are left intact therefore the more important a feature the greater decrease in model s skill score to compute the permutation based importance values we randomly permutated each input variable 50 times and computed the average relative increase in the mean square error mse value of the training dataset using the k fold cross validation technique k 10 we also collectively permuted the climatic variables namely p spei irr and spei wy to estimate their joint importance incorporating the k fold technique enables us to quantify the influence of input variables on gwl forecasts made using unseen data during the model training 2 3 long term groundwater level projections after rf model development and evaluation the model was trained for the last time using all historical data from 1980 to 2016 then the finalized rf model was employed in combination with ordinary kriging to forecast future annual gwl changes from 2017 to 2099 under various climate and management scenarios kriging is applied as a best linear unbiased estimator to create smooth and continuous rasters isaaks and srivastava 1989 we select ordinary kriging since it is a well known geostatistical interpolation technique and has been employed along with ml models for gwl projection in previous studies nourani et al 2011 tapoglou et al 2014 chang et al 2016 the geostatistical wizard tool in arcmap was used to determine kriging parameters namely semivariogram model type lag size major range partial sill nugget and search radius features these parameters were estimated based on kriging s rmse computed using the leave one out cross validation technique 2 3 1 modeling framework for long term groundwater level projections the modeling framework developed for spatiotemporal gwl forecasting in the long term is shown in fig 2 the calibrated and trained rf model is the backbone of this modeling framework the input variables of the rf model can be broadly classified into two groups according to their update mechanism the first group includes climatic variables derived from downscaled climate projections namely p spei irr and spei wy these variables are estimated ahead of long term simulations and will not be affected by model outputs the second group consists of input variables that are a function of gwl and vary with changes in gwl namely sy gwwp and gwd unlike the first group the second group of variables is updated dynamically during the entire simulation period as a result of annual gwl variations the rf model uses the input variables to forecast annual gwl change at measurement points the rf model outputs are then post processed through a series of steps yielding a number of secondary outputs in the first step of post processing the gwl changes in measurement points are interpolated using ordinary kriging with a gaussian semivariogram model in the next step the gwl raster is updated for the next water year by adding the gwl change raster to the current year s gwl raster the saturated thickness raster is then updated by subtracting the bedrock elevation raster from the updated gwl raster the updated gwl raster is also used to update sy values at borehole locations which are then interpolated to update the sy raster for the next water year using ordinary kriging with an exponential semivariogram model see section 2 2 2 for more details on computing sy value at boreholes updating the status of high production wells is the last step in the post processing of the rf model outputs in this study two deactivation criteria are considered for high production wells a non irrigation well becomes inactive when saturated thickness drops below 1 m i e well goes dry whereas an irrigation well becomes inactive if saturated thickness drops below 9 m i e well ceases to support irrigated crop production due to low well capacity schloss et al 2000 rawling and rinehart 2019 the rf model outputs together with the secondary outputs are used to update the gwl dependent input variables for the next water year the whole modeling workflow is carried out through a set of python programming language scripts developed for the current study incorporating the scikit learn library pedregosa et al 2011 and the arcpy package 2 3 2 climate projections statistically downscaled gridded monthly precipitation and pet from 20 global climate models gcms of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 were used to derive future projections of p spei irr and spei wy with the spatial resolution of 4 km abatzoglou and brown 2012 taylor et al 2012 the grid cell values were then extracted at gwl measurement points to be used as the rf model inputs the downscaling technique employed was the multivariate adapted constructed analogs maca procedure which has the advantages of computational efficiency higher accuracy than simple interpolation approaches and preservation of the first principles of meteorology through joint downscaling measures abatzoglou and brown 2012 zhang et al 2022 daily maximum and minimum temperature wind velocity precipitation and solar radiation were downscaled during this process for the baseline period historical observations from gridmet abatzoglou 2013 were used for downscaling the projection data the maca first applies the bias correction technique of quantile mapping to adjust the mean and variance of the gcm daily data to gridmet using the projected and historical runs followed by an epoch adjustment to remove the potential of finding no analog in the historical period next the best analog is identified using thirty predictor patterns centered around a 45 day window on each calendar date this analog procedure is conducted jointly for temperature and dew point to improve coherence between downscaled fields whereas wind velocity and precipitation are downscaled individually epoch adjustments are reintroduced and quantile mapping is performed again to ensure statistical moments are consistent with observations the daily value s obtained after quantile mapping is the final downscaled daily variable parameter estimates for the log logistic distribution in the spei calculations were calibrated using the downscaled data from 1980 to 2016 and applied similarly for the projection period from 2017 to 2099 at each grid cell because of uncertainties in future trajectory of greenhouse gas ghg emissions gcm projections for two different representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios namely rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 are included in this study see table s1 in supplementary material for a list of all gcms considered in the current study along with their resolution and corresponding institution 2 3 3 long term groundwater level projections under different climate and management scenarios the developed modeling framework together with the downscaled climate projections are leveraged to evaluate the long term impacts of climate variability and changes on future gwls and groundwater availability in the study area the modeling framework is executed for 40 different climate scenarios from 2017 to 2099 i e 20 gcms and 2 rcps in addition to running the model for climate scenarios under status quo management condition five different hypothetical well retirement plans are defined and reflected in gwwp values namely 10 20 30 40 and 50 retirement plans the 10 retirement plan involves the random selection of 10 of active irrigation wells at the beginning of the projection period and their uniform deactivation over a 10 year period i e 2021 2030 this plan is converted into the other plans through augmenting the initial 10 well retirement by 10 increments during the same deactivation period to assess the integrated effects of climatological and regulatory factors we run the model for a combination of six management and two climate scenarios i e a total of 12 scenarios from 2017 to 2099 the five hypothetical retirement plans plus one no action plan i e baseline constitute the management scenarios the well retirement plans are hypothetical which means neither their political acceptability nor economic consequence is studied here since we want to evaluate well retirement plans under two different climate conditions the climate scenarios are derived from the average of gcms projections for rcp 4 5 and for rcp 8 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 random forests model testing and evaluation 3 1 1 random forests model performance in testing period fig 3 a presents the performance metrics of the rf model along with the svm model and other three simpler models in this figure all the metrics that correspond to discrete residuals are obtained through averaging the metrics of individual gwl measurement points the bias and the rmse values that correspond to cumulative residuals are computed based on cumulative residual values in 2016 in all the measurement points these residuals in fact compare the position of modeled gwls versus measured values at the end of the testing period the comparison of the rf model with the svm model shows that the rf model outperforms the svm model with respect to all metrics fig 3a additionally the rf model consistently has the best performance based on all metrics except for the bias compared to the three simpler models the positive value of bias indicates either underestimation of gwl decline or overestimation of gwl rise and conversely negative value of bias indicates either overestimation of gwl decline or underestimation of gwl rise considering the characteristics of the study area bias values reveal that all models tend to underestimate gwl decline in the testing period except for the mnlr 3rd model the distribution of cumulative residuals at the end of the testing period fig 3b reveals that the extraordinary low bias value of the mnlr 3rd model is attributable to large negative residuals in a few gwl measurement points in the rf model 87 of gwl measurement points have a cumulative residual within the range of 1 75 m with the mean value i e bias of 0 10 m whereas in the mnlr 3rd model 73 of cumulative residuals fall within the same range with the mean value of 0 13 m this comparison shows the balanced performance of the rf model in the vast majority of the measurement points the better performance of the rf model compared to the svm model which is a robust ml technique in gwl modeling as well as the simpler methods provides further justification for the selection of the rf technique in this study the cumulative residuals of the rf model at the end of the testing period with rmse 1 59 m is comparable with the values attained by sahoo et al 2017 in the ogallala aquifer for the testing period of 2003 to 2012 where a majority of cumulative residuals in the last year fell within 2 m it should be noted that in the referenced study a separate highly parametrized ml model with pre processed input data i e a hybrid ann model was developed and calibrated for each individual monitoring well resulting in slightly better performance of their models in comparison with our rf model to investigate the performance of the rf model in each testing year a time series of discrete residuals distributions is depicted in fig 3c acknowledging a slight general tendency for the underestimation of gwl declines the distributions of residuals suggest fairly unbiased gwl forecasts in all the years except 2012 which is the second driest year after 2011 in terms of spei irr and spei wy during the 1980 2016 period the extreme dry condition in 2011 and 2012 corresponds to the southern u s drought that affected large parts of the country in the 2010 2012 period biased gwl forecasts in 2012 can be attributed to this drought in fact the prolonged extreme dry condition led to soil moisture depletion forcing the farmers to heavily rely on groundwater for crop production in this year since the rf model has not been trained with such an unprecedented dry condition it underestimates gwl declines in the majority of cases in 2012 the reduced accuracy of data driven gwl models under climate extremes is not unique to this study ghaseminejad and uddameri 2020 nourani et al 2022b in addition to the temporal evaluation a spatial analysis of the rf model s performance metrics calculated based on cumulative residuals provides a better picture of the model s capabilities for long term gwl projections and also reveals possible spatial anomalies in model performance fig 4 the value of bias is within 0 50 m in 52 of the points is greater than 0 50 m in 33 of the points and is less than 0 50 m in 15 of the points this implies the rf model generally underestimates gwl declines during the testing period it can be seen that 60 of the points have a rmse value of less than 0 75 m while only 10 of the points have a rmse value of greater than 2 m the r value is greater than 0 9 and 0 5 in 63 and 79 of the points respectively in 42 of the points the kge is greater than 0 7 while it is greater than 0 5 in 63 of the points the kge may not seem satisfactory in 37 of the points with values less than 0 5 however the value of kge is greater than 0 41 in 88 of the points suggesting that the model s overall performance is significantly better than the mean values knoben et al 2019 in the vast majority of points the comparison of these results with the performance metrics of an integrated space time ann ist ann model ghaseminejad and uddameri 2020 implies the adequate performance of the rf model taking into account the simplicity of development and calibration there is no spatial trend in the values of bias and rmse fig 4 however a spatial pattern can be detected in the r and the kge with clustered regions of low metric values the regions located along the aquifer boundary on the northeast of the county as well as the regions in the northwest of the county are overlying portions of the aquifer with small saturated thickness less than 20 m due to small well capacity values in these regions groundwater extraction for irrigation is not as intensive as the rest of the county leading to noisy gwl fluctuations because of such noisy behavior the difference between measured and modeled variance increases leading to decreased values of r and kge in these regions on the other hand the bias and the rmse metrics indicate good overall performance in these regions suggesting these two metrics could be misleading in regions characterized by small range of gwls nourani et al 2022b the diminished performance of ml models due to noisy gwl fluctuations has been reported in previous studies for shallow wells rakhshandehroo et al 2018 and regions with shallower gwls and less pumping intensities sharafati et al 2020 to look at the rf model performance from a totally different perspective the annual decrease in total groundwater storage forecasted by the model see eq 4 is compared with annual groundwater use in finney county from 2012 to 2016 fig 5 due to the absolute dominance of the groundwater sink term i e groundwater withdrawal in the study area the groundwater storage variations and annual groundwater use data are appropriately correlated with r 0 9858 3 1 2 random forests model sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis of the rf model is carried out through the quantification of input variables contribution using the two approaches of impurity based fig 6 a and permutation based fig 6b feature importance see section 2 2 4 all input variables have the same ranking in both approaches gwwp is the most important variable followed by gwd spei irr p spei wy and sy earning the highest ranking of model inputs by the gwwp underscores the combined impact of two neglected variables in previous studies namely saturated thickness and the number of active high production wells on gwl variations in an intensively irrigated region we note that saturated thickness and depth to groundwater table the former corresponding to gwwp and the latter representing gwd are among the most influential irrigation drivers in western kansas lamb et al 2021 both gwwp and gwd are indicators of groundwater development intensity i e degree of pumping establishment across the study area offering a process based justification for their top ranking the climatic variables in the current study i e spei irr p and spei wy are believed to only have indirect impacts on gwls due to deep gwls and intensively irrigated agriculture in aquifers with deep gwls the direct impacts of climatological factors on gwls through influencing groundwater recharge rates can be dominated by their indirect impacts affecting irrigation demands russo and lall 2017 the higher importance of spei irr than spei wy also implies the indirect impacts of climatic variables as the spei irr likely affect irrigation water demand more substantially the joint permutation based importance of climatic variables c in fig 6b reveals the collective role of these variables in the rf model however the c is still dominated by the gwwp the sy has the least importance value among the input variables which is likely due to the absolute dominance of groundwater extraction over gwl variations in the study area as represented directly and indirectly by the rest of the inputs another possible reason could be inaccurate sy estimates arising from interpolation errors and or approximate representation of lithology layers in well log data butler et al 2020b tsanis et al 2008 also incorporated sy as an additional feature in their ann model and noticed slight improvement in their model performance the impurity based feature importance approach is prone to overfitting i e it tends to overestimate the importance of features that do not actually contribute to model outputs but are being utilized for overfitting during model training on the other hand the permutation based importance values are computed using unseen data during the training thus the constancy of input variables ranking implies that none of the input variables cause overfitting during the rf model training 3 2 long term projections 3 2 1 climatic variables projections the spatially averaged historical from 1980 to 2016 and projected from 2017 to 2099 values of the rf model s climatic input variables are presented in fig 7 the comparison of projected variables with historical records shows the percentage of projected data that exceed the historical range is 15 14 and 9 for p spei irr and spei wy in rcp 4 5 respectively and is 14 16 and 20 for p spei irr and spei wy in rcp 8 5 respectively therefore it can be inferred that the rf model is not extrapolating gwl variations with respect to climatic inputs in most cases of future climate scenarios a decreasing temporal trend is noticeable in the projected values of spei irr and spei wy for rcp 8 5 implying the negative impacts of ghg emissions on drought conditions in the study area the spei ranges within 3 with negative values indicating drier than normal climatic conditions and positive values indicating wetter than normal conditions we use the ensemble mean of gcms projections to assess the impact of two different climate conditions on well retirement policies the ensemble mean of gcms projections for rcp 4 5 constitutes the rcp 4 5 ensemble mean climate scenario with the average value of 489 mm 0 42 and 0 71 for p spei irr and spei wy during the projection period respectively the ensemble mean of gcms for rcp 8 5 forms the rcp 8 5 ensemble mean climate scenario with the average value of 474 mm 0 75 and 0 96 for p spei irr and spei wy respectively 3 2 2 long term groundwater level projections under various climate conditions to better analyze the rf model s long term forecasts at individual gwl measurement points under different climate scenarios we select six measurement points and plot saturated thickness variations at each point fig 8 these simulations are done under business as usual condition with no shifts in irrigation technology crop choices cultivars and or water use regulations the selected gwl measurement points represent a wide range of saturated thickness values at the beginning of the projection period the reason for presenting the forecasted values in the form of saturated thickness rather than gwl is that saturated thickness provides a more complete assessment of groundwater availability the ensemble means of saturated thickness forecasts for rcp 4 5 and for rcp 8 5 present the overall trend of groundwater depletion in each emission scenario at the selected gwl measurement points fig 8b saturated thickness forecasts at all the points except point 6 clearly show a decreasing trend in depletion rate as the system progresses towards aquifer depletion representing the s shaped logistic curve as suggested by steward et al 2013 the rf model s capability to capture this decreasing trend is obtained through introducing the gwwp as an input variable deactivating wells as a result of groundwater depletion and training the model with all historical data across the study area corresponding to different depletion stages the different depletion mechanism at point 6 can be attributed to noisy gwl fluctuations as a result of insignificant groundwater withdrawals in regions with small saturated thickness and low well density these regions have witnessed a rise in gwls in 2011 which has been the driest year since 1980 with respect to all three climatic variables in the study area we ascribe this phenomenon to producers decision to switch from irrigated to either dryland rain fed or no crop production during abnormally dry conditions in regions where pumping is not heavily established due to low well capacity values such decisions are manifested in a sudden increase in saturated thickness at point 6 in years after 2070 under one specific climate scenario namely the ipsl cm5a mr gcm model for rcp 8 5 being characterized by extreme dry conditions in years succeeding 2070 these results show the rf model holds promise for capturing spatiotemporal heterogeneities in producers irrigation decisions based on historical data although there is no guarantee that the producers make the same decisions in future on the other hand a physically based groundwater model cannot simulate such heterogeneities unless coupled with an agent based agro economic model e g mod at rouhi rad et al 2020 to compare groundwater availability under different climate scenarios in a spatially lumped manner we calculate total groundwater storage in the study area see eq 4 from 2017 to 2099 for each climate scenario fig 9 the results indicate the total volume of water in storage decreases by more than 87 by the end of the century in all climate scenarios however each scenario affects groundwater depletion differently fig 9a for example in the climate scenario correspondent to the ipsl cm5a mr gcm model for rcp 8 5 despite rapid depletion in the first half of the projection period groundwater storage starts increasing in years after 2070 due to the cessation of irrigated agriculture during severe drought events in regions with small saturated thickness and low well density the ensemble means of projected groundwater storage values for rcp 4 5 and for rcp 8 5 imply that ghg emissions slightly affect groundwater availability in the study area fig 9b this can be attributed to the fact that the negative impact of ghg emissions which is manifested in decreasing trend of projected spei values for rcp 8 5 becomes significant in the second half of the century that is to say in the years after 2040 fig 7b and c by that time total groundwater storage declines by more than 37 in all scenarios indicating approximately half of the total volume loss occurs without being significantly affected by ghg emissions moreover extreme dry conditions in years after 2040 will not likely lead to drastic gwl declines because of groundwater withdrawal constraints caused by reduced well capacities to evaluate the impacts of climatological factors on groundwater availability in a spatially distributed manner we analyze the rasters of projected saturated thickness from 2017 to 2099 obtained through running the rf model for different climate scenarios developed based on individual gcms in each year and for each rcp scenario we compute the minimum maximum and ensemble mean of projected saturated thickness values at each grid cell figs s4 s6 in supplementary material the ensemble mean rasters of projected saturated thickness show the majority of the aquifer s domain in finney county will become depleted i e saturated thickness drops below 9 m by 2060 in both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios fig 10 a the minimum maximum and ensemble mean rasters of projected saturated thickness are used to estimate the aquifer s depletion time frame spatially by finding the first year when saturated thickness drops below 9 m at each cell fig 10b the depletion time frame rasters clearly show the extent of impact of climatological factors on groundwater availability across the study area the majority of the aquifer s extent in the county will become depleted by 2050 2060 and 2070 under minimum mean and maximum saturated thickness conditions respectively in both rcps to quantify the impact of climatological factors on groundwater depletion time frame we calculate the difference of depletion time frames under minimum and maximum saturated thickness conditions for each rcp fig 10c those regions that will become depleted after the projection period i e years after 2099 are excluded from this spatial analysis the results imply climate plays an important role in groundwater availability in regions with small saturated thickness and low well density i e regions located along the already depleted areas on the northeast of the county in these regions climatological factors can shift the depletion time frame by more than 25 years on the other hand groundwater availability in the rest of the county especially central and southern parts with larger saturated thickness and higher well density is less affected by climate as a result of more intensive groundwater withdrawals overall the depletion time frame in the majority of the study area will be shifted by 15 years or less in both rcps due to uncertainties in future climatic variables in this study we ignore uncertainties in gridded saturated thickness data arising from interpolation errors 3 2 3 long term groundwater level projections under several combined management and climate conditions to assess and present the rf model s ability to properly capture well retirement effects under a variety of conditions three gwl measurement points are selected and their saturated thickness variation in all scenarios is plotted fig 11 the results at point 1 where initial saturated thickness is large and retired wells density is high show that the retirement plans significantly affect groundwater depletion trends and prolong the aquifer s lifetime the higher the well retirement percentage the more positive impacts with respect to the aquifer s sustainability on the other hand at point 2 with similar initial saturated thickness value to point 1 but lower well retirement density the impacts of the retirement plans on groundwater depletion become less significant at both of these points the effectiveness of the retirement plans diminishes under the rcp 8 5 ensemble mean climate scenario as a result of increase in the severity of dry events in years after 2040 due to the negative impact of ghg emissions fig 7b and c at point 3 where initial saturated thickness is small and well retirement density is quite high the retirement plans have negligible impacts on depletion trends in either climate scenario emphasizing the importance of initial saturated thickness in conservation policies success foster et al 2017 the impact of the well retirement plans on groundwater availability in the entirety of finney county is inspected through computing total groundwater storage see eq 4 from 2017 to 2099 in different management and climate scenarios fig 12 a see figs s7 s12 in supplementary material for projected saturated thickness rasters under different combined management and climate scenarios the results show even with 50 well retirement the aquifer will lose 87 and 93 of its total water in storage by the end of the century under the rcp 4 5 ensemble mean and the rcp 8 5 ensemble mean climate scenarios respectively therefore well retirement policies do not lead to sustained groundwater savings in the county to better understand and compare the temporal effects of the retirement plans on groundwater sustainability total water saving in each scenario is computed as a percentage of total groundwater storage at the beginning of the projection period fig 12b the groundwater saving period starts with the initiation of well retirements in 2021 and lasts until total water saving peaks in a year within the 2054 2065 period depending on the retirement and climate scenarios after hitting the peak total water saving starts declining as a result of higher groundwater extraction rates in the retirement scenarios compared to the no action scenario in the second half of the century groundwater depletion rate is higher in the retirement scenarios because of larger saturated thickness values in other words the producers who opt out of the retirement plans are given this opportunity to pump more water due to higher well capacities compared to the no action scenario the temporary efficacy of well retirement policies has been discussed by rouhi rad et al 2021 while for 10 20 30 40 and 50 well retirement plans the maximum total water saving under the rcp 4 5 ensemble mean climate scenario is 1 6 3 6 5 7 8 2 and 10 8 respectively it is 1 5 3 4 5 3 7 3 and 9 5 under the rcp 8 5 ensemble mean climate scenario these values indicate the negative impact of drier climate conditions on the outcomes of the well retirement plans as mentioned before the severity of dry events increases in years after 2040 in the rcp 8 5 ensemble mean climate scenario at the same time the implementation of the retirement plans leads to larger saturated thickness values across the county the concurrency of both drier climate conditions and larger saturated thickness increases the groundwater depletion rate and reduces total water saving in the retirement plans 4 summary and conclusions the steady overexploitation of the ogallala aquifer over past decades has raised concerns about the viability of irrigated crop production in regions overlying the aquifer in the foreseeable future particularly in the southern and central high plains handling this issue in a proper manner requires an accurate long term groundwater level gwl forecasting tool here we developed a data driven modeling framework utilizing the random forests rf technique in combination with ordinary kriging to spatiotemporally project future gwls as a function of climatological and anthropogenic factors the developed modeling framework was tested in finney county in southwest kansas an intensively groundwater irrigated region with significant groundwater depletion in recent years in this study rather than developing a separate model for each monitoring well a single rf model was trained calibrated and tested using all historical gwl measurements across the study area initially we considered nine input variables for the rf model based on the hydrogeological characteristics of the study area the most relevant input variables were then selected through an iterative process utilizing the rf algorithm to compute the relative importance of the variables the final input variables are groundwater withdrawal potential gwwp mean spei 3 in irrigation period spei irr groundwater depth gwd water year total precipitation p mean spei 3 in water year spei wy and aquifer specific yield at groundwater level sy the introduction of gwwp which is the product of saturated thickness and number of active high production wells as a new measure of pumping intensity enables the rf model to capture decline in groundwater depletion rate as the system progresses towards aquifer depletion gwwp also gives the rf model this ability to quantify the impacts of well retirement policies on future gwls testing the generalization capabilities of the rf model from multiple aspects suggests the acceptable performance of the model taking into account its simplicity with respect to development and calibration the sensitivity analysis of the rf model reveals the dominance of gwwp over the rest of the input variables simulation runs through the 21st century with climate impacts paint a dire picture of future groundwater availability in the study area under business as usual conditions the majority of the aquifer s extent will cease to support irrigated agriculture by 2050 2060 and 2070 under the worst average and best climate conditions respectively the results imply that while climate significantly affects groundwater depletion trends in areas with small saturated thickness and low well density climatological factors will likely shift the aquifer s depletion time frame by 15 years or less in most of the study area moreover greenhouse gas emissions do not have a substantial impact on groundwater availability in the county simulations including combined impacts of management and climate conditions indicate that although well retirement plans will lead to groundwater savings in the county the savings do not persist for a long period due to larger groundwater withdrawals by the remaining wells the results also suggest the efficacy of the retirement plans is hindered by drier climate conditions in the second half of the century as a result of ghg emissions overall the modeling framework developed in this study holds promise for capturing long term climatological and regulatory impacts on groundwater availability in intensively irrigated regions the modeling framework can serve as a rapid assessment tool informing policymakers about future groundwater availability at the county level and under different climate and management conditions it helps policymakers to determine the urgency of adaptation and or conservation strategies concerning groundwater depletion across the high plains region while finding the most suitable ml technique for long term projection of gwls is outside the scope of this study replacing the rf method with more recent and well tested ml methods such as deep learning techniques zhang et al 2018 solgi et al 2021 could further improve the modeling framework performance and should be considered in future studies another possible pathway to improved gwl projections would be the spatial clustering of gwl measurement points into homogenous groups nourani et al 2022a then instead of developing one single model for all measurement points a separate model would be developed for each cluster which could lead to more accurate forecasts since uncertainties in gridded data such as saturated thickness and sy are ignored here future work should seek to evaluate interpolation errors and their resultant impacts on model outputs credit authorship contribution statement

2821,the steady overexploitation of the ogallala aquifer underlying the u s high plains region has put irrigated crop production at risk particularly in the southern and central high plains to manage this issue properly a data driven modeling framework is developed and tested that is fast to employ and yet provides reliable long term groundwater level gwl forecasts as a function of climatological and anthropogenic factors the modeling framework uses the random forests rf technique in combination with ordinary kriging and is tested in finney county in southwest kansas the introduction of groundwater withdrawal potential as a new surrogate for pumping intensity enables the rf model to capture decline in groundwater depletion rate as the system progresses towards aquifer depletion and or as a result of well retirement policies the rf model is executed from 2017 to 2099 for 20 different downscaled global climate models gcms for the two representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios of 4 5 and 8 5 the results show the aquifer will cease to support irrigated agriculture in most of the county by 2060 under status quo management and average climate conditions moreover climate will likely shift the aquifer s depletion time frame by 15 years or less in most of the study area the long term combined impact of well retirement plans and climate conditions on groundwater depletion trends imply well retirement policies do not lead to sustained groundwater savings this study demonstrates the capacity of machine learning models to serve as a rapid assessment tool

2015 the ogallala aquifer which consists of the neogene period ogallala formation is the dominant constituent of the high plains aquifer system with about 77 areal coverage of the whole system gutentag et al 1984 and is known as one of the largest and most heavily utilized freshwater aquifers worldwide gowda et al 2019 haacker et al 2019 in the ogallala aquifer groundwater is generally under unconfined conditions and crop and livestock production in the u s high plains region rely heavily on this exhaustible resource steward et al 2013 gowda et al 2019 the ogallala aquifer has been undergoing depletion since at least the middle of the 20th century gutentag et al 1984 scanlon et al 2012 mcguire 2017 and with current rates of extraction portions of the aquifer in the southern and central high plains will cease to support irrigated agriculture within the next few decades scanlon et al 2012 steward et al 2013 haacker et al 2016 deines et al 2020 compounding this challenge drought severity frequency and persistence are expected to increase with climate change throughout the high plains region harding and snyder 2012 amplifying groundwater demand to support crop production and likely shortening the timeline to depletion cotterman et al 2018 on the other hand the implementation of management strategies such as pumping reduction and water rights retirement could possibly extend the aquifer lifespan butler et al 2016 manning et al 2020 to manage this complex situation federal and state organizations as well as local groundwater management districts are interested in the possible impacts of climate change and conservation policies on future water levels and depletion time frames across the ogallala aquifer developing a tool capable of rapid long term forecasting of groundwater levels gwls as a function of climatological and anthropogenic factors at the regional scale i e county level is an important step forecasting tools include both physically based hydrologic models and data driven statistical models in contrast to physically based models that solve governing mass balance equations to simulate groundwater storage and flow in aquifer system data driven models use soft computing and machine learning ml techniques solomatine and ostfeld 2008 amaranto et al 2018 these techniques capture nonlinear hidden patterns in historical data and use those patterns to forecast future gwls in aquifers without imposing rules for any underlying physical processes sahoo et al 2017 and can be a suitable alternative to physically based models daliakopoulos et al 2005 adamowski and chan 2011 over the last two decades the number of studies using ml methods in gwl modeling has steadily increased due to their ease of application and relatively short run time along with desirable performance among different ml and soft computing techniques in groundwater modeling some of the more commonly used ones are artificial neural network ann guo et al 2021 anshuman and eldho 2022 hakim et al 2022 nourani et al 2022b extreme learning machine elm alizamir et al 2018 natarajan and sudheer 2020 genetic programming gp shiri and kişi 2011 fallah mehdipour et al 2013 and support vector machine svm yoon et al 2011 guzman et al 2019 mohapatra et al 2021 in addition to the widely used methods in gwl modeling the application of ensemble learning algorithms such as random forests rf amaranto et al 2018 sahoo et al 2018 wang et al 2018 koch et al 2019 gradient boosting machine gbm sharafati et al 2020 and extreme gradient boosting xgb rahman et al 2020 has become more popular in recent years while the number of studies regarding development and testing data driven models for accurate gwl forecasting at a monthly or sub monthly time step has increased in recent years rajaee et al 2019 only a few studies have attempted to utilize such models for either long term gwl prediction or the projection of groundwater depletion time frame haacker et al 2016 steward and allen 2016 salem et al 2018 however these existing studies either ignored the exogenous factors e g climate condition affecting future gwls or groundwater depletion rate was substantially smaller than in the case of the ogallala aquifer furthermore only a few studies to date have evaluated the impact of policy makers decisions on gwls using either data driven models feng et al 2008 or semi statistical water balance approaches butler et al 2020a a review of the literature reveals that ml has yet to be employed to assess the long term impacts of management strategies on groundwater resources considering climate variability in the work reported here we develop and evaluate a data driven modeling architecture for long term gwl forecasting in groundwater irrigated agricultural regions the main components of the architecture are an ensemble learning model and a geostatistical interpolation technique rf random forests and ordinary kriging respectively rf simulates annual gwl change in measurement points and these discrete gwl change forecasts are spatially distributed using kriging the combination of ml and geostatistical methods has been applied in a number of studies simulating gwl spatiotemporally nourani et al 2011 tapoglou et al 2014 however we include aquifer saturated thickness i e vertical distance from water table to bedrock and the number of active high production wells which have not been incorporated in previous studies enabling our model to capture decline in groundwater depletion rate as storage conditions evolve closer to complete depletion moreover the input data equip the model with the capability to quantify the impacts of water conservation policies namely well retirement plans on future gwls by employing the developed data driven modeling framework in an intensively irrigated area overlying the ogallala aquifer this study primarily aims to 1 introduce a new input variable named groundwater withdrawal potential gwwp which is the product of aquifer saturated thickness and number of active high production wells as a proxy for unavailable pumping data in long term gwl projections 2 evaluate the long term impacts of climatological factors on groundwater availability and depletion time frames and 3 assess the efficacy of well retirement policies in prolonging the lifetime of the aquifer under different climate conditions while the proposed modeling framework is tested for the ogallala aquifer in finney county in southwest kansas it can be applied to other stressed aquifers worldwide where groundwater pumping is a significant factor in gwl decline 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area finney county in southwest kansas is one of the most intensively irrigated areas across the high plains region owing to the great saturated thickness within the underlying ogallala aquifer fig 1 groundwater development in the county began before the 1940 s in garden city and surrounding areas to the north of the arkansas river over the next decades as a result of advances in irrigation and drilling technologies groundwater development rapidly expanded to the rest of the county and reached its peak in 1980 fig s1 and the video file in supplementary material according to the water information management and analysis system wimas kansas geological survey 2019a 2534 irrigation wells were active in finney county in 1980 and between 24 and 31 of the county s area has been irrigated since then there are some areas along the arkansas river and mainly northwest of garden city that historically were irrigated by diverting water from the river into unlined irrigation ditches fig 1b and c however the river went dry in the region in the early 2000 s leading to the dependence of ditch service areas on groundwater as the main source of irrigation the ogallala aquifer in finney county has been over exploited over the past several decades resulting in nearly 30 m decrease in average saturated thickness between 1952 and 2017 unsustainable groundwater withdrawals high dependence on the aquifer for irrigated agriculture and the implementation of the conservation reserve enhancement program crep have drawn researchers attention to finney county in recent years rouhi rad et al 2020 xiang et al 2020 the reason for selecting finney county as our study region in addition to already mentioned reasons is the abundance of annual gwl measurements from a network of 165 wells fig 1c the high variability of saturated thickness across the county area providing the opportunity to train the model with data in a variety of depletion stages and the availability of geologic data from well logs moreover we do not expect a significant increase in the number of high production wells in the future due to the decreasing trend of active high production wells in the county since 1980 supplementary material fig s1 making long term gwl projections more reliable 2 2 random forests model development in this study the rf technique is used to forecast gwl variations and subsequently gwl values i e water table elevation values in measurement points the rf method is selected because despite its relatively simple structure and ease of calibration it is resistant to outliers noise and redundant data and can handle complex data of different statistical distributions with no need for data scaling breiman 2001 rodriguez galiano et al 2014 tyralis et al 2019 moreover as suggested by galelli and castelletti 2013 the rf method can be used directly for input ranking thanks to its intrinsic ability to quantify the relative importance of input variables we have leveraged this capability of the rf technique to find the best subset of input variables without using any external algorithms moreover the internal measurement of input variable importance makes the rf models more comprehensible compared to other black box ml models such as svm rahman et al 2020 here we present steps taken toward rf model development and evaluation 2 2 1 random forests random forests rf is an ensemble learning algorithm introduced by breiman 2001 for both classification and regression problems the rf method employs an ensemble of classification and regression trees carts breiman et al 1984 using bootstrapping and bagging methods breiman 1996 to rectify the overfitting problem of individual trees attributed to their excessive flexibility biau and scornet 2016 since gwl forecasting is a regression problem the developed rf model in our study consists of an ensemble of single regression trees in each regression tree the bootstrapped sample of the original dataset is recursively partitioned at a series of internal split nodes each node is split into two subsets of data called child nodes by a split value at each node the algorithm searches through a random subset of input variables features to find the best split leading to minimum impurity in resultant child nodes to calculate impurity at each node the algorithm fits a constant regression model to the data and computes regression error the constant value is calculated as the mean of target variables labels at each node and the common measure for regression error is mean square error mse the best split at each node is found by maximizing the information gain g which is defined as the difference between parent node s impurity and the weighted sum of child nodes impurity 1 g q m θ h q m n l n m h q l n r n m h q r where q represents dataset at each node θ represents the candidate split h is impurity function n represents the size of dataset at each node m denotes parent node l denotes left child node and r represents right child node the impurity function h at node m is defined as 2 h q m 1 n m y q m y y m 2 where y denotes target variables and y m is the mean of target variables at node m the same process is repeated for each child node and each tree keeps growing until a stopping criterion is reached loh 2011 at terminal leaf nodes the output of rf is the arithmetic average aggregation of all trees outputs in this study the scikit learn library pedregosa et al 2011 of the python programming language is used to construct the rf model 2 2 2 data description and input variable selection annual gwl measurements in finney county spanning from 1980 to 2017 were obtained from the wizard water well levels database kansas geological survey 2019b in addition to all gwl measurement points in finney county we included a few points located within the immediate proximity of the county border to increase forecast accuracy in boundary areas fig 1c since the target variable is gwl variations gwl measurements were converted to annual gwl changes for water years 1980 to 2016 we have considered water year october through september instead of calendar year for our analysis as it starts with the aquifer recovery period october through april and ends with the irrigation period may through september gwl data were filtered in a three step process first gwl measurements during the irrigation period were ignored as they are prone to drawdown effects from pumping multiple measurements from a single well in the recovery period were averaged to provide one estimate per well for each water year second gwl changes beyond 1 96 standard deviations from the mean incorporating all gwl variation data were considered as outliers and removed third the investigation of available satellite based data deines et al 2019 earth resources observation and science eros center 2020 reveals the majority of croplands in the study area were converted to center pivots by 1980 with the exception of the croplands located within the irrigation ditch companies service area marked by red polygon in fig 1c in this region groundwater irrigated agriculture using center pivots has become prevalent since 2003 therefore all pre 2003 gwl variations in this region were excluded due to inconsistency in irrigation system as well as irrigation water source emphasizing the importance of historical analysis in data driven modeling efforts after the three steps of filtering 2 438 annual gwl change records from 165 wells were available for training and testing the rf model the number of records in individual wells ranged from 2 to 37 with a median of 12 based on previous knowledge of the groundwater system in the study area we initially incorporated a wide range of input variables into the rf model that could possibly affect gwls on annual basis table 1 presents the list of initial input variables their importance rank time scale category and the source of basic data used to obtain quantify them some of the input variables are among the most commonly used input variables in previous gwl forecasting studies as indicated by rajaee et al 2019 that is to say groundwater depth gwd water year total precipitation p average daily mean temperature in irrigation season t and water year mean river flow f the gwd is an indicator of groundwater depletion intensity the p is a measure of soil moisture replenishment and groundwater recharge the t represents soil moisture loss through evapotranspiration and the f is a measure of aquifer recharge through the infiltration of a portion of stream flow if there is any into the river bed and banks the rest of the variables have either never been considered or been considered in a few studies to date and will be briefly explained here in agricultural regions pumping significantly influences gwl variations and should be included as a model input however pumping data is seldom available in these regions in lieu of unavailable groundwater extraction data previous studies have attempted to use other variables as a proxy for pumping such as irrigation demand of major crops sahoo et al 2017 salem et al 2018 amaranto et al 2019 in the current study we introduce groundwater withdrawal potential gwwp as a new measure of pumping intensity that can be calculated at gwl measurement point i as follows 3 gwwp b i w i where b i is saturated thickness at location i and w i is the number of active high production wells within a 3000 m radius of i the radius value was selected through a search of values ranging from 50 to 3500 m a given well is considered as high production if it is being used for irrigation industrial or municipal demands the status of high production wells during the 1980 2016 period was obtained by analyzing water rights data we evaluated the relevance of the gwwp compared to b and w by constructing an rf model with these three inputs and measuring their impurity based importance the term of impurity based importance will be explained later in this section the results show the superiority of the gwwp with the importance value of 0 49 over b and w with the importance value of 0 40 and 0 11 respectively since well capacity defined as the maximum pumping rate that could be sustained throughout the irrigation season is partly a function of aquifer saturated thickness harman 1966 one may interpret the gwwp as an indicator of total maximum pumping rate in the vicinity of a given gwl measurement point while the gwwp represents regional groundwater extraction intensity distance to the closest active high production well dcw is included to capture the local impacts of pumping the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 is a normalized drought index that fits aggregated differences between monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet to a three parameter log logistic distribution to quantify departures from normal conditions and has been used in the u s great plains region zambreski et al 2018 we already have considered the t and the p as two climatic variables but neither is able to solely represent soil moisture deficit which is a determinant of pumping intensity in each year on the other hand afshar et al 2022 have shown the spei has a high correlation with a soil moisture drought index namely the standardized soil moisture index ssmi in the u s high plains therefore the spei can be used as an indicator of soil moisture deficit in our study area moreover the spei has been utilized as a surrogate for total annual pumping in a recent data driven gwl modeling study in the southern high plains of texas and had the highest relative contribution among the model inputs ghaseminejad and uddameri 2020 in the current study gridded estimates of historical monthly accumulated precipitation and pet based on the penman monteith methodology were retrieved from gridmet abatzoglou 2013 for the 1980 2016 period these variables were used to derive the spei with the aggregation time step of three months spei 3 at each grid cell since the spei 3 is more closely related to agricultural drought zambreski et al 2018 we used the gridded spei 3 values to get water year mean spei wy as well as irrigation period s mean spei irr of the spei 3 at gwl measurement points from 1980 to 2016 the spei irr is a measure of crop irrigation demand whereas the spei wy represents soil moisture depletion and replenishment mechanisms throughout a given water year the state of kansas has a comprehensive database of well logs kansas geological survey 2019c therefore we examined the relevance of hydrogeological parameters in data driven gwl models by incorporating aquifer specific yield at gwl sy as a model input since such category of data has been considered only in a few studies tsanis et al 2008 koch et al 2019 to estimate sy we compiled a well log dataset of 603 boreholes in finney county and its vicinity supplementary material fig s2a initially the well logs were used to make the bedrock elevation raster which is required for the calculation of saturated thickness at gwl measurement points supplementary material fig s2a additionally we used the well logs along with historical water table elevation rasters to estimate sy at each borehole from 1980 to 2016 by finding the lithology layers located within the gwl 2 35 gwl 1 08 interval and calculating the interval s weighted average specific yield based on the suggested values in liu et al 2010 the values of 2 35 and 1 08 correspond to the 2 5th and 97 5th percentiles of historical gwl changes distribution respectively the sy values were then interpolated using ordinary kriging with an exponential semivariogram model to generate gridded estimates of sy supplementary material fig s2b see section 2 3 for more details on kriging the resultant grids were used to estimate sy at gwl measurement points sy calculations were performed using the python arcpy package while the rf method is susceptible to low dimensional rather than high dimensional input data wang et al 2018 it is appropriate to reduce high dimensionality by finding the most relevant input variables we have used the rf algorithm to rank the input variables and consequently have selected the best subset of them in the rf algorithm the total information gain g see eq 1 attained by each input variable in a given tree is normalized by total g at all nodes of the tree resulting in a feature s relative importance in a single tree the relative importance of each feature in the rf model is obtained by averaging a feature s relative importance in all individual trees this measure of feature importance is called the impurity based importance we have selected the best subset of input variables through an iterative process in this process an rf model with 500 trees was constructed and trained using historical data from 1980 to 2011 at each iteration and the feature with the least impurity based importance was omitted from the succeeding iteration since our single goal during the input variable selection process was to quantify the relative importance of model inputs the rf models were parameterized in such a way that all available input variables at a given iteration were explored to find the best split at each node rather than searching through a random subset of them the procedure was repeated until all remaining input variables attained an impurity based importance value of greater than or equal to 0 1 which was met in the fourth iteration fig s3 in supplementary material the final input variables are gwwp spei irr gwd p spei wy and sy table 1 we selected an annual time step for the rf model with the assumption that input variables influence gwl change within the same time step thereby removing the need to perform the time lag analysis of input variables as has been performed in previous studies e g amaranto et al 2019 the gwl forecasting scheme of the rf model in this study is the one step ahead forecasting approach i e the model utilizes input data in year t to forecast gwl change in year t and subsequently gwl value in year t 1 2 2 3 random forests model training testing and evaluation the common procedure in constructing data driven gwl models is that a separate model is built and calibrated for each gwl measurement point with a long record of historical data sahoo et al 2017 amaranto et al 2019 while this procedure yields high levels of accuracy at measurement points it ignores a considerable portion of measured data at wells with a rather short record of gwl measurements the procedure also leads to noticeable interpolation errors in creating gridded gwl data due to the scarcity of long record wells moreover the rf model needs to be trained with a wide range of gwwp values in order to capture decline in groundwater depletion rate as the system evolves closer to complete depletion therefore in this study historical model inputs and outputs at all gwl measurement points are lumped together and a single rf model is developed for all the points the historical data were split into the two temporal periods of training 1980 to 2011 and testing 2012 to 2016 the training dataset was used to construct and calibrate the rf model the k fold cross validation technique k 10 was adopted to calibrate the model hyperparameters and bias and root mean square error rmse were used as model performance metrics in cross validation the hyperparameters chosen for calibration were the number of trees the number of input variables considered at each split the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node and the minimum number of samples required to be at a terminal node with the final values of 600 2 4 and 2 respectively after training and calibration the rf model performance is independently examined by running the model for the testing period and comparing its outputs with measured data via four different model performance metrics namely bias root mean square error rmse the pearson correlation coefficient r and the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 in model testing we only consider gwl measurement points with available records over the entire testing period that is to say 52 points in total the performance metrics are calculated based on the two categories of residuals defined as the modeled gwl subtracted from the measured gwl namely discrete and cumulative residuals the metrics calculated based on discrete residuals measure model performance in one year ahead gwl forecasting i e model performance in each year is independent of its performance in previous years on the other hand the metrics computed based on cumulative residuals demonstrate the long term forecast capabilities of the model since errors in a given year will propagate into the next years the performance metrics were computed for the rf model as well as a set of simpler data driven models that is to say multiple linear regression mlr multiple 2nd order non linear regression mnlr 2nd and multiple 3rd order non linear regression mnlr 3rd in addition to these simpler techniques we developed and calibrated an svm model which is a robust and commonly used ml method in gwl modeling and compared its performance with the rf model all these additional modeling techniques were used as reference points for the evaluation of the rf model s forecast skill in the testing period to develop the svm model the input variables were scaled to have unit variance and zero mean except for spei irr and spei wy which are scaled intrinsically similar to recent gwl forecasting studies amaranto et al 2018 rahman et al 2020 radial basis function kernel is selected for the svm model the svm model was calibrated using the grid search cross validation technique and by finding the values of three hyperparameters namely cost epsilon and gamma we employed the scikit learn library pedregosa et al 2011 of the python programming language to develop and calibrate the svm model the details of the svm method are presented in vapnik 1999 to further evaluate the rf model performance we compared annual reported total groundwater use in the county kansas geological survey 2019a with model estimated annual decrease in total groundwater storage the rf model outputs along with the ordinary kriging technique can be used to generate gridded saturated thickness values as well as gridded weighted average specific yield values of all lithology layers located below gwl these two grids then can be used to estimate total groundwater storage v in the study area as follows 4 v c 1 c n b c sy c δ x δ y where b c is saturated thickness in cell c sy c represents weighted average specific yield in cell c n denotes the total number of cells δ x is cell size in x direction and δ y is cell size in y direction 2 2 4 relative importance of input variables we quantified the relative importance of input variables via the two approaches of impurity based see section 2 2 2 and permutation based feature importance to understand underlying non linear interactions between model inputs and outputs the impurity based importance values were derived from the calibrated rf model where a random subset of features with a size of two was considered at each tree node to find the best split the permutation based feature importance is defined as decrease in a model s skill score caused by random permutation of a given input variable or a group of variables for a number of times while the rest of the input variables are left intact therefore the more important a feature the greater decrease in model s skill score to compute the permutation based importance values we randomly permutated each input variable 50 times and computed the average relative increase in the mean square error mse value of the training dataset using the k fold cross validation technique k 10 we also collectively permuted the climatic variables namely p spei irr and spei wy to estimate their joint importance incorporating the k fold technique enables us to quantify the influence of input variables on gwl forecasts made using unseen data during the model training 2 3 long term groundwater level projections after rf model development and evaluation the model was trained for the last time using all historical data from 1980 to 2016 then the finalized rf model was employed in combination with ordinary kriging to forecast future annual gwl changes from 2017 to 2099 under various climate and management scenarios kriging is applied as a best linear unbiased estimator to create smooth and continuous rasters isaaks and srivastava 1989 we select ordinary kriging since it is a well known geostatistical interpolation technique and has been employed along with ml models for gwl projection in previous studies nourani et al 2011 tapoglou et al 2014 chang et al 2016 the geostatistical wizard tool in arcmap was used to determine kriging parameters namely semivariogram model type lag size major range partial sill nugget and search radius features these parameters were estimated based on kriging s rmse computed using the leave one out cross validation technique 2 3 1 modeling framework for long term groundwater level projections the modeling framework developed for spatiotemporal gwl forecasting in the long term is shown in fig 2 the calibrated and trained rf model is the backbone of this modeling framework the input variables of the rf model can be broadly classified into two groups according to their update mechanism the first group includes climatic variables derived from downscaled climate projections namely p spei irr and spei wy these variables are estimated ahead of long term simulations and will not be affected by model outputs the second group consists of input variables that are a function of gwl and vary with changes in gwl namely sy gwwp and gwd unlike the first group the second group of variables is updated dynamically during the entire simulation period as a result of annual gwl variations the rf model uses the input variables to forecast annual gwl change at measurement points the rf model outputs are then post processed through a series of steps yielding a number of secondary outputs in the first step of post processing the gwl changes in measurement points are interpolated using ordinary kriging with a gaussian semivariogram model in the next step the gwl raster is updated for the next water year by adding the gwl change raster to the current year s gwl raster the saturated thickness raster is then updated by subtracting the bedrock elevation raster from the updated gwl raster the updated gwl raster is also used to update sy values at borehole locations which are then interpolated to update the sy raster for the next water year using ordinary kriging with an exponential semivariogram model see section 2 2 2 for more details on computing sy value at boreholes updating the status of high production wells is the last step in the post processing of the rf model outputs in this study two deactivation criteria are considered for high production wells a non irrigation well becomes inactive when saturated thickness drops below 1 m i e well goes dry whereas an irrigation well becomes inactive if saturated thickness drops below 9 m i e well ceases to support irrigated crop production due to low well capacity schloss et al 2000 rawling and rinehart 2019 the rf model outputs together with the secondary outputs are used to update the gwl dependent input variables for the next water year the whole modeling workflow is carried out through a set of python programming language scripts developed for the current study incorporating the scikit learn library pedregosa et al 2011 and the arcpy package 2 3 2 climate projections statistically downscaled gridded monthly precipitation and pet from 20 global climate models gcms of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 were used to derive future projections of p spei irr and spei wy with the spatial resolution of 4 km abatzoglou and brown 2012 taylor et al 2012 the grid cell values were then extracted at gwl measurement points to be used as the rf model inputs the downscaling technique employed was the multivariate adapted constructed analogs maca procedure which has the advantages of computational efficiency higher accuracy than simple interpolation approaches and preservation of the first principles of meteorology through joint downscaling measures abatzoglou and brown 2012 zhang et al 2022 daily maximum and minimum temperature wind velocity precipitation and solar radiation were downscaled during this process for the baseline period historical observations from gridmet abatzoglou 2013 were used for downscaling the projection data the maca first applies the bias correction technique of quantile mapping to adjust the mean and variance of the gcm daily data to gridmet using the projected and historical runs followed by an epoch adjustment to remove the potential of finding no analog in the historical period next the best analog is identified using thirty predictor patterns centered around a 45 day window on each calendar date this analog procedure is conducted jointly for temperature and dew point to improve coherence between downscaled fields whereas wind velocity and precipitation are downscaled individually epoch adjustments are reintroduced and quantile mapping is performed again to ensure statistical moments are consistent with observations the daily value s obtained after quantile mapping is the final downscaled daily variable parameter estimates for the log logistic distribution in the spei calculations were calibrated using the downscaled data from 1980 to 2016 and applied similarly for the projection period from 2017 to 2099 at each grid cell because of uncertainties in future trajectory of greenhouse gas ghg emissions gcm projections for two different representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios namely rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 are included in this study see table s1 in supplementary material for a list of all gcms considered in the current study along with their resolution and corresponding institution 2 3 3 long term groundwater level projections under different climate and management scenarios the developed modeling framework together with the downscaled climate projections are leveraged to evaluate the long term impacts of climate variability and changes on future gwls and groundwater availability in the study area the modeling framework is executed for 40 different climate scenarios from 2017 to 2099 i e 20 gcms and 2 rcps in addition to running the model for climate scenarios under status quo management condition five different hypothetical well retirement plans are defined and reflected in gwwp values namely 10 20 30 40 and 50 retirement plans the 10 retirement plan involves the random selection of 10 of active irrigation wells at the beginning of the projection period and their uniform deactivation over a 10 year period i e 2021 2030 this plan is converted into the other plans through augmenting the initial 10 well retirement by 10 increments during the same deactivation period to assess the integrated effects of climatological and regulatory factors we run the model for a combination of six management and two climate scenarios i e a total of 12 scenarios from 2017 to 2099 the five hypothetical retirement plans plus one no action plan i e baseline constitute the management scenarios the well retirement plans are hypothetical which means neither their political acceptability nor economic consequence is studied here since we want to evaluate well retirement plans under two different climate conditions the climate scenarios are derived from the average of gcms projections for rcp 4 5 and for rcp 8 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 random forests model testing and evaluation 3 1 1 random forests model performance in testing period fig 3 a presents the performance metrics of the rf model along with the svm model and other three simpler models in this figure all the metrics that correspond to discrete residuals are obtained through averaging the metrics of individual gwl measurement points the bias and the rmse values that correspond to cumulative residuals are computed based on cumulative residual values in 2016 in all the measurement points these residuals in fact compare the position of modeled gwls versus measured values at the end of the testing period the comparison of the rf model with the svm model shows that the rf model outperforms the svm model with respect to all metrics fig 3a additionally the rf model consistently has the best performance based on all metrics except for the bias compared to the three simpler models the positive value of bias indicates either underestimation of gwl decline or overestimation of gwl rise and conversely negative value of bias indicates either overestimation of gwl decline or underestimation of gwl rise considering the characteristics of the study area bias values reveal that all models tend to underestimate gwl decline in the testing period except for the mnlr 3rd model the distribution of cumulative residuals at the end of the testing period fig 3b reveals that the extraordinary low bias value of the mnlr 3rd model is attributable to large negative residuals in a few gwl measurement points in the rf model 87 of gwl measurement points have a cumulative residual within the range of 1 75 m with the mean value i e bias of 0 10 m whereas in the mnlr 3rd model 73 of cumulative residuals fall within the same range with the mean value of 0 13 m this comparison shows the balanced performance of the rf model in the vast majority of the measurement points the better performance of the rf model compared to the svm model which is a robust ml technique in gwl modeling as well as the simpler methods provides further justification for the selection of the rf technique in this study the cumulative residuals of the rf model at the end of the testing period with rmse 1 59 m is comparable with the values attained by sahoo et al 2017 in the ogallala aquifer for the testing period of 2003 to 2012 where a majority of cumulative residuals in the last year fell within 2 m it should be noted that in the referenced study a separate highly parametrized ml model with pre processed input data i e a hybrid ann model was developed and calibrated for each individual monitoring well resulting in slightly better performance of their models in comparison with our rf model to investigate the performance of the rf model in each testing year a time series of discrete residuals distributions is depicted in fig 3c acknowledging a slight general tendency for the underestimation of gwl declines the distributions of residuals suggest fairly unbiased gwl forecasts in all the years except 2012 which is the second driest year after 2011 in terms of spei irr and spei wy during the 1980 2016 period the extreme dry condition in 2011 and 2012 corresponds to the southern u s drought that affected large parts of the country in the 2010 2012 period biased gwl forecasts in 2012 can be attributed to this drought in fact the prolonged extreme dry condition led to soil moisture depletion forcing the farmers to heavily rely on groundwater for crop production in this year since the rf model has not been trained with such an unprecedented dry condition it underestimates gwl declines in the majority of cases in 2012 the reduced accuracy of data driven gwl models under climate extremes is not unique to this study ghaseminejad and uddameri 2020 nourani et al 2022b in addition to the temporal evaluation a spatial analysis of the rf model s performance metrics calculated based on cumulative residuals provides a better picture of the model s capabilities for long term gwl projections and also reveals possible spatial anomalies in model performance fig 4 the value of bias is within 0 50 m in 52 of the points is greater than 0 50 m in 33 of the points and is less than 0 50 m in 15 of the points this implies the rf model generally underestimates gwl declines during the testing period it can be seen that 60 of the points have a rmse value of less than 0 75 m while only 10 of the points have a rmse value of greater than 2 m the r value is greater than 0 9 and 0 5 in 63 and 79 of the points respectively in 42 of the points the kge is greater than 0 7 while it is greater than 0 5 in 63 of the points the kge may not seem satisfactory in 37 of the points with values less than 0 5 however the value of kge is greater than 0 41 in 88 of the points suggesting that the model s overall performance is significantly better than the mean values knoben et al 2019 in the vast majority of points the comparison of these results with the performance metrics of an integrated space time ann ist ann model ghaseminejad and uddameri 2020 implies the adequate performance of the rf model taking into account the simplicity of development and calibration there is no spatial trend in the values of bias and rmse fig 4 however a spatial pattern can be detected in the r and the kge with clustered regions of low metric values the regions located along the aquifer boundary on the northeast of the county as well as the regions in the northwest of the county are overlying portions of the aquifer with small saturated thickness less than 20 m due to small well capacity values in these regions groundwater extraction for irrigation is not as intensive as the rest of the county leading to noisy gwl fluctuations because of such noisy behavior the difference between measured and modeled variance increases leading to decreased values of r and kge in these regions on the other hand the bias and the rmse metrics indicate good overall performance in these regions suggesting these two metrics could be misleading in regions characterized by small range of gwls nourani et al 2022b the diminished performance of ml models due to noisy gwl fluctuations has been reported in previous studies for shallow wells rakhshandehroo et al 2018 and regions with shallower gwls and less pumping intensities sharafati et al 2020 to look at the rf model performance from a totally different perspective the annual decrease in total groundwater storage forecasted by the model see eq 4 is compared with annual groundwater use in finney county from 2012 to 2016 fig 5 due to the absolute dominance of the groundwater sink term i e groundwater withdrawal in the study area the groundwater storage variations and annual groundwater use data are appropriately correlated with r 0 9858 3 1 2 random forests model sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis of the rf model is carried out through the quantification of input variables contribution using the two approaches of impurity based fig 6 a and permutation based fig 6b feature importance see section 2 2 4 all input variables have the same ranking in both approaches gwwp is the most important variable followed by gwd spei irr p spei wy and sy earning the highest ranking of model inputs by the gwwp underscores the combined impact of two neglected variables in previous studies namely saturated thickness and the number of active high production wells on gwl variations in an intensively irrigated region we note that saturated thickness and depth to groundwater table the former corresponding to gwwp and the latter representing gwd are among the most influential irrigation drivers in western kansas lamb et al 2021 both gwwp and gwd are indicators of groundwater development intensity i e degree of pumping establishment across the study area offering a process based justification for their top ranking the climatic variables in the current study i e spei irr p and spei wy are believed to only have indirect impacts on gwls due to deep gwls and intensively irrigated agriculture in aquifers with deep gwls the direct impacts of climatological factors on gwls through influencing groundwater recharge rates can be dominated by their indirect impacts affecting irrigation demands russo and lall 2017 the higher importance of spei irr than spei wy also implies the indirect impacts of climatic variables as the spei irr likely affect irrigation water demand more substantially the joint permutation based importance of climatic variables c in fig 6b reveals the collective role of these variables in the rf model however the c is still dominated by the gwwp the sy has the least importance value among the input variables which is likely due to the absolute dominance of groundwater extraction over gwl variations in the study area as represented directly and indirectly by the rest of the inputs another possible reason could be inaccurate sy estimates arising from interpolation errors and or approximate representation of lithology layers in well log data butler et al 2020b tsanis et al 2008 also incorporated sy as an additional feature in their ann model and noticed slight improvement in their model performance the impurity based feature importance approach is prone to overfitting i e it tends to overestimate the importance of features that do not actually contribute to model outputs but are being utilized for overfitting during model training on the other hand the permutation based importance values are computed using unseen data during the training thus the constancy of input variables ranking implies that none of the input variables cause overfitting during the rf model training 3 2 long term projections 3 2 1 climatic variables projections the spatially averaged historical from 1980 to 2016 and projected from 2017 to 2099 values of the rf model s climatic input variables are presented in fig 7 the comparison of projected variables with historical records shows the percentage of projected data that exceed the historical range is 15 14 and 9 for p spei irr and spei wy in rcp 4 5 respectively and is 14 16 and 20 for p spei irr and spei wy in rcp 8 5 respectively therefore it can be inferred that the rf model is not extrapolating gwl variations with respect to climatic inputs in most cases of future climate scenarios a decreasing temporal trend is noticeable in the projected values of spei irr and spei wy for rcp 8 5 implying the negative impacts of ghg emissions on drought conditions in the study area the spei ranges within 3 with negative values indicating drier than normal climatic conditions and positive values indicating wetter than normal conditions we use the ensemble mean of gcms projections to assess the impact of two different climate conditions on well retirement policies the ensemble mean of gcms projections for rcp 4 5 constitutes the rcp 4 5 ensemble mean climate scenario with the average value of 489 mm 0 42 and 0 71 for p spei irr and spei wy during the projection period respectively the ensemble mean of gcms for rcp 8 5 forms the rcp 8 5 ensemble mean climate scenario with the average value of 474 mm 0 75 and 0 96 for p spei irr and spei wy respectively 3 2 2 long term groundwater level projections under various climate conditions to better analyze the rf model s long term forecasts at individual gwl measurement points under different climate scenarios we select six measurement points and plot saturated thickness variations at each point fig 8 these simulations are done under business as usual condition with no shifts in irrigation technology crop choices cultivars and or water use regulations the selected gwl measurement points represent a wide range of saturated thickness values at the beginning of the projection period the reason for presenting the forecasted values in the form of saturated thickness rather than gwl is that saturated thickness provides a more complete assessment of groundwater availability the ensemble means of saturated thickness forecasts for rcp 4 5 and for rcp 8 5 present the overall trend of groundwater depletion in each emission scenario at the selected gwl measurement points fig 8b saturated thickness forecasts at all the points except point 6 clearly show a decreasing trend in depletion rate as the system progresses towards aquifer depletion representing the s shaped logistic curve as suggested by steward et al 2013 the rf model s capability to capture this decreasing trend is obtained through introducing the gwwp as an input variable deactivating wells as a result of groundwater depletion and training the model with all historical data across the study area corresponding to different depletion stages the different depletion mechanism at point 6 can be attributed to noisy gwl fluctuations as a result of insignificant groundwater withdrawals in regions with small saturated thickness and low well density these regions have witnessed a rise in gwls in 2011 which has been the driest year since 1980 with respect to all three climatic variables in the study area we ascribe this phenomenon to producers decision to switch from irrigated to either dryland rain fed or no crop production during abnormally dry conditions in regions where pumping is not heavily established due to low well capacity values such decisions are manifested in a sudden increase in saturated thickness at point 6 in years after 2070 under one specific climate scenario namely the ipsl cm5a mr gcm model for rcp 8 5 being characterized by extreme dry conditions in years succeeding 2070 these results show the rf model holds promise for capturing spatiotemporal heterogeneities in producers irrigation decisions based on historical data although there is no guarantee that the producers make the same decisions in future on the other hand a physically based groundwater model cannot simulate such heterogeneities unless coupled with an agent based agro economic model e g mod at rouhi rad et al 2020 to compare groundwater availability under different climate scenarios in a spatially lumped manner we calculate total groundwater storage in the study area see eq 4 from 2017 to 2099 for each climate scenario fig 9 the results indicate the total volume of water in storage decreases by more than 87 by the end of the century in all climate scenarios however each scenario affects groundwater depletion differently fig 9a for example in the climate scenario correspondent to the ipsl cm5a mr gcm model for rcp 8 5 despite rapid depletion in the first half of the projection period groundwater storage starts increasing in years after 2070 due to the cessation of irrigated agriculture during severe drought events in regions with small saturated thickness and low well density the ensemble means of projected groundwater storage values for rcp 4 5 and for rcp 8 5 imply that ghg emissions slightly affect groundwater availability in the study area fig 9b this can be attributed to the fact that the negative impact of ghg emissions which is manifested in decreasing trend of projected spei values for rcp 8 5 becomes significant in the second half of the century that is to say in the years after 2040 fig 7b and c by that time total groundwater storage declines by more than 37 in all scenarios indicating approximately half of the total volume loss occurs without being significantly affected by ghg emissions moreover extreme dry conditions in years after 2040 will not likely lead to drastic gwl declines because of groundwater withdrawal constraints caused by reduced well capacities to evaluate the impacts of climatological factors on groundwater availability in a spatially distributed manner we analyze the rasters of projected saturated thickness from 2017 to 2099 obtained through running the rf model for different climate scenarios developed based on individual gcms in each year and for each rcp scenario we compute the minimum maximum and ensemble mean of projected saturated thickness values at each grid cell figs s4 s6 in supplementary material the ensemble mean rasters of projected saturated thickness show the majority of the aquifer s domain in finney county will become depleted i e saturated thickness drops below 9 m by 2060 in both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios fig 10 a the minimum maximum and ensemble mean rasters of projected saturated thickness are used to estimate the aquifer s depletion time frame spatially by finding the first year when saturated thickness drops below 9 m at each cell fig 10b the depletion time frame rasters clearly show the extent of impact of climatological factors on groundwater availability across the study area the majority of the aquifer s extent in the county will become depleted by 2050 2060 and 2070 under minimum mean and maximum saturated thickness conditions respectively in both rcps to quantify the impact of climatological factors on groundwater depletion time frame we calculate the difference of depletion time frames under minimum and maximum saturated thickness conditions for each rcp fig 10c those regions that will become depleted after the projection period i e years after 2099 are excluded from this spatial analysis the results imply climate plays an important role in groundwater availability in regions with small saturated thickness and low well density i e regions located along the already depleted areas on the northeast of the county in these regions climatological factors can shift the depletion time frame by more than 25 years on the other hand groundwater availability in the rest of the county especially central and southern parts with larger saturated thickness and higher well density is less affected by climate as a result of more intensive groundwater withdrawals overall the depletion time frame in the majority of the study area will be shifted by 15 years or less in both rcps due to uncertainties in future climatic variables in this study we ignore uncertainties in gridded saturated thickness data arising from interpolation errors 3 2 3 long term groundwater level projections under several combined management and climate conditions to assess and present the rf model s ability to properly capture well retirement effects under a variety of conditions three gwl measurement points are selected and their saturated thickness variation in all scenarios is plotted fig 11 the results at point 1 where initial saturated thickness is large and retired wells density is high show that the retirement plans significantly affect groundwater depletion trends and prolong the aquifer s lifetime the higher the well retirement percentage the more positive impacts with respect to the aquifer s sustainability on the other hand at point 2 with similar initial saturated thickness value to point 1 but lower well retirement density the impacts of the retirement plans on groundwater depletion become less significant at both of these points the effectiveness of the retirement plans diminishes under the rcp 8 5 ensemble mean climate scenario as a result of increase in the severity of dry events in years after 2040 due to the negative impact of ghg emissions fig 7b and c at point 3 where initial saturated thickness is small and well retirement density is quite high the retirement plans have negligible impacts on depletion trends in either climate scenario emphasizing the importance of initial saturated thickness in conservation policies success foster et al 2017 the impact of the well retirement plans on groundwater availability in the entirety of finney county is inspected through computing total groundwater storage see eq 4 from 2017 to 2099 in different management and climate scenarios fig 12 a see figs s7 s12 in supplementary material for projected saturated thickness rasters under different combined management and climate scenarios the results show even with 50 well retirement the aquifer will lose 87 and 93 of its total water in storage by the end of the century under the rcp 4 5 ensemble mean and the rcp 8 5 ensemble mean climate scenarios respectively therefore well retirement policies do not lead to sustained groundwater savings in the county to better understand and compare the temporal effects of the retirement plans on groundwater sustainability total water saving in each scenario is computed as a percentage of total groundwater storage at the beginning of the projection period fig 12b the groundwater saving period starts with the initiation of well retirements in 2021 and lasts until total water saving peaks in a year within the 2054 2065 period depending on the retirement and climate scenarios after hitting the peak total water saving starts declining as a result of higher groundwater extraction rates in the retirement scenarios compared to the no action scenario in the second half of the century groundwater depletion rate is higher in the retirement scenarios because of larger saturated thickness values in other words the producers who opt out of the retirement plans are given this opportunity to pump more water due to higher well capacities compared to the no action scenario the temporary efficacy of well retirement policies has been discussed by rouhi rad et al 2021 while for 10 20 30 40 and 50 well retirement plans the maximum total water saving under the rcp 4 5 ensemble mean climate scenario is 1 6 3 6 5 7 8 2 and 10 8 respectively it is 1 5 3 4 5 3 7 3 and 9 5 under the rcp 8 5 ensemble mean climate scenario these values indicate the negative impact of drier climate conditions on the outcomes of the well retirement plans as mentioned before the severity of dry events increases in years after 2040 in the rcp 8 5 ensemble mean climate scenario at the same time the implementation of the retirement plans leads to larger saturated thickness values across the county the concurrency of both drier climate conditions and larger saturated thickness increases the groundwater depletion rate and reduces total water saving in the retirement plans 4 summary and conclusions the steady overexploitation of the ogallala aquifer over past decades has raised concerns about the viability of irrigated crop production in regions overlying the aquifer in the foreseeable future particularly in the southern and central high plains handling this issue in a proper manner requires an accurate long term groundwater level gwl forecasting tool here we developed a data driven modeling framework utilizing the random forests rf technique in combination with ordinary kriging to spatiotemporally project future gwls as a function of climatological and anthropogenic factors the developed modeling framework was tested in finney county in southwest kansas an intensively groundwater irrigated region with significant groundwater depletion in recent years in this study rather than developing a separate model for each monitoring well a single rf model was trained calibrated and tested using all historical gwl measurements across the study area initially we considered nine input variables for the rf model based on the hydrogeological characteristics of the study area the most relevant input variables were then selected through an iterative process utilizing the rf algorithm to compute the relative importance of the variables the final input variables are groundwater withdrawal potential gwwp mean spei 3 in irrigation period spei irr groundwater depth gwd water year total precipitation p mean spei 3 in water year spei wy and aquifer specific yield at groundwater level sy the introduction of gwwp which is the product of saturated thickness and number of active high production wells as a new measure of pumping intensity enables the rf model to capture decline in groundwater depletion rate as the system progresses towards aquifer depletion gwwp also gives the rf model this ability to quantify the impacts of well retirement policies on future gwls testing the generalization capabilities of the rf model from multiple aspects suggests the acceptable performance of the model taking into account its simplicity with respect to development and calibration the sensitivity analysis of the rf model reveals the dominance of gwwp over the rest of the input variables simulation runs through the 21st century with climate impacts paint a dire picture of future groundwater availability in the study area under business as usual conditions the majority of the aquifer s extent will cease to support irrigated agriculture by 2050 2060 and 2070 under the worst average and best climate conditions respectively the results imply that while climate significantly affects groundwater depletion trends in areas with small saturated thickness and low well density climatological factors will likely shift the aquifer s depletion time frame by 15 years or less in most of the study area moreover greenhouse gas emissions do not have a substantial impact on groundwater availability in the county simulations including combined impacts of management and climate conditions indicate that although well retirement plans will lead to groundwater savings in the county the savings do not persist for a long period due to larger groundwater withdrawals by the remaining wells the results also suggest the efficacy of the retirement plans is hindered by drier climate conditions in the second half of the century as a result of ghg emissions overall the modeling framework developed in this study holds promise for capturing long term climatological and regulatory impacts on groundwater availability in intensively irrigated regions the modeling framework can serve as a rapid assessment tool informing policymakers about future groundwater availability at the county level and under different climate and management conditions it helps policymakers to determine the urgency of adaptation and or conservation strategies concerning groundwater depletion across the high plains region while finding the most suitable ml technique for long term projection of gwls is outside the scope of this study replacing the rf method with more recent and well tested ml methods such as deep learning techniques zhang et al 2018 solgi et al 2021 could further improve the modeling framework performance and should be considered in future studies another possible pathway to improved gwl projections would be the spatial clustering of gwl measurement points into homogenous groups nourani et al 2022a then instead of developing one single model for all measurement points a separate model would be developed for each cluster which could lead to more accurate forecasts since uncertainties in gridded data such as saturated thickness and sy are ignored here future work should seek to evaluate interpolation errors and their resultant impacts on model outputs credit authorship contribution statement

2822,the focus of this study is to locate shallow groundwater sgw occurrences in arid lands using the western desert wd area 680 000 km2 of egypt as a test site the sgw in the study area originated from paleo precipitation during previous wet climatic periods in wet periods fossil groundwater was at higher levels ascended along high angle faults and discharged at the surface in contrast at present the water levels are lower and the discharge occurs at near surface elevations spring locations were identified as the dependent variable while the independent variables included remote sensing based variables and geomorphological features indicative of current or paleo discharge locations including elevation slope curvature distance to sapping features soil moisture ndvi radar backscatter coefficient and brightness temperature relationships between sgw occurrences target and their controlling factors independent variables were established using extreme gradient boosting xgb support vector machine svm and logistic regression lr methods the trained models were used to map sgw locations across the entire wd findings include the following 1 the xgb yielded the most favorable result in identifying sgw locations overall accuracy 0 93 compared to svm overall accuracy 0 88 and lr overall accuracy 0 87 2 areas with a very high probability of sgw occurrences were found in lowlands and proximal to sapping features 3 the overwhelming majority of the cultivated lands within the southern and central sections of the wd lie within areas identified as high and very high probability sgw locations 4 our models identify two previously unrecognized major sgw occurrences an eastern zone ez length 800 km width 9 to 80 km area 43 000 km2 and an east west trending northern zone nz centered over the qattara depression length 500 km width 200 km area 62 150 km2 5 additional criteria were used to refine the modeled xgb sgw distribution southern and central wd 43 200 km2 to 23 400 km2 ez from 21 300 km2 to 17 400 and nz from 62 150 to 30 700 km2 including presence of shallow aquifers to accommodate rising nubian waters nubian water salinity fresh to brackish and low to moderate thickness 1 km of post nubian successions that rising waters interact with the techniques are cost effective and efficient and could be readily applied to large sectors of saharan africa and arabia whose landscape and fossil aquifers bear many resemblances in their geologic climatic and geomorphic characteristics to the nubian sandstone aquifer system keywords shallow groundwater arid lands remote sensing machine learning algorithms western desert egypt data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water scarcity represents one of the major challenges facing societies residing in the arid and semiarid regions of the world during the past few decades many of these arid regions endured added pressures related to excessive exploitation of their limited water resources population growth and climate change related droughts and water shortages abdelmohsen et al 2022 motagh et al 2007 wada et al 2010 in arid lands groundwater continues to be the primary source of fresh water it sustains the local communities and terrestrial ecosystems and unlike surface water is protected from severe evaporation gleeson et al 2012 the western desert wd of egypt with an average annual rainfall of 5 mm and an area of 680 000 km2 is one of the largest arid regions of the world previous studies in the deserts of egypt revealed that vast natural discharge regions and shallow near surface groundwater areas remain unidentified abotalib et al 2021 khalil et al 2021b sultan et al 2007 using a two dimensional groundwater flow model calibrated against head data from some 20 wells in wadi asyuti it was demonstrated sultan et al 2007 that a significant contribution to the asyuti groundwater system came from rising nubian sandstone aquifer system nsas groundwater 3 19 107 m3 yr 75 of incoming flow assuming geologic settings and discharge rates similar to those at asyuti 70 107 m3 yr of groundwater is available for sustainable development in similar settings around the nile river and the gulf of suez sultan et al 2007 it is advantageous to understand better the distribution of near surface discharge of the nsas that underlies the wd landscape the latter wd occupies two thirds of the territory of egypt in this study we develop and apply cost effective and reliable methodologies to identify these discharge locations across the wd the wd climate alternated between wet and dry periods during the quaternary as evidenced by the outputs of hydrologic models and the isotopic compositions and ages tens to hundreds of thousands of years of the nsas groundwater and the travertine and paleolake deposits abotalib et al 2019 haynes and haas 1980 howard and griffith 2009 pachur and hoelzmann 2000 sturchio et al 2004 aquifers across the wd were recharged during interglacial stages by the intensification of monsoons or paleowesterlies during glacial stages crombie et al 1997 sultan et al 1997a szabo et al 1995 the prolonged recharge during the wet periods elevated the aquifer s paleo piezometric surface by 25 to 100 m above the present level howard and griffith 2009 pachur and hoelzmann 2000 and caused an upward flow of pressurized gas rich groundwater along deep seated sub vertical faults abotalib and heggy 2019 the high hydraulic conductivity of fault zones and the pressure exerted by the weight of the overlying thick impermeable shales and limestone sequences facilitated the upward flow and extensive discharge surface and near surface levels abotalib et al 2021 sultan et al 2007 the prolonged groundwater discharge at the surface contributed to theater headed valleys thvs formation undermined escarpments caused them to retreat and gave way to depressions the discharge left tufa plastered on escarpment faces formed travertine around springs and spring mounds and playa deposits in depressions abotalib et al 2019 2016 during dry periods the water table declined groundwater discharge at the surface decreased escarpment retreated and deposition of tufa and playas declined or halted the pressurized groundwater accessing deep seated faults hereafter referred to as conductive faults discharged at the near surface rather than at the surface abotalib et al 2021 hegazy et al 2020 sultan et al 2007 therefore by defining the landforms attributed to natural discharge during wet climate periods one can infer the current shallow groundwater sgw locations the term sgw will be used hereafter to refer to depths to groundwater levels 50 m locally the distribution of sgw is typically identified through field based observations or geophysical techniques e g electrical resistivity and ground penetrating radar those methods are effective yet their applications over large domains are costly labor intensive and time intensive alshehri et al 2020 othman et al 2018 othman and abdelmohsen 2022 in contrast machine learning applications could offer a practical and cost effective solution to identifying sgw on regional scales machine learning is a division of artificial intelligence that relies on the notion that systems can learn from data recognize patterns and make decisions with the least human intervention bishop 2006 machine learning techniques can be used to identify sgw locations by establishing a linear or nonlinear relationship between sgw occurrences and their controlling factors and using those relationships to predict the sgw occurrences for the areas of unknown data points for example chen et al 2018 proposed an ensemble weights of evidence with logistic regression and functional tree models to identify natural groundwater discharge locations in china using topographic lithologic and land use variables naghibi et al 2020 applied machine learning algorithms extreme gradient boosting and parallel random forest to a set of dem derived parameters to identify the natural spring locations in the lorestan province of iran the main challenge of using a machine learning approach is data availability for training the models and the need for adequate input variables to explain the target which may not be available everywhere earlier attempts heavily relied on dem derived variables such as elevation slope flow direction flow accumulation and curvature naghibi et al 2020 pande et al 2020 but less so on other relevant factors e g soil moisture and vegetation intensity that correlate well with sgw occurrences alshehri et al 2020 remote sensing based datasets have been successfully used to map the spatial and temporal variations of soil moisture gao et al 2020 vegetation cover costa et al 2020 groundwater storage abdelmalik and abdelmohsen 2019 aboualy et al 2021 das et al 2018 sahour et al 2020a landforms and land surface temperature duan et al 2019 over extensive areas in this study we generate these products to identify sgw occurrences over the entire wd the earlier studies were focused on groundwater that originated from modern precipitation and used related variables such as precipitation intensity streamflow density and distance to the river das et al 2018 li et al 2019 the focus of this study is to identify sgw occurrences originating from paleo precipitation that occurred during previous wet climatic periods some tens to hundreds of thousands of years ago in the quaternary this fossil groundwater now residing in shallow aquifers originated as the natural discharge of ascending deep seated groundwater that accessed sub vertical conductive faults in our case the selected variables include remote sensing based variables indicative of near surface groundwater such as high soil moisture radar backscattering coefficient normalized difference vegetation index ndvi values and low land surface temperatures those variables could also detect sgw in modern aquifers maskooni et al 2020 however a few additional variables were selected that are unique to the investigated paleo hydrologic setting examples include geomorphological features indicative of current natural discharge locations e g proximity to active fault controlled springs or discharge locations during previous wet periods e g proximity to spring mounds or sapping features although the local communities within the wd are highly dependent on groundwater resources for drinking and agricultural purposes previous investigations aimed at identifying sgw locations are rare and local masoud and el osta 2016 we attempt to map the distribution of sgw across the entire wd the identification of the distribution of sgw occurrences is the first step towards the development of new agricultural communities and the expansion of the existing ones as well 2 geology and hydrogeology of the wd the nsas underlies the wd that extends from the libyan border to the nile river and from the mediterranean sea to the egyptian sudanese border fig 1 the mean annual precipitation of the region is 5 mm abdelmohsen et al 2019 and the mean aridity index is 0 05 sahour et al 2020 the recharge of the nsas during previous wet paleoclimatic periods in the quaternary sturchio et al 2004 sultan et al 1997b caused a significant rise of the paleo piezometric heads by as much as 100 m compared to the present day dry period abotalib et al 2019 howard and griffith 2009 pachur and hoelzmann 2000 starting in the 1950 s the egyptian government embarked on major desert reclamation projects e g the new valley project in which hundreds of deep wells 800 m were drilled increasing the extraction from the nsas from 1 km3 year in 1952 to 2 4 km3 year in 2014 omar and moussa 2016 the increase in extraction led to a drawdown of water levels by as much as 20 m in the farafra depression 10 20 m in the kharga depression and 30 m in the dakhla depression elsheikh 2015 sefelnasr et al 2015 during the previous quaternary wet periods water levels rose and groundwater discharge increased leaving behind paleolakes in the lowlands and tuffa and travertine deposits on the scarp faces of the depressions abotalib et al 2019 pachur and hoelzmann 2000 u th dating of these groundwater related deposits placed the wd wet periods in the cool pleistocene glacial periods marine isotope stage mis 6 8 10 and 12 with limited deposition during the warm interglacial periods mis 5 7 and 13 abotalib et al 2019 the modern recharge mainly occurs in the southern highlands of gebel darfur in sudan and gebel tibesti in chad where the sandstone outcrops receive precipitation of up to 96 mm year abdelmohsen et al 2019 as well as from the aswan high dam reservoir abdelmohsen et al 2020 ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 the nsas consists mainly of paleozoic and mesozoic sandstones intercalated with shallow marine tertiary carbonates and shale fig 2 the aquifer is bound by the saltwater freshwater interface in the north the basement from the east and south and the devonian bedrock from the west sultan et al 2013 the nsas consists of three subbasins dakhla kufra and northern sudan the uweinat aswan uplift separates the dakhla and northern sudan subbasins and the uweinat howar uplift separates northern sudan from the kufra subbasin hesse et al 1987 water in the kufra subbasin flows from the south to the north and in the dakhla subbasin from the south southwest to north northeast average gradient 0 5 m km and discharges at oases and lowlands thorweihe and heinl 2002 the natural losses due to evaporation are estimated at 15 4 106 m3 year in the farafra depression 23 8 106 m3 year in the bahariya depression 32 106 m3 year in the dakhla depression 34 106 m3 year in the kharga depression 28 106 m3 year in the siwa depression and up to 360 106 m3 year in the qattara depression brinkmann et al 1987 rigw wsc 1989 the nsas comprises two distinct units the nubian aquifer system nas and the post nubian aquifer system pnas the nas is composed mainly of sandstone and the pnas of carbonates bakhbakhi 2006 the landscape across the nsas is dominated by extensive outcrops of flat topped carbonate plateaus and natural depressions bound by escarpments thvs are found along the length of the escarpments and playas and tufa deposits in areas proximal to the cliffs the development of thvs depressions escarpments and other groundwater related deposits e g playas and tufa support the near surface discharge of groundwater during the wet paleoclimate periods abotalib et al 2016 the age of the groundwater in the nsas ranges from a few thousand years in the south i e near the uweinat uplift haynes and haas 1980 to one million years near the bahariya oasis in the north sturchio et al 2004 and is consistent with southwest to northeast groundwater flow from a recharge area near the uweinat uplift 3 data and methodology we conducted a fourfold exercise to identify the sgw locations in the wd of egypt representing the bulk of the area occupied by the dakhla subbasin we identified variables affecting sgw occurrence and randomly divided the data into two training and testing subsets the former was used to develop the models and the latter to evaluate the performance of the models step i the relationship between sgw occurrence and its controlling factors was established using three machine learning algorithms extreme gradient boosting xgb support vector machine svm and logistic regression lr then the performance of each model was evaluated to select the optimum model step ii the trained models were applied to the available input variables to map the sgw across the entire wd step iii finally the outputs of the models were refined using additional geological constraints to identify areas better suited for agricultural development step iv a detailed explanation of the data and adopted methodology is described below 3 1 data the output or target is sgw occurrence the inputs are variables affecting or correlating with it including elevation slope curvature distance to sapping features soil moisture radar backscatter coefficient ndvi and land surface temperature the selection of the input variables was based on our understanding of the study area s geologic setting the groundwater s origin as indicated by its isotopic composition and lessons learned from similar earlier studies 3 1 1 shallow and deep groundwater training points the sgw points were identified primarily from spring locations natural groundwater discharge 173 points and a few others 28 points from watermelon field locations spring is a point at which groundwater flows at the earth s surface gholami et al 2021 therefore the groundwater level in those areas is shallow the watermelon fields are other indicators of the sgw areas across the wd in those areas local farmers use near surface groundwater to irrigate their fields we chose the spring and water melon locations as our target groundwater levels from existing wells were not selected as targets monitoring wells are rare in the western desert and productive wells water levels have been compromised by excessive extraction since the 1960 s the extraction caused a dramatic drop in water levels el rawy and smedt 2020 thus the present groundwater levels do not represent the static levels in the area we identified areas characterized by sgw occurrences and others by deep groundwater non sgw points for training purposes we selected 201 sgw points and 399 deep groundwater points from regions of high elevation and deep water table levels 3 1 2 topographic features a digital elevation model dem produced by the shuttle radar topography mission srtm farr et al 2007 with a spatial resolution of 30 m was used to extract topographic features including elevation slope and profile curvature the surface elevations in the wd ranged from 5 to 1 115 m mean elevation 337 6 m above mean sea level table 1 in general the higher the surface elevation the larger the depth to the water table and vice versa for low surface elevations the slope fig 3 was derived from the dem using the slope function in arcgis the slope in most parts of the wd ranged from 0 to 77 average 2 9 table 1 many of the springs target are found along or proximal to the intersection of two or more faults that bound cliffs along which deep seated groundwater in the confined sections of the nsas ascend and discharge at surface or near surface elevations abotalib et al 2016 the curvature function moore et al 1991 describes deviations from a straight line or a plane surface the earth s surface can be concave negative curvature value or convex positive curvature value the curvature in the wd ranges between 7 5 and 9 7 average 0 table 1 concave surfaces especially those at lower elevations could be indicative of the distribution of depressions in which sgw is likely to be found 3 1 3 distance to sapping features dts groundwater sapping is a process of headward movement of channels in response to concentrated groundwater discharge which alters the earth s surface s physical and chemical structure at the seepage site laity and malin 1985 these alterations form theater shaped channel heads and u shaped valleys that are indications of sgw presence the distribution of the thvs was mapped across the wd using a gis based lr model that predicted the presence or absence of thvs based on values of a set of predictor variables all of which were extracted from remote sensing and geological datasets abotalib et al 2016 the areas near these landforms are more likely to have a near surface groundwater table therefore the dts fig 3 was selected as one of the sgw predictors to be included in the model s inputs the dts in the study area ranged from 0 to 391 km average 78 4 km the distance from each pixel to the nearest sapping feature was calculated using the proximity tool which measures the shortest separation between two elements fig 3 3 1 4 soil moisture sms in many sgw areas e g lowlands and river valleys the groundwater table and the presence of hydraulic gradients between the saturated zone and the root zone lead to a continuous supply of groundwater to the root zone chen and hu 2004 therefore soil moisture is expected to be higher in sgw areas alshehri et al 2020 the level 2 l2 smap sentinel 1 soil moisture data das et al 2020 2019 was obtained from the national snow and ice data center available at https nsidc org these data present land surface conditions retrieved by the soil moisture active passive smap radiometer and the european space agency s sentinel 1a and 1b sar constellation there were 154 scenes over the study area from multiple data acquisitions from 2015 to 2016 the data underwent preprocessing data conversion and mosaicking the final soil moisture map is the average of multiple scenes fig 3 the soil moisture in the study area ranged from 0 02 to 0 46 cm3 cm3 average 0 07 cm3 cm3 table 1 3 1 5 radar backscatter coefficient radar backscatter coefficient rbc in decibels was extracted from sentinel 1 satellite data spatial resolution 12 m 12 m which uses synthetic aperture radar sar operating in the c band wavelength region 3 8 to 7 5 cm of the electromagnetic spectrum the ascending acquisition of the sentinel 1a ground range detected grd scenes https asf alaska edu was selected due to the availability of the images over the wd region the data underwent co registration radiometric calibration and extraction of rbc beta naught β0 rbc has proven to be an effective parameter for monitoring the hydrological compartments of the earth including soil moisture alexakis et al 2017 wetland water level dynamics kim et al 2014 sahour et al 2021a and flooding events zeng et al 2020 a static regional sentinel 1 rbc image fig 3 was generated from 18 scenes acquired in june 2016 rbc values are expected to be high over shallow sgw locations and to vary in response to temporal variation of the groundwater table the rbc in the study area ranged from 33 to 6 db average 20 db 3 1 6 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the landsat derived ndvi products spatial resolution 30 m 30 m obtained from usgs earth resources observation and science eros available at https espa cr usgs gov were used as one of the input variables the data provide consistent spatial and temporal variation of vegetation cover over the region of interest the average image fig 3 was calculated from multitemporal scenes 29 tiles 1235 landsat 8 16 daily ndvi dataset 2013 04 2017 10 covering the study area in arid and semiarid regions sgw availability is a crucial factor affecting vegetation dynamics with sgw s presence the root zones of natural vegetation can reach the water table gholami and sahour 2022 huang et al 2019 therefore high ndvi values from natural vegetation can potentially indicate sgw locations the ndvi in the study area ranged from 0 76 to 0 72 average 0 1 table 1 3 1 7 land surface temperature the modis terra land surface temperature lst kelvin products spatial resolution 0 05 0 05 were obtained from nasa s modis processing website available at https modis gsfc nasa gov the data provide consistent spatial and temporal variation of brightness temperature bt over the study area the average image was calculated from multiple modis 8 daily thermal datasets 2 tiles 790 scenes 2009 01 2017 07 lst is expected to be lower in the areas characterized by sgw alkhaier et al 2012 previous studies used lst as a proxy of soil moisture status showing significant correlation values cammalleri et al 2015 3 2 methods sgw prediction models the entire dataset inputs and output was normalized and divided into two subsets for training and testing we used 75 of the total data 450 points for training and 25 250 points to evaluate the models the multicollinearity was tested using the variance inflation factor vif multicollinearity is a condition in which two or more explanatory variables are highly correlated a common problem in linear models e g lr vif is one of the most widely used detecting tests for multicollinearity it determines how much the variance of a coefficient is inflated because of linear dependencies with other explanatory variables alin 2010 considering a threshold of 10 for vif no multicollinearity was detected among the individual variables table 1 three machine learning algorithms xgb svm and lr were used to extract the relationship between sgw occurrence and its controlling factors lr can be well trained if a linear relationship between input and the target is expected lr can avoid overfitting and make feature selection using regularization however the performance of lr is limited to a large number of features with the presence of nonlinearity in the case of svm a linear kernel was adopted making it comparable to the structure of lr the advantage of using svm and xgb over lr is handling the nonlinear relationships between inputs and the target the xgb is a tree based model consisting of many trees 500 in this study to make decisions on the predictable outcome and repeat as many as needed to reach a certain level of accuracy fan et al 2018 the models are described as follows 3 2 1 logistic regression model lr lr is a capable model for predicting the presence or absence of an outcome based on a set of explanatory variables values lr is used to address classification problems when the dependent variable is binary in nature in this study the output is a binary variable representing the presence or absence of sgw the relationship between the sgw occurrence and its dependency on several independent variables can be expressed as follows kleinbaum and klein 2002 1 p x 1 1 e z where p x is the probability of sgw presence probability varies between 0 and 1 on an s shaped curve and z is the linear combination it follows that the lr involves fitting an equation of the following form to the data the regression line for n independent variables x1 x2 xn can be explained as follows 2 z b0 b1x1 b2x2 bnxn 3 2 2 support vector machine svm svm is a supervised learning method for classification and regression problems that belong to the family of generalized linear classifiers in other terms svm is a prediction tool that uses machine learning theory to maximize predictive accuracy while automatically avoiding over fit to the data vapnik 1999 svm can be defined as systems that use hypothesis space of linear functions in a high dimensional feature space trained with a learning algorithm from the optimization theory kanevski et al 2009 svm can be visualized as a surface that creates a boundary between plotted points in a multidimensional space representing their feature values the goal of an svm is to create a flat border called ahyperplane which divides the space into relatively homogeneous partitions on either side hofmann 2006 in n dimensional space a hyperplane is defined by w x b 0 where x is an observed vector w is a vector of n weights w 1 w 2 w n and b is a single number known as the bias the bias is conceptually equivalent to the intercept in the slope intercept form of a straight line hofmann 2006 the goal of the svm process is to find a set of weights that specify two hyperplanes as eq 3 3 w x b 1 w x b 1 vector geometry defines the distance between these two planes as 2 w where w is the euclidian distance between w and the origin it is desired to maximize the separation between the two planes in such a way that the problem becomes 4 min w 1 2 w y i w x i b 1 the second line notes that this minimization is subject to the condition that each of the y i data points are correctly classified here y i indicates the class value transformed either to 1 or 1 to address the nonlinearity problem a kernel function was applied to transform the input data into a high dimensional feature space model optimization was performed on the three primary parameters of the svm model these three parameters are the regularization parameter gamma and margin of tolerance al fugara et al 2020 the regularization parameter c prevents over fitting and determines the influence of the misclassification on the objective function the gamma γ parameter controls the nonlinearity of the kernel function the margin of tolerance ε determines the distance from the decision surface to the closest data point chapelle et al 2002 3 2 3 xgb xgb chen and guestrin 2016 is a scalable learning algorithm based on gradient boosting boosted regression trees were applied successfully to address regression and classification problems e g sahour et al 2021 in essence the boosting algorithm advances the bias variance tradeoff by starting with a weak model and sequentially enhancing its performance by constructing new trees where the prediction from each new tree is updated by reducing the residual error from the former tree in the sequence xgb is a significant improvement over gradient boosting in gradient boosting we start with a set of input variables x 1 x n to predict a set of corresponding target values y 1 y n we fit a model f x y and minimize the sum of the loss function j by improving the model f x 5 j i 1 n l y i f x i where l is a differentiable convex loss function that measures the difference between the prediction f x and the target y friedman and meulman 2003 the modeling process in xgb began by calculating the negative gradients of j with respect to f xi j f x i in the next step a classification tree h was fitted to negative gradients j f x i and f xi was updated with f xi γ h where γ is the step size to reach the estimated minimum of j this iteration was performed to achieve the minimum difference between prediction and observation chen and guestrin 2016 in xgb the loss function is 6 j i 1 n l y i f x i h ω h where 7 ω h γ t 1 2 λ ω 2 here t is the number of leaves in the tree and ω is the leaf weights the function ω penalizes the complexity of the model chen and guestrin 2016 the optimal weight ω of leaf j was calculated as follows 8 ω j j g j j h j λ where g j j f x i and h j is the j th classification tree fitted to g j then the optimal value of the loss function was calculated 9 1 2 j 1 t j g j 2 j h j λ γ t the additional regularization term helps to smooth the final learned weights to avoid over fitting intuitively the regularized objective will tend to select a model employing simple and predictive functions chen and guestrin 2016 parameter tuning was performed to construct the optimum structure of the xgb model the parameters that underwent optimization are the number of trees lambda alpha gamma maximum depth and learning rate lambda is a regularization function to control over fitting in the training step alpha is another regularization term that regulates the speed by which an algorithm works by varying the assigned weights in high dimensional problems the learning rate eta specifies the participation of each tree and reduces overfitting maximum depth determines the maximum number of end nodes in each leaf of the trees and gamma defines the lowest loss reduction needed for additional splits in each tree 3 3 evaluation of model performance the machine learning algorithms for classifying sgw locations were evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic roc curve roc is a graphical plot showing a model s diagnostic ability as its discrimination threshold is varied the roc plot displays false and true positive rates on the x and y axes respectively hand and till 2001 in addition to the roc curve the area under the roc curve auc accuracy kappa specificity and sensitivity indices were also used to validate the models the evaluation was carried out on the test subset which was not used for developing the models variable importance vi was implemented to analyze the strength of the relationships between sgw and its controlling factors in each model the vi was calculated by the sum of the decreases in the errors when split by an individual variable then the relative importance is the vi of a particular variable divided by the highest vi value 4 results and discussion 4 1 correlation of variables model performance and variable importance the optimum number of trees in the xgb model was found to be 500 optimum values are presented in table 2 for lambda 0 1 alpha 0 75 gamma 0 5 maximum depth 10 and learning rate 0 01 the optimized parameters for the svm model including the optimal value of sigma 0 1 the number of support vectors 1 object function linear classification and training error 0 01 are presented in table 3 the xgb produced the highest accuracy among the three models in both the training and testing stages followed by the svm and lr the values of auc accuracy specificity sensitivity and kappa coefficients for the three models used on the training and testing sets are shown in tables 4 and 5 respectively the roc curves of the three algorithms used are depicted in fig 4 the area under roc curves auc ranges between 0 and 1 a higher auc value indicates an enhanced performance of an algorithm fig 4 given that the xgb produced the highest accuracy among the three models on both the testing and training datasets the xgb model outputs were considered the best results among the three models once the optimum structures of the individual models were constructed the set of available variables was used as inputs to the trained models to predict the sgw locations across the entire wd of egypt we classified the results based on the range of probabilities into four classes low medium high and very high probabilities table 6 all three models showed almost the same order in the relative importance of the variables vi the highest vi was associated with elevation followed by dts slope rbc ndvi sms and bt curvature and lst were excluded from the set of input variables due to their statistical insignificance the dts and dem values are highly correlated with and indicative of sgw occurrences regardless of whether the sgw is a few meters or tens of meters deep in contrast the remaining remote sensing factors rbc ndvi sms and bt correlate well with sgw occurrences that are a few meters deep but are insensitive to groundwater tens of meters deep moreover they are associated with factors other than sgw occurrences as well for example 1 high ndvi values are observed over farms irrigated by waters extracted from deep wells 2 high rbs values over areas characterized by rough topography e g sabkhas and 3 low bt and high sms over mountainous areas where the temperatures are low cool and surfaces are less dry these reasons explain why these factors are less important than the dts and dem in identifying the sgw occurrences in our study area 4 2 distribution of modeled sgw the patterns of sgw occurrences from the three models are remarkably similar fig 6a 6b and 6c yet their spatial extent could vary from one model to another for example the distribution of the very high probability areas for sgw in the xgb model 36 190 km2 exceeded that from the svm 14 600 km2 which in turn surpassed the very high probability areas for sgw from the lr results 12 400 km2 4 2 1 distribution of modeled sgw in relation to lowlands and sapping features sgw occurrences are largely controlled by low surface elevations and small dts fig 5 the figure displays the relative importance of each independent variable the dem was the most important variable xgb 37 svm 23 and lr 18 followed by the dts xgb 21 svm 21 and lr 16 the importance of these two variables is corroborated by the spatial correspondence between the areas of the high and the very high probability of sgw modeled occurrences hereafter referred to as modeled xgb svm or lrs sgw occurrences with the distribution of lowlands and sapping features fig 6 fig 6 shows the modeled lr fig 6a svm fig 6b and xgb sgw occurrences fig 6c and fig 6d displays the distribution of modeled xgb sgw occurrences the sapping features and the lowlands fig 6c and d show that the modeled xgb sgw occurrences are located in the lowlands namely the depressions and oases kharga dakhla farafra siwa baharyia and qattara where the elevations are low range 128 to 150 m a m s l compared to their surroundings 200 to 500 m a m s l this is also true for the modeled lr and svm sgw occurrences fig 6a b and d this is to be expected given that the gradient of the groundwater in the wd is gentle 0 00038 mohamed et al 2016 resulting in a difference of 350 m in groundwater levels across the entire extent of the dakhla subbasin in the wd i e 900 km in extension under such conditions the depth to groundwater will be largely controlled by the land surface elevation the lower the surface elevation the shallower the groundwater levels and vice versa for high surface elevations in these oases and depressions many karstic features e g speleothems flowstones chalk pillars and dissolution caves indicative of sgw discharge and processes were reported abdelmohsen et al 2019 aref et al 1987 butzer 1965 el gammal 2010 mostafa 2013 ruggieri 2001 inspection of fig 6d shows that the modeled xgb sgw occurrences are proximal to the distribution of sapping features where the dts in these areas ranges from 1 to 10 km this is also true for the modeled lr and svm sgw occurrences fig 6a 6b and 6d this is expected given that sapping features developed in areas where ascending groundwater along deep seated conductive faults undermined the cliffs and discharged at surface elevations in previous wet climatic periods and possibly at near surface elevations under the present dry conditions thus the distribution of sapping features mark the location of conductive faults ascending groundwater and surface to near surface groundwater elevations the remaining variables slope rbc ndvi sms and bt are significant yet less important 2 to 16 fig 5 than the dem and dts 4 2 2 distribution of modeled sgw in relation to sgw aquifers one of the conditions for the preservation of the ascending groundwater is the presence of lithologic units at the surface near surface or at shallow depths 50 m that can host the rising waters within the areas identified by statistical models as high and very high probability areas for sgw occurrences hereafter referred to as shallow aquifers these include a wide range of lithological units 32 formations supplementary dataset 1 extending from quaternary sand sheets and dunes into upper jurassic sandstone formations el hinnawi et al 2006 with the moghra and marmarica aquifers showing the largest areal extent the moghra aquifer up to 500 m thick is composed of intercalated fluvial sands and clays abotalib and mohamed 2013 the marmarica aquifer up to 150 m thick at east siwa oasis consists of karstified limestone calcarenite and fractured marly limestone ghobashy et al 2021 in the generation of shallow aquifer coverage areas showing evidence of excessive salinization of soils e g sabkhas due to continuous discharge and evaporation of discharged groundwater at surface and near surface elevations were excluded a high correspondence is observed between the distribution of such aquifers 95 000 km2 and that of the modeled xgb sgw 126 000 km2 fig 7 a the area of overlap 71 000 km2 between the two coverages is hereafter referred to as selected sgw occurrences in the study area 4 2 3 distribution of modeled sgw in relation to agricultural communities in the southern and central sections comparison of the distribution of modeled xgb sgw occurrences with the distribution of vegetated areas mostly cultivated areas extracted from google earth images fig 6c shows that the overwhelming majority of cultivated areas in the southern and central sections of the wd are within the modeled xgb sgw occurrences however the selected sgw occurrences in the central and southern sections 43 200 km2 far exceed the cultivated areas 2 000 km2 fig 6c 7b as indicated in the earlier section the selected sgw areas are represented by the intersection of the distribution of shallow aquifers and that of the modeled xgb sgw the majority of the cultivated areas in those sections of the wd are located in the kharga baris dakhla farafra and bahariya oases and their surroundings fig 6c that is to be expected given that our selection targets spring locations where agricultural communities started in ancient and historical time periods during the ancient egyptian darnell and haddad 2003 and the roman eras bagnall et al 2006 up to the 1950 s the overwhelming majority of the cultivated land in the wd was irrigated by naturally flowing springs and hand dug shallow wells since that date the continuous and progressive extraction of groundwater has led to the reduction or cessation of flowing springs the development of cones of depression over areas of high extraction and the lowering of the water table in the shallow aquifers at many of these locations a large cone of depression was reported from the dakhla oasis with a diameter exceeding 30 km and a drop in water level by some 40 m in the center of the cone similarly a large cone of depression was reported from abu munqar area with a width of 10 km and a drop of 35 m in water level ebraheem et al 2004 elsheikh 2015 thus only in areas distant 30 km from these cones of depressions would we expect to observe the predicted sgw occurrences 4 2 4 distribution of sgw in northern and eastern wd there are two areas where the spatial correlation of the distribution of existing agricultural communities with modeled xgb sgw occurrences is not as clear as they are in the central and southern sections of the wd fig 6c in those areas there are large stretches of modeled sgw occurrences that are devoid of cultivated lands the first occurs along a stretch of land that extends east and west of the qattara depression and north and south of it extending some 500 km in length and 200 km in width and covering an approximate area of 62 150 km2 fig 6c 7a hereafter referred to as the northern zone nz the second one occurs along a zone that runs subparallel to and west of the nile valley hereafter referred to as the eastern zone ez the ez extends for some 800 km in length ranges from 9 to 80 km in width and covers an approximate area of 21 300 km2 within each of the two zones shallow aquifers that accommodate rising waters were identified fig 7a the figure shows a high correspondence between the distribution of the modeled xgb sgw occurrences and that of shallow aquifers supplementary dataset 1 at surface near surface or shallow depths 50 m the ez is bound on the east by the nile valley and on the west by the eocene plateau the zone is dissected by a complex of dip slip fault systems that are subparallel to the faults bounding the nile valley graben abotalib and mohamed 2013 sultan et al 2007 the zone stands 50 m above the adjacent nile valley yet below the eocene plateau by 200 to 400 m only recently in the past three to four decades farmers within the nile valley realized that they could cultivate areas within the ez by tapping sgw within the alluvial sediments and fractured eocene aquifer within the adjacent ez google earth images over the ez show that some 2 566 km2 are already cultivated comparison of the distribution of modeled xgb sgw occurrences within the ez with the distribution of cultivated areas fig 6c 7a shows that the overwhelming majority of cultivated areas in the ez are within the modeled xgb sgw occurrences however the selected sgw occurrences in this zone 17 400 km2 far exceed the developed regions 2 566 km2 fig 6c and 7b the lowlands within the nz like the ones in the central sections of the wd discharge at surface and near surface levels forming springs and oases e g sitra el bahrain and nawamisa fig 1 yet the population and agricultural communities have remained limited in size throughout historical periods we suspect this is partly due to differences in water quality the delineated nz aligns with a brackish water zone zone ii fig 7a in the nas that represents a transition from the freshwater zone to the south of lat 29 n zone i 500 ppm fig 6c 7 to the brine water zone 100 000 ppm north of lat 31 n dabous and osmond 2001 fig 6c 7 moreover the presence of thick up to 1 5 km successions of carbonates marl and shales overlying the upper cretaceous nas horizon in the nz compared to the central sections typically 0 200 m thick thorweihe 1990 increases the salinity of the rising nubian waters through water rock interactions before discharge at surface and near surface elevations abotalib et al 2021 the reported salinity from wells penetrating the miocene aquifer in the nz ranged from 1200 to 9800 mg l gomaa et al 2021 in a few localized areas e g el moghra oasis the water salinity could reach up to 14 000 mg l eltarabily and moghazy 2021 although most of the nz s sgw might not be suitable for human consumption they could be used for growing salt tolerant crop types e g olives citrus beet barley sunflower canola quinoa jojoba barbary fig and jatropha some crops can tolerate salinities of up to 10 000 ppm eltarabily and moghazy 2021 rugini and fedeli 1990 of particular interest are the areas south of the qattara depression the selection of those areas can potentially serve the development of agricultural communities and reduce losses to discharge and evaporation as described earlier the discharge of the nsas in the qattara depression is estimated at 0 36 km3 year brinkmann et al 1987 rigw wsc 1989 at present all such waters are lost to evaporation leaving behind thick 5 30 m aref et al 2002 sabkha deposits we used two additional criteria to select sgw locations within the nz first the chosen areas lie to the south of zone iii fig 7b where the salinity of the rising nubian waters can approach that of brines dabous and osmond 2001 second the selected areas should be in areas where the depth to the nubian sandstone dtn is relatively shallow 1 km these areas lie to the south of the dtn threshold line in fig 7b the dtn could reach up to 4 km north of the line bosworth and tari 2021 in areas south of the dtn threshold line the dtn is relatively shallow and the thickness of the post nubian succession is relatively small tens to hundreds of meters inspection of cross section a aʹ within the eastern sections of the nz fig 7b and 8a shows outcrops of the nss in the south where the baharia monocline exposes the nss at the surface it also reveals a south to north increase in dtn reaching some 3 km in the abu gharadig basin bosworth and tari 2021 similarly the dtn increases in the central sections of the nz from a few hundred meters in the south up to 1 km in the north cross section b bʹ fig 7b and 8b the western sections of the nz have thick nss successions thickness up to 4 km deposited in paleozoic basins deep basement 3 4 km deep and thin overburden of upper cretaceous and paleogene rocks cross section c cʹ fig 7b and 8c we assume that the shallower the dtn the lesser the interactions of the rising nubian waters with the country rocks before discharge at the surface or near surface elevations this assumption is supported by the low salinity 700 mg l of sgw from kharga and dakhla oases where the dtn does not exceed 500 m mahmoud and ghoubachi 2017 and by the high salinities 7500 mg l of sgw in areas where the dtn exceeded 1 km araffa et al 2021 using the modeled xgb sgw occurrences and the presence of a shallow aquifer earlier criteria and two additional criteria presence within zones i or ii shallow basement we estimate that the selected sgw locations within the nz occupy 30 700 km2 fig 7b 4 2 5 origin of groundwater in the selected shallow aquifers one of the pieces of evidence for the advocated model natural discharge of the nsas at near surface levels within the central and southern sections of the wd and the nz and ez is the depleted isotopic composition of groundwater from shallow aquifers within those areas and the similarity in their isotopic compositions to those of the underlying nsas groundwaters for example in the natural depressions oases the nas is exposed at or near the surface and artesian springs discharge fossil nas water the isotopic composition of those artesian waters is indicative of recharge at previous cooler continental conditions δ18o 11 to 8 5 and δ2h 90 to 80 abotalib et al 2016 awad 2006 the groundwater from the marmarica aquifer in siwa oasis within the nz is similar in its isotopic composition δ18o 11 to 8 and δ2h 85 to 70 to the spring discharge in the southern oases and different from modern waters including nile water before the construction of the aswan high dam δ18o 1 to 7 and δ2h 3 7 to 30 el bakri et al 1991 abotalib et al 2016 and the weighted average of modern precipitation over northern egypt δ18o 6 33 and δ2h 38 75 khalil et al 2021b to the east of the siwa oasis several small lakes e g sitra el bahrain and nawamisa are found within lowlands and along the extension of east west and northwest southeast trending faults cziesla et al 1993 we interpret the lakes as locations of natural discharge and the surrounding areas as potential regions for agricultural development these lakes are surrounded by outcrops of the hamra formation composed mainly of white to grayish white limestone with intercalations of conglomerates and sandy beds el hinnawi et al 2006 and thus could potentially represent a suitable aquifer to accommodate groundwater discharge similar phenomena were reported from the eastern and western deserts of egypt sultan et al 2007 showed that discharge of the nubian aquifer is occurring on a large scale primarily through deep seated fault systems that bound the nile valley graben they stated that ascending groundwater discharges into relatively thick alluvial aquifers proximal to the fault complex that defines the nile valley the authors provided isotopic and geochemical analyses along with field and remote sensing data and hydrologic models in support of their conceptual model groundwater samples from alluvial and fractured eocene aquifers in central nile valley between el menia and beni suef within the ez have depleted isotopic compositions indicative of focused recharge from the nas δ18o 9 93 δ2h 79 05 or intermediate isotopic values indicative of mixing of nas water with modern nile waters abotalib et al 2021 4 3 applications and limitations of the adopted methodology in this section we discuss the applications and limitations of the adopted methodology for mapping sgw in the study area and similar settings elsewhere section 4 3 1 and the potential for building on our findings to identify areas most suited for agricultural development section 4 3 2 4 3 1 applications and limitations for sgw detection in similar settings the applied methodologies are cost effective and efficient techniques that could be readily applied to large sectors of saharan africa and arabia whose landscape and fossil aquifers bear many resemblances in their geologic climatic and geomorphic characteristics to the nsas for example as with the nsas the north western sahara aquifer system nwsas area 1 2 million km2 in algeria tunisia and libya and the mega aquifer system mas area 2 106 km2 in saudi arabia oman and united arab emirates are differentiated into two major units a lower continental unit and an upper marine carbonate dominated unit the nsas is dissected by deep seated fault systems including reactivated northwest southeast trending najd faults northeast southwest and northeast east southwest west trending faults of the pelusian system and east west trending faults of the nubia fault system abotalib et al 2016 mohamed et al 2016 the nwsas is dissected by north south trending horsts and grabens of the amguid el biod ridge which extends for 650 km in the central sections of the aquifer kerdjidj 2005 the mas is also dissected by multiple fault orientations particularly in rub al khali area including reactivated northwest southeast trending najd faults and northeast southwest trending systems of hercynian age stewart 2016 these tectonic elements act as hydraulic conduits and allow cross formation flow between the various aquifers kalbus et al 2011 un escwa and bgr 2013 all three aquifers were primarily recharged by autochthonous precipitation during the more humid climatic conditions that prevailed across the saharan arabian desert belt during the pleistocene sturchio et al 2004 sultan et al 2008 yet they receive limited modern recharge locally at present abotalib et al 2016 sultan et al 2019 the fossil nature of the aquifers was inferred from the depleted isotopic o h composition of its groundwater compared to modern precipitation and from the progressive increase in the residence time up to 1 million years old of the groundwater with increasing distance from the recharge areas abotalib et al 2019 sturchio et al 2004 the three aquifers nsas nwsas mas display similar natural discharge patterns within the lowlands including evaporative sabkha and chotts e g qattara depression in egypt chott el djerid in tunisia ouargla oasis in algeria and uruq al mu taridah in saudi arabia gaye et al 2005 matter et al 2015 salem and pallas 2002 youcef and hamdi aïssa 2014 zouari et al 2011 and excavations in the carbonate plateaus e g farafra and baharia depressions in egypt al jaghbub oasis in libya ouargla oasis in algeria rub al khali depression in saudi arabia the sabkhas chotts and excavations in the plateau are surface manifestations of the vertical connection between deep and shallow aquifers along deep seated faults thvs are ubiquitous in all three aquifers and share common characteristics these include local structural control along pre existing structural discontinuities minimal upstream contribution areas and within the confined sections of the aquifers and along the escarpment face the model has its limitations machine learning models require extensive training data to develop meaningful relationships between the input variables and the target data availability is one of the significant challenges in machine learning based modeling and mapping adequate sgw location data may not be available everywhere hindering our methodology in data deficit areas especially those with different hydroclimatic and geological settings in our study we would have preferred to have the depth to water table from monitoring wells across the entire wd as our target dataset unfortunately monitoring wells in the wd is minimal we addressed this limitation by using the location of springs as our target instead we should not expect all sgw occurrences to be associated with springs thus the model application could have missed a subset of these sgw occurrences the application of the model could be readily facilitated by identifying conductive faults however mapping faults across the wd is hindered by the advance of quaternary sand sheets and dunes that cover large sectors of the wd and conceal the underlying fault patterns fig 1 the orientation of a fault in relation to the direction of groundwater flow can determine whether it acts as a preferred conduit or impediment to groundwater flow faults intersecting the groundwater flow at low angles capture groundwater flow whereas those obstructing the flow at high angles impound groundwater mohamed et al 2015 in addition the vertical conductivity of the fault plane is affected by several factors including the sense of displacement nature of fault damage zones the thickness of the fault core and whether it is active or non active attwa et al 2021 gudmundsson 2001 khalil et al 2021a given the above reasons we elected not to use the mapped distribution of faults as one of the model s independent variables instead we believe that the distribution of sapping features that we found to be one of the most significant independent variables refer to section 4 2 2 mimics the distribution of conductive faults after all the sapping features were formed as described earlier refer to section 1 by the ascent of pressurized groundwater through deep seated faults which caused prolonged and extensive discharge undermined escarpments incised thvs and promoted scarp retreat in this respect the present distribution of thvs mimics the approximate distribution of conductive faults that incised the existing thvs however our application did not account for the overall distribution of conductive faults through which earlier groundwater discharge episodes occurred those episodes must have undermined the carbonate plateau that had a much broader and earlier extent across the wd abotalib et al 2016 the model must have also missed a subset of sgw occurrences in areas where pressurized groundwater discharge on or near the surface exists but not the lithological and topographic settings favorable for thv formation given the above mentioned limitations the identified sgw occurrences should be considered as a minimum distribution 4 3 2 model applications for agricultural development although this research aims to develop cost effective methodologies for mapping sgw in arid lands the identified distribution of sgw could potentially be used as one of the criteria but not the only criterion for selecting areas targeted for land reclamation and agricultural development a few of these conditions should be considered for additional refinements of the model outputs if it is to be used for the development of farming communities those should be restricted to areas where the concentration of conductive faults and sgw were verified where thick shallow aquifers crop out or were reported and where water quality is suitable for agriculture development this task can be accomplished using standard geophysical geochemical and subsurface data very low frequency vlf techniques have been successfully used in the egyptian deserts to identify water bearing high angle conductive faults mohamed et al 2015 sultan et al 2011 and electrical resistivity for estimating the depth to water table el saadawy et al 2020 additional preferences and exclusions could be considered these include desirable soil types climate proximity to urban centers road networks etc exclusions could comprise areas covered by excessive dune fields or mined areas dating from the second world war aquifer testing should be conducted in any of the selected sgw occurrences to identify sustainable extraction scenarios for irrigation from the identified discharge layer s 5 summary groundwater is the primary water resource in arid and semiarid regions of the world yet identifying potential groundwater extraction locations is challenging field based techniques e g electrical resistivity and ground penetrating radar are often useful and accurate however applying those methods over extensive areas is challenging we developed and tested a methodology based on available remote sensing topographic and geomorphologic datasets and machine learning algorithms to map the sgw areas across egypt s wd the machine learning algorithms final inputs were elevation distance to sapping features slope radar backscatter coefficient ndvi soil moisture and bt these data were used to model the sgw locations applying three machine learning algorithms xgb svm and lr and the results were tested by comparing the predicted and observed sgw locations the xgb accuracy 0 93 kappa 0 85 outperformed the svm accuracy 0 87 kappa 0 71 and lr accuracy 0 80 kappa 0 65 algorithms during the accuracy assessment the models were used to map the sgw locations across the entire study area given that the xgb produced the highest accuracy among the three models on both the testing and training datasets the xgb model outputs were considered to be the optimum results among the three models low surface elevations and small dts primarily controlled the modeled sgw occurrences the importance of these two variables is corroborated by the spatial correspondence between the areas of the high probability of sgw occurrences model outputs with the distribution of lowlands kharga dakhla farafra farafra siwa baharyiah and qattara depressions and sapping features in the wd the remaining variables slope rbc ndvi sms and bt were significant yet less important than the dem and dts this is because these independent variables are sensitive to sgw occurrences that are a few meters deep but not groundwater tens of meters deep moreover the remaining variables are influenced by factors other than sgw occurrences the overwhelming majority of the currently cultivated lands within the central and southern sections of the investigated area are within regions modeled as high and very high priority xgb sgw locations in contrast our models identify two previously unrecognized significant sgw occurrences in the northern and eastern parts of the wd the first the eastern zone ez runs subparallel to the nile valley and to the west of it extends for some 800 km in length and 9 to 80 km in width and covers an approximate area of 21 300 km2 the second zone the northern zone nz occurs along a stretch of land that extends east and west of the qattara depression and to the north and south of it covering an approximate area of 62 150 km2 the modeled sgw occurrences covered 43 200 km2 in the central and southern sections of the study area 21 300 km2 in the ez and 62 150 in the nz using the presence of shallow aquifers within those areas as additional criteria for refining the modeled sgw distribution the optimum sgw was estimated at 23 400 km2 in the central and southern sections of the wd and 17 400 km2 in the ez we used two additional conditions to refine the sgw locations in the nz the first is placement in areas where the rising nubian waters are fresh or brackish within zones i or ii but not in regions where the nubian waters are saline zone iii the second is placement in areas where post nubian successions are limited in thickness dtn 1 km the rising nubian waters do not undergo extensive interactions with thick post nubian sequences in those areas using the conditions mentioned above the optimum sgw was estimated at 30 700 km2 in the nz of the wd the adopted techniques are cost effective and efficient and could be applied to large sectors of saharan africa and arabia whose landscape and fossil aquifers bear many resemblances in their geologic climatic and geomorphic characteristics to the nsas these include but are not limited to the nwsas area 1 2 106 km2 in algeria tunisia and libya and the mega aquifer system mas area 2 106 km2 in saudi arabia oman and united arab emirates likewise the adopted techniques could be applied to other arid regions worldwide with similar fossil aquifer settings credit authorship contribution statement hossein sahour

2822,the focus of this study is to locate shallow groundwater sgw occurrences in arid lands using the western desert wd area 680 000 km2 of egypt as a test site the sgw in the study area originated from paleo precipitation during previous wet climatic periods in wet periods fossil groundwater was at higher levels ascended along high angle faults and discharged at the surface in contrast at present the water levels are lower and the discharge occurs at near surface elevations spring locations were identified as the dependent variable while the independent variables included remote sensing based variables and geomorphological features indicative of current or paleo discharge locations including elevation slope curvature distance to sapping features soil moisture ndvi radar backscatter coefficient and brightness temperature relationships between sgw occurrences target and their controlling factors independent variables were established using extreme gradient boosting xgb support vector machine svm and logistic regression lr methods the trained models were used to map sgw locations across the entire wd findings include the following 1 the xgb yielded the most favorable result in identifying sgw locations overall accuracy 0 93 compared to svm overall accuracy 0 88 and lr overall accuracy 0 87 2 areas with a very high probability of sgw occurrences were found in lowlands and proximal to sapping features 3 the overwhelming majority of the cultivated lands within the southern and central sections of the wd lie within areas identified as high and very high probability sgw locations 4 our models identify two previously unrecognized major sgw occurrences an eastern zone ez length 800 km width 9 to 80 km area 43 000 km2 and an east west trending northern zone nz centered over the qattara depression length 500 km width 200 km area 62 150 km2 5 additional criteria were used to refine the modeled xgb sgw distribution southern and central wd 43 200 km2 to

lands remote sensing machine learning algorithms western desert egypt data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water scarcity represents one of the major challenges facing societies residing in the arid and semiarid regions of the world during the past few decades many of these arid regions endured added pressures related to excessive exploitation of their limited water resources population growth and climate change related droughts and water shortages abdelmohsen et al 2022 motagh et al 2007 wada et al 2010 in arid lands groundwater continues to be the primary source of fresh water it sustains the local communities and terrestrial ecosystems and unlike surface water is protected from severe evaporation gleeson et al 2012 the western desert wd of egypt with an average annual rainfall of 5 mm and an area of 680 000 km2 is one of the largest arid regions of the world previous studies in the deserts of egypt revealed that vast natural discharge regions and shallow near surface groundwater areas remain unidentified abotalib et al 2021 khalil et al 2021b sultan et al 2007 using a two dimensional groundwater flow model calibrated against head data from some 20 wells in wadi asyuti it was demonstrated sultan et al 2007 that a significant contribution to the asyuti groundwater system came from rising nubian sandstone aquifer system nsas groundwater 3 19 107 m3 yr 75 of incoming flow assuming geologic settings and discharge rates similar to those at asyuti 70 107 m3 yr of groundwater is available for sustainable development in similar settings around the nile river and the gulf of suez sultan et al 2007 it is advantageous to understand better the distribution of near surface discharge of the nsas that underlies the wd landscape the latter wd occupies two thirds of the territory of egypt in this study we develop and apply cost effective and reliable methodologies to identify these discharge locations across the wd the wd climate alternated between wet and dry periods during the quaternary as evidenced by the outputs of hydrologic models and the isotopic compositions and ages tens to hundreds of thousands of years of the nsas groundwater and the travertine and paleolake deposits abotalib et al 2019 haynes and haas 1980 howard and griffith 2009 pachur and hoelzmann 2000 sturchio et al 2004 aquifers across the wd were recharged during interglacial stages by the intensification of monsoons or paleowesterlies during glacial stages crombie et al 1997 sultan et al 1997a szabo et al 1995 the prolonged recharge during the wet periods elevated the aquifer s paleo piezometric surface by 25 to 100 m above the present level howard and griffith 2009 pachur and hoelzmann 2000 and caused an upward flow of pressurized gas rich groundwater along deep seated sub vertical faults abotalib and heggy 2019 the high hydraulic conductivity of fault zones and the pressure exerted by the weight of the overlying thick impermeable shales and limestone sequences facilitated the upward flow and extensive discharge surface and near surface levels abotalib et al 2021 sultan et al 2007 the prolonged groundwater discharge at the surface contributed to theater headed valleys thvs formation undermined escarpments caused them to retreat and gave way to depressions the discharge left tufa plastered on escarpment faces formed travertine around springs and spring mounds and playa deposits in depressions abotalib et al 2019 2016 during dry periods the water table declined groundwater discharge at the surface decreased escarpment retreated and deposition of tufa and playas declined or halted the pressurized groundwater accessing deep seated faults hereafter referred to as conductive faults discharged at the near surface rather than at the surface abotalib et al 2021 hegazy et al 2020 sultan et al 2007 therefore by defining the landforms attributed to natural discharge during wet climate periods one can infer the current shallow groundwater sgw locations the term sgw will be used hereafter to refer to depths to groundwater levels 50 m locally the distribution of sgw is typically identified through field based observations or geophysical techniques e g electrical resistivity and ground penetrating radar those methods are effective yet their applications over large domains are costly labor intensive and time intensive alshehri et al 2020 othman et al 2018 othman and abdelmohsen 2022 in contrast machine learning applications could offer a practical and cost effective solution to identifying sgw on regional scales machine learning is a division of artificial intelligence that relies on the notion that systems can learn from data recognize patterns and make decisions with the least human intervention bishop 2006 machine learning techniques can be used to identify sgw locations by establishing a linear or nonlinear relationship between sgw occurrences and their controlling factors and using those relationships to predict the sgw occurrences for the areas of unknown data points for example chen et al 2018 proposed an ensemble weights of evidence with logistic regression and functional tree models to identify natural groundwater discharge locations in china using topographic lithologic and land use variables naghibi et al 2020 applied machine learning algorithms extreme gradient boosting and parallel random forest to a set of dem derived parameters to identify the natural spring locations in the lorestan province of iran the main challenge of using a machine learning approach is data availability for training the models and the need for adequate input variables to explain the target which may not be available everywhere earlier attempts heavily relied on dem derived variables such as elevation slope flow direction flow accumulation and curvature naghibi et al 2020 pande et al 2020 but less so on other relevant factors e g soil moisture and vegetation intensity that correlate well with sgw occurrences alshehri et al 2020 remote sensing based datasets have been successfully used to map the spatial and temporal variations of soil moisture gao et al 2020 vegetation cover costa et al 2020 groundwater storage abdelmalik and abdelmohsen 2019 aboualy et al 2021 das et al 2018 sahour et al 2020a landforms and land surface temperature duan et al 2019 over extensive areas in this study we generate these products to identify sgw occurrences over the entire wd the earlier studies were focused on groundwater that originated from modern precipitation and used related variables such as precipitation intensity streamflow density and distance to the river das et al 2018 li et al 2019 the focus of this study is to identify sgw occurrences originating from paleo precipitation that occurred during previous wet climatic periods some tens to hundreds of thousands of years ago in the quaternary this fossil groundwater now residing in shallow aquifers originated as the natural discharge of ascending deep seated groundwater that accessed sub vertical conductive faults in our case the selected variables include remote sensing based variables indicative of near surface groundwater such as high soil moisture radar backscattering coefficient normalized difference vegetation index ndvi values and low land surface temperatures those variables could also detect sgw in modern aquifers maskooni et al 2020 however a few additional variables were selected that are unique to the investigated paleo hydrologic setting examples include geomorphological features indicative of current natural discharge locations e g proximity to active fault controlled springs or discharge locations during previous wet periods e g proximity to spring mounds or sapping features although the local communities within the wd are highly dependent on groundwater resources for drinking and agricultural purposes previous investigations aimed at identifying sgw locations are rare and local masoud and el osta 2016 we attempt to map the distribution of sgw across the entire wd the identification of the distribution of sgw occurrences is the first step towards the development of new agricultural communities and the expansion of the existing ones as well 2 geology and hydrogeology of the wd the nsas underlies the wd that extends from the libyan border to the nile river and from the mediterranean sea to the egyptian sudanese border fig 1 the mean annual precipitation of the region is 5 mm abdelmohsen et al 2019 and the mean aridity index is 0 05 sahour et al 2020 the recharge of the nsas during previous wet paleoclimatic periods in the quaternary sturchio et al 2004 sultan et al 1997b caused a significant rise of the paleo piezometric heads by as much as 100 m compared to the present day dry period abotalib et al 2019 howard and griffith 2009 pachur and hoelzmann 2000 starting in the 1950 s the egyptian government embarked on major desert reclamation projects e g the new valley project in which hundreds of deep wells 800 m were drilled increasing the extraction from the nsas from 1 km3 year in 1952 to 2 4 km3 year in 2014 omar and moussa 2016 the increase in extraction led to a drawdown of water levels by as much as 20 m in the farafra depression 10 20 m in the kharga depression and 30 m in the dakhla depression elsheikh 2015 sefelnasr et al 2015 during the previous quaternary wet periods water levels rose and groundwater discharge increased leaving behind paleolakes in the lowlands and tuffa and travertine deposits on the scarp faces of the depressions abotalib et al 2019 pachur and hoelzmann 2000 u th dating of these groundwater related deposits placed the wd wet periods in the cool pleistocene glacial periods marine isotope stage mis 6 8 10 and 12 with limited deposition during the warm interglacial periods mis 5 7 and 13 abotalib et al 2019 the modern recharge mainly occurs in the southern highlands of gebel darfur in sudan and gebel tibesti in chad where the sandstone outcrops receive precipitation of up to 96 mm year abdelmohsen et al 2019 as well as from the aswan high dam reservoir abdelmohsen et al 2020 ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 the nsas consists mainly of paleozoic and mesozoic sandstones intercalated with shallow marine tertiary carbonates and shale fig 2 the aquifer is bound by the saltwater freshwater interface in the north the basement from the east and south and the devonian bedrock from the west sultan et al 2013 the nsas consists of three subbasins dakhla kufra and northern sudan the uweinat aswan uplift separates the dakhla and northern sudan subbasins and the uweinat howar uplift separates northern sudan from the kufra subbasin hesse et al

distinct units the nubian aquifer system nas and the post nubian aquifer system pnas the nas is composed mainly of sandstone and the pnas of carbonates bakhbakhi 2006 the landscape across the nsas is dominated by extensive outcrops of flat topped carbonate plateaus and natural depressions bound by escarpments thvs are found along the length of the escarpments and playas and tufa deposits in areas proximal to the cliffs the development of thvs depressions escarpments and other groundwater related deposits e g playas and tufa support the near surface discharge of groundwater during the wet paleoclimate periods abotalib et al 2016 the age of the groundwater in the nsas ranges from a few thousand years in the south i e near the uweinat uplift haynes and haas 1980 to one million years near the bahariya oasis in the north sturchio et al 2004 and is consistent with southwest to northeast groundwater flow from a recharge area near the uweinat uplift 3 data and methodology we conducted a fourfold exercise to identify the sgw locations in the wd of egypt representing the bulk of the area occupied by the dakhla subbasin we identified variables affecting sgw occurrence and randomly divided the data into two training and testing subsets the former was used to develop the models and the latter to evaluate the performance of the models step i the relationship between sgw occurrence and its controlling factors was established using three machine learning algorithms extreme gradient boosting xgb support vector machine svm and logistic regression lr then the performance of each model was evaluated to select the optimum model step ii the trained models were applied to the available input variables to map the sgw across the entire wd step iii finally the outputs of the models were refined using additional geological constraints to identify areas better suited for agricultural development step iv a detailed explanation of the data and adopted methodology is described below 3 1 data the output or target is sgw occurrence the inputs are variables affecting or correlating with it including elevation slope curvature distance to sapping features soil moisture radar backscatter coefficient ndvi and land surface temperature the selection of the input variables was based on our understanding of the study area s geologic setting the groundwater s origin as indicated by its isotopic composition and lessons learned from similar earlier studies 3 1 1 shallow and deep groundwater training points the sgw points were identified primarily from spring locations natural groundwater discharge 173 points and a few others 28 points from watermelon field locations spring is a point at which groundwater flows at the earth s surface gholami et al 2021 therefore the groundwater level in those areas is shallow the watermelon fields are other indicators of the sgw areas across the wd in those areas local farmers use near surface groundwater to irrigate their fields we chose the spring and water melon locations as our target groundwater levels from existing wells were not selected as targets monitoring wells are rare in the western desert and productive wells water levels have been compromised by excessive extraction since the 1960 s the extraction caused a dramatic drop in water levels el rawy and smedt 2020 thus the present groundwater levels do not represent the static levels in the area we identified areas characterized by sgw occurrences and others by deep groundwater non sgw points for training purposes we selected 201 sgw points and 399 deep groundwater points from regions of high elevation and deep water table levels 3 1 2 topographic features a digital elevation model dem produced by the shuttle radar topography mission srtm farr et al 2007 with a spatial resolution of 30 m was used to extract topographic features including elevation slope and profile curvature the surface elevations in the wd ranged from 5 to 1 115 m mean elevation 337 6 m above mean sea level table 1 in general the higher the surface elevation the larger the depth to the water table and vice versa for low surface elevations the slope fig 3 was derived from the dem using the slope function in arcgis the slope in most parts of the wd ranged from 0 to 77 average 2 9 table 1 many of the springs target are found along or proximal to the intersection of two or more faults that bound cliffs along which deep seated groundwater in the confined sections of the nsas ascend and discharge at surface or near surface elevations abotalib et al 2016 the curvature function moore et al 1991 describes deviations from a straight line or a plane surface the earth s surface can be concave negative curvature value or convex positive curvature value the curvature in the wd ranges between 7 5 and 9 7 average 0 table 1 concave surfaces especially those at lower elevations could be indicative of the distribution of depressions in which sgw is likely to be found 3 1 3 distance to sapping features dts groundwater sapping is a process of headward movement of channels in response to concentrated groundwater discharge which alters the earth s surface s physical and chemical structure at the seepage site laity and malin 1985 these alterations form theater shaped channel heads and u shaped valleys that are indications of sgw presence the distribution of the thvs was mapped across the wd using a gis based lr model that predicted the presence or absence of thvs based on values of a set of predictor variables all of which were extracted from remote sensing and geological datasets abotalib et al 2016 the areas near these landforms are more likely to have a near surface groundwater table therefore the dts fig 3 was selected as one of the sgw predictors to be included in the model s inputs the dts in the study area ranged from 0 to 391 km average 78 4 km the distance from each pixel to the nearest sapping feature was calculated using the proximity tool which measures the shortest separation between two elements fig 3 3 1 4 soil moisture sms in many sgw areas e g lowlands and river valleys the groundwater table and the presence of hydraulic gradients between the saturated zone and the root zone lead to a continuous supply of groundwater to the root zone chen and hu 2004 therefore soil moisture is expected to be higher in sgw areas alshehri et al 2020 the level 2 l2 smap sentinel 1 soil moisture data das et al 2020 2019 was obtained from the national snow and ice data center available at https nsidc org these data present land surface conditions retrieved by the soil moisture active passive smap radiometer and the european space agency s sentinel 1a and 1b sar constellation there were 154 scenes over the study area from multiple data acquisitions from 2015 to 2016 the data underwent preprocessing data conversion and mosaicking the final soil moisture map is the average of multiple scenes fig 3 the soil moisture in the study area ranged from 0 02 to 0 46 cm3 cm3 average 0 07 cm3 cm3 table 1 3 1 5 radar backscatter coefficient radar backscatter coefficient rbc in decibels was extracted from sentinel 1 satellite data spatial resolution 12 m 12 m which uses synthetic aperture radar sar operating in the c band wavelength region 3 8 to 7 5 cm of the electromagnetic spectrum the ascending acquisition of the sentinel 1a ground range detected grd scenes https asf alaska edu was selected due to the availability of the images over the wd region the data underwent co registration radiometric calibration and extraction of rbc beta naught β0 rbc has proven to be an effective parameter for monitoring the hydrological compartments of the earth including soil moisture alexakis et al 2017 wetland water level dynamics kim et al 2014 sahour et al 2021a and flooding events zeng et al 2020 a static regional sentinel 1 rbc image fig 3 was generated from 18 scenes acquired in june 2016 rbc values are expected to be high over shallow sgw locations and to vary in response to temporal variation of the groundwater table the rbc in the study area ranged from 33 to 6 db average 20 db 3 1 6 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the landsat derived ndvi products spatial resolution 30 m 30 m obtained from usgs earth resources observation and science eros available at https espa cr usgs gov were used as one of the input variables the data provide consistent spatial and temporal variation of vegetation cover over the region of interest the average image fig 3 was calculated from multitemporal scenes 29 tiles 1235 landsat 8 16 daily ndvi dataset 2013 04 2017 10 covering the study area in arid and semiarid regions sgw availability is a crucial factor affecting vegetation dynamics with sgw s presence the root zones of natural vegetation can reach the water table gholami and sahour 2022 huang et al 2019 therefore high ndvi values from natural vegetation can potentially indicate sgw locations the ndvi in the study area ranged from 0 76 to 0 72 average 0 1 table 1 3 1 7 land surface temperature the modis terra land surface temperature lst kelvin products spatial resolution 0 05 0 05 were obtained from nasa s modis processing website available at https modis gsfc nasa gov the data provide consistent spatial and temporal variation of brightness temperature bt over the study area the average image was calculated from multiple modis 8 daily thermal datasets 2 tiles 790 scenes 2009 01 2017 07 lst is expected to be lower in the areas characterized by sgw alkhaier et al 2012 previous studies used lst as a proxy of soil moisture status showing significant correlation values cammalleri et al 2015 3 2 methods sgw prediction models the entire dataset inputs and output was normalized and divided into two subsets for training and testing we used 75 of the total data 450 points for training and 25 250 points to evaluate the models the multicollinearity was tested using the variance inflation factor vif multicollinearity is a condition in which two or more explanatory variables are highly correlated a common problem in linear models e g lr vif is one of the most widely used detecting tests for multicollinearity it determines how much the variance of a coefficient is inflated because of linear dependencies with other explanatory variables alin 2010 considering a threshold of 10 for vif no multicollinearity was detected among the individual variables table 1 three machine learning algorithms xgb svm and lr were used to extract the relationship between sgw occurrence and its controlling factors lr can be well trained if a linear relationship between input and the target is expected lr can avoid overfitting and make feature selection using regularization however the performance of lr is limited to a large number of features with the presence of nonlinearity in the case of svm a linear kernel was adopted making it comparable to the structure of lr the advantage of using svm and xgb over lr is handling the nonlinear relationships between inputs and the target the xgb is a tree based model consisting of many trees 500 in this study to make decisions on the predictable outcome and repeat as many as needed to reach a certain level of accuracy fan et al 2018 the models are described as follows 3 2 1 logistic regression model lr lr is a capable model for predicting the presence or absence of an outcome based on a set of explanatory variables values lr is used to address classification problems when the dependent variable is binary in nature in this study the output is a binary variable representing the presence or absence of sgw the relationship between the sgw occurrence and its dependency on several independent variables can be expressed as follows kleinbaum and klein 2002 1 p x 1 1 e z where p x is the probability of sgw presence probability varies between 0 and 1 on an s shaped curve and z is the linear combination it follows that the lr involves fitting an equation of the following form to the data the regression line for n independent variables x1 x2 xn can be explained as follows 2 z b0 b1x1 b2x2 bnxn 3 2 2 support vector machine svm svm is a supervised learning method for classification and regression problems that belong to the family of generalized linear classifiers in other terms svm is a prediction tool that uses machine learning theory to maximize predictive accuracy while automatically avoiding over fit to the data vapnik 1999 svm can be defined as systems that use hypothesis space of linear functions in a high dimensional feature space trained with a learning algorithm from the optimization theory kanevski et al 2009 svm can be visualized as a surface that creates a boundary between plotted points in a multidimensional space representing their feature values the goal of an svm is to create a flat border called ahyperplane which divides the space into relatively homogeneous partitions on either side hofmann 2006 in n dimensional space a hyperplane is defined by w x b 0 where x is an observed vector w is a vector of n weights w 1 w 2 w n and b is a single number known as the bias the bias is conceptually equivalent to the intercept in the slope intercept form of a straight line hofmann 2006 the goal of the svm process is to find a set of weights that specify two hyperplanes as eq 3 3 w x b 1 w x b 1 vector geometry defines the distance between these two planes as 2 w where w is the euclidian distance between w and the origin it is desired to maximize the separation between the two planes in such a way that the problem becomes 4 min w 1 2 w y i w x i b 1 the second line notes that this minimization is subject to the condition that each of the y i data points are correctly classified here y i indicates the class value transformed either to 1 or 1 to address the nonlinearity problem a kernel function was applied to transform the input data into a high dimensional feature space model optimization was performed on the three primary parameters of the svm model these three parameters are the regularization parameter gamma and margin of tolerance al fugara et al 2020 the regularization parameter c prevents over fitting and determines the influence of the misclassification on the objective function the gamma γ parameter controls the nonlinearity of the kernel function the margin of tolerance ε determines the distance from the decision surface to the closest data point chapelle et al 2002 3 2 3 xgb xgb chen and guestrin 2016 is a scalable learning algorithm based on gradient boosting boosted regression trees were applied successfully to address regression and classification problems e g sahour et al 2021 in essence the boosting algorithm advances the bias variance tradeoff by starting with a weak model and sequentially enhancing its performance by constructing new trees where the prediction from each new tree is updated by reducing the residual error from the former tree in the sequence xgb is a significant improvement over gradient boosting in gradient boosting we start with a set of input variables x 1 x n to predict a set of corresponding target values y 1 y n we fit a model f x y and minimize the sum of the loss function j by improving the model f x 5 j i 1 n l y i f x i where l is a differentiable convex loss function that measures the difference between the prediction f x and the target y friedman and meulman 2003 the modeling process in xgb began by calculating the negative gradients of j with respect to f xi j f x i in the next step a classification tree h was fitted to negative gradients j f x i and f xi was updated with f xi γ h where γ is the step size to reach the estimated minimum of j this iteration was performed to achieve the minimum difference between prediction and observation chen and guestrin 2016 in xgb the loss function is 6 j i 1 n l y i f x i h ω h where 7 ω h γ t 1 2 λ ω 2 here t is the number of leaves in the tree and ω is the leaf weights the function ω penalizes the complexity of the model chen and guestrin 2016 the optimal weight ω of leaf j was calculated as follows 8 ω j j g j j h j λ where g j j f x i and h j is the j th classification tree fitted to g j then the optimal value of the loss function was calculated 9 1 2 j 1 t j g j 2 j h j λ γ t the additional regularization term helps to smooth the final learned weights to avoid over fitting intuitively the regularized objective will tend to select a model employing simple and predictive functions chen and guestrin 2016 parameter tuning was performed to construct the optimum structure of the xgb model the parameters that underwent optimization are the number of trees lambda alpha gamma maximum depth and learning rate lambda is a regularization function to control over fitting in the training step alpha is another regularization term that regulates the speed by which an algorithm works by varying the assigned weights in high dimensional problems the learning rate eta specifies the participation of each tree and reduces overfitting maximum depth determines the maximum number of end nodes in each leaf of the trees and gamma defines the lowest loss reduction needed for additional splits in each tree 3 3 evaluation of model performance the machine learning algorithms for classifying sgw locations were evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic roc curve roc is a graphical plot showing a model s diagnostic ability as its discrimination threshold is varied the roc plot displays false and true positive rates on the x and y axes respectively hand and till 2001 in addition to the roc curve the area under the roc curve auc accuracy kappa specificity and sensitivity indices were also used to validate the models the evaluation was carried out on the test subset which was not used for developing the models variable importance vi was implemented to analyze the strength of the relationships between sgw and its controlling factors in each model the vi was calculated by the sum of the decreases in the errors when split by an individual variable then the relative importance is the vi of a particular variable divided by the highest vi value 4 results and discussion 4 1 correlation of variables model performance and variable importance the optimum number of trees in the xgb model was found to be 500 optimum values are presented in table 2 for lambda 0 1 alpha 0 75 gamma 0 5 maximum depth 10 and learning rate 0 01 the optimized parameters for the svm model including the optimal value of sigma 0 1 the number of support vectors 1 object function linear classification and training error 0 01 are presented in table 3 the xgb produced the highest accuracy among the three models in both the training and testing stages followed by the svm and lr the values of auc accuracy specificity sensitivity and kappa coefficients for the three models used on the training and testing sets are shown in tables 4 and 5 respectively the roc curves of the three algorithms used are depicted in fig 4 the area under roc curves auc ranges between 0 and 1 a higher auc value indicates an enhanced performance of an algorithm fig 4 given that the xgb produced the highest accuracy among the three models on both the testing and training datasets the xgb model outputs were considered the best results among the three models once the optimum structures of the individual models were constructed the set of available variables was used as inputs to the trained models to predict the sgw locations across the entire wd of egypt we classified the results based on the range of probabilities into four classes low medium high and very high probabilities table 6 all three models showed almost the same order in the relative importance of the variables vi the highest vi was associated with elevation followed by dts slope rbc ndvi sms and bt curvature and lst were excluded from the set of input variables due to their statistical insignificance the dts and dem values are highly correlated with and indicative of sgw occurrences regardless of whether the sgw is a few meters or tens of meters deep in contrast the remaining remote sensing factors rbc ndvi sms and bt correlate well with sgw occurrences that are a few meters deep but are insensitive to groundwater tens of meters deep moreover they are associated with factors other than sgw occurrences as well for example 1 high ndvi values are observed over farms irrigated by waters extracted from deep wells 2 high rbs values over areas characterized by rough topography e g sabkhas and 3 low bt and high sms over mountainous areas where the temperatures are low cool and surfaces are less dry these reasons explain why these factors are less important than the dts and dem in identifying the sgw occurrences in our study area 4 2 distribution of modeled sgw the patterns of sgw occurrences from the three models are remarkably similar fig 6a 6b and 6c yet their spatial extent could vary from one model to another for example the distribution of the very high probability areas for sgw in the xgb model 36 190 km2 exceeded that from the svm 14 600 km2 which in turn surpassed the very high probability areas for sgw from the lr results 12 400 km2 4 2 1 distribution of modeled sgw in relation to lowlands and sapping features sgw occurrences are largely controlled by low surface elevations and small dts fig 5 the figure displays the relative importance of each independent variable the dem was the most important variable xgb 37 svm 23 and lr 18 followed by the dts xgb 21 svm 21 and lr 16 the importance of these two variables is corroborated by the spatial correspondence between the areas of the high and the very high probability of sgw modeled occurrences hereafter referred to as modeled xgb svm or lrs sgw occurrences with the distribution of lowlands and sapping features fig 6 fig 6 shows the modeled lr fig 6a svm fig 6b and xgb sgw occurrences fig 6c and fig 6d displays the distribution of modeled xgb sgw occurrences the sapping features and the lowlands fig 6c and d show that the modeled xgb sgw occurrences are located in the lowlands namely the depressions and oases kharga dakhla farafra siwa baharyia and qattara where the elevations are low range 128 to 150 m a m s l compared to their surroundings 200 to 500 m a m s l this is also true for the modeled lr and svm sgw occurrences fig 6a b and d this is to be expected given that the gradient of the groundwater in the wd is gentle 0 00038 mohamed et al 2016 resulting in a difference of 350 m in groundwater levels across the entire extent of the dakhla subbasin in the wd i e 900 km in extension under such conditions the depth to groundwater will be largely controlled by the land surface elevation the lower the surface elevation the shallower the groundwater levels and vice versa for high surface elevations in these oases and depressions many karstic features e g speleothems flowstones chalk pillars and dissolution caves indicative of sgw discharge and processes were reported abdelmohsen et al 2019 aref et al 1987 butzer 1965 el gammal 2010 mostafa 2013 ruggieri 2001 inspection of fig 6d shows that the modeled xgb sgw occurrences are proximal to the distribution of sapping features where the dts in these areas ranges from 1 to 10 km this is also true for the modeled lr and svm sgw occurrences fig 6a 6b and 6d this is expected given that sapping features developed in areas where ascending groundwater along deep seated conductive faults undermined the cliffs and discharged at surface elevations in previous wet climatic periods and possibly at near surface elevations under the present dry conditions thus the distribution of sapping features mark the location of conductive faults ascending groundwater and surface to near surface groundwater elevations the remaining variables slope rbc ndvi sms and bt are significant yet less important 2 to 16 fig 5 than the dem and dts 4 2 2 distribution of modeled sgw in relation to sgw aquifers one of the conditions for the preservation of the ascending groundwater is the presence of lithologic units at the surface near surface or at shallow depths 50 m that can host the rising waters within the areas identified by statistical models as high and very high probability areas for sgw occurrences hereafter referred to as shallow aquifers these include a wide range of lithological units 32 formations supplementary dataset 1 extending from quaternary sand sheets and dunes into upper jurassic sandstone formations el hinnawi et al 2006 with the moghra and marmarica aquifers showing the largest areal extent the moghra aquifer up to 500 m thick is composed of intercalated fluvial sands and clays abotalib and mohamed 2013 the marmarica aquifer up to 150 m thick at east siwa oasis consists of karstified limestone calcarenite and fractured marly limestone ghobashy et al 2021 in the generation of shallow aquifer coverage areas showing evidence of excessive salinization of soils e g sabkhas due to continuous discharge and evaporation of discharged groundwater at surface and near surface elevations were excluded a high correspondence is observed between the distribution of such aquifers 95 000 km2 and that of the modeled xgb sgw 126 000 km2 fig 7 a the area of overlap 71 000 km2 between the two coverages is hereafter referred to as selected sgw occurrences in the study area 4 2 3 distribution of modeled sgw in relation to agricultural communities in the southern and central sections comparison of the distribution of modeled xgb sgw occurrences with the distribution of vegetated areas mostly cultivated areas extracted from google earth images fig 6c shows that the overwhelming majority of cultivated areas in the southern and central sections of the wd are within the modeled xgb sgw occurrences however the selected sgw occurrences in the central and southern sections 43 200 km2 far exceed the cultivated areas 2 000 km2 fig 6c 7b as indicated in the earlier section the selected sgw areas are represented by the intersection of the distribution of shallow aquifers and that of the modeled xgb sgw the majority of the cultivated areas in those sections of the wd are located in the kharga baris dakhla farafra and bahariya oases and their surroundings fig 6c that is to be expected given that our selection targets spring locations where agricultural communities started in ancient and historical time periods during the ancient egyptian darnell and haddad 2003 and the roman eras bagnall et al 2006 up to the 1950 s the overwhelming majority of the cultivated land in the wd was irrigated by naturally flowing springs and hand dug shallow wells since that date the continuous and progressive extraction of groundwater has led to the reduction or cessation of flowing springs the development of cones of depression over areas of high extraction and the lowering of the water table in the shallow aquifers at many of these locations a large cone of depression was reported from the dakhla oasis with a diameter exceeding 30 km and a drop in water level by some 40 m in the center of the cone similarly a large cone of depression was reported from abu munqar area with a width of 10 km and a drop of 35 m in water level ebraheem et al 2004 elsheikh 2015 thus only in areas distant 30 km from these cones of depressions would we expect to observe the predicted sgw occurrences 4 2 4 distribution of sgw in northern and eastern wd there are two areas where the spatial correlation of the distribution of existing agricultural communities with modeled xgb sgw occurrences is not as clear as they are in the central and southern sections of the wd fig 6c in those areas there are large stretches of modeled sgw occurrences that are devoid of cultivated lands the first occurs along a stretch of land that extends east and west of the qattara depression and north and south of it extending some 500 km in length and 200 km in width and covering an approximate area of 62 150 km2 fig 6c 7a hereafter referred to as the northern zone nz the second one occurs along a zone that runs subparallel to and west of the nile valley hereafter referred to as the eastern zone ez the ez extends for some 800 km in length ranges from 9 to 80 km in width and covers an approximate area of 21 300 km2 within each of the two zones shallow aquifers that accommodate rising waters were identified fig 7a the figure shows a high correspondence between the distribution of the modeled xgb sgw occurrences and that of shallow aquifers supplementary dataset 1 at surface near surface or shallow depths 50 m the ez is bound on the east by the nile valley and on the west by the eocene plateau the zone is dissected by a complex of dip slip fault systems that are subparallel to the faults bounding the nile valley graben abotalib and mohamed 2013 sultan et al 2007 the zone stands 50 m above the adjacent nile valley yet below the eocene plateau by 200 to 400 m only recently in the past three to four decades farmers within the nile valley realized that they could cultivate areas within the ez by tapping sgw within the alluvial sediments and fractured eocene aquifer within the adjacent ez google earth images over the ez show that some 2 566 km2 are already cultivated comparison of the distribution of modeled xgb sgw occurrences within the ez with the distribution of cultivated areas fig 6c 7a shows that the overwhelming majority of cultivated areas in the ez are within the modeled xgb sgw occurrences however the selected sgw occurrences in this zone 17 400 km2 far exceed the developed regions 2 566 km2 fig 6c and 7b the lowlands within the nz like the ones in the central sections of the wd discharge at surface and near surface levels forming springs and oases e g sitra el bahrain and nawamisa fig 1 yet the population and agricultural communities have remained limited in size throughout historical periods we suspect this is partly due to differences in water quality the delineated nz aligns with a brackish water zone zone ii fig 7a in the nas that represents a transition from the freshwater zone to the south of lat 29 n zone i 500 ppm fig 6c 7 to the brine water zone 100 000 ppm north of lat 31 n dabous and osmond 2001 fig 6c 7 moreover the presence of thick up to 1 5 km successions of carbonates marl and shales overlying the upper cretaceous nas horizon in the nz compared to the central sections typically 0 200 m thick thorweihe 1990 increases the salinity of the rising nubian waters through water rock interactions before discharge at surface and near surface elevations abotalib et al 2021 the reported salinity from wells penetrating the miocene aquifer in the nz ranged from 1200 to 9800 mg l gomaa et al 2021 in a few localized areas e g el moghra oasis the water salinity could reach up to 14 000 mg l eltarabily and moghazy 2021 although most of the nz s sgw might not be suitable for human consumption they could be used for growing salt tolerant crop types e g olives citrus beet barley sunflower canola quinoa jojoba barbary fig and jatropha some crops can tolerate salinities of up to 10 000 ppm eltarabily and moghazy 2021 rugini and fedeli 1990 of particular interest are the areas south of the qattara depression the selection of those areas can potentially serve the development of agricultural communities and reduce losses to discharge and evaporation as described earlier the discharge of the nsas in the qattara depression is estimated at 0 36 km3 year brinkmann et al 1987 rigw wsc 1989 at present all such waters are lost to evaporation leaving behind thick 5 30 m aref et al 2002 sabkha deposits we used two additional criteria to select sgw locations within the nz first the chosen areas lie to the south of zone iii fig 7b where the salinity of the rising nubian waters can approach that of brines dabous and osmond 2001 second the selected areas should be in areas where the depth to the nubian sandstone dtn is relatively shallow 1 km these areas lie to the south of the dtn threshold line in fig 7b the dtn could reach up to 4 km north of the line bosworth and tari 2021 in areas south of the dtn threshold line the dtn is relatively shallow and the thickness of the post nubian succession is relatively small tens to hundreds of meters inspection of cross section a aʹ within the eastern sections of the nz fig 7b and 8a shows outcrops of the nss in the south where the baharia monocline exposes the nss at the surface it also reveals a south to north increase in dtn reaching some 3 km in the abu gharadig basin bosworth and tari 2021 similarly the dtn increases in the central sections of the nz from a few hundred meters in the south up to 1 km in the north cross section b bʹ fig 7b and 8b the western sections of the nz have thick nss successions thickness up to 4 km deposited in paleozoic basins deep basement 3 4 km deep and thin overburden of upper cretaceous and paleogene rocks cross section c cʹ fig 7b and 8c we assume that the shallower the dtn the lesser the interactions of the rising nubian waters with the country rocks before discharge at the surface or near surface elevations this assumption is supported by the low salinity 700 mg l of sgw from kharga and dakhla oases where the dtn does not exceed 500 m mahmoud and ghoubachi 2017 and by the high salinities 7500 mg l of sgw in areas where the dtn exceeded 1 km araffa et al 2021 using the modeled xgb sgw occurrences and the presence of a shallow aquifer earlier criteria and two additional criteria presence within zones i or ii shallow basement we estimate that the selected sgw locations within the nz occupy 30 700 km2 fig 7b 4 2 5 origin of groundwater in the selected shallow aquifers one of the pieces of evidence for the advocated model natural discharge of the nsas at near surface levels within the central and southern sections of the wd and the nz and ez is the depleted isotopic composition of groundwater from shallow aquifers within those areas and the similarity in their isotopic compositions to those of the underlying nsas groundwaters for example in the natural depressions oases the nas is exposed at or near the surface and artesian springs discharge fossil nas water the isotopic composition of those artesian waters is indicative of recharge at previous cooler continental conditions δ18o 11 to 8 5 and δ2h 90 to 80 abotalib et al 2016 awad 2006 the groundwater from the marmarica aquifer in siwa oasis within the nz is similar in its isotopic composition δ18o 11 to 8 and δ2h 85 to 70 to the spring discharge in the southern oases and different from modern waters including nile water before the construction of the aswan high dam δ18o 1 to 7 and δ2h 3 7 to 30 el bakri et al 1991 abotalib et al 2016 and the weighted average of modern precipitation over northern egypt δ18o 6 33 and δ2h 38 75 khalil et al 2021b to the east of the siwa oasis several small lakes e g sitra el bahrain and nawamisa are found within lowlands and along the extension of east west and northwest southeast trending faults cziesla et al 1993 we interpret the lakes as locations of natural discharge and the surrounding areas as potential regions for agricultural development these lakes are surrounded by outcrops of the hamra formation composed mainly of white to grayish white limestone with intercalations of conglomerates and sandy beds el hinnawi et al 2006 and thus could potentially represent a suitable aquifer to accommodate groundwater discharge similar phenomena were reported from the eastern and western deserts of egypt sultan et al 2007 showed that discharge of the nubian aquifer is occurring on a large scale primarily through deep seated fault systems that bound the nile valley graben they stated that ascending groundwater discharges into relatively thick alluvial aquifers proximal to the fault complex that defines the nile valley the authors provided isotopic and geochemical analyses along with field and remote sensing data and hydrologic models in support of their conceptual model groundwater samples from alluvial and fractured eocene aquifers in central nile valley between el

with modern nile waters abotalib et al 2021 4 3 applications and limitations of the adopted methodology in this section we discuss the applications and limitations of the adopted methodology for mapping sgw in the study area and similar settings elsewhere section 4 3 1 and the potential for building on our findings to identify areas most suited for agricultural development section 4 3 2 4 3 1 applications and limitations for sgw detection in similar settings the applied methodologies are cost effective and efficient techniques that could be readily applied to large sectors of saharan africa and arabia whose landscape and fossil aquifers bear many resemblances in their geologic climatic and geomorphic characteristics to the nsas for example as with the nsas the north western sahara aquifer system nwsas area 1 2 million km2 in algeria tunisia and libya and the mega aquifer system mas area 2 106 km2 in saudi arabia oman and united arab emirates are differentiated into two major units a lower continental unit and an upper marine carbonate dominated unit the nsas is dissected by deep seated fault systems including reactivated northwest southeast trending najd faults northeast southwest and northeast east southwest west trending faults of the pelusian system and east west trending faults of the nubia fault system abotalib et al 2016 mohamed et al 2016 the nwsas is dissected by north south trending horsts and grabens of the amguid el biod ridge which extends for 650 km in the central sections of the aquifer kerdjidj 2005 the mas is also dissected by multiple fault orientations particularly in rub al khali area including reactivated northwest southeast trending najd faults and northeast southwest trending systems of hercynian age stewart 2016 these tectonic elements act as hydraulic conduits and allow cross formation flow between the various aquifers kalbus et al 2011 un escwa and bgr 2013 all three aquifers were primarily recharged by autochthonous precipitation during the more humid climatic conditions that prevailed across the saharan arabian desert belt during the pleistocene sturchio et al 2004 sultan et al 2008 yet they receive limited modern recharge locally at present abotalib et al 2016 sultan et al 2019 the fossil nature of the aquifers was inferred from the depleted isotopic o h composition of its groundwater compared to modern precipitation and from the progressive increase in the residence time up to 1 million years old of the groundwater with increasing distance from the recharge areas abotalib et al 2019 sturchio et al 2004 the three aquifers nsas nwsas mas display similar natural discharge patterns within the lowlands including evaporative sabkha and chotts e g qattara depression in egypt chott el djerid in tunisia ouargla oasis in algeria and uruq al mu taridah in saudi arabia gaye et al 2005 matter et al 2015 salem and pallas 2002 youcef and hamdi aïssa 2014 zouari et al 2011 and excavations in the carbonate plateaus e g farafra and baharia depressions in egypt al jaghbub oasis in libya ouargla oasis in algeria rub al khali depression in saudi arabia the sabkhas chotts and excavations in the plateau are surface manifestations of the vertical connection between deep and shallow aquifers along deep seated faults thvs are ubiquitous in all three aquifers and share common characteristics these include local structural control along pre existing structural discontinuities minimal upstream contribution areas and within the confined sections of the aquifers and along the escarpment face the model has its limitations machine learning models require extensive training data to develop meaningful relationships between the input variables and the target data availability is one of the significant challenges in machine learning based modeling and mapping adequate sgw location data may not be available everywhere hindering our methodology in data deficit areas especially those with different hydroclimatic and geological settings in our study we would have preferred to have the depth to water table from monitoring wells across the entire wd as our target dataset unfortunately monitoring wells in the wd is minimal we addressed this limitation by using the location of springs as our target instead we should not expect all sgw occurrences to be associated with springs thus the model application could have missed a subset of these sgw occurrences the application of the model could be readily facilitated by identifying conductive faults however mapping faults across the wd is hindered by the advance of quaternary sand sheets and dunes that cover large sectors of the wd and conceal the underlying fault patterns fig 1 the orientation of a fault in relation to the direction of groundwater flow can determine whether it acts as a preferred conduit or impediment to groundwater flow faults intersecting the groundwater flow at low angles capture groundwater flow whereas those obstructing the flow at high angles impound groundwater mohamed et al 2015 in addition the vertical conductivity of the fault plane is affected by several factors including the sense of displacement nature of fault damage zones the thickness of the fault core and whether it is active or non active attwa et al 2021 gudmundsson 2001 khalil et al 2021a given the above reasons we elected not to use the mapped distribution of faults as one of the model s independent variables instead we believe that the distribution of sapping features that we found to be one of the most significant independent variables refer to section 4 2 2 mimics the distribution of conductive faults after all the sapping features were formed as described earlier refer to section 1 by the ascent of pressurized groundwater through deep seated faults which caused prolonged and extensive discharge undermined escarpments incised thvs and promoted scarp retreat in this respect the present distribution of thvs mimics the approximate distribution of conductive faults that incised the existing thvs however our application did not account for the overall distribution of conductive faults through which earlier groundwater discharge episodes occurred those episodes must have undermined the carbonate plateau that had a much broader and earlier extent across the wd abotalib et al 2016 the model must have also missed a subset of sgw occurrences in areas where pressurized groundwater discharge on or near the surface exists but not the lithological and topographic settings favorable for thv formation given the above mentioned limitations the identified sgw occurrences should be considered as a minimum distribution 4 3 2 model applications for agricultural development although this research aims to develop cost effective methodologies for mapping sgw in arid lands the identified distribution of sgw could potentially be used as one of the criteria but not the only criterion for selecting areas targeted for land reclamation and agricultural development a few of these conditions should be considered for additional refinements of the model outputs if it is to be used for the development of farming communities those should be restricted to areas where the concentration of conductive faults and sgw were verified where thick shallow aquifers crop out or were reported and where water quality is suitable for agriculture development this task can be accomplished using standard geophysical geochemical and subsurface data very low frequency vlf techniques have been successfully used in the egyptian deserts to identify water bearing high angle conductive faults mohamed et al 2015 sultan et al 2011 and electrical resistivity for estimating the depth to water table el saadawy et al 2020 additional preferences and exclusions could be considered these include desirable soil types climate proximity to urban centers road networks etc exclusions could comprise areas covered by excessive dune fields or mined areas dating from the second world war aquifer testing should be conducted in any of the selected sgw occurrences to identify sustainable extraction scenarios for irrigation from the identified discharge layer s 5 summary groundwater is the primary water resource in arid and semiarid regions of the world yet identifying potential groundwater extraction locations is challenging field based techniques e g electrical resistivity and ground penetrating radar are often useful and accurate however applying those methods over extensive areas is challenging we developed and tested a methodology based on available remote sensing topographic and geomorphologic datasets and machine learning algorithms to map the sgw areas across egypt s wd the machine learning algorithms final inputs were elevation distance to sapping features slope radar backscatter coefficient ndvi soil moisture and bt these data were used to model the sgw locations applying three machine learning algorithms xgb svm and lr and the results were tested by comparing the predicted and observed sgw locations the xgb accuracy 0 93 kappa 0 85 outperformed the svm accuracy 0 87 kappa 0 71 and lr accuracy 0 80 kappa 0 65 algorithms during the accuracy assessment the models were used to map the sgw locations across the entire study area given that the xgb produced the highest accuracy among the three models on both the testing and training datasets the xgb model outputs were considered to be the optimum results among the three models low surface elevations and small dts primarily controlled the modeled sgw occurrences the importance of these two variables is corroborated by the spatial correspondence between the areas of the high probability of sgw occurrences model outputs with the distribution of lowlands kharga dakhla farafra farafra siwa baharyiah and qattara depressions and sapping features in the wd the remaining variables slope rbc ndvi sms and bt were significant yet less important than the dem and dts this is because these independent variables are sensitive to sgw occurrences that are a few meters deep but not groundwater tens of meters deep moreover the remaining variables are influenced by factors other than sgw occurrences the overwhelming majority of the currently cultivated lands within the central and southern sections of the investigated area are within regions modeled as high and very high priority xgb sgw locations in contrast our models identify two previously unrecognized significant sgw occurrences in the northern and eastern parts of the wd the first the eastern zone ez runs subparallel to the nile valley and to the west of it extends for some 800 km in length and 9 to 80 km in width and covers an approximate area of 21 300 km2 the second zone the northern zone nz occurs along a stretch of land that extends east and west of the qattara depression and to the north and south of it covering an approximate area of 62 150 km2 the modeled sgw occurrences covered 43 200 km2 in the central and southern sections of the study area 21 300 km2 in the ez and 62 150 in the nz using the presence of shallow aquifers within those areas as additional criteria for refining the modeled sgw distribution the optimum sgw was estimated at 23 400 km2 in the central and southern sections of the wd and 17 400 km2 in the ez we used two additional conditions to refine the sgw locations in the nz the first is placement in areas where the rising nubian waters are fresh or brackish within zones i or ii but not in regions where the nubian waters are saline zone iii the second is placement in areas where post nubian successions are limited in thickness dtn 1 km the rising nubian waters do not undergo extensive interactions with thick post nubian sequences in those areas using the conditions mentioned above the optimum sgw was estimated at 30 700 km2 in the nz of the wd the adopted techniques are cost effective and efficient and could be applied to large sectors of saharan africa and arabia whose landscape and fossil aquifers bear many resemblances in their geologic climatic and geomorphic characteristics to the nsas these include but are not limited to the nwsas area 1 2 106 km2 in algeria tunisia and libya and the mega aquifer system mas area 2 106 km2 in saudi arabia oman and united arab emirates likewise the adopted techniques could be applied to other arid regions worldwide with similar fossil aquifer settings credit authorship contribution statement hossein sahour

queensland brisbane australia corresponding author air water interactions regulate lake water temperature by balancing the rate of change of water temperature stored heat with the incoming and outgoing heat fluxes which are functions of water temperature and external forcing yet there is a large knowledge gap in quantifying the thermoregulation of a lake and especially managed lakes which is hypothesized to be related to both external environmental forcing and management decisions on lake depth and water inflow here we explore the thermoregulation of a restored and managed mediterranean lake agamon hula israel by direct measurements of all major heat fluxes we interpret the results with a rigorous analysis of the thermoregulation equation obtained by formulating the energy balance equation in terms of water temperature the equation shows how water temperature of a lake shifts toward steady state scaled by the lake s response time where the steady state temperature was reached it was controlled by external environmental forcing and not by lake depth whereas the thermal response time to re attain steady state following an abrupt change in various environmental conditions is controlled by water depth the lake temperature response to pre defined oscillations of the environmental forcing showed that the amplitude of water temperature fluctuations and the time delay from steady state are controlled by the ratio between the environmental forcing s time period diurnal seasonal or other cycles and the thermal response time of the lake the summertime measured co2 fluxes of agamon hula revealed the lake acts as a co2 source to the atmosphere overpassing similar water bodies from different climates abbreviations ec eddy covariance le

temperature occurs through air water exchange of energy and water vapor petrescu et al 2015 rouse et al 2005 the energy balance equation of a lake states that the rate of change of stored heat per unit area equals the incoming and outgoing heat fluxes 1 g r n a d l e h where g is the rate of change of heat storage water temperature rn is the net radiation sum of incoming and outcoming radiation and ad is the advection of heat via water discharge the last two terms are the turbulent fluxes the latent heat of evaporation le and the sensible heat flux h which are most accurately measured by the eddy covariance ec method figure 1a lensky et al 2018 nordbo et al 2011 tanny et al 2008 regulation of the water temperature of lakes under given environmental conditions can be expressed by solving the energy balance equation eqn 1 in terms of water temperature provided that all the heat fluxes are formulated as a function of water temperature and environmental forcing this is solved numerically as parts of oceanographic models e g pom roms however the numerical solutions do not provide explicit relations between the controlling processes of thermoregulation in lakes especially in managed lakes and wetlands several questions remain unclear here we choose to focus on the following a what are the main processes controlling the steady state temperature that provide zero change of the heat storage flux g 0 in eqn 1 b how fast does the lake temperature responds to an abrupt change in environmental conditions and what dictates the characteristic time to the new steady state response time c what controls the dynamics of water temperature when environmental conditions are continuously changing during daily and seasonal cycles for managed lakes and wetlands these questions are commonly hypothesized to be related to both external environmental forcing such as air temperature humidity and wind speed and to management decisions on the lake depth and water discharge however quantifying the role each factor has on defining rates of water temperature regulation is yet obscured thus answering these questions is critical for our basic understanding of lakes thermoregulation with implications on water management decisions cosgrove loucks 2015 ecological resilience ecotourism bernardo et al 2007 carey et al 2011 deutsch et al 2008 and greenhouse gas emissions yvon durocher et

from the atmosphere leifeld menichetti 2018 yet direct measurements of co2 fluxes over managed lakes and wetlands are limited in number especially in mediterranean climates here we address the questions regarding thermoregulation of a lake and greenhouse gas emissions by presenting results from an investigation of summertime air water interactions using the ec method from a restored managed shallow lake the agamon hula lake israel hereon agamon hula as agamon means little lake in hebrew we quantify the air water interactions and explore their relationships with micrometeorological conditions by direct observations sections 4 1and 4 2 then linking the measured heat fluxes with the environmental conditions section 4 3 including water temperature allows the development of novel equations based on energy conservation describing the water temperature regulation for lakes with demonstrations of its application for agamon hula section 4 4 finally we explore and connect synoptic

constant diurnal wind pattern and temperature deviations lensky et al 2018 this is a result of a persistent synoptic scale circulation pattern affecting northern israel which is under a subtropical high pressure belt associated with air subsidence in the upper to middle troposphere leading to extensive warming of the mid layers increasing atmospheric stability and suppressing rainfall dayan

footprint of 50 70 and 90 were calculated from kljun et al 2015 the footprint results ensured that the ec system was successfully measuring the agamon hula water free of vegetated surfaces fig 2a the net radiation rn was calculated by summing the four radiation components 2 r n k l k l incoming and outgoing longwave and shortwave radiation components per unit area of the lake surface that were

forecasts ecmwf interim reanalysis era interim dee et al 2011 4 results and discussion 4 1 micrometeorological diurnal cycle at agamon hula the radiation and micrometeorological parameters display a strong diurnal pattern during summer fig 3 typical to the eastern mediterranean region deviations from the mean diurnal cycles are minor figs s4 s8 and are related mostly to changes in synoptic scale weather the diurnal cycle of radiation rises from minimum nighttime values 350 450 and 0 w m2 for l l k and k respectively to the noon maximum 400 500 1000 and 40 fig 3a b air and water temperatures follow the radiation curve respectively lagging 1 and 2 h behind with minimum temperatures before sunrise 19 5 c and 25 2 c fig 3c to maxima in the afternoon 32 4 c and 34 0 c the rh displays an opposite trend fig 3d peaking at sunrise 88 and reaching a minimum at the afternoon 41 air vapor pressure ea is nearly constant throughout the diurnal cycle 20 mbar fig 3e water vapor pressure ew is minimal 32 mbar slightly after sunrise then it rises and reaches a maximum 53 mbar during the afternoon wind speed is low during the night 1 3 m s fig 3f and increases before noon with the arrival of msb which peaks in the afternoon 9 0 m s increasing wind speed is paired with a shift in wind direction from weak southeasterly winds 145 to stronger northwesterly winds 290 figure 2d 4 2 diurnal cycle of heat fluxes and energy budget closure the diurnal course of the five heat flux components presented in eqn 1 is illustrated in fig 4 a when sun rises the net radiation increases from nighttime negative values that are dominated by net radiation emission 85 w m2 to the noon maximum gain of radiative flux 875 w m2 dominated by the incoming solar radiation the heat storage of the lake g rises from sunrise to noon maximum 800 w m2 fueled by the incoming radiation the increased stored heat from morning to noon is converted to turbulent fluxes at the afternoon mostly via latent heat flux 600 w m2 and slightly by sensible heat flux 20 w m2 the sharp increase in le results in evaporative cooling of the water surface i e a sharp decline of g at sunset the le fluxes decrease 250 w m2 to the nighttime low that is defined by positive fluxes of h 20 w m2 the contribution of advection of heat by discharges is minor 5 w m2 the daily averages of the five heat flux components are tightly explained by the concept of energy balance eqn 1 i e the stored heat g is almost equal to the difference between available energy rn ad and turbulent energy le h with a 4 deviation fig 4c furthermore in agamon hula the half hourly average results for the entire summer 62 days fig 4d are closely related thereby confirming the high quality of data 4 3 environmental control on turbulent fluxes the correlation between micrometeorological variables and turbulent fluxes measured at agamon hula reveals that le and h are best explained by the mass transfer model modified from harbeck et

kg k wind speed and the temperature difference c between the water and the overlying atmosphere tw and ta respectively fig 5b the energy budget and the micrometeorological variables are coupled during the diurnal cycle at agamon hula the increased stored heat from morning to noon and the arrival of the dry and strong msb winds accelerates both wind speed and the vapor pressure difference ew ea fig 5c which enhance the turbulent fluxes at the afternoon mostly via le and slightly by h fig 5d at sunset the le fluxes decrease in response to evaporative cooling of the water surface resulting in reduced vapor pressure difference along with lower wind velocities hence suppressing le nighttime fluxes of h are related to the temperature gradient between the lake and the atmosphere fig 5e 4 4 water temperature regulation according to the energy balance equation the next step is to examine how air water interactions regulate water temperature in the case of a water column that is spatially uniform in temperature first we write an equation for the steady state temperature using the expression for the heat flux components discussed above then we consider time dependent temperature variations in the vicinity of the steady state condition and derive a transient solution the full description is detailed in the si 4 4 1 the steady state water temperature the steady state water temperature t w s t is achieved when the heat storage or water temperature is constant i e g 0 substituting eqn 2 4 7 and 8 into the heat storage of eqn 3 yields the steady state condition 9 d c p ρ w

using the stefan boltzman equation ε is the emissivity of a gray body 0 97 and σ is the stefan boltzman constant w m2 k the ra represents the latter radiation components unrelated to water temperature calculated as 10 r a k l k the steady state temperature is controlled by the physical properties of water cp ɛw ρw and lv the environmental forcing rh ta ws and radiation and management decisions on the discharges qin and qout and the water temperature of the incoming discharge tin however the depth of the lake d does not appear in the equation and therefore has no control on the steady state temperature of the lake hence both deep and shallow lakes under the same external forcing should theoretically reach the same steady state temperature if the external forcing remains constant the algebraic equation eq 9 is solved numerically to obtain the value of the steady state temperature 4 4 2 trainset solution of water temperature we explore the evolution of water temperature in the vicinity of the steady state temperature t w s t eq 9 this is done by approximating each term of the heat fluxes by a linear function of water temperature using the first term of the taylor series centered at the steady state water temperature 11 1 r n r a l t w s t l t w t w s t 11 2 a d a d t w s t a d t w t w s t 11 3 l e l e t w s t l e t w t w s t 11 4 h h t w s t h t w t w s t where l t w

during the time t τr the difference between initial and steady state temperature values decreases by a factor of e 63 thus τr represents a practical metric to estimate the thermal response time of the lake fig 6 according to eq 14 τr is proportional to water depth d physical properties of water cp ɛw ρw and lv wind speed ws vapor ew and ea and temperature tw and ta difference between the water body and the atmosphere and management decisions on the outgoing lakes discharges q o u t in addition the slopes of the heat fluxes with respect to water temperature of eq 14 pose interesting features regarding thermoregulation of lakes first higher slopes will decrease the response time of lakes second heat fluxes with larger slopes will emit a higher amount of heat for a given rise of water temperature and vice versa for lower slopes in practice the environmental forcing e g radiation ta and rh is not constant and typically oscillates with diurnal and seasonal cycles meaning that the steady state water temperature fluctuates with time we search the solution of eq 13 for the case of oscillating steady state temperature 16 t w s t t t w s t δ t w s t e i 2 π τ f t where τ f is the time period of the environmental forcing at different time scales daily seasonal or climate change cycles t s t and δ t w s t are constants representing the average steady state water temperature and the amplitude of its oscillation in this case the solution for the time dependent water temperature is 17 t w t t w s t δ t w s t 1 i 2 π τ f τ r 1 e i 2 π τ f t since the solution of eq 17 is formulated in terms of complex numbers we transform it to express the amplitude a w of the water temperature oscillations the real part and the phase shift between the oscillating steady state temperature of eq 16 and predicted water temperature oscillations the amplitude of the water temperature oscillations in response to oscillating external conditions is reduced by a factor depending on the ratio between the response time τ r and the period of the external forcing τ f 18 a w δ t w s t 1 2 π τ r τ f 2 1 and the phase lag is 19 ϕ tan 1 2 π τ r τ f hence both the water temperature oscillation amplitude a w and the phase lag ϕ are determined by the ratio between the thermal response time and time period of the environmental forcing τ r τ f using the phase lag eq 19 and amplitude

amplitude fig 7d when the response time is larger than the environmental forcing time period 2 π τ r τ f a larger phase occurs and the amplitude of the water temperature is minimal note that the maximal phase lag is π 2 to transform the phase to time lag it should be multiplied by τ f 2 π which corresponds to a quarter of a period the crucial role of the ratio τ r τ f on the dynamics of lake temperature demonstrates why deep lakes with a large response time release relatively high amount of stored heat during colder seasons when incoming radiation is low blanken et al 2003 hamdani et al 2018 rouse et al 2003 also it can explain the observed warmer water temperature and higher outgoing fluxes of le from shallow lakes as opposed to adjacent deep lakes when entering summertime granger hedstrom 2011 oswald rouse 2004 wang et al 2017 note that for deeper lakes the variations of the water temperature with depth should be considered requiring further development in the future 4 4 3 implications of the thermoregulation equations for agamon hula at agamon hula both the calculated steady state for the daily average conditions according to eq 9 and the daily average water temperature yielded similar results t w s t 29 3 and t w 29 2 respectively thus at agamon hula the daily average water temperature is practically at steady state this is also observed by the value of the change of stored heat which for the daily average is negligible 1 w m2 fig 4a for the summertime daily scale of the average values of net radiation and meteorological conditions for the case of agamon hula τ r is 13 h the highest heat flux slope with respect to water temperature i e l ad le and h was found for the latent heat flux of evaporation demonstrating that evaporative cooling acts as the most effective thermoregulation mechanism followed by l and lastly through h with a ratio of 4 8 1 and 1 3 1 respectively fig 6 hence as the lake temperature rises the regulation will further increase the magnitude of le sensitivity tests on the transient solution of eq 15 are presented in fig 8 the results show that the shallower the lake is the faster it will reach steady state fig 8a the larger the inflow discharge is the more it influences the water temperature of the lake in the case of agamon hula during summer and the inflowing water is cooler than the waterbody thus increasing advection by ten results in cooler steady state temperature 28 2 c fig 8b in addition if we increase the incoming water temperature by 10 c it has negligible impact on the steady state temperature by increasing the radiative forcing by 5 the outgoing fluxes increase e g more evaporation and the steady state temperature increases 30 2 c fig 8c increased air vapor pressure by raising ta or rh by 10 resulted in a warmer steady state 30 1 and 29 8 c respectively as le is reduced due to a lower vapor pressure gradient storing more heat in the water column these results suit observed warmer water temperatures from lakes located closer to the equator where rh ta and radiation are higher as opposed to colder lakes at higher latitudes woolway et al 2018 reducing le can also occur as wind speed ws decreases which in turn leads to a warmer final water temperature 29 9 c which might reflect a synoptic scale climatic change in the region liu et al 2016 mcgloin et al 2015 for the intra diurnal cycle the thermal response of agamon hula is larger than the time scale of the environmental oscillations i e 2 π τ r τ f fig 7c d implying that the half hourly energy balance results of agamon hula are not at steady state therefore the actual water temperature lags four hours after the expected steady state temperature fig 3c and the amplitude of the water temperature is around a fourth of the steady state temperature a w δ t w s t 0 27 in agreement with the high amplitude of the oscillating g along the diurnal cycle from 600 to 1000 w m2 fig 4a for the seasonal time scale the response time is much shorter than the environmental forcing i e 2 π τ r τ f thus the shallow lake s water temperature will follow the steady state temperature with a maximal amplitude a w δ t w s t 1 and a neglectable time lag fitting the neglectable measured daily average value of g fig 4a 4 5 the role of synoptic patterns on air water interactions deviations of le fluxes from the typical diurnal mean might reflect changes in synoptic scale weather in israel and neighboring areas inter seasonal variations in summer are related to deviations in the intensity and position of the persian trough which influences changes in the magnitude of the synoptic scale winds alpert et al 2004 dayan et al 2002 with steeper pressure differences above the eastern mediterranean these synoptic scale generated winds are enhanced dayan et al 2012 shilo et al 2015 such changes in this pattern are emphasized below when we compare between the respective five days with the highest and lowest le and both with the diurnal average fig 9 the pressure difference above the eastern mediterranean was greater for days with maximum le 239 253 w m2 to minimal le 152 168 w m2 with δp of 1 9 and 0 59 hpa respectively fig 9a b hence both the mesoscale msb and synoptic scale forcing are acting together resulting in higher mean wind velocities relative to the mean diurnal wind regime 3 8 m s vs 3 4 m s respectively fig 9c in contrast mesoscale winds are not supported by the synoptic scale winds during days with weak synoptic pressure differences resulting in relatively low mean wind velocities 3 1 m s windier days enhanced le and therefore mean fluxes of le are higher in these days 237 w m2 fig 9d relative to the mean diurnal course 197 w m2 on days when local winds dominate weak synoptic scale pressure differences le is below average 161 w m2 the energy balance of the lake is altered by the intensity of the pressure difference above the eastern mediterranean i e by the synoptic scale forcing in days with maximum and minimum synoptic scale forcing rn 226 and 224 w m2 respectively and h 12 and 16 w m2 respectively are similar to the averaged diurnal mean 227 and 15 w m2 respectively thus energy is transferred by stored heat in turn by the water temperature more energy was converted to turbulent fluxes of le by the heat stored in the lake g 20 w m2 and vice versa for low le g 22 w m2 as opposed to the averaged diurnal mean g 1 w m2 these synoptic events illustrate the discussion regarding the role environmental forcing has on water temperature regulation 4 6 fluxes of co2 the flux of co2 along the average course of the diurnal cycle fig 4b and fig s7 for the entire time series indicates that the lake acts as a source of co2 to the atmosphere with maximum co2 effluxes at sunrise 13 µmol m2 s falling to negative values during the morning 4 µmol s m2 8 am local time fluxes of co2 are near zero during the daytime until sunset rising to near constant positive values at night during summer the daily average flux of co2 is 12 9 g m2 d or in units of t km2 d where the lake is 1 km2 this observation is surprising as most reported data from restored shallow lakes in various geo climatic regions shows that they act as sinks for atmospheric co2 during summertime such as a restored shallow wetland in california usa 14 g m2 d knox et al 2015 a peat bog with a temperate oceanic climate in delta british columbia canada 1 3 g m2 d lee et al 2017 a subtropical marsh in yunnan province china 1 8 g m2 d du et al 2021 and a wetland in florida usa 7 5 g m2 d zhang et al 2021 even measured positive co2 fluxes are relatively low compared to agamon hula ranging from 0 48 to 1 37 g m2 d in sweden huotari et al 2011 podgrajsek et al 2015 and the austrian alps scholz et al 2021 to 5 g m2 d from a restored shallow fen in ne germany 5 g m2 d franz et al 2016 for most of the lakes discussed here the measurement footprints is capturing a mixture of both vegetated patches and the lake s water surface while in the case presented here the measured co2 fluxes are based on co2 fluxes from the water surface not from vegetated areas fig 2a hence indicating the water surface co2 signal excluding the adjacent vegetation in the future the instillation of an adjacent ec tower that captures only the vegetation co2 signal might further improve our understating regarding co2 air water exchange 5 conclusions air water interactions were measured over agamon hula northern israel using the eddy covariance method during the summer of 2021 the measurements illustrate the concept of energy balance closure as the daily average values of incoming and outgoing heat fluxes are nearly equal a correlation was detected between latent and sensible heat fluxes to the micrometeorological variables of wind speed and water vapor and temperature difference between the lake surface and the atmosphere respectively the thermoregulation equation was obtained by formulating the energy balance equation in terms of water temperature the equation shows how the water temperature of a lake shifts toward a steady state scaled by the lake s response time it is concluded that the steady state temperature is unrelated to depth as both deep and shallow lakes should theoretically reach the same steady state temperature under similar and constant external forcing we formulated the relation between steady state water temperature and the environmental forcing steady state temperature will increase for higher air temperature humidity lower evaporation and radiation which can guide the estimation of water temperature at different geo climatic regions and for projections of global warming scenarios the solution of the thermoregulation equation for the case of a rapid change in environmental forcing reveals that the shallower the lake is the faster it will reach a steady state as the response time is mostly related to the lake depth for the common case where the steady state temperature oscillates due to oscillations in environmental forcing the amplitude of water temperature and the time delay from steady state are controlled by the ratio of the period of the oscillating environmental forcing daily seasonal and even climate change cycles over the thermal response time of the lake hence shallow lakes will deviate from steady state temperature within the diurnal cycles with lower temperature amplitude and time delay but will follow steady state temperature when averaging for a few days similarly deeper lakes will show transient behavior within the seasonal time period but will follow steady state in the annual scale and oceans will mostly react with climate change cycles an illustration of the way environmental forcing can alter the lake s thermoregulation is exemplified by intensified synoptic winds that cooled the lake in addition agamon hula was found as a net source of atmospheric co2 to the atmosphere exceeding co2

queensland brisbane australia corresponding author air water interactions regulate lake water temperature by balancing the rate of change of water temperature stored heat with the incoming and outgoing heat fluxes which are functions of water temperature and external forcing yet there is a large knowledge gap in quantifying the thermoregulation of a lake and especially managed lakes which is hypothesized to be related to both external environmental forcing and management decisions on lake depth and water inflow here we explore the thermoregulation of a restored and managed mediterranean lake agamon hula israel by direct measurements of all major heat fluxes we interpret the results with a rigorous analysis of the thermoregulation equation obtained by formulating the energy balance equation in terms of water temperature the equation shows how water temperature of a lake shifts toward steady state scaled by the lake s response time where the steady state temperature was reached it was controlled by external environmental forcing and not by lake depth whereas the thermal response time to re attain steady state following an abrupt change in various environmental conditions is controlled by water depth the lake temperature response to pre defined oscillations of the environmental forcing showed that the amplitude of water temperature fluctuations and the time delay from steady state are controlled by the ratio between the environmental forcing s time period diurnal seasonal or other cycles and the thermal response time of the lake the summertime measured co2 fluxes of agamon hula revealed the lake acts as a co2 source to the atmosphere overpassing similar water bodies from different climates abbreviations ec eddy covariance le

unit area equals the incoming and outgoing heat fluxes 1 g r n a d l e h where g is the rate of change of heat storage water temperature rn is the net radiation sum of incoming and outcoming radiation and ad is the advection of heat via water discharge the last two terms are the turbulent fluxes the latent heat of evaporation le and the sensible heat flux h which are most accurately measured by the eddy covariance ec method figure 1a lensky et al 2018 nordbo et al 2011 tanny et al 2008 regulation of the water temperature of lakes under given environmental conditions can be expressed by solving the energy balance equation eqn 1 in terms of water temperature provided that all the heat fluxes are formulated as a function of water temperature and environmental forcing this is solved numerically as parts of oceanographic models e g pom roms however the numerical solutions do not provide explicit relations between the controlling processes of thermoregulation in lakes especially in managed lakes and wetlands several questions remain unclear here we choose to focus on the following a what are the main processes controlling the steady state temperature that provide zero change of the heat storage flux g 0 in eqn 1 b how fast does the lake temperature responds to an abrupt change in environmental conditions and what dictates the characteristic time to the new steady state response time c what controls the dynamics of water temperature when environmental conditions are continuously changing during daily and seasonal cycles for managed lakes and wetlands these questions are commonly hypothesized to be related to both external environmental forcing such as air temperature humidity and wind speed and to management decisions on the lake depth and water discharge however quantifying the role each factor has on defining rates of water temperature regulation is yet obscured thus answering these questions is critical for our basic understanding of lakes thermoregulation with implications on water management decisions cosgrove loucks 2015 ecological resilience ecotourism bernardo et al 2007 carey et al 2011 deutsch et al 2008 and greenhouse gas emissions yvon durocher et

questions regarding thermoregulation of a lake and greenhouse gas emissions by presenting results from an investigation of summertime air water interactions using the ec method from a restored managed

strong diurnal pattern during summer fig 3 typical to the eastern mediterranean region deviations from the mean diurnal cycles are minor figs s4 s8 and are related mostly to changes in synoptic scale

opposite trend fig 3d peaking at sunrise 88 and reaching a minimum at the afternoon 41 air vapor pressure ea is nearly constant throughout the diurnal cycle 20 mbar fig 3e water vapor pressure ew is minimal 32 mbar slightly after sunrise then it rises and reaches a maximum 53 mbar during the afternoon wind speed is low during the night 1 3 m s fig 3f and increases before noon with the arrival of msb which peaks in the afternoon 9 0 m s increasing wind speed is paired with a shift in wind direction from weak southeasterly winds 145 to stronger northwesterly winds 290 figure 2d 4 2 diurnal cycle of heat fluxes and energy budget closure the diurnal course of the five heat flux components presented in eqn 1 is illustrated in fig 4 a when sun rises the net radiation increases from nighttime negative values that are dominated by net radiation emission 85 w m2 to the noon maximum gain of radiative flux 875 w m2 dominated by the incoming solar radiation the heat storage of the lake g rises from sunrise to noon maximum 800 w m2 fueled by the incoming radiation the increased stored heat from morning to noon is converted to turbulent fluxes at the afternoon mostly via latent heat flux 600 w m2 and slightly by sensible heat flux 20 w m2 the sharp increase in le results in evaporative cooling of the water surface i e a sharp decline of g at sunset the le fluxes decrease 250 w m2 to the nighttime low that is defined by positive fluxes of h 20 w m2 the contribution of advection of heat by discharges is minor 5 w m2 the daily averages of the five heat flux components are tightly explained by the concept of energy balance eqn 1 i e the stored heat g is almost equal to the difference between available energy rn ad and turbulent energy le h with a 4 deviation fig 4c furthermore in agamon hula the half hourly average results for the entire summer 62 days fig 4d are closely related thereby confirming the high quality of data 4 3 environmental control on turbulent fluxes the correlation between micrometeorological variables and turbulent fluxes measured at agamon hula reveals that le and h are best explained by the mass transfer model modified from harbeck et

kg k wind speed and the temperature difference c between the water and the overlying atmosphere tw and ta respectively fig 5b the energy budget and the micrometeorological variables are coupled during the diurnal cycle at agamon hula the increased stored heat from morning to noon and the arrival of the dry and strong msb winds accelerates both wind speed and the vapor pressure difference ew ea fig 5c which enhance the turbulent fluxes at the afternoon mostly via le and slightly by h fig 5d at sunset the le fluxes decrease in response to evaporative cooling of the water surface resulting in reduced vapor pressure difference along with lower wind velocities hence suppressing le nighttime fluxes of h are related to the temperature gradient between the lake and the atmosphere fig 5e 4 4 water temperature regulation according to the energy balance equation the next step is to examine how air water interactions regulate water temperature in the case of a water column that is spatially uniform in temperature first we write an equation for the steady state temperature using the expression for the heat flux components discussed above then we consider time dependent temperature variations in the vicinity of the steady state condition and derive a transient solution the full description is detailed in the si 4 4 1 the steady state water temperature the steady state water

the discharges qin and qout and the water temperature of the incoming discharge tin however the depth of the lake d does not appear in the equation and therefore has no control on the steady state temperature of the lake hence both deep and shallow lakes under the same external forcing should theoretically reach the same steady state temperature if the external forcing remains constant the algebraic equation eq 9 is solved numerically to obtain the value of the steady state temperature 4 4 2 trainset solution of water temperature we explore the evolution of water temperature in the vicinity of the steady state temperature t w s t eq 9 this is done by approximating each term of the heat fluxes by a linear function of water temperature using the first term of the taylor series

and the atmosphere and management decisions on the outgoing lakes discharges q o u t in addition the slopes of the heat fluxes with respect to water temperature of eq 14 pose interesting features regarding thermoregulation of lakes first higher slopes will decrease the response time of lakes second heat fluxes with larger slopes will emit a higher amount of heat for a given rise of water temperature and vice versa for lower slopes in practice the environmental forcing e g radiation ta and rh is not constant and typically oscillates with diurnal and seasonal cycles meaning that the steady state water temperature fluctuates with time we search the solution of eq 13 for the case of oscillating steady state temperature 16 t w s t t t w s t δ t w s t e i 2 π τ f t where τ f is the time period of the environmental forcing at different time scales daily seasonal or climate change cycles t s t and δ t w s t are constants representing the average steady state water temperature and the amplitude of its oscillation in this case the solution for the time dependent water temperature is 17 t w t t w s t δ t w s t 1 i 2 π τ f τ r 1 e i 2 π τ f t since the solution of eq 17 is formulated in terms of complex numbers we transform it to express the amplitude a w of the water temperature oscillations the real part and the phase shift between the oscillating steady state temperature of eq 16 and predicted water temperature oscillations the amplitude of the water temperature oscillations in response to oscillating external conditions is reduced by a factor depending on the ratio between the response time τ r and the period of the external forcing τ f 18 a w δ t w s t 1 2 π τ r τ f 2 1 and the phase lag is 19 ϕ tan 1 2 π τ r τ f hence both the water temperature oscillation amplitude a w and the phase lag ϕ are determined by the ratio between the thermal response time and time period of the environmental forcing τ r τ f using the phase lag eq 19 and amplitude eq 18 the solution for the water temperature change in response to a sinusoidal like external oscillation is 20 t w t t w s t δ t w s t 1 2 π τ r τ f 2 1 s i n 2 π t τ f tan 1 2 π τ r τ f fig 7 a shows how the predicted water temperature in eq 20 responds to the oscillatory forcing of eq 16 we illustrate it for different time scale ratios τ r τ f fig 7b when the thermal response time is smaller than the time period of the environmental forcing 2 π τ r τ f the solution is closer to the steady state oscillatory solution with a negligible phase fig 7c and maximal water temperature amplitude fig 7d when the response time is larger than the environmental forcing time period 2 π τ r τ f a larger phase occurs and the amplitude of the water temperature is minimal note that the maximal phase lag is π 2 to transform the phase to time lag it should be multiplied by τ f 2 π which corresponds to a quarter of a period the crucial role of the ratio τ r τ f on the dynamics of lake temperature demonstrates why deep lakes with a large response time release relatively high amount of stored heat during colder seasons when incoming radiation is low blanken et al 2003 hamdani et al 2018 rouse et al 2003 also it can explain the observed warmer water temperature and higher outgoing fluxes of le from shallow lakes as opposed to adjacent deep lakes when entering summertime granger hedstrom 2011 oswald rouse 2004 wang et al 2017 note that for deeper lakes the variations of the water temperature with depth should be considered requiring further development in the future 4 4 3 implications of the thermoregulation equations for agamon hula at agamon hula both the calculated steady state for the daily average conditions according to eq 9 and the daily average water temperature yielded similar results t w s t 29 3 and t w 29 2 respectively thus at agamon hula the daily average water temperature is practically at steady state this is also observed by the value of the change of stored heat which for the daily average is negligible 1 w m2 fig 4a for the summertime daily scale of the average values of net radiation and meteorological conditions for the case of agamon hula τ r is 13 h the highest heat flux slope with respect to water temperature i e l ad le and h was found for the latent heat flux of evaporation demonstrating that evaporative cooling acts as the most effective thermoregulation mechanism followed by l and lastly through h with a ratio of 4 8 1 and 1 3 1 respectively fig 6 hence as the lake temperature rises the regulation will further increase the magnitude of le sensitivity tests on the transient solution of eq 15 are presented in fig 8 the results show that the shallower the lake is the faster it will reach steady state fig 8a the larger the inflow discharge is the more it influences the water temperature of the lake in the case of agamon hula during summer and the inflowing water is cooler than the waterbody thus increasing advection by ten results in cooler steady state temperature 28 2 c fig 8b in addition if we increase the incoming water temperature by 10 c it has negligible impact on the steady state temperature by increasing the radiative forcing by 5 the outgoing fluxes increase e g more evaporation and the steady state temperature increases 30 2 c fig 8c increased air vapor pressure by raising ta or rh by 10 resulted in a warmer steady state 30 1 and 29 8 c respectively as le is reduced due to a lower vapor pressure gradient storing more heat in the water column these results suit observed warmer water temperatures from lakes located closer to the equator where rh ta and radiation are higher as opposed to colder lakes at higher latitudes woolway et al 2018 reducing le can also occur as wind speed ws decreases which in turn leads to a warmer final water temperature 29 9 c which might reflect a synoptic scale climatic change in the region liu et al 2016 mcgloin et al 2015 for the intra diurnal cycle the thermal response of agamon hula is larger than the time scale of the environmental oscillations i e 2 π τ r τ f fig 7c d implying that the half hourly energy balance results of agamon hula are not at steady state therefore the actual water temperature lags four hours after the expected steady state temperature fig 3c and the amplitude of the water temperature is around a fourth of the steady state temperature a w δ t w s t 0 27 in agreement with the high amplitude of the oscillating g along the diurnal cycle from 600 to 1000 w m2 fig 4a for the seasonal time scale the response time is much shorter than the environmental forcing i e 2 π τ r τ f thus the shallow lake s water temperature will follow the steady state temperature with a maximal amplitude a w δ t w s t 1 and a neglectable time lag fitting the neglectable measured daily average value of g fig 4a 4 5 the role of synoptic patterns on air water interactions deviations of le fluxes from the typical diurnal mean might reflect changes in synoptic scale weather in israel and neighboring areas inter seasonal variations in summer are related to deviations in the intensity and position of the persian trough which influences changes in the magnitude of the synoptic scale winds alpert et al 2004 dayan et al 2002 with steeper pressure differences above the eastern mediterranean these synoptic scale generated winds are enhanced dayan et al 2012 shilo et al 2015 such changes in this pattern are emphasized below when we compare between the respective five days with the highest and lowest le and both with the diurnal average fig 9 the pressure difference above the eastern mediterranean was greater for days with maximum le 239 253 w m2 to minimal le 152 168 w m2 with δp of 1 9 and 0 59 hpa respectively fig 9a b hence both the mesoscale msb and synoptic scale forcing are acting together resulting in higher mean wind velocities relative to the mean diurnal wind regime 3 8 m s vs 3 4 m s respectively fig 9c in contrast mesoscale winds are not supported by the synoptic scale winds during days with weak synoptic pressure differences resulting in relatively low mean wind velocities 3 1 m s windier days enhanced le and therefore mean fluxes of le are higher in these days 237 w m2 fig 9d relative to the mean diurnal course 197 w m2 on days when local winds dominate weak synoptic scale pressure differences le is below average 161 w m2 the energy balance of the lake is altered by the intensity of the pressure difference above the eastern mediterranean i e by the synoptic scale forcing in days with maximum and minimum synoptic scale forcing rn 226 and 224 w m2 respectively and h 12 and 16 w m2 respectively are similar to the averaged diurnal mean 227 and 15 w m2 respectively thus energy is transferred by stored heat in turn by the water temperature more energy was converted to turbulent fluxes of le by the heat stored in the lake g 20 w m2 and vice versa for low le g 22 w m2 as opposed to the averaged diurnal mean g 1 w m2 these synoptic events illustrate the discussion regarding the role environmental forcing has on water temperature regulation 4 6 fluxes of co2 the flux of co2 along the average course of the diurnal cycle fig 4b and fig s7 for the entire time series indicates that the lake acts as a source of co2 to the atmosphere with maximum co2 effluxes at sunrise 13 µmol m2 s falling to negative values during the morning 4 µmol s m2 8 am local time fluxes of co2 are near zero during the daytime until sunset rising to near constant positive values at night during summer the daily average flux of co2 is 12 9 g m2 d or in units of t km2 d where the lake is 1 km2 this observation is surprising as most reported data from restored shallow lakes in various geo climatic regions shows that they act as sinks for atmospheric co2 during summertime such as a restored shallow wetland in california usa 14 g m2 d knox et al 2015 a peat bog with a temperate oceanic climate in delta british columbia canada 1 3 g m2 d lee et al 2017 a subtropical marsh in yunnan province china 1 8 g m2 d du et al 2021 and a wetland in florida usa 7 5 g m2 d zhang et al 2021 even measured positive co2 fluxes are relatively low compared to agamon hula ranging from 0 48 to 1 37 g m2 d in sweden huotari et al 2011 podgrajsek et al 2015 and the austrian alps scholz et al 2021 to 5 g m2 d from a restored shallow fen in ne germany 5 g m2 d franz et al 2016 for most of the lakes discussed here the measurement footprints is capturing a mixture of both vegetated patches and the lake s water surface while in the case presented here the measured co2 fluxes are based on co2 fluxes from the water surface not from vegetated areas fig 2a hence indicating the water surface co2 signal excluding the adjacent vegetation in the future the instillation of an adjacent ec tower that captures only the vegetation co2 signal might further improve our understating regarding co2 air water exchange 5 conclusions air water interactions were measured over agamon hula northern israel using the eddy covariance method during the summer of 2021 the measurements illustrate the concept of energy balance closure as the daily average values of incoming and outgoing heat fluxes are nearly equal a correlation was detected between latent and sensible heat fluxes to the micrometeorological variables of wind speed and water vapor and temperature difference between the lake surface and the atmosphere respectively the thermoregulation equation was obtained by formulating the energy balance equation in terms of water temperature the equation shows how the water temperature of a lake shifts toward a steady state scaled by the lake s response time it is concluded that the steady state temperature is unrelated to depth as both deep and shallow lakes should theoretically reach the same steady state temperature under similar and constant external forcing we formulated the relation between steady state water temperature and the environmental forcing steady state temperature will increase for higher air temperature humidity lower evaporation and radiation which can guide the estimation of water temperature at different geo climatic regions and for projections of global warming scenarios the solution of the thermoregulation equation for the case of a rapid change in environmental forcing reveals that the shallower the lake is the faster it will reach a steady state as the response time is mostly related to the lake depth for the common case where the steady state temperature oscillates due to oscillations in environmental forcing the amplitude of water temperature and the time delay from steady state are controlled by the ratio of the period of the oscillating environmental forcing daily seasonal and even climate change cycles over the thermal response time of the lake hence shallow lakes will deviate from steady state temperature within the diurnal cycles with lower temperature amplitude and time delay but will follow steady state temperature when averaging for a few days similarly deeper lakes will show transient behavior within the seasonal time period but will follow steady state in the annual scale and oceans will mostly react with climate change cycles an illustration of the way environmental forcing can alter the lake s thermoregulation is exemplified by intensified synoptic winds that cooled the lake in addition agamon hula was found as a net source of atmospheric co2 to the atmosphere exceeding co2

2824,many regions of the world have experienced rapid hydro climatic changes in recent decades mediterranean areas have especially experienced prolonged droughts changes to runoff and low flow periods many methods and assumptions for assessing trends in rainfall and runoff are available however a comprehensive framework is required that can consider variations at large temporal and spatial scales long term persistence ltp seasonal patterns and multiple change points an analysis framework has been developed in r and applied to a network of 107 rainfall gauges with about 100 yrs data and 90 streamflow water quality gauges 30 50 yrs data across south west western australia a region with a typical mediterranean climate trends were estimated using the original mann kendall omk family of tests including using the mann kendall test under the scaling hypothesis mkltp and seasonal mann kendall smk single and multiple change points were calculated by the non parametric lanzante s test lat e agglomerative algorithm ecp and energy divisive edp trend tests show annual rainfall has decreased by 2 6 mm yr in the western areas and increased by 0 9 mm yr in the eastern areas with corresponding change points in the 1940 s 1960 s and from 1995 to 2000 although 30 of the annual rainfall and 100 of the standardized precipitation index spi time series were found to be under ltp a regional flow trend analysis shows catchments are yielding much less runoff in more than 90 of gauged stations the runoff in perennial and ephemeral streams has shown a decline with the rate of 6 54 and 2 50 mm yr respectively runoff and baseflow decline occurred as step changes lagged after rainfall and the rate of decline in baseflow was more than for runoff suggesting that groundwater connectivity with stream inverts has fallen substantially stream salinities increased by 64 mg l yr or 15 overall which was highly significant the framework provides a structured approach to analyse changes in rainfall runoff and stream salinity for a mediterranean climate that is projected to become even warmer and drier keywords climate change dryland salinity hydro climatic drought australia water resources data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction time series analysis of hydro climatic data e g rainfall streamflow is widely used to detect temporal patterns associated with seasonality irregularity trends shifts or other forms of periodicity cyclicity salas obeysekera 2014 such analyses help water resource managers by identifying features such as lag responses of runoff to rainfall li et al 2008 fang et al 2012 altered runoff due to land use changes mohammady et al 2018 interactions between groundwater levels and rainfall

salinity chen et al 2000 gong and shen 2011 and the impacts of catchment management on nutrient export basu et al 2010 scharler baird 2003 time series analysis is also increasingly of interest to identify the nature of abrupt changes in hydrologic variables for example reduced sediment discharge to downstream waters caused by dam construction shi et al 2019 or water quality improvement following removal or treatment of point source discharges williams 2001 accordingly hydro climatic and water quality temporal data are rarely stationary and display changing statistical properties e g mean variance and autocorrelation over time milly et al 2015 totaro et al 2019 slater et al 2021 non parametric statistical approaches have become increasingly relied upon to quantify the nature of hydro climatic and water quality trends hirsch et al 1982 araghi et al 2015 as they are distribution free and provide a more nuanced perspective of trends over time kocsis et al 2017 trend analysis aims to detect the gradual deviation from past norms the original mann kendall omk test is a well known approach hamed 2008 and several modified methods have been developed the omk assumes that the data are independent and there is no serial correlation structure among the observations however hydro climatic observations i e rainfall and streamflow have strong auto correlation due to seasonality hirsch slack 1984 the seasonal mann kendall smk test was therefore introduced by hirsch et al 1982 to solve assessments across seasonal boundaries allowing comparison of hydro climatic time series from the same season over different years kazemzadeh and malekian 2016 mullick et al 2019 liu and mao 2020 gomes and wai 2020 the modified mann kendall mmk has also been applied to auto correlated data to eliminate its effect within seasons hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 nikzad tehrani et al 2019 mirdashtvan et al 2020 for example to find the impact of covariates in hydro climate variables on chemical oxygen demand libiseller and grimvall 2002 showed that the partial mann kendall pmk test proved more successful than the omk test further when working with hydro climatic variables it can be challenging to separate long term persistence ltp behaviour that results from slow interactions in the land atmosphere ocean system from deterministic trends in the catchment brought about by changes such as clearing of perennial vegetation increasing urbanization and increasing water consumption helsel et al 2020 here persistence is defined as the continuance of an effect after the cause is removed noting that climate variations at large temporal and spatial scales can change the central tendency of hydro climatic variables this effect has been quantified using a scaling coefficient now termed the hurst coefficient h after hurst 1951 hamed 2008 further improved the omk test by modifying the variance of the test statistic of the mann kendall test under a scaling hypothesis this modification has been applied to eliminate inflation in a given variance leading to an apparent trend and is termed the mann kendall long term persistence mkltp method hu et al 2020 despitethewidespreadapplication of the mk family of tests and change point detection methods across a diversity of contexts there remains uncertainty as to how where and which method to apply to specific data an ongoing challenge in applying these methods is their failure to separate seasonal patterns which can lead to misinterpretation of the impacts on catchment hydrology helsel et al 2020 another weakness arises when applying the scaling effect on hydro climatic parameters causing a variance inflation at a time scale greater than annual koutsoyiannis 2003 hamed 2008 hydro climatic processes are affected by climate processes such as el niño cycles and long term climate change as well as human activities such as land use changes ishak rahman 2019 detecting whether time series have abrupt changes or not identifying the change timing and identifying any trends between two or more abrupt changes can provide critical information to support adaptive management numerous studies have demonstrated the use of the most often used single change point detection methods e g lanzante s test lat pettitt s test buishand s test mann kendall rank standard normal homogeneity test snt to detect an abrupt change in hydro climatic time series shifteh some e et al 2012 malekian and kazemzadeh 2016 espinoza et al 2019 mahmood and jia 2019 chen et al 2019 ishak and rahman 2019 güçlü 2020 in contrast therearea number ofmethodsthat can identify multiple change points either using simple methods such as computing the cumulative deviation from the mean cdfm emelyanova et al 2013 or more sophisticated approaches such as the e agglomerative ecp and e divisive edp change detection algorithms matteson and james 2014 james et al 2019 there is also a need to determine trends before and after change points jehanzaib et al 2020 such analyses can show the magnitude of the effect of climate change or human activities as well as remove their persistent effects scaling after an identified change point whilst these assessment techniqueshave been used throughout the world south west western australia swwa serves as an interesting case study because it illustrates the rapid pace of hydro climatic change in a mediterranean climate zone the swwa has experienced a 15 20 reduction in average rainfall which started as an extended period of drought in the mid 1970 s petrone et al 2010 and which has become more severe since 1997 ali et al 2012 since the mid 1970 s surface runoff into the perth water supply network has declined by 50 silberstein et al 2012 a new hydrologic response regime has been triggered with a decrease in the runoff coefficient runoff rainfall and this has also manifested as a shift from perennial to ephemeral streams in some catchments smettem et al 2013 previous analyses of hydro climatic data from swwa have used the omk test to detect significant declining trends in rainfall and runoff in the majority of catchments petrone et al 2010 chowdhury and beecham 2010 similar results were found in 29 stations across swwa as streamflows declined in response to the below average rainfall durrant byleveld 2009 recently mcfarlane et al 2020 reported runoff and groundwater responses to climate change across swwa and reported a decline in rainfall runoff major flooding in winter groundwater levels runoff into dams and a decrease in the rate of salinisation over parts of the region while decreased runoff was the most easily observed change after the reduction in rainfall in all cases it was proceeded by less obvious falls in groundwater levels extending the analysis using the statistical methods outlined above on a wide range of datasets will provide opportunities to detect change points and trends between change points as hydro climatic processes respond to rising temperatures and potential evaporation as well as decreasing rainfall the main objective of this study was to develop a framework that allows an assessment of trends and change points to identify those that can be best applied to rainfall streamflow and streamwater quality data the framework was designed to detect annual and seasonal trends single and multiple change points and to be applied to data with complex inter and intra annual characteristics specifically this work aimed to develop an integrated framework to 1 detect significant or general negative and positive trends in climate and stream variables within the orginal mann kendall omk family and test the trend detection using data from swwa as a test case 2 separate long term persistence ltp behaviour and auto correlation due to interactions in the land atmosphere ocean system and seasonality and 3 identify abrupt single and multiple changes and trends between change points this framework is used to compare the results with monitoring stations previously analysed by mcfarlane et al 2020 and discern systematic and regional changes in trends and change points in the entire monitoring network across swwa 2 overview of statistical methods in general regression analysis was used to build methods for trend analysis including non parametric alternatives to ordinary least squares for data with a monotonic upward or downward non linear trend the non linear original mann kendall omk family of tests can be used a number of studies have concluded that this family of tests is the most effective tool for hydro climate variable analysis wang et al 2019 hirsch et al 1982 hirsch 2012 ator et al 2019 cloern 2019 step trend also known as change point tests are able to either compare two different periods separated by a long gap or to detect an abrupt shift slater et al 2021 in the realm of statistics in general there are many change point detection methods at least more than 20 nonparametric methods csörgő horváth 1988 also recent studies show that change point detection is a highly popular area of research in hydro climatic time series villarini et al 2012 rougé et al 2013 sagarika et al 2014 harrigan et al 2014 rahmani et al 2015 conte et al 2019 ryberg et al 2020 helsel et al 2020 there are several change point tests applied in this study including single and multiple tests such as the lat cdfm ecp and edp lanzante 1996 weber and stewart 2004 matteson and james 2014 james et al 2019 these tests are divided into two sections single and multiple change point detection among different single change point detections e g lanzante s test lat pettitt s test buishand s test mann kendall rank standard normal homogeneity test snt we decided to use the lanzante s test lat because in evaluation tests it was found that different methods gave very similar or identical results several single change point tests detected the exact location of change points with regard to multiple change points sharma et al 2016 examined four different change point detection tests which by virtue of current literature appear to be the most widely used and the newest algorithms they were bayesian analysis of change points erdman emerson 2008 e agglomerative algorithm for change points ecp and edp matteson james 2014 iterative robust detection method gérard marchant et al 2008 and wild binary segmentation fryzlewicz 2014 the energy agglomerative ecp and energy divisive edp algorithms have been applied in the present study as our initial tests accurately identified the correct locations and numbers of change points although they were not the most efficient and took more computational time for identification 2 1 models for trend analysis 2 1 1 original mann kendall test omk the omk test is a non parametric test for randomness against time which applies the kendall t test mann 1945 kendall 1948 letting x 1 x 2 x n be a sequence of measurements over time mann proposed to test the null hypothesis h0 that the data comes from a population where the random variables are independent and identically distributed the alternative hypothesis h1 is that the data follow a monotonic trend over time longobardi villani 2010 under h0 the mann kendall test statistic is 1 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s i g n x j x i where n is the length of the time series and 2 sign x j x i 1 x j x i 0 x j x i 1 x j x i when n 10 under the hypothesis of independent and randomly distributed variables the s statistic is approximately normally distributed with zero mean and variance as follows 3 σ s n 18 n 1 2 n 5 therefore the standardized z statistic zs follows a normal standardized distribution 4 z s s 1 σ s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 σ s i f s 0 and can be used to determine if a trend is significant or not in a two sided trend test the h0 the null hypothesis must be accepted if z z α 2 at α level of significance a downward trend is indicated by a negative value of s and an upward trend is shown by a positive value of s wang et al 2019 2 1 2 sen s slope estimator the sen s slope is applied to find the true slope of a linear trend in a time series sen 1968 the slope that calculates n pairs of data are estimated by 5 β i median y j y i x j x j for i 1 n where yj and yi are data values at time xi and xj n j i 1 respectively the sen s estimator of the slope can be defined as the median of n values of β a dataset of n x y pairs will result in n n 1 2 pairwise comparisons helsel et al 2020 the true slope can be computed by a non parametric test and β is checked by a two sided test at the 100 1 α confidence interval malekian kazemzadeh 2016 2 1 3 seasonal mann kendall test smk in nature most hydro climatic variables are related to seasonal patterns which are not detected by the omk test because the trend signal cannot be differentiated from seasonal effects as well as noise hirsch et al 1982 introduced the smk test to compute the test on each of m seasons separately and then combined the outcomes to perform the test kendall s s statistics denoted si are computed for each season and these are then summed to form the overall statistic sk 6 s k i 1 m s i the distribution of sk can be approximated by a normal distribution when the product of the number of seasons and number of years is more than about 25 based on 7 σ s k 2 i 1 m σ s i 2 i 1 m n i n i 1 2 n i 5 18 where ni is the number of years of data in the season i the z statistic is calculated as 8 z s k s k 1 σ s k i f s k 0 0 i f s k 0 s k 1 σ s k i f s k 0 in a two sided trend test the h0 the null hypothesis must be accepted if z z α 2 at the α level of significance in this study the r package rkt marchetto 2017 was used to undertake the smk tests on the data 2 1 4 adjustment for serial correlation based on the null hypothesis of the omk test the dataset is independent and randomly ordered malekian kazemzadeh 2016 it means that there is no serial correlation and trend among the observations the dataset used in present study might show serial correlation the positive serial correlation increases the possibility of rejecting the null hypothesis of no trend while the null hypothesis is true the correction for correlation among blocks have made by hirsch and slack 1984 and the partial test was proposed by libiseller and grimvall 2002 the rkt package have the ability to remove auto correlation between the data correction for inter block marchetto 2017 and 21 2 2 models for change point detection 2 2 1 single change point trend analysis is an estimation of the general direction in which something is developing or changing whereas change point detection identifies abrupt behaviour changes that may indicate a changing data structure or distribution sharma et al 2016 the process of identifying distributional changes within time ordered observations is called change point analysis matteson james 2014 the non parametric lanzante s test lat can be used to identify a single shift in the central tendency in a time series lanzante 1996 the lat is not affected by the presence of outliers and other forms of non normality the null hypothesis no shift is tested against the alternative shift a shift can be detected by the wilcoxon mann whitney two sample test the available r package trend pohlert 2018 was used in this study to identify single change points via the lat the cumulative deviation from the mean cdfm is also commonly used for identifying anomalously wet and dry periods weber and stewart 2004 emelyanova et al 2013 and has been applied to identify inter and intra annual wet and dry periods in monthly and seasonal time series of hydro climatic data the purpose of this test is to detect the existence of a change in the mean after m observations chiew mcmahon 1993 the cdfm also helped to detect the hurst index known as the scaling hypothesis hurst 1951 2 2 2 multiple change points the ecp and edp change point detection tests may be used to detect multiple change points in the hydro climatic and water quality data the ecp is an agglomerative hierarchical estimation algorithm and a computationally efficient method for detecting multiple change points and their locations via the goodness of fit of clusters within the data matteson and james 2014 james et al 2019 sudden changes can be detected using an agglomeration approach the edp test is based on divisive hierarchical clustering by measuring differences in multivariate hierarchical multiple change points with significance testing to find significant multiple change points matteson and james 2014 the available r package ecp james et al 2019 has been applied used herein to calculate the number of change points 2 3 trend analysis between change points and overall time series using the mann kendall test under the scaling hypothesis mkltp the mkltp is a modification of the omk family of tests that considers the scaling effect hypothesis long term persistence within raw data hamed 2008 the hypothesis of scaling considers invariance at any scale greater than annual koutsoyiannis 2003 the scaling effect assessed via the hurst index h varies between zero and one and for hydrological data typically ranges between 0 5 and 0 9 hurst 1951 a value greater than 0 5 results from an increase in the variance termed variance inflation to calculate h the trend was first removed from the raw time series using sens s slope estimator eq 5 sen 1968 the maximum likelihood ml method introduced by mcleod and hipel 1978 was then applied to calculate h for the equivalent normal variates the equivalent normal variates zt are computed from 9 z t φ 1 r t n 1 where n is the number of observations rt is the rank of detrended observation xt using eq 5 and φ 1 is the inverse standard normal distribution function then the log likelihood function of n normal observations with a scaling coefficient h was maximized using 10 logl h 0 5 log c n h z t c n h 1 z 2 γ 0 n 2 log γ 0

coefficients of scale lag l when h is 0 5 h calculated by eq 10 is approximately normally distributed for the uncorrelated case the significance of the mean μh and standard deviation σh of the

scaling hypothesis because of the incorrect variance variance inflation arises because the variance of the trend test statistic will be larger than what it would be under the standard assumptions that the random variable is independent and identically distributed helsel et al 2020 hamed 2008 modified the expression for variance such that if the series under question shows scaling effects the modified version would be applied 14 v s i j k l 2 π sin 1 r ijkl b 15 r ijkl ρ jl ρ il ρ jk ρ ik 2 2 ρ ij 2 2 ρ kl 16 b a 0 a 1 h a 2 h 2 a 3 h 3 a 4 h 4 where v s is the modified variance r ijkl are the correlations between the equivalent normal variates and b is the bias correction factor the coefficients a 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 in eq 16 are functions of the sample size n and these functions were found by the method outlined in hamed 2008 the modified expression reduces the misunderstanding of the results from type i errors when no trend exists it also helps avoid contradictions found in spatial inconsistencies such as significant but opposite trends in neighbouring stations hydrological observations usually turn out to be serially correlated when the samples are collected at consecutive time points and the dynamics of the underlying physical process occurs within the sampling time noguchi et al 2011 the mkltp test also avoids any autocorrelations that exist in the time series by applying eqs 10 16 the available r statistics package hkprocess tyralis et al 2016 was implemented for the omk mkltp tests in conjunction with the change point assessments to identify time series segments 3 application to south west western australia 3 1 site overview south west western australia swwa has experienced rapid hydro climatic changes during recent decades with the decline in streamflow into perth s dam catchments being profound elsewhere in the region major changes in the condition of a range of environmental assets have also been attributed to rainfall decline rising temperatures and potential evaporation rates the study area has a dense network of 107 rainfall gauges and 90 streamflow water quality gauges and provides a unique case study to evaluate long term hydro climatological trends fig 1 a and b it is characterised by five main hydrological zones perth basin lower south west darling range zone of rejuvenated drainage and wheatbelt whose landscapes span swwa fig 1a other areas mentioned include the blackwood plateau the leeuwin naturalist block the scott coastal plain and parts of the swan coastal plain which are part of the lower south west the characteristics of the catchments and rainfall streamflow and salinity gauged period of record is shown in table s1 the study area is 205 533 km3 made up of urban area 1 agriculture 27 5 rangeland 61 6 forest 8 6 and water 1 3 areas based on the updated köppen geiger climate classification the region has three different classifications peel et al 2007 the western most coastal area is csa temperate dry hot summer the southern coastal area is csb temperate dry warm summer and the inland eastern area is bsk arid cold steppe peel et al 2007 up to two thirds of the annual precipitation occurs in winter june september and there is a strong reduction in annual rainfall from the south west about 900 mm to the north east about 300 mm bom 2020 with a minor orographic effect associated with the darling range behind the flat coastal plain fig 1a potential evapotranspiration measured using class a pan evaporimeters falls from 1555 mm in the north east to 1260 mm in the south west inland areas have a variety of topsoils but regoliths are deeply weathered and clayey overlying predominantly granitic bedrock these areas also have ephemeral streams and saline groundwater as a result of poor flushing of cyclic salts these areas have experienced a considerable change in hydrology because shallow rooted crops have replaced deep rooted vegetation mcfarlane et al 1993 this has led to a lower level of evapotranspiration increased surface runoff and increased groundwater recharge it has also increased soil erosion stream bank degradation and the mobilization of salt into streams viney sivapalan 2001 there is limited irrigation or abstraction for water consumption and limited urbanization in contrast the surface soils of the swan coastal plain scp catchments are sandy and highly permeable with high infiltration capacity and poor nutrient retention capabilities silberstein et al 2012 rainfall directly recharges the underlying unconfined aquifer with limited surface runoff localised areas of clayey soils are associated with river floodplains that cross the plain brearley 2005 groundwater is often fresh to brackish and water abstraction from superficial unconfined and deeper confined aquifers is widespread land use in the area includes urban residential irrigated horticulture crop farming and cattle pasture valesini et al 2019 in some areas urbanization has led to an increase in surface runoff with most being infiltrating through soak wells and absorption basins into the superficial aquifer mcfarlane 1984 large areas with high groundwater have been drained and flow in those drains is comprised of both surface water during and after rainfall events and groundwater typically year round 3 2 assessment approach to assess hydro climatic changes across swwa an r package was developed to take rainfall and stream monitoring data of varying record lengths pre process the data to derive various summary metrics and provide an assessment of trends and change points the outputs were then used to compare method performance and guide the discussion of the hydro climatic and water quality drivers of change over swwa fig 2 3 2 1 data inputs we examined long term daily rainfall trends for 107 stations provided by the australian bureau of meteorology and streamflow related parameters e g runoff baseflow and hydrological drought in 90 stations with the daily data provided by the department of water and environmental regulation bom 2020 wir 2020 fig 1 a and b as an indicator of water quality we also assessed salinity calculated by continuously measured river conductivity and temperature data that was available since 1980 wir 2020 3 2 2 a priori classification of hydro climatic time series each of the three input data types were subject to different levels of pre processing before being used for trend analysis fig 2 for the rainfall time series the standardized precipitation index spi was used vicente serrano et al 2010 as an indicator of climatological drought for the streamflow data we first classified flow regimes as either perennial or ephemeral based on an analysis of zero flow days kennard et al 2010 poff 1996 figs 1 and 2 baseflow means the portion of flow that comes from ground water or other delayed sources hall 1968 kim yang 2017 baseflow was estimated from the total gauged data using the lynne hollick baseflow separation approach which is a recursive digital filter hallett et al 2018 ladson et al 2013 lyne hollick 1979 for perennial streams streamflow droughts were defined as periods when the streamflow was below a specified threshold value and drought duration and severity streamflow deficit was estimated this approach used a daily threshold value with the threshold determined by streamflow measured on the day and over 15 days before and afterward beyene et al 2014 for ephemeral streams the number of zero flow days in each year was calculated the available r package hydrostats was used for baseflow determination spei and flowscreen were used for determining climatological and streamflow droughts in streams classified as perennial and wql was used to calculate salinity from temperature and conductivity data bond 2018 begueria and vicente serrano 2017 dierauer and whitfield 2017 jassby and cloern 2017 3 2 3 trend and change points signals in this step the aim was to determine the degree of non stationarity in the various hydro climatic variables during the analysis period a trend and change point detection toolbox that is suited for the diverse climate and hydrological time series was developed in r to use the range of non parametric statistical approaches described in section 2 and applied to compute metrics for monthly and annual data fig 2 monthly rainfall runoff baseflow and salinity data were classified as contributing to either a wet season may october or a dry season november april for monthly data each season was separately evaluated using the smk trend test and the lat and cdfm single change point detection tests for annual time series including rainfall runoff baseflow zero flow days hydrological drought severity and duration the dry wet season ratio flow duration curve and salinity omk mkltp trend tests and ecp and edp multiple change points detection tests were applied fig 2 based on a computed h index there were four cases for assessing the omk mkltp tests 1 when h is not significant and the trend is significant in this case the time series does not have a long term persistence ltp effect but the trend is significant using the omk test 2 when h is significant and the trend is not significant using the mkltp test here the time series trend is an insignificant trend in but it has an ltp effect 3 when both the h and trend are significant therefore the trend is imposed im under an ltp effect and 4 when h is significant but the time series does not have a significant trend using the omk and mkltp tests it can be considered as an apparent trend s due to an ltp effect for the monthly time series the r package rkt is used and for annual time series the r package hkprocess was applied 3 2 4 drivers of changes once the results were generated for each station they were then able to be used for method comparison and to assess the hydrological drivers of change first selected sites were analysed more intensively to test the capability of the chosen methods second we compared regional trends and change points in the entire monitoring network across swwa thereafter to interpolate and map the climatic trend changes over the study area a kriging algorithm was applied using the geostatistical analyst and spatial analysis tools implemented in arcgis v 10 5 1 software oliver and webster 1990 alilou et al 2019 finally we consider the nonstationary drivers that are relevant to explain the significant downward and upward shifts in the underlying distributions of hydro climatic time series considering factors such as climate change land cover change and or water use where relevant 4 results to assess the capability of the analysis framework we first applied it to data from fourteen of the monitoring stations previously analysed by mcfarlane et al 2020 termed focus sites the fifteen are made up of seven streamflow stations and eight nearby rainfall stations we then looked at the results from the entire monitoring network to illustrate patterns in trends and change points across the swwa region 4 1 trends at individual sites 4 1 1 changes in rainfall the focus rainfall stations demonstrated trends and change points in both the seasonal rainfall patterns and how these contributed to the overall trend seen in the annual rainfall data the results from two focus sites cape leeuwin and lake carmody are presented as examples of the outputs from these analyses and other focus sites are shown in the supplementary material fig s1 s6 the cdfm on the monthly data demonstrated variability in wet and dry season rainfall across a long timescale and was used to quantify those trends the lat test identified a significant single downward shift at cape leeuwin in 1995 p 0 01 for monthly annual dry and wet season data which was consistent with the cdfm analysis fig 3 a c these results illustrate the capability of the framework to identify trend statistics on different time series including imposed trends im insignificant trends s random variability in and multiple change points where significance is defined as p 0 05 at cape leeuwin the annual trend was driven by the decrease in wet season rainfall fig 3e g in contrast at lake carmody the lat test showed a significant single upward shift in the 1960 s p 0 01 for annual data and dry and wet seasons which was also confirmed by the cdfm analysis fig 4 a c general trends omk and random variability in were determined for the annual dry and wet seasons and showed that the annual trend was driven by significant increases in summer rainfall fig 4e g trends and shifts in aggregated climatological drought indices as indicated by the 24 month scale spi 24 are like those detected by the analyses above fig 3d and 4d over the analysis period the values of spi 24 showed one major downward shift in 2001 at cape leeuwin and an upward shift around the 1960 s at lake carmody overall 75 of the rainfall focus stations had decreasing trends in the annual and monthly mean rainfall using the omk mkltp and smk tests with rates of decline ranging from 8 to 28 over 100 years table 1 three out of eight rainfall stations showed a long term persistence ltp effect suggesting long term autocorrelation that can lead to an apparent trend these were therefore further inspected by using the results from the mkltp method which gives extra information in contrast to mcfarlane et al 2020 the rates of decline or increase predicted by the omk test were usually higher than predicted by the smk test notably the monthly and annual rainfall trends significantly followed the winter rainfall trend figs 3 and 4 most of the focus rainfall stations demonstrated the first abrupt departure from the past norms indicating a change point in the annual data between the 1940 s to the 1970 s in mcfarlane et al 2020 most of the change points were located in the 1970 s our results suggest that it is more likely that there has been more than one change point in the rainfall time series with the rainfall decline starting since the 1940 s it is confirmed by the ecp test on annual rainfall that there are multiple change points between the 1940 s to the 2000 s figs 3 and 4 increasing trends were observed in two eastern rainfall stations codg codgen and lake carmody with trends ranging from 13 to 56 over 100 years although the decline in rainfall has been progressive the drought has increased in the selected sites at an accelerating rate since 2000 4 1 2 changes in streamflow characteristics and salinity the data from the seven streamflow focus sites were analyzed for the trends and change points in both the monthly runoff zero flow days baseflow and salinity patterns and how these contributed to the overall trend seen in the annual data between 1958 and 2019 selected outputs from three sites boyanup bridge jane brook national park and mungalup tower are used to show different points of interest other focus sites are shown in the supplementary material monthly runoff data for the boyanup bridge site shows that the cdfm and lat tests distinguished the same falling trends and change points in the year 2000 in the entire record and when looking specifically at the wet season fig 5 a c sen s slope in annual and wet seasonal time series 1980 2019 show slopes of 0 57 and 0 50 mm yr respectively fig 5e and g the annual trend decrease was driven by significant declines in both summer and winter runoff the flow duration curve for inter change point periods illustrates that the mid ranges flows have reduced in recent years but high flows and low flows have not changed fig 5d the observed trend statistics in baseflows in the boyanup bridge gauging station show the cdfm and lat tests detected falling trends and change points of baseflow in the monthly and wet season series in the early 2000 s significance is defined as p 0 05 fig 6 a c the annual baseflow trend decrease was driven by the decrease in winter baseflow as these are the only ones that are significant fig 6e g although an increasing but not significant trend in monthly and annual dry season baseflow is shown the drought severity streamflow deficit has been increasing since 2009 fig 6f and h a notable trend and change point are also illustrated in the zero flow days record fig 7 a the omk mkltp structure showed its capability in detecting large scale variability for zero flow days at the jane brook national park gauging station highlighting it is an ephemeral stream fig 7a and b considering these results it can be said that the zero flow days have significantly increased about 3 days yr and that has manifested since 2000 the salinity trend at mungalup tower is an example of how stream salinity has increased at some sites with an insignificant trend in the annual and dry season salinities but a significant positive trend in wet season salinity fig 8 the increasing trend started in 2008 in most of the salinity focus stations fig 8 and table 2 overall 66 of the focus stations had significant declining runoff trends with the rate ranging between 32 and 90 table 2 the baseflow rates also decreased by between 41 and 53 considering the results the baseflow sites illustrated that they were more under the long term persistence ltp effect than for the other parameters which has not been considered in previous analyses the results indicated that drought duration increased by 26 to 60 and a similar increase happened for salinity 17 to 60 4 2 regional trends 4 2 1 regional rainfall changes across the entire rainfall station data between 1920 and 2019 the rate of annual rainfall slope determined by the annual sen s slope varied from 2 6 mm yr in the western coastal margin to 0 9 mm yr in the eastern areas fig s11a the switch to a positive annual rainfall trend occurs somewhere east of kondinin and codg codgin a negative sen s slope trend in most western areas is higher with the rate of 3 8 mm yr in wet seasons and 0 35 mm yr in dry seasons fig s11b the wet season rainfall trend switch to being positive occurs at around lake carmody in contrast the positive sen s slopes for the most easterly areas have been recorded with the rate of 0 46 mm yr in wet seasons and 0 65 mm yr in dry seasons fig s11c the dry season rainfall switch to being negative occurs in the south western areas donnybrook and kendenup the mean sen s slope for the perth basin and lower south west hydrological zones recorded the steepest rainfall declines in annual and wet season time series fig 9 a b in dry seasons most of the zones recorded a positive mean sen s slope except for the most south westerly area lower south west zone fig 9c auto correlation analysis illustrated that about 40 of rainfall stations have been effected at the 0 05 significance level table s2 when it comes to seasonal analysis the smk test shows that sen s slope is often lower than estimated by the omk mkltp test table 3 declining and increasing sen s slopes were not more than 12 per decade 0 11 mm yr and 3 per decade 0 006 mm yr in the smk test respectively in contrast the omk mkltp shows 20 of changes per decade and 26 of changes per decade in the study area the mkltp test identified that 29 27 of annual time series were under the hurst index h in fact they exhibited an imposed trend random variability and scaling variability table 3 although the annual trend has always followed the wet season s trend ltp s h effect on the annual time series does not replicate what is seen in the wet season 29 versus 7 stations the ltp shows its effect on the dry rainfall with 19 stations in contrast to the other time series spatial mapping of the h index also showed that stations of the eastern area in the wet season are under scaling effect 0 55 h more than the western areas h 0 45 interestingly spi 24 shows that 100 of the stations were under scaling effects and the mkltp modified the trend analysis result accordingly only two stations were under an imposed trend table 3 overall 95 of the most westerly stations had a significant decline in wet and annual rainfall while 50 of stations had a significant positive trend in dry season rainfall in the most easterly areas fig 10 a c it can be concluded that the annual and wet seasonal rainfall has been decreasing over the entire study area over the 100 years with dry season rainfall increasing in the eastern parts given about 80 of annual rainfall is in the wet season and dry season rainfall is less effective most evaporates in the hot summers the wetting trend in the east is not a major factor affecting hydrology and agriculture the northern perth basin includes some stations in lower rainfall areas and these have contributed to this zone having an increase in summer rainfall compared with the lower south west zone which is located wholly in a high rainfall area it is especially important that the most recent years since about 2000 have shown the most rapid drying across south western australia 4 2 2 regional streamflow and salinity changes the existence of positive serial correlation in runoff time series is noted for approximately 63 of the stations at the 0 05 significance level table s2 in addition 50 of the salinity time series also exhibited positive serial correlation more than 90 of streamflow stations have a negative sen s slope indicating a strong drying trend table 4 the smk method estimated that 83 of monthly 73 of wet and 75 of dry season time series of runoff have significant negative trends the sen s slope for volumes in perennial streams calculated by the smk test varies between 0 05 49 over 50 years 5 2 51 over 50 years and 0 03 mm yr 2 over 50 years in monthly wet and dry time series respectively in contrast ephemeral streams have a lower runoff decline rate for monthly 7 over 50 years 0 002 mm yr wet 52 over 50 years 2 mm yr and dry 12 over 50 years 0 006 mm yr the rate of decline using omk mkltp is higher than the smk test in both perennial and ephemeral streams table 4 in the annual time series there is about a 50 reduction in the amount of runoff across swwa the omk mkltp was able to detect the long term persistence ltp effect especially for dry seasons in perennial streams 29 stations and ephemeral streams 9 stations the annual sen s slope patterns in baseflow follows the patterns for perennial streamflow runoff with slight differences in the rate table 5 the seasonal baseflow trends also had a low rate of sen s slope decline for monthly 2 wet 5 and dry 2 seasons however the baseflow in the study area was under the long term persistence ltp effect more than perennial streamflow runoff for 20 15 and 37 stations in annual wet and dry time series respectively the trends in hydrological drought occurrence and zero flow days for all south western stations are shown in table 6 drought severity in perennial streams has a notable increasing trend with a monthly slope of 0 88 mm yr when applying the smk test and an annual slope of 8 7 mm yr using the omk mkltp test these indicate a major deficit in streamflows throughout the study area and they are accompanied by and increase in zero flow days by 1 5 days yr in the ephemeral streams the sen s slope calculated for surface water salinity shows that it has varied between 3 and 64 mg l yr in the study area table 7 this translates into an increase of between 8 and 12 over 30 years the smk test shows that 65 of the stations had a positive trend in three different periods the same trend was detected using the omk mkltp test the advantage of using the omk mkltp lies in detecting 14 9 and 17 stations that had an ltp effect in the annual wet and dry time series respectively table 7 5 discussion 5 1 summary of findings for the statistical methods the overall aim of this study was to develop a generic testing framework to describe and quantify hydro climatic trends in an area with a mediterranean climate we have shown that the developed framework is able to detect annual and seasonal trends single and multiple change points and is applicable for data sets that have complicated inter annual and intra annual characteristics we found that the number of rainfall and streamflow stations with significant trends declined when the mkltp scaling effect was considered this finding is similar to that found by hamed 2008 however in our case significant decreasing trends were detected rather than increasing ones this is to be expected given differences in the study areas regional climate drivers and or differences in seasonality our results showed that the h ratio is more than 0 5 for wet season rainfall annual runoff baseflow and dry season stream salinity indicating these datasets have large scale variability high variance inflation we also noted the the sen s slope estimated for the smk in different time series is lower than estimated for the omk mkltp test the change point analyses show that the lat and single change point approaches are not suitable for use in the study area because the swwa has experienced multiple step changes in the hydro climatic time series however simple methods such as spi 24 and cdfm were able to detect wet and dry periods inter annual variability multiple change points and the concept of ltp in the raw time series emelyanova et al 2013 folton et al 2019 to remove apparent significant trends in segments of time series multiple change point ecp and edp detections were combined with the mkltp this hybrid method was able to identify significant trend and distributional changes between segments and to show how the data were changing step by step matteson and james 2014 james et al 2019 the ecp method more accurately identified the number and exact location of change points compared with the edp method and therefore our results confirm that the agglomerative approach is preferable to the divisive approach matteson and james 2014 for this purpose it also removed change point masking trends to identify the true direction of trends sharma et al 2016 however when applying ecp and edp within r users should take care about the arguments of member and alpha it is recommended that a sensitivity test using different alpha values e g 1 or 2 before undertaking an application in this study we used a for loop to find the best initial membership vector for the time series please refer to the supplementary section for a sensitivity analysis associated with the ecp and edp methods classifying perennial and ephemeral streams prior to trend analyses was also important to show that the baseflow trend was not observed in ephemeral streams the method used by beyene et al 2014 proved to be a robust method to detect hydrological droughts via water deficiencies and their increased duration in the perennial river system 5 2 hydro climatic and water quality drivers of change over swwa nonstationary drivers refers to longer term processes which may cause significant shifts in the underlying distributions of hydro climatic extremes via climate or land cover change slater et al 2021 to investigate nonstationary drivers of hydro climatic and water quality change across swwa we separately explored how climate and land use changes affected the trends of different time series 5 2 1 rainfall drivers wet season rainfall has significantly fallen in 95 of the western sites and the dry season rainfall has increased in 50 of the eastern sites wet season rainfall supports non irrigated agricultural crops and pastures to grow and it is currently at its lowest since the 1940 s with the decline mostly occurring since the 1970 s however dry season rainfall has been the highest it has been in 100 years the proportion of annual rain falling in the wettest six months has shown a substantial decline in all stations except at lake carmody when looking at the focus sites the greatest declines have been measured at the cape leeuwin and kendenup stations in the southwest annual and wet season time seies show progressive drying from north to south and from east to west fig 10a and b in contrast the dry season time series show progressive wetting from south west to north east in the dry period time series fig 10c the single change point lat indicated abrupt shifts have happened since the 1940 s and 1950 s the trend is clear despite an increase in large scale variability in 30 of the stations all climatological drought spi 24 time series shows long term persistence and the indication of droughts has increased in the western area since 2000 although the specific cause of the observed decline in rainfall has not been confirmed smith power 2014 change in the large scale circulation pattern such as a decrease in the general baroclinicity and increases in the mean sea level pressure have been associated with the rainfall decline smith 2004 hope et al 2006 a poleward shift in the weather systems in most mediterranean areas has been noted although rainfall increases were detected in the wheatbelt zone and avon catchment between 1920 and 2019 annual wet season and especially dry season fig 10 the rainfall increase is likely lost to soil evaporation use by annual crops and pastures the detected decline in rainfall along the coastal areas is expected to continue air average temperatures are predicted to increase by 1 2 to 4 c by 2090 under optimistic and pessimistic climate change scenarios respectively hope et al 2015 some climate models predict that heatwave compounded drought events will become common by 2050 in some regions sedlmeier et al 2018 matusick et al 2018 5 2 2 streamflow related drivers monthly annual dry and wet season runoff showed a general and significant downward trend in 90 of the stream gauging stations especially affecting the wetter months overall results are aligned with those observed in the darling range by petrone et al 2010 who proposed the decline in runoff was related to the winter rainfall decline from 1975 and again after 2000 our study detected more negative shifts between 1994 and 2000 using the single and multiple change point detection tests the inflows occurring in the dry seasons were under long term persistence more than annual and wet seasons time series mcfarlane et al 2020 also showed the maximum daily flows and historical floods are increasing in the dry seasons in contrast to the declining trend in the wet seasons aquifers receiving direct rainfall recharge have a similar cdfm trend between groundwater levels and rainfall yesertener 2005 emelyanova et al 2013 baseflow decreased more than annual runoff in the study area which suggests that watertables have fallen below the valley inverts and saturation excess runoff has decreased d mcfarlane et al 2020 hughes et al 2012 also showed that groundwater storage has declined in recent drought years with rates of decline ranging from 0 05 to 0 48 m yr in the western catchments before the 1980 s there were no years with zero daily flows over a seven day period however since 2000 there have been eight years with no flow over seven day periods smettem et al 2013 this could be due to more hydrological drought occurring in perennial streams or more zero flow days occurring in ephemeral streams our results demonstrated that the zero flow days in ephemeral streams are increasing by about two days per year a close relationship between meteorological and hydrological drought severity is well accepted however hydrological drought typically lags behind meteorological drought because meteorological drought can develop quickly wu et al 2017 the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought is related to the seasonal characteristics summer rain may be ineffective huang et al 2017 whilst the rainfall is increasing in dry seasons the hydrological drought in the dry period shows increasing frequency and duration in perennial streams of the study region this may be because the watertable is lower after the reduction in winter rainfall making the wetted area around streams lower when summer rain occurs the hydrological drought severity is a sign of streamflow deficit in the rivers of swwa it has generally increased by 8 7 mm yr and more severe years were recorded after 2000 similar results have been reported by ali et al 2012 and hughes et al 2012 with more severe rainfall drought since 1975 although our results indicate a severe change point in 2000 stream ecosystems will have experienced a dramatic decline in the amount and duration of surface water needed to maintain their life cycle functions possible causes for the declining streamflows have been suggested increased temperatures drive higher rates of evaporation cai et al 2009 nicholls 2010 along with a decline in average rainfall frequency of daily rainfall and in wet day amounts bates et al 2010 petrone et al 2010 suggest that the increase in actual et results in falling groundwater levels and a deficit in soil moisture storage may be driving runoff decline in the study area as severe climatological droughts have both short and long term effects on the hydrological cycle van loon 2015 we suggest that the severe droughts that have happened since 1970 especially since 2000 are the main reason for the marked decline in runoff a close relationship has been found between forest cover and streamflow harper et al 2019 where streamflow increases with a reduction of forest cover through deforestation thinning and the spread of diseases such as jarrah dieback and decreases with reforestation and reduced rainfall in response to a predicted 8 reduction in rainfall by 2030 surface runoff reduction is expected to reduce by a further 20 groundwater discharge to streams is also projected to be decline by about 35 under a dry future climate ali et al 2012 the past trends of land use and climate change are predicted to continue with 15 global climate models gcms predicting that western australia wa in particular perth will be one of the most vulnerable areas experiencing a decline in surface water runoff about 24 and groundwater recharge about 2 silberstein et al 2012 ali et al 2012 in addition it is estimated that the population of perth will increase from 1 1 to 3 1 million by 2050 islam et al 2014 hence wa will face further pressure on existing surface water resources as well as unconfined aquifers in comparison with expected demands mcfarlane et al 2012 5 2 3 salinity drivers many inland catchments have saline runoff because deep rooted native vegetation have been replaced by shallow rooted crops and pastures which has increased recharge raising groundwater levels and mobilising salt stored in deep soil profiles into ephemeral streams callow and smettem 2007 mcfarlane et al 2016 this analysis has shown increasing stream salinity especially during wet seasons in the inland wheatbelt region about one million hectares of previously productive land had become salt affected by 2000 mcfarlane et al 2004 and stream salinity increased harper et al 2019 hatton and ruprecht 2002 suggested that increased areas of salt affected land may increase flood peaks because catchments would be saturated prior to rainfall flooding however observations indicate that floods have decreased and summer peak flows may now be higher than those in winter mcfarlane et al 2020 it is therefore unlikely that the salinity will increase across swwa under climate change scenarios however we note that in both the avon and peel harvey streams salinity loads are decreasing while the swan canning streams and other areas in south swwa are experiencing an increasing trend in both concentrations and tonnes 5 3 future work these findings highlight that while changes in climate and hydrology across swwa are complex our analytical framework has been able to increase our understanding of how the system has responded to climate change there are however unresolved issues that our study has identified the change point timing is complicated and occurs at different times in rainfall and streamflows in both the drier eastern and wetter western areas depending on what method is used single or multiple detection methods change points may be identified as occurring at different times our analytical framework can help exploration of this complexity it remains unclear how catchment processes influence trends and new methods are needed to understand non stationarity in the runoff coefficient more specialist methods are needed to be able to investigate how spatial and temporal changes propagate through catchments stream gauging is often located at the lower end of systems but the runoff coefficient will likely also change across catchments and throughout time in response to gradient rainfall changes long term drying trends also affect the amount and type of perennial vegetation on catchments which adds further complexity as they adapt it remains challenging to understand what catchments are doing and new methodologies to account for the propagation of these changes within river networks are needed 6 conclusions swwa has experienced a significant decrease in rainfall since the 1970 s and increased temperatures and potential evaporation over a longer period the study region is expected to experience even drier wet seasons and wetter dry seasons at least in the east into the future this research has attempted to address key gaps in scientific knowledge relating to the effect of climate change on runoff and stream water quality over time and geographic regions an analysis framework has been developed in r and applied to a network of 107 rainfall gauges 100 years of data and 90 streamflow water quality gauges 50 30 years of data across swwa trends were calculated by the original mann kendall omk family of tests including using the mann kendall test under the scaling hypothesis mkltp and seasonal mann kendall smk single and multiple change points were estimated by the non parametric lanzante s test lat and e agglomerative algorithm ecp energy divisive edp and cumulative departure from the mean cdfm analysis oftheoutcomesshowedthat annual rainfall has decreased by 2 6 mm yr in western areas and increased by 0 9 mm yr in eastern areas almost 65 of western rainfall weather stations have measured a significant decline in the wet season and annual rainfall in contrast to 50 of stations having a significant increase in dry seasons in the eastern areas the impact of hurst phenomenon imposed a trend of 30 in the annual rainfall stations also of note is that all of the standardized precipitation index spi time series were under long term persistence ltp and the drought has further increased in the western area since 2000 these climatic trends indicate a high risk of freshwater scarcity for swwa the regional streamflow trend analysis shows catchments are yielding much less runoff in more than 90 of gauged stations the runoffs of perennial and ephemeral streams have declined by 6 54 and 2 50 mm yr respectively hydrological drought trend and zero flow days have increased since 2000 which corresponds to the negative shift for runoffs between 1994 and 2000 it is important to note that the baseflows rates of decline were higher than that detected for runoff indicating that groundwater levels have fallen substantially an overall significant increasing trend has been recorded for stream salinity in swwa at 64 15 mg l yr however salt loads t yr have decreased because runoff volumes have declined by an even greater amount it can be concluded there is a strong relationship between the impact of climate change on runoff and stream water quality that will continue as the climate continues to become warmer and drier as is projected to occur in most areas with a mediterranean climate the results of this study can be used to inform water resource suppliers and managers natural resource managers landholders and government policymakers to facilitate the adaptation to anticipated climate change a knowledge of processes is required to be able to use future climate projections to anticipate break points that are indicative of major disruptions in the hydrological processes in

2824,many regions of the world have experienced rapid hydro climatic changes in recent decades mediterranean areas have especially experienced prolonged droughts changes to runoff and low flow periods many methods and assumptions for assessing trends in rainfall and runoff are available however a comprehensive framework is required that can consider variations at large temporal and spatial scales long term persistence ltp seasonal patterns and multiple change points an analysis framework has been developed in r and applied to a network of 107 rainfall gauges with about 100 yrs data and 90 streamflow water quality gauges 30 50 yrs data across south west western australia a region with a typical mediterranean climate trends were estimated using the original mann kendall omk family of tests including using the mann kendall test under the scaling hypothesis mkltp and seasonal mann kendall smk single and multiple change points were calculated by the non parametric lanzante s test lat e agglomerative algorithm ecp and energy divisive edp trend tests show annual rainfall has decreased by 2 6 mm yr in the western areas and increased by 0 9 mm yr in the eastern areas with corresponding change points in the 1940 s 1960 s and from 1995 to 2000 although 30 of the annual rainfall and 100 of the standardized precipitation index spi time series were found to be under ltp a regional flow trend analysis shows catchments are yielding much less runoff in more than 90 of gauged stations the runoff in perennial and ephemeral streams has shown a decline with the rate of 6 54 and 2 50 mm yr respectively runoff and baseflow decline occurred as step changes lagged after rainfall and the rate of decline in baseflow was more than for runoff suggesting that groundwater connectivity with stream inverts has fallen substantially stream salinities increased by 64 mg l yr or 15 overall which was highly significant the framework provides a structured approach to analyse changes in rainfall runoff and stream salinity for a mediterranean climate that is projected to become even warmer and drier keywords climate change dryland salinity hydro climatic drought australia water resources data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction time series analysis of hydro climatic data e g rainfall streamflow is widely used to detect temporal patterns associated with seasonality irregularity trends shifts or other forms of periodicity cyclicity salas obeysekera 2014 such analyses help water resource managers by identifying features such as lag responses of runoff to rainfall li et al 2008 fang et al 2012 altered runoff due to land use changes mohammady et al 2018 interactions between groundwater levels and rainfall runoff ruprecht and schofield 1989 kinal and stoneman 2011 kinal and stoneman 2012 hughes et al 2012 emelyanova et al 2013 mcfarlane et al 2020 grigg and kinal 2020 impacts of changing flows on salinity chen et al 2000 gong and shen 2011 and the impacts of catchment management on nutrient export basu et al 2010 scharler baird 2003 time series analysis is also increasingly of interest to identify the nature of abrupt changes in hydrologic variables for example reduced sediment discharge to downstream waters caused by dam construction shi et al 2019 or water quality improvement following removal or treatment of point source discharges williams 2001 accordingly hydro climatic and water quality temporal data are rarely stationary and display changing statistical properties e g mean variance and autocorrelation over time milly et al 2015 totaro et al 2019 slater et al 2021 non parametric statistical approaches have become increasingly relied upon to quantify the nature of hydro climatic and water quality trends hirsch et al 1982 araghi et al 2015 as they are distribution free and provide a more nuanced perspective of trends over time kocsis et al 2017 trend analysis aims to detect the gradual deviation from past norms the original mann kendall omk test is a well known approach hamed 2008 and several modified methods have been developed the omk assumes that the data are independent and there is no serial correlation structure among the observations however hydro climatic observations i e rainfall and streamflow have strong auto correlation due to seasonality hirsch slack 1984 the seasonal mann kendall smk test was therefore introduced by hirsch et al 1982 to solve assessments across seasonal boundaries allowing comparison of hydro climatic time series from the same season over different years kazemzadeh and malekian 2016 mullick et al 2019 liu and mao 2020 gomes and wai 2020 the modified mann kendall mmk has also been applied to auto correlated data to eliminate its effect within seasons hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 nikzad tehrani et al 2019 mirdashtvan et al 2020 for example to find the impact of covariates in hydro climate variables on chemical oxygen demand libiseller and grimvall 2002 showed that the partial mann kendall pmk test proved more successful than the omk test further when working with hydro climatic variables it can be challenging to separate long term persistence ltp behaviour that results from slow interactions in the land atmosphere ocean system from deterministic trends in the catchment brought about by changes such as clearing of perennial vegetation increasing urbanization and increasing water consumption helsel et al 2020 here persistence is defined as the continuance of an effect after the cause is removed noting that climate variations at large temporal and spatial scales can change the central tendency of hydro climatic variables this effect has been quantified using a scaling coefficient now termed the hurst coefficient h after hurst 1951 hamed 2008 further improved the omk test by modifying the variance of the test statistic of the mann kendall test under a scaling hypothesis this modification has been applied to eliminate inflation in a given variance leading to an apparent trend and is termed the mann kendall long term persistence mkltp method hu et al 2020 despitethewidespreadapplication of the mk family of tests and change point detection methods across a diversity of contexts there remains uncertainty as to how where and which method to apply to specific data an ongoing challenge in applying these methods is their failure to separate seasonal patterns which can lead to misinterpretation of the impacts on catchment hydrology helsel et al 2020 another weakness arises when applying the scaling effect on hydro climatic parameters causing a variance inflation at a time scale greater than annual koutsoyiannis 2003 hamed 2008 hydro climatic processes are affected by climate processes such as el niño cycles and long term climate change as well as human activities such as land use changes ishak rahman 2019 detecting whether time series have abrupt changes or not identifying the change timing and identifying any trends between two or more abrupt changes can provide critical information to support adaptive management numerous studies have demonstrated the use of the most often used single change point detection methods e g lanzante s test lat pettitt s test buishand s test mann kendall rank standard normal homogeneity test snt to detect an abrupt change in hydro climatic time series shifteh some e et al 2012 malekian and kazemzadeh 2016 espinoza et al 2019 mahmood and jia 2019 chen et al 2019 ishak and rahman 2019 güçlü 2020 in contrast therearea number ofmethodsthat can identify multiple change points either using simple methods such as computing the cumulative deviation from the mean cdfm emelyanova et al 2013 or more sophisticated approaches such as the e agglomerative ecp and e divisive edp change detection algorithms matteson and james 2014 james et al 2019 there is also a need to determine trends before and after change points jehanzaib et al 2020 such analyses can show the magnitude of the effect of climate change or human activities as well as remove their persistent effects scaling after an identified change point whilst these assessment techniqueshave been used throughout the world south west western australia swwa serves as an interesting case study because it illustrates the rapid pace of hydro climatic change in a mediterranean climate zone the swwa has experienced a 15 20 reduction in average rainfall which started as an extended period of drought in the mid 1970 s petrone et al 2010 and which has become more severe since 1997 ali et al 2012 since the mid 1970 s surface runoff into the perth water supply network has declined by 50 silberstein et al 2012 a new hydrologic response regime has been triggered with a decrease in the runoff coefficient runoff rainfall and this has also manifested as a shift from perennial to ephemeral streams in some catchments smettem et al 2013 previous analyses of hydro climatic data from swwa have used the omk test to detect significant declining trends in rainfall and runoff in the majority of catchments petrone et al 2010 chowdhury and beecham 2010 similar results were found in 29 stations across swwa as streamflows declined in response to the below average rainfall durrant byleveld 2009 recently mcfarlane et al 2020 reported runoff and groundwater responses to climate change across swwa and reported a decline in rainfall runoff major flooding in winter groundwater levels runoff into dams and a decrease in the rate of salinisation over parts of the region while decreased runoff was the most easily observed change after the reduction in rainfall in all cases it was proceeded by less obvious falls in groundwater levels extending the analysis using the statistical methods outlined above on a wide range of datasets will provide opportunities to detect change points and trends between change points as hydro climatic processes respond to rising temperatures and potential evaporation as well as decreasing rainfall the main objective of this study was to develop a framework that allows an assessment of trends and change points to identify those that can be best applied to rainfall streamflow and streamwater quality data the framework was designed to detect annual and seasonal trends single and multiple change points and to be applied to data with complex inter and intra annual characteristics specifically this work aimed to develop an integrated framework to 1 detect significant or general negative and positive trends in climate and stream variables within the orginal mann kendall omk family and test the trend detection using data from swwa as a test case 2 separate long term persistence ltp behaviour and auto correlation due to interactions in the land atmosphere ocean system and seasonality and 3 identify abrupt single and multiple changes and trends between change points this framework is used to compare the results with monitoring stations previously analysed by mcfarlane et al 2020 and discern systematic and regional changes in trends and change points in the entire monitoring network across swwa 2 overview of statistical methods in general regression analysis was used to build methods for trend analysis including non parametric alternatives to ordinary least squares for data with a monotonic upward or downward non linear trend the non linear original mann kendall omk family of tests can be used a number of studies have concluded that this family of tests is the most effective tool for hydro climate variable analysis wang et al 2019 hirsch et al 1982 hirsch 2012 ator et al 2019 cloern 2019 step trend also known as change point tests are able to either compare two different periods separated by a long gap or to detect an abrupt shift slater et al 2021 in the realm of statistics in general there are many change point detection methods at least more than 20 nonparametric methods csörgő horváth 1988 also recent studies show that change point detection is a highly popular area of research in hydro climatic time series villarini et al 2012 rougé et al 2013 sagarika et al 2014 harrigan et al 2014 rahmani et al 2015 conte et al 2019 ryberg et al 2020 helsel et al 2020 there are several change point tests applied in this study including single and multiple tests such as the lat cdfm ecp and edp lanzante 1996 weber and stewart 2004 matteson and james 2014 james et al 2019 these tests are divided into two sections single and multiple change point detection among different single change point detections e g lanzante s test lat pettitt s test buishand s test mann kendall rank standard normal homogeneity test snt we decided to use the lanzante s test lat because in evaluation tests it was found that different methods gave very similar or identical results several single change point tests detected the exact location of change points with regard to multiple change points sharma et al 2016 examined four different change point detection tests which by virtue of current literature appear to be the most widely used and the newest algorithms they were bayesian analysis of change points erdman emerson 2008 e agglomerative algorithm for change points ecp and edp matteson james 2014 iterative robust detection method gérard marchant et al 2008 and wild binary segmentation fryzlewicz 2014 the energy agglomerative ecp and energy divisive edp algorithms have been applied in the present study as our initial tests accurately identified the correct locations and numbers of change points although they were not the most efficient and took more computational time for identification 2 1 models for trend analysis 2 1 1 original mann kendall test omk the omk test is a non parametric test for randomness against time which applies the kendall t test mann 1945 kendall 1948 letting x 1 x 2 x n be a sequence of measurements over time mann proposed to test the null hypothesis h0 that the data comes from a population where the random variables are independent and identically distributed the alternative hypothesis h1 is that the data follow a monotonic trend over time longobardi villani 2010 under h0 the mann kendall test statistic is 1 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s i g n x j x i where n is the length of the time series and 2 sign x j x i 1 x j x i 0 x j x i 1 x j x i when n 10 under the hypothesis of independent and randomly distributed variables the s statistic is approximately normally distributed with zero mean and variance as follows 3 σ s n 18 n 1 2 n 5 therefore the standardized z statistic zs follows a normal standardized distribution 4 z s s 1 σ s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 σ s i f s 0 and can be used to determine if a trend is significant or not in a two sided trend test the h0 the null hypothesis must be accepted if z z α 2 at α level of significance a downward trend is indicated by a negative value of s and an upward trend is shown by a positive value of s wang et al 2019 2 1 2 sen s slope estimator the sen s slope is applied to find the true slope of a linear trend in a time series sen 1968 the slope that calculates n pairs of data are estimated by 5 β i median y j y i x j x j for i 1 n where yj and yi are data values at time xi and xj n j i 1 respectively the sen s estimator of the slope can be defined as the median of n values of β a dataset of n x y pairs will result in n n 1 2 pairwise comparisons helsel et al 2020 the true slope can be computed by a non parametric test and β is checked by a two sided test at the 100 1 α confidence interval malekian kazemzadeh 2016 2 1 3 seasonal mann kendall test smk in nature most hydro climatic variables are related to seasonal patterns which are not detected by the omk test because the trend signal cannot be differentiated from seasonal effects as well as noise hirsch et al 1982 introduced the smk test to compute the test on each of m seasons separately and then combined the outcomes to perform the test kendall s s statistics denoted si are computed for each season and these are then summed to form the overall statistic sk 6 s k i 1 m s i the distribution of sk can be approximated by a normal distribution when the product of the number of seasons and number of years is more than about 25 based on 7 σ s k 2 i 1 m σ s i 2 i 1 m n i n i 1 2 n i 5 18 where ni is the number of years of data in the season i the z statistic is calculated as 8 z s k s k 1 σ s k i f s k 0 0 i f s k 0 s k 1 σ s k i f s k 0 in a two sided trend test the h0 the null hypothesis must be accepted if z z α 2 at the α level of significance in this study the r package rkt marchetto 2017 was used to undertake the smk tests on the data 2 1 4 adjustment for serial correlation based on the null hypothesis of the omk test the dataset is independent and randomly ordered malekian kazemzadeh 2016 it means that there is no serial correlation and trend among the observations the dataset used in present study might show serial correlation the positive serial correlation increases the possibility of rejecting the null hypothesis of no trend while the null hypothesis is true the correction for correlation among blocks have made by hirsch and slack 1984 and the partial test was proposed by libiseller and grimvall 2002 the rkt package have the ability to remove auto correlation between the data correction for inter block marchetto 2017 and 21 2 2 models for change point detection 2 2 1 single change point trend analysis is an estimation of the general direction in which something is developing or changing whereas change point detection identifies abrupt behaviour changes that may indicate a changing data structure or distribution sharma et al 2016 the process of identifying distributional changes within time ordered observations is called change point analysis matteson james 2014 the non parametric lanzante s test lat can be used to identify a single shift in the central tendency in a time series lanzante 1996 the lat is not affected by the presence of outliers and other forms of non normality the null hypothesis no shift is tested against the alternative shift a shift can be detected by the wilcoxon mann whitney two sample test the available r package trend pohlert 2018 was used in this study to identify single change points via the lat the cumulative deviation from the mean cdfm is also commonly used for identifying anomalously wet and dry periods weber and stewart 2004 emelyanova et al 2013 and has been applied to identify inter and intra annual wet and dry periods in monthly and seasonal time series of hydro climatic data the purpose of this test is to detect the existence of a change in the mean after m observations chiew mcmahon 1993 the cdfm also helped to detect the hurst index known as the scaling hypothesis hurst 1951 2 2 2 multiple change points the ecp and edp change point detection tests may be used to detect multiple change points in the hydro climatic and water quality data the ecp is an agglomerative hierarchical estimation algorithm and a computationally efficient method for detecting multiple change points and their locations via the goodness of fit of clusters within the data matteson and james 2014 james et al 2019 sudden changes can be detected using an agglomeration approach the edp test is based on divisive hierarchical clustering by measuring differences in multivariate hierarchical multiple change points with significance testing to find significant multiple change points matteson and james 2014 the available r package ecp james et al 2019 has been applied used herein to calculate the number of change points 2 3 trend analysis between change points and overall time series using the mann kendall test under the scaling hypothesis mkltp the mkltp is a modification of the omk family of tests that considers the scaling effect hypothesis long term persistence within raw data hamed 2008 the hypothesis of scaling considers invariance at any scale greater than annual koutsoyiannis 2003 the scaling effect assessed via the hurst index h varies between zero and one and for hydrological data typically ranges between 0 5 and 0 9 hurst 1951 a value greater than 0 5 results from an increase in the variance termed variance inflation to calculate h the trend was first removed from the raw time series using sens s slope estimator eq 5 sen 1968 the maximum likelihood ml method introduced by mcleod and hipel 1978 was then applied to calculate h for the equivalent normal variates the equivalent normal variates zt are computed from 9 z t φ 1 r t n 1 where n is the number of observations rt is the rank of detrended observation xt using eq 5 and φ 1 is the inverse standard normal distribution function then the log likelihood function of n normal observations with a scaling coefficient h was maximized using 10 logl h 0 5 log c n h z t c n h 1 z 2 γ 0 n 2 log γ 0 11 c n h ρ j i i 1 2 n 12 ρ l 0 5 l 1 2 h 2 l 2 h l 1 2 h where the variance of z t is defined as γ 0 cn h is the correlation matrix of h estimated using eq 11 12 and ρ l is the autocorrelation coefficients of scale lag l when h is 0 5 h calculated by eq 10 is approximately normally distributed for the uncorrelated case the significance of the mean μh and standard deviation σh of the estimated h given by hamed 2008 as 13 μ h 0 5 2 874 n 0 9067 σ h 0 7765 n 0 5 0 0062 can be analyzed and are functions of the sample size n if h was significant the trend test was conducted under the scaling hypothesis because of the incorrect variance variance inflation arises because the variance of the trend test statistic will be larger than what it would be under the standard assumptions that the random variable is independent and identically distributed helsel et al 2020 hamed 2008 modified the expression for variance such that if the series under question shows scaling effects the modified version would be applied 14 v s i j k l 2 π sin 1 r ijkl b 15 r ijkl ρ jl ρ il ρ jk ρ ik 2 2 ρ ij 2 2 ρ kl 16 b a 0 a 1 h a 2 h 2 a 3 h 3 a 4 h 4 where v s is the modified variance r ijkl are the correlations between the equivalent normal variates and b is the bias correction factor the coefficients a 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 in eq 16 are functions of the sample size n and these functions were found by the method outlined in hamed 2008 the modified expression reduces the misunderstanding of the results from type i errors when no trend exists it also helps avoid contradictions found in spatial inconsistencies such as significant but opposite trends in neighbouring stations hydrological observations usually turn out to be serially correlated when the samples are collected at consecutive time points and the dynamics of the underlying physical process occurs within the sampling time noguchi et al 2011 the mkltp test also avoids any autocorrelations that exist in the time series by applying eqs 10 16 the available r statistics package hkprocess tyralis et al 2016 was implemented for the omk mkltp tests in conjunction with the change point assessments to identify time series segments 3 application to south west western australia 3 1 site overview south west western australia swwa has experienced rapid hydro climatic changes during recent decades with the decline in streamflow into perth s dam catchments being profound elsewhere in the region major changes in the condition of a range of environmental assets have also been attributed to rainfall decline rising temperatures and potential evaporation rates the study area has a dense network of 107 rainfall gauges and 90 streamflow water quality gauges and provides a unique case study to evaluate long term hydro climatological trends fig 1 a and b it is characterised by five main hydrological zones perth basin lower south west darling range zone of rejuvenated drainage and wheatbelt whose landscapes span swwa fig 1a other areas mentioned include the blackwood plateau the leeuwin naturalist block the scott coastal plain and parts of the swan coastal plain which are part of the lower south west the characteristics of the catchments and rainfall streamflow and salinity gauged period of record is shown in table s1 the study area is 205 533 km3 made up of urban area 1 agriculture 27 5 rangeland 61 6 forest 8 6 and water 1 3 areas based on the updated köppen geiger climate classification the region has three different classifications peel et al 2007 the western most coastal area is csa temperate dry hot summer the southern coastal area is csb temperate dry warm summer and the inland eastern area is bsk arid cold steppe peel et al 2007 up to two thirds of the annual precipitation occurs in winter june september and there is a strong reduction in annual rainfall from the south west about 900 mm to the north east about 300 mm bom 2020 with a minor orographic effect associated with the darling range behind the flat coastal plain fig 1a potential evapotranspiration measured using class a pan evaporimeters falls from 1555 mm in the north east to 1260 mm in the south west inland areas have a variety of topsoils but regoliths are deeply weathered and clayey overlying predominantly granitic bedrock these areas also have ephemeral streams and saline groundwater as a result of poor flushing of cyclic salts these areas have experienced a considerable change in hydrology because shallow rooted crops have replaced deep rooted vegetation mcfarlane et al 1993 this has led to a lower level of evapotranspiration increased surface runoff and increased groundwater recharge it has also increased soil erosion stream bank degradation and the mobilization of salt into streams viney sivapalan 2001 there is limited irrigation or abstraction for water consumption and limited urbanization in contrast the surface soils of the swan coastal plain scp catchments are sandy and highly permeable with high infiltration capacity and poor nutrient retention capabilities silberstein et al 2012 rainfall directly recharges the underlying unconfined aquifer with limited surface runoff localised areas of clayey soils are associated with river floodplains that cross the plain brearley 2005 groundwater is often fresh to brackish and water abstraction from superficial unconfined and deeper confined aquifers is widespread land use in the area includes urban residential irrigated horticulture crop farming and cattle pasture valesini et al 2019 in some areas urbanization has led to an increase in surface runoff with most being infiltrating through soak wells and absorption basins into the superficial aquifer mcfarlane 1984 large areas with high groundwater have been drained and flow in those drains is comprised of both surface water during and after rainfall events and groundwater typically year round 3 2 assessment approach to assess hydro climatic changes across swwa an r package was developed to take rainfall and stream monitoring data of varying record lengths pre process the data to derive various summary metrics and provide an assessment of trends and change points the outputs were then used to compare method performance and guide the discussion of the hydro climatic and water quality drivers of change over swwa fig 2 3 2 1 data inputs we examined long term daily rainfall trends for 107 stations provided by the australian bureau of meteorology and streamflow related parameters e g runoff baseflow and hydrological drought in 90 stations with the daily data provided by the department of water and environmental regulation bom 2020 wir 2020 fig 1 a and b as an indicator of water quality we also assessed salinity calculated by continuously measured river conductivity and temperature data that was available since 1980 wir 2020 3 2 2 a priori classification of hydro climatic time series each of the three input data types were subject to different levels of pre processing before being used for trend analysis fig 2 for the rainfall time series the standardized precipitation index spi was used vicente serrano et al 2010 as an indicator of climatological drought for the streamflow data we first classified flow regimes as either perennial or ephemeral based on an analysis of zero flow days kennard et al 2010 poff 1996 figs 1 and 2 baseflow means the portion of flow that comes from ground water or other delayed sources hall 1968 kim yang 2017 baseflow was estimated from the total gauged data using the lynne hollick baseflow separation approach which is a recursive digital filter hallett et al 2018 ladson et al 2013 lyne hollick 1979 for perennial streams streamflow droughts were defined as periods when the streamflow was below a specified threshold value and drought duration and severity streamflow deficit was estimated this approach used a daily threshold value with the threshold determined by streamflow measured on the day and over 15 days before and afterward beyene et al 2014 for ephemeral streams the number of zero flow days in each year was calculated the available r package hydrostats was used for baseflow determination spei and flowscreen were used for determining climatological and streamflow droughts in streams classified as perennial and wql was used to calculate salinity from temperature and conductivity data bond 2018 begueria and vicente serrano 2017 dierauer and whitfield 2017 jassby and cloern 2017 3 2 3 trend and change points signals in this step the aim was to determine the degree of non stationarity in the various hydro climatic variables during the analysis period a trend and change point detection toolbox that is suited for the diverse climate and hydrological time series was developed in r to use the range of non parametric statistical approaches described in section 2 and applied to compute metrics for monthly and annual data fig 2 monthly rainfall runoff baseflow and salinity data were classified as contributing to either a wet season may october or a dry season november april for monthly data each season was separately evaluated using the smk trend test and the lat and cdfm single change point detection tests for annual time series including rainfall runoff baseflow zero flow days hydrological drought severity and duration the dry wet season ratio flow duration curve and salinity omk mkltp trend tests and ecp and edp multiple change points detection tests were applied fig 2 based on a computed h index there were four cases for assessing the omk mkltp tests 1 when h is not significant and the trend is significant in this case the time series does not have a long term persistence ltp effect but the trend is significant using the omk test 2 when h is significant and the trend is not significant using the mkltp test here the time series trend is an insignificant trend in but it has an ltp effect 3 when both the h and trend are significant therefore the trend is imposed im under an ltp effect and 4 when h is significant but the time series does not have a significant trend using the omk and mkltp tests it can be considered as an apparent trend s due to an ltp effect for the monthly time series the r package rkt is used and for annual time series the r package hkprocess was applied 3 2 4 drivers of changes once the results were generated for each station they were then able to be used for method comparison and to assess the hydrological drivers of change first selected sites were analysed more intensively to test the capability of the chosen methods second we compared regional trends and change points in the entire monitoring network across swwa thereafter to interpolate and map the climatic trend changes over the study area a kriging algorithm was applied using the geostatistical analyst and spatial analysis tools implemented in arcgis v 10 5 1 software oliver and webster 1990 alilou et al 2019 finally we consider the nonstationary drivers that are relevant to explain the significant downward and upward shifts in the underlying distributions of hydro climatic time series considering factors such as climate change land cover change and or water use where relevant 4 results to assess the capability of the analysis framework we first applied it to data from fourteen of the monitoring stations previously analysed by mcfarlane et al 2020 termed focus sites the fifteen are made up of seven streamflow stations and eight nearby rainfall stations we then looked at the results from the entire monitoring network to illustrate patterns in trends and change points across the swwa region 4 1 trends at individual sites 4 1 1 changes in rainfall the focus rainfall stations demonstrated trends and change points in both the seasonal rainfall patterns and how these contributed to the overall trend seen in the annual rainfall data the results from two focus sites cape leeuwin and lake carmody are presented as examples of the outputs from these analyses and other focus sites are shown in the supplementary material fig s1 s6 the cdfm on the monthly data demonstrated variability in wet and dry season rainfall across a long timescale and was used to quantify those trends the lat test identified a significant single downward shift at cape leeuwin in 1995 p 0 01 for monthly annual dry and wet season data which was consistent with the cdfm analysis fig 3 a c these results illustrate the capability of the framework to identify trend statistics on different time series including imposed trends im insignificant trends s random variability in and multiple change points where significance is defined as p 0 05 at cape leeuwin the annual trend was driven by the decrease in wet season rainfall fig 3e g in contrast at lake carmody the lat test showed a significant single upward shift in the 1960 s p 0 01 for annual data and dry and wet seasons which was also confirmed by the cdfm analysis fig 4 a c general trends omk and random variability in were determined for the annual dry and wet seasons and showed that the annual trend was driven by significant increases in summer rainfall fig 4e g trends and shifts in aggregated climatological drought indices as indicated by the 24 month scale spi 24 are like those detected by the analyses above fig 3d and 4d over the analysis period the values of spi 24 showed one major downward shift in 2001 at cape leeuwin and an upward shift around the 1960 s at lake carmody overall 75 of the rainfall focus stations had decreasing trends in the annual and monthly mean rainfall using the omk mkltp and smk tests with rates of decline ranging from 8 to 28 over 100 years table 1 three out of eight rainfall stations showed a long term persistence ltp effect suggesting long term autocorrelation that can lead to an apparent trend these were therefore further inspected by using the results from the mkltp method which gives extra information in contrast to mcfarlane et al 2020 the rates of decline or increase predicted by the omk test were usually higher than predicted by the smk test notably the monthly and annual rainfall trends significantly followed the winter rainfall trend figs 3 and 4 most of the focus rainfall stations demonstrated the first abrupt departure from the past norms indicating a change point in the annual data between the 1940 s to the 1970 s in mcfarlane et al 2020 most of the change points were located in the 1970 s our results suggest that it is more likely that there has been more than one change point in the rainfall time series with the rainfall decline starting since the 1940 s it is confirmed by the ecp test on annual rainfall that there are multiple change points between the 1940 s to the 2000 s figs 3 and 4 increasing trends were observed in two eastern rainfall stations codg codgen and lake carmody with trends ranging from 13 to 56 over 100 years although the decline in rainfall has been progressive the drought has increased in the selected sites at an accelerating rate since 2000 4 1 2 changes in streamflow characteristics and salinity the data from the seven streamflow focus sites were analyzed for the trends and change points in both the monthly runoff zero flow days baseflow and salinity patterns and how these contributed to the overall trend seen in the annual data between 1958 and 2019 selected outputs from three sites boyanup bridge jane brook national park and mungalup tower are used to show different points of interest other focus sites are shown in the supplementary material monthly runoff data for the boyanup bridge site shows that the cdfm and lat tests distinguished the same falling trends and change points in the year 2000 in the entire record and when looking specifically at the wet season fig 5 a c sen s slope in annual and wet seasonal time series 1980 2019 show slopes of 0 57 and 0 50 mm yr respectively fig 5e and g the annual trend decrease was driven by significant declines in both summer and winter runoff the flow duration curve for inter change point periods illustrates that the mid ranges flows have reduced in recent years but high flows and low flows have not changed fig 5d the observed trend statistics in baseflows in the boyanup bridge gauging station show the cdfm and lat tests detected falling trends and change points of baseflow in the monthly and wet season series in the early 2000 s significance is defined as p 0 05 fig 6 a c the annual baseflow trend decrease was driven by the decrease in winter baseflow as these are the only ones that are significant fig 6e g although an increasing but not significant trend in monthly and annual dry season baseflow is shown the drought severity streamflow deficit has been increasing since 2009 fig 6f and h a notable trend and change point are also illustrated in the zero flow days record fig 7 a the omk mkltp structure showed its capability in detecting large scale variability for zero flow days at the jane brook national park gauging station highlighting it is an ephemeral stream fig 7a and b considering these results it can be said that the zero flow days have significantly increased about 3 days yr and that has manifested since 2000 the salinity trend at mungalup tower is an example of how stream salinity has increased at some sites with an insignificant trend in the annual and dry season salinities but a significant positive trend in wet season salinity fig 8 the increasing trend started in 2008 in most of the salinity focus stations fig 8 and table 2 overall 66 of the focus stations had significant declining runoff trends with the rate ranging between 32 and 90 table 2 the baseflow rates also decreased by between 41 and 53 considering the results the baseflow sites illustrated that they were more under the long term persistence ltp effect than for the other parameters which has not been considered in previous analyses the results indicated that drought duration increased by 26 to 60 and a similar increase happened for salinity 17 to 60 4 2 regional trends 4 2 1 regional rainfall changes across the entire rainfall station data between 1920 and 2019 the rate of annual rainfall slope determined by the annual sen s slope varied from 2 6 mm yr in the western coastal margin to 0 9 mm yr in the eastern areas fig s11a the switch to a positive annual rainfall trend occurs somewhere east of kondinin and codg codgin a negative sen s slope trend in most western areas is higher with the rate of 3 8 mm yr in wet seasons and 0 35 mm yr in dry seasons fig s11b the wet season rainfall trend switch to being positive occurs at around lake carmody in contrast the positive sen s slopes for the most easterly areas have been recorded with the rate of 0 46 mm yr in wet seasons and 0 65 mm yr in dry seasons fig s11c the dry season rainfall switch to being negative occurs in the south western areas donnybrook and kendenup the mean sen s slope for the perth basin and lower south west hydrological zones recorded the steepest rainfall declines in annual and wet season time series fig 9 a b in dry seasons most of the zones recorded a positive mean sen s slope except for the most south westerly area lower south west zone fig 9c auto correlation analysis illustrated that about 40 of rainfall stations have been effected at the 0 05 significance level table s2 when it comes to seasonal analysis the smk test shows that sen s slope is often lower than estimated by the omk mkltp test table 3 declining and increasing sen s slopes were not more than 12 per decade 0 11 mm yr and 3 per decade 0 006 mm yr in the smk test respectively in contrast the omk mkltp shows 20 of changes per decade and 26 of changes per decade in the study area the mkltp test identified that 29 27 of annual time series were under the hurst index h in fact they exhibited an imposed trend random variability and scaling variability table 3 although the annual trend has always followed the wet season s trend ltp s h effect on the annual time series does not replicate what is seen in the wet season 29 versus 7 stations the ltp shows its effect on the dry rainfall with 19 stations in contrast to the other time series spatial mapping of the h index also showed that stations of the eastern area in the wet season are under scaling effect 0 55 h more than the western areas h 0 45 interestingly spi 24 shows that 100 of the stations were under scaling effects and the mkltp modified the trend analysis result accordingly only two stations were under an imposed trend table 3 overall 95 of the most westerly stations had a significant decline in wet and annual rainfall while 50 of stations had a significant positive trend in dry season rainfall in the most easterly areas fig 10 a c it can be concluded that the annual and wet seasonal rainfall has been decreasing over the entire study area over the 100 years with dry season rainfall increasing in the eastern parts given about 80 of annual rainfall is in the wet season and dry season rainfall is less effective most evaporates in the hot summers the wetting trend in the east is not a major factor affecting hydrology and agriculture the northern perth basin includes some stations in lower rainfall areas and these have contributed to this zone having an increase in summer rainfall compared with the lower south west zone which is located wholly in a high rainfall area it is especially important that the most recent years since about 2000 have shown the most rapid drying across south western australia 4 2 2 regional streamflow and salinity changes the existence of positive serial correlation in runoff time series is noted for approximately 63 of the stations at the 0 05 significance level table s2 in addition 50 of the salinity time series also exhibited positive serial correlation more than 90 of streamflow stations have a negative sen s slope indicating a strong drying trend table 4 the smk method estimated that 83 of monthly 73 of wet and 75 of dry season time series of runoff have significant negative trends the sen s slope for volumes in perennial streams calculated by the smk test varies between 0 05 49 over 50 years 5 2 51 over 50 years and 0 03 mm yr 2 over 50 years in monthly wet and dry time series respectively in contrast ephemeral streams have a lower runoff decline rate for monthly 7 over 50 years 0 002 mm yr wet 52 over 50 years 2 mm yr and dry 12 over 50 years 0 006 mm yr the rate of decline using omk mkltp is higher than the smk test in both perennial and ephemeral streams table 4 in the annual time series there is about a 50 reduction in the amount of runoff across swwa the omk mkltp was able to detect the long term persistence ltp effect especially for dry seasons in perennial streams 29 stations and ephemeral streams 9 stations the annual sen s slope patterns in baseflow follows the patterns for perennial streamflow runoff with slight differences in the rate table 5 the seasonal baseflow trends also had a low rate of sen s slope decline for monthly 2 wet 5 and dry 2 seasons however the baseflow in the study area was under the long term persistence ltp effect more than perennial streamflow runoff for 20 15 and 37 stations in annual wet and dry time series respectively the trends in hydrological drought occurrence and zero flow days for all south western stations are shown in table 6 drought severity in perennial streams has a notable increasing trend with a monthly slope of 0 88 mm yr when applying the smk test and an annual slope of 8 7 mm yr using the omk mkltp test these indicate a major deficit in streamflows throughout the study area and they are accompanied by and increase in zero flow days by 1 5 days yr in the ephemeral streams the sen s slope calculated for surface water salinity shows that it has varied between 3 and 64 mg l yr in the study area table 7 this translates into an increase of between 8 and 12 over 30 years the smk test shows that 65 of the stations had a positive trend in three different periods the same trend was detected using the omk mkltp test the advantage of using the omk mkltp lies in detecting 14 9 and 17 stations that had an ltp effect in the annual wet and dry time series respectively table 7 5 discussion 5 1 summary of findings for the statistical methods the overall aim of this study was to develop a generic testing framework to describe and quantify hydro climatic trends in an area with a mediterranean climate we have shown that the developed framework is able to detect annual and seasonal trends single and multiple change points and is applicable for data sets that have complicated inter annual and intra annual characteristics we found that the number of rainfall and streamflow stations with significant trends declined when the mkltp scaling effect was considered this finding is similar to that found by hamed 2008 however in our case significant decreasing trends were detected rather than increasing ones this is to be expected given differences in the study areas regional climate drivers and or differences in seasonality our results showed that the h ratio is more than 0 5 for wet season rainfall annual runoff baseflow and dry season stream salinity indicating these datasets have large scale variability high variance inflation we also noted the the sen s slope estimated for the smk in different time series is lower than estimated for the omk mkltp test the change point analyses show that the lat and single change point approaches are not suitable for use in the study area because the swwa has experienced multiple step changes in the hydro climatic time series however simple methods such as spi 24 and cdfm were able to detect wet and dry periods inter annual variability multiple change points and the concept of ltp in the raw time series emelyanova et al 2013 folton et al 2019 to remove apparent significant trends in segments of time series multiple change point ecp and edp detections were combined with the mkltp this hybrid method was able to identify significant trend and distributional changes between segments and to show how the data were changing step by step matteson and james 2014 james et al 2019 the ecp method more accurately identified the number and exact location of change points compared with the edp method and therefore our results confirm that the agglomerative approach is preferable to the divisive approach matteson and james 2014 for this purpose it also removed change point masking trends to identify the true direction of trends sharma et al 2016 however when applying ecp and edp within r users should take care about the arguments of member and alpha it is recommended that a sensitivity test using different alpha values e g 1 or 2 before undertaking an application in this study we used a for loop to find the best initial membership vector for the time series please refer to the supplementary section for a sensitivity analysis associated with the ecp and edp methods classifying perennial and ephemeral streams prior to trend analyses was also important to show that the baseflow trend was not observed in ephemeral streams the method used by beyene et al 2014 proved to be a robust method to detect hydrological droughts via water deficiencies and their increased duration in the perennial river system 5 2 hydro climatic and water quality drivers of change over swwa nonstationary drivers refers to longer term processes which may cause significant shifts in the underlying distributions of hydro climatic extremes via climate or land cover change slater et al 2021 to investigate nonstationary drivers of hydro climatic and water quality change across swwa we separately explored how climate and land use changes affected the trends of different time series 5 2 1 rainfall drivers wet season rainfall has significantly fallen in 95 of the western sites and the dry season rainfall has increased in 50 of the eastern sites wet season rainfall supports non irrigated agricultural crops and pastures to grow and it is currently at its lowest since the 1940 s with the decline mostly occurring since the 1970 s however dry season rainfall has been the highest it has been in 100 years the proportion of annual rain falling in the wettest six months has shown a substantial decline in all stations except at lake carmody when looking at the focus sites the greatest declines have been measured at the cape leeuwin and kendenup stations in the southwest annual and wet season time seies show progressive drying from north to south and from east to west fig 10a and b in contrast the dry season time series show progressive wetting from south west to north east in the dry period time series fig 10c the single change point lat indicated abrupt shifts have happened since the 1940 s and 1950 s the trend is clear despite an increase in large scale variability in 30 of the stations all climatological drought spi 24 time series shows long term persistence and the indication of droughts has increased in the western area since 2000 although the specific cause of the observed decline in rainfall has not been confirmed smith power 2014 change in the large scale circulation pattern such as a decrease in the general baroclinicity and increases in the mean sea level pressure have been associated with the rainfall decline smith 2004 hope et al 2006 a poleward shift in the weather systems in most mediterranean areas has been noted although rainfall increases were detected in the wheatbelt zone and avon catchment between 1920 and 2019 annual wet season and especially dry season fig 10 the rainfall increase is likely lost to soil evaporation use by annual crops and pastures the detected decline in rainfall along the coastal areas is expected to continue air average temperatures are predicted to increase by 1 2 to 4 c by 2090 under optimistic and pessimistic climate change scenarios respectively hope et al 2015 some climate models predict that heatwave compounded drought events will become common by 2050 in some regions sedlmeier et al 2018 matusick et al 2018 5 2 2 streamflow related drivers monthly annual dry and wet season runoff showed a general and significant downward trend in 90 of the stream gauging stations especially affecting the wetter months overall results are aligned with those observed in the darling range by petrone et al 2010 who proposed the decline in runoff was related to the winter rainfall decline from 1975 and again after 2000 our study detected more negative shifts between 1994 and 2000 using the single and multiple change point detection tests the inflows occurring in the dry seasons were under long term persistence more than annual and wet seasons time series mcfarlane et al 2020 also showed the maximum daily flows and historical floods are increasing in the dry seasons in contrast to the declining trend in the wet seasons aquifers receiving direct rainfall recharge have a similar cdfm trend between groundwater levels and rainfall yesertener 2005 emelyanova et al 2013 baseflow decreased more than annual runoff in the study area which suggests that watertables have fallen below the valley inverts and saturation excess runoff has decreased d mcfarlane et al 2020 hughes et al 2012 also showed that groundwater storage has declined in recent drought years with rates of decline ranging from 0 05 to 0 48 m yr in the western catchments before the 1980 s there were no years with zero daily flows over a seven day period however since 2000 there have been eight years with no flow over seven day periods smettem et al 2013 this could be due to more hydrological drought occurring in perennial streams or more zero flow days occurring in ephemeral streams our results demonstrated that the zero flow days in ephemeral streams are increasing by about two days per year a close relationship between meteorological and hydrological drought severity is well accepted however hydrological drought typically lags behind meteorological drought because meteorological drought can develop quickly wu et al 2017 the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought is related to the seasonal characteristics summer rain may be ineffective huang et al 2017 whilst the rainfall is increasing in dry seasons the hydrological drought in the dry period shows increasing frequency and duration in perennial streams of the study region this may be because the watertable is lower after the reduction in winter rainfall making the wetted area around streams lower when summer rain occurs the hydrological drought severity is a sign of streamflow deficit in the rivers of swwa it has generally increased by 8 7 mm yr and more severe years were recorded after 2000 similar results have been reported by ali et al 2012 and hughes et al 2012 with more severe rainfall drought since 1975 although our results indicate a severe change point in 2000 stream ecosystems will have experienced a dramatic decline in the amount and duration of surface water needed to maintain their life cycle functions possible causes for the declining streamflows have been suggested increased temperatures drive higher rates of evaporation cai et al 2009 nicholls 2010 along with a decline in average rainfall frequency of daily rainfall and in wet day amounts bates et al 2010 petrone et al 2010 suggest that the increase in actual et results in falling groundwater levels and a deficit in soil moisture storage may be driving runoff decline in the study area as severe climatological droughts have both short and long term effects on the hydrological cycle van loon 2015 we suggest that the severe droughts that have happened since 1970 especially since 2000 are the main reason for the marked decline in runoff a close relationship has been found between forest cover and streamflow harper et al 2019 where streamflow increases with a reduction of forest cover through deforestation thinning and the spread of diseases such as jarrah dieback and decreases with reforestation and reduced rainfall in response to a predicted 8 reduction in rainfall by 2030 surface runoff reduction is expected to reduce by a further 20 groundwater discharge to streams is also projected to be decline by about 35 under a dry future climate ali et al 2012 the past trends of land use and climate change are predicted to continue with 15 global climate models gcms predicting that western australia wa in particular perth will be one of the most vulnerable areas experiencing a decline in surface water runoff about 24 and groundwater recharge about 2 silberstein et al 2012 ali et al 2012 in addition it is estimated that the population of perth will increase from 1 1 to 3 1 million by 2050 islam et al 2014 hence wa will face further pressure on existing surface water resources as well as unconfined aquifers in comparison with expected demands mcfarlane et al 2012 5 2 3 salinity drivers many inland catchments have saline runoff because deep rooted native vegetation have been replaced by shallow rooted crops and pastures which has increased recharge raising groundwater levels and mobilising salt stored in deep soil profiles into ephemeral streams callow and smettem 2007 mcfarlane et al 2016 this analysis has shown increasing stream salinity especially during wet seasons in the inland wheatbelt region about one million hectares of previously productive land had become salt affected by 2000 mcfarlane et al 2004 and stream salinity increased harper et al 2019 hatton and ruprecht 2002 suggested that increased areas of salt affected land may increase flood peaks because catchments would be saturated prior to rainfall flooding however observations indicate that floods have decreased and summer peak flows may now be higher than those in winter mcfarlane et al 2020 it is therefore unlikely that the salinity will increase across swwa under climate change scenarios however we note that in both the avon and peel harvey streams salinity loads are decreasing while the swan canning streams and other areas in south swwa are experiencing an increasing trend in both concentrations and tonnes 5 3 future work these findings highlight that while changes in climate and hydrology across swwa are complex our analytical framework has been able to increase our understanding of how the system has responded to climate change there are however unresolved issues that our study has identified the change point timing is complicated and occurs at different times in rainfall and streamflows in both the drier eastern and wetter western areas depending on what method is used single or multiple detection methods change points may be identified as occurring at different times our analytical framework can help exploration of this complexity it remains unclear how catchment processes influence trends and new methods are needed to understand non stationarity in the runoff coefficient more specialist methods are needed to be able to investigate how spatial and temporal changes propagate through catchments stream gauging is often located at the lower end of systems but the runoff coefficient will likely also change across catchments and throughout time in response to gradient rainfall changes long term drying trends also affect the amount and type of perennial vegetation on catchments which adds further complexity as they adapt it remains challenging to understand what catchments are doing and new methodologies to account for the propagation of these changes within river networks are needed 6 conclusions swwa has experienced a significant decrease in rainfall since the 1970 s and increased temperatures and potential evaporation over a longer period the study region is expected to experience even drier wet seasons and wetter dry seasons at least in the east into the future this research has attempted to address key gaps in scientific knowledge relating to the effect of climate change on runoff and stream water quality over time and geographic regions an analysis framework has been developed in r and applied to a network of 107 rainfall gauges 100 years of data and 90 streamflow water quality gauges 50 30 years of data across swwa trends were calculated by the original mann kendall omk family of tests including using the mann kendall test under the scaling hypothesis mkltp and seasonal mann kendall smk single and multiple change points were estimated by the non parametric lanzante s test lat and e agglomerative algorithm ecp energy divisive edp and cumulative departure from the mean cdfm analysis oftheoutcomesshowedthat annual rainfall has decreased by 2 6 mm yr in western areas and increased by 0 9 mm yr in eastern areas almost 65 of western rainfall weather stations have measured a significant decline in the wet season and annual rainfall in contrast to 50 of stations having a significant increase in dry seasons in the eastern areas the impact of hurst phenomenon imposed a trend of 30 in the annual rainfall stations also of note is that all of the standardized precipitation index spi time series were under long term persistence ltp and the drought has further increased in the western area since 2000 these climatic trends indicate a high risk of freshwater scarcity for swwa the regional streamflow trend analysis shows catchments are yielding much less runoff in more than 90 of gauged stations the runoffs of perennial and ephemeral streams have declined by 6 54 and 2 50 mm yr respectively hydrological drought trend and zero flow days have increased since 2000 which corresponds to the negative shift for runoffs between 1994 and 2000 it is important to note that the baseflows rates of decline were higher than that detected for runoff indicating that groundwater levels have fallen substantially an overall significant increasing trend has been recorded for stream salinity in swwa at 64 15 mg l yr however salt loads t yr have decreased because runoff volumes have declined by an even greater amount it can be concluded there is a strong relationship between the impact of climate change on runoff and stream water quality that will continue as the climate continues to become warmer and drier as is projected to occur in most areas with a mediterranean climate the results of this study can be used to inform water resource suppliers and managers natural resource managers landholders and government policymakers to facilitate the adaptation to anticipated climate change a knowledge of processes is required to be able to use future climate projections to anticipate break points that are indicative of major disruptions in the hydrological processes in
