groundwater flow is also difficult particularly for researches of ecology and environmental science in this study we present biological indicators of benthic invertebrates to evaluate the contribution of groundwater to surface water bodies because the benthic invertebrates show distribution patterns reflecting habitat scale environmental conditions in a sensitive manner they are expected to serve

possibly be used as indicators 2 2 1 groundwater dependent species this group include underground and cave dwelling species known as stygobites and species that can occur in both groundwater and surface water stygophiles stygobites are generally known as no eyes elongated shapes long appendages and lacking pigmentation translucent they are obligate or strictly subterranean stygophiles are not necessarily restricted to subterranean environments but they are partial to them 2 2 2 cold stenothermal species cold stenothermal species refers to cold adapted stenotherms of benthic invertebrates which grow over a narrow range of low temperature respectively as showed in fig 1 cold adapted stenotherms are commonly found in streams and rivers of high latitude regions and coldwater habitats of low latitude regions such as headwater springs spring fed and glacier fed streams warm stenothermal species have adapted to a range of respective high temperature and can be commonly found in low latitude regions some stenothermal species of high latitude regions can also be considered as warm stenotherms because there are these special groups that could not survive if exposed to very freezing temperature or subzero environments during winter period when surrounding water freeze the water temperature may go beyond their lethal limits of cold hardiness in this case they may find spring water as suitable habitats 2 2 3 other unknown species besides the above geographic physical and ecological factors that may explain why these groups can be considered as spring indicators there are species recorded as possible spring indicators in the previous works but the reasons maintained unknown during the biological sampling of benthic invertebrates in rivers and streams some species which can be commonly recorded in spring waters are considered as spring species however the reasons of why they inhabit in springs are not clear the identification of these species refers to the current researches and documents 3 results 3 1 taxonomic composition of spring fauna a total of 1448 aquatic invertebrate taxa representing 58 orders were found from 249 research sites the invertebrate fauna

lepidostomatidae limnephilidae ceratopogonidae chironomidae empididae are mostly filter feeders and deposit feeders which are often found in streams and are usually associated with aquatic plants they mainly dominate stream habitats since streams that functioned as lotic habitats appear to be more suitable than lentic habitats in springs 3 10 bivalvia species in sphaeriidae pelecydoda and

hydroptilidae and neuroptera osmylidae are recorded within epiphytic species 4 discussion it is widely known that the special characteristics of springs the locations of springs at the interface between groundwater surface water and terrestrial ecosystems have led to a high value of their biodiversity and high contribution to ecosystem services however until recently very little research has focused on spring ecosystems or their dependent species this lack of information and attention to spring ecosystems has resulted in the loss of many springs through poor groundwater and land use practices the key element in sustainable spring habitat management and conservation is to recognize the location of springs in freshwater ecosystems barquín and scarsbrook 2008 to approach this models and simulations have been developed in order to estimate the groundwater flow however it can be difficult to achieve since running a model or a simulation needs some certain assumptions e g underlying geological data which makes it rather difficult to estimate groundwater flow on a local scale as increasing recognition of the importance of cross discipline studies and development of groundwater ecology a new paradigm emphasizes that sustainable groundwater management needs not only abiotic physiochemical criteria but also the biological criteria tomlinson et al 2007 hancock et al 2005 boulton et al 2008 spring fauna have been suggested as valuable and cheap indicator for monitoring groundwater quality tomlinson et al 2007 stein et al 2010 however the potential use of spring fauna as biological indicators for the assessment of groundwater contribution is still seldom accessible in this paper we suggested a list of spring indicators of benthic invertebrates including three potential bio indicator groups groundwater dependent species stenothermal species and epiphytic species once the benthic community of springs has been sampled this information can be evaluated using the spring indicator list regarding the identification of four potential bio indicator groups we have provided a short introduction in this paper further information should be referred to in related documents there are a few points that still need to be recognized here regarding the identification and application of stenothermal species and groundwater dependent species they are very important groups inside the spring indicators as the result of the taxonomic composition showed in fig 2 considering the high diversity of these two groups the identification and application should vary according to geological and geographical environments the stenothermal species refer to benthic invertebrates which have narrow ranges of thermal tolerance it includes cold adapted and warm adapted stenotherms respectively non stenotherms could be considered as eurytherms which have adapted to a wide range of temperature however a proper identification of a given species can be difficult and uncertain there are few studies on termotolerance and cold hardiness involving aquatic insects and accurate data on the upper and lower thermal limits for many species are still rare lencioni and bernabò 2017 logan and buckley 2015 furthermore the classification of species into stenotherm or eurytherm group can be variable because of their geographical distribution and migration generally high latitude polar species are considered as cold adapted stenotherms as they possess the lowest upper thermal threshold of all organisms lencioni and bernabò 2017 they can be found in streams and coldwater habitats of low latitude regions during summer season due to their upper thermal limits of heat tolerance they may find springs or hyporheic zones as suitable habitats for example the species b antarctica from the antarctic region pseudodiamesa branickii and diamesa cinerella meigen from alpine streams are investigated as cold stenothermal species for themotolerance and cold hardiness studies rinehart et al 2006 bernabò et al 2011 lencioni et al 2013 lencioni and rossar 2005 have reported the subfamily diamesinae of diptera as a dominant taxon in cold alpine streams and springs on the other hand studies on cold hardiness show that some stenothermal polar species could not survive if exposed to freezing temperature or subzero environments during winter periods when surrounding water freezes or the water temperature goes beyond their lethal limits of cold hardiness in high latitude regions some of these species may find springs or hyporheic zones as refuge lencioni and spitale 2015 within this context it is imperative that stenothermal species could be considered as spring indicators under some certain circumstances for the purpose of this study we have selected some stenothermal species as spring indicators however when comes to the application of these stenothermal spring indicators we need to consider their upper and lower thermal limits and as well as their geographical distribution generally speaking stenothermal polar species could be used as possible spring indicators in temperate and tropical zones while in polar regions benthic invertebrate species which have adapted to a narrow range of temperature close to local spring water temperature could be considered as biological indicators of springs besides the two spring indicator groups there are also a number of species recorded as possible spring indicators in the previous works but the reasons maintained unknown species such as epiphytic species macroinvertebrates associated with bryophytes could possibly be considered spring indicators under some certain circumstances given the stability of springs as habitats stones with moss mats are more common at spring sites this could be one of the possible explanations for the abundance of stone surface and moss mat dwellers at springs and spring fed streams many studies have shown that the epiphytic species prefer cold waters tada and satake 1994 reported epiphytic zoobenthos at upper reaches of a cool mountain stream species micrasema sp mc was the most abundant taxon found on bryophyte mats at the headwater sites storey and quinn 2008 found the epiphytic species kempynus order neuroptera in small perennial headwaters within this context epiphytic species share some common characteristics with stenothermal species thus can be considered possible spring indicators in some cases aquatic invertebrates are numerous and exhibit graded responses to various disturbances in their surrounding environments merrit et al 2008 they have been used as bio indicators in the river management for purposes such as water quality assessment and habitat quality evaluation harikumar et al 2014 scherr 2010 hamilton 2013 also studied the effects of climate change on stream invertebrates in their role as biological indicators and responses to disturbance some studies have researched macroinvertebrate community composition and distribution in springs however it is still unclear why these species have adapted or inhabit in springs wigger et al 2015 have researched spring habitats along an altitudinal gradient of about 2000m in a valley in the bernese alps the purpose was to explore the corresponding spring fauna with the environmental parameters of springs at different altitudes we expected more attention on spring habitats and their dependent species it becomes imperative to explore this issue considering the potential risks of temperature variation threatened by climate change more efforts should be made on genomic approaches cold hardiness and thermotolerance studies to provide additional information of stenothermal species investigating the distribution and migration of stenothermal species researching their thermotolerance and cold hardiness would be great strategies for monitoring the influence of climate change such exploring needs more integrative studies and research focused on the development of methods and tools for integrated management of water resource systems combining hydrology engineering and ecology 5 conclusion this study identified spring indicator taxa of benthic invertebrates from data set collected from field research and literature on a continental and worldwide scale the information provided by the spring indicator taxa of an aquifer can reflect the contacts between the surface origin of the water and may be used as an indicator of groundwater and spring evaluation given the susceptibility of springs and groundwater to modification from land use change and water abstraction many species should be considered at risk and urgent attention is required to incorporate biological indicators into an assessment of groundwater and spring management there are many factors than can be considered during a decision making policy setting applying biological indicators to conservation work is essential for sustainable river ecosystem management and the well being of human life conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards

as suitable habitats 2 2 3 other unknown species besides the above geographic physical and ecological factors that may explain why these groups can be considered as spring indicators there are species recorded as possible spring indicators in the previous works but the reasons maintained unknown during the biological sampling of benthic invertebrates in rivers and streams some species which can be commonly recorded in spring waters are considered as spring species however the reasons of why they inhabit in springs are not clear the identification of these species refers to the current researches and documents 3 results 3 1 taxonomic composition of spring fauna a total of 1448 aquatic invertebrate taxa representing 58 orders were found from 249 research sites the invertebrate fauna

hydroptilidae and neuroptera osmylidae are recorded within epiphytic species 4 discussion it is widely known that the special characteristics of springs the locations of springs at the interface between groundwater surface water and terrestrial ecosystems have led to a high value of their biodiversity and high contribution to ecosystem services however until recently very little research has focused on spring ecosystems or their dependent species this lack of information and attention to spring ecosystems has resulted in the loss of many springs through poor groundwater and land use practices the key element in sustainable spring habitat management and conservation is to recognize the location of springs in freshwater ecosystems barquín and scarsbrook 2008 to approach this models and simulations have been developed in order to estimate the groundwater flow however it can be difficult to achieve since running a model or a simulation needs some certain assumptions e g underlying geological data which makes it rather difficult to estimate groundwater flow on a local scale as increasing recognition of the importance of cross discipline studies and development of groundwater ecology a new paradigm emphasizes that sustainable groundwater management needs not only abiotic physiochemical criteria but also the biological criteria tomlinson et al 2007 hancock et al 2005 boulton et al 2008 spring fauna have been suggested as valuable and cheap indicator for monitoring groundwater quality tomlinson et al 2007 stein et al 2010 however the potential use of spring fauna as biological indicators for the assessment of groundwater contribution is still seldom accessible in this paper we suggested a list of spring indicators of benthic invertebrates including three potential bio indicator groups groundwater dependent species stenothermal species and epiphytic species once the benthic community of springs has been sampled this information can be evaluated using the spring indicator list regarding the identification of four potential bio indicator groups we have provided a short introduction in this paper further information should be referred to in related documents there are a few points that still need to be recognized here regarding the identification and application of stenothermal species and groundwater dependent species they are very important groups inside the spring indicators as the result of the taxonomic composition showed in fig 2 considering the high diversity of these two groups the identification and application should vary according to geological and geographical environments the stenothermal species refer to benthic invertebrates which have narrow ranges of thermal tolerance it includes cold adapted and warm adapted stenotherms respectively non stenotherms could be considered as eurytherms which have adapted to a wide range of temperature however a proper identification of a given species can be difficult and uncertain there are few studies on termotolerance and cold hardiness involving aquatic insects and accurate data on the upper and lower thermal limits for many species are still rare lencioni and bernabò 2017 logan and buckley 2015 furthermore the classification of species into stenotherm or eurytherm group can be variable because of their geographical distribution and migration generally high latitude polar species are considered as cold adapted stenotherms as they possess the lowest upper thermal threshold of all organisms lencioni and bernabò 2017 they can be found in streams and coldwater habitats of low latitude regions during summer season due to their upper thermal limits of heat tolerance they may find springs or hyporheic zones as suitable habitats for example the species b antarctica from the antarctic region pseudodiamesa branickii and diamesa cinerella meigen from alpine streams are investigated as cold stenothermal species for themotolerance and cold hardiness studies rinehart et al 2006 bernabò et al 2011 lencioni et al 2013 lencioni and rossar 2005 have reported the subfamily diamesinae of diptera as a dominant taxon in cold alpine streams and springs on the other hand studies on cold hardiness show that some stenothermal polar species could not survive if exposed to freezing temperature or subzero environments during winter periods when surrounding water freezes or the water temperature goes beyond their lethal limits of cold hardiness in high latitude regions some of these species may find springs or hyporheic zones as refuge lencioni and spitale 2015 within this context it is imperative that stenothermal species could be considered as spring indicators under some certain circumstances for the purpose of this study we have selected some stenothermal species as spring indicators however when comes to the application of these stenothermal spring indicators we need to consider their upper and lower thermal limits and as well as their geographical distribution generally speaking stenothermal polar species could be used as possible spring indicators in temperate and tropical zones while in polar regions benthic invertebrate species which have adapted to a narrow range of temperature close to local spring water temperature could be considered as biological indicators of springs besides the two spring indicator groups there are also a number of species recorded as possible spring indicators in the previous works but the reasons maintained unknown species such as epiphytic species macroinvertebrates associated with bryophytes could possibly be considered spring indicators under some certain circumstances given the stability of springs as habitats stones with moss mats are more common at spring sites this could be one of the possible explanations for the abundance of stone surface and moss mat dwellers at springs and spring fed streams many studies have shown that the epiphytic species prefer cold waters tada and satake 1994 reported epiphytic zoobenthos at upper reaches of a cool mountain stream species micrasema sp mc was the most abundant taxon found on bryophyte mats at the headwater sites storey and quinn 2008 found the epiphytic species kempynus order neuroptera in small perennial headwaters within this context epiphytic species share some common characteristics with stenothermal species thus can be considered possible spring indicators in some cases aquatic invertebrates are numerous and exhibit graded responses to various disturbances in their surrounding environments merrit et al 2008 they have been used as bio indicators in the river management for purposes such as water quality assessment and habitat quality evaluation harikumar et al 2014 scherr 2010 hamilton 2013 also studied the effects of climate change on stream invertebrates in their role as biological indicators and responses to disturbance some studies have researched macroinvertebrate community composition and distribution in springs however it is still unclear why these species have adapted or inhabit in springs wigger et al 2015 have researched spring habitats along an altitudinal gradient of about 2000m in a valley in the bernese alps the purpose was to explore the corresponding spring fauna with the environmental parameters of springs at different altitudes we expected more attention on spring habitats and their dependent species it becomes imperative to explore this issue considering the potential risks of temperature variation threatened by climate change more efforts should be made on genomic approaches cold hardiness and thermotolerance studies to provide additional information of stenothermal species investigating the distribution and migration of stenothermal species researching their thermotolerance and cold hardiness would be great strategies for monitoring the influence of climate change such exploring needs more integrative studies and research focused on the development of methods and tools for integrated management of water resource systems combining hydrology engineering and ecology 5 conclusion this study identified spring indicator taxa of benthic invertebrates from data set collected from field research and literature on a continental and worldwide scale the information provided by the spring indicator taxa of an aquifer can reflect the contacts between the surface origin of the water and may be used as an indicator of groundwater and spring evaluation given the susceptibility of springs and groundwater to modification from land use change and water abstraction many species should be considered at risk and urgent attention is required to incorporate biological indicators into an assessment of groundwater and spring management there are many factors than can be considered during a decision making policy setting applying biological indicators to conservation work is essential for sustainable

1051,the occurrence of springs in the european lowlands has not yet been satisfactorily recognised this is because crenological research focuses mainly on mountainous areas where springs are common and rich in water the premise to undertake research on the springs of lowland and postglacial areas in poland is the fact that they allow the assessment of spring abundance in the areas with geological structure and hydrological conditions different than in the mountains which is now an extremely important argument the study presents preliminary results of research on roztoka springs located in the polish lowland in the coastal zone of the south baltic covering the hydrogeological hydrological and hydrobiological issues the results indicate that the springs are fed from the quaternary aquifer in which three hydrostructural zones were distinguished the third zone iii with the largest area and water resources is of crucial importance in the recharge of the springs the yield of the springs is relatively high for young glacial areas and in summer exceeds 70 dm 3 s 1 the roztoka springs have a much larger underground recharge area than it is apparent from the topographic course of the watershed bicarbonates dominate the chemical composition of the springs the primary type of water is calcium bicarbonate sulphate the vegetation corresponds to the difficult environmental conditions and is represented primarily by the montio cardaminetea group the roztoka springs area represents high landscape values this is why it should be recommended for protection in order to preserve its natural condition which is threatened by current forest management keywords spring grounwater recharge drainage spring yield chemical composition vegetation cover 1 introduction the issue of the functioning of natural outflows of groundwaters in young glacial areas is relatively poorly understood due to low yields and often dispersed nature of the outflow these areas are not within the interest of hydrogeologists it also applies to eco and hydrobiological approaches small surface areas settled by specialised organisms with a narrow ecological range cantonati et al 2012 these areas are not very attractive for researchers in recent years however this approach has been changing attention is paid to the particularly valuable role of springs in the landscape their natural biodiversity golubev et al 1999 grzelak 2011 martin brunke 2012 czachorowski et al 2013 their morphogenetic role mazurek 2010 afelt 2012 and as an initiator of the development and recharge of the river network michalczyk 1997 fac beneda jereczek 2009 springs constitute a link connecting underground and surface water circulation therefore research is currently being undertaken to assess their yields chemical composition and physical properties koc glińska lewczuk 2004 mazurek 2008 fac beneda 2009 which can then be used to determine the conditions in which plant and animal organisms develop the study of the outflows of the roztoka springs follows this trend since the springs are a place for the development of specialised fauna and flora they are also a good indicator of changes in the environment under anthropopressure research indicates most common anthropogenic stressors include drainage changes in chemical composition through the inflow of biogenic contaminants and metals disturbance of thermal stability and changes in land use lehosmaa et al 2017 ilmonen et al 2012 laini et al 2012 heino et al 2005 in foreign literature one can find examples of research aimed at capturing threats and assessing the sensitivity of crenological objects barquín scarsbrook 2008 rossi et al 2015 lehosmaa et al 2018 these studies are intended to indicate methods for the protection of springs as valuable nature related ecosystems dependent on water the research aims to delineate recharge area of the roztoka springs based on the determination of the hydrochemical type of their water and identification of the seasonal variability of their yield regime for this reason the paper focuses mainly on the following research aspects identification and dynamics of groundwaters verification of their cycle balance and renewability in the recharge area as well as the determination of the physicochemical properties of spring waters another goal is to present the habitat conditions in the spring niches by recognising their floral diversity thus the scope of the work is to determine the impact of environmental conditions on the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the groundwater outflows of the roztoka springs 2 study area the roztoka springs initiate a small river 9 1 km the białogórska struga which discharges its waters into the piaśnica the białogórska struga drains the eastern part of the słowińskie coastland kondracki 1998 in hydrographic terms it is a pomeranian river adjacent to the catchments of the rivers chełst lubiatówka bezimienna and bychowska struga mapa hydrograficzna 2005 natural drainage occurs via outflows which are mainly concentrated and permanent and initiate the river through two well developed streams fig 1 according to the detailed geological map 1 50 000 choczewo sheet skompski 1982 the niches formed by these outflows are situated on the accumulation terrace related to the deposition of sands at the bottom of the river valley hydrogeological hydrological and hydrobiological conditions as well as physicochemical properties of the roztoka springs have been determined only fragmentarily the first research was conducted in 2008 by the polish geological institute marine geology branch in gdańsk the research defined outflow typology and included basic tests of outflow quality and yield tarnawska 2013 later górniak and pietryczuk 2015 estimated the volume of the outflow from the roztoka springs at 20 35 dm 3 s 1 this two year study was initiated in 2017 at the department of hydrology of the university of gdańsk with the aim of monthly measurements the article presents initial conclusions concerning hydrogeological hydrological and hydrobiological conditions 3 materials and methods the research procedure consisted in gathering material using classical methods field laboratory and desk after appropriate preparation the data were subjected to interpretation and assessment in respect of the aims of the study particular emphasis was given to geological and hydrogeological surveys of the study area based on the analysis of thematic maps skompski 1982 lidzbarski 1999 mapa hydrograficzna polski 2005 due to the shallow depth of water within the transverse outflow profiles the valeport 801 electromagnetic flowmeter with a flat sensor was used the device allows the measurement of water velocity even at a depth of 25 mm it is based on the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction thus ensuring high accuracy of the obtained result measurement error at 0 5 the value of the flow volume was obtained after multiplying the measured water velocity by the cross section of the wet profile and applying the appropriate coefficients of bottom roughness reduction the obtained results should be treated as indicative values the flow was measured at the outflow of the selected individual springs and spring niches as well as in the profiles closing the outflow of the two streams fed from these niches fig 2 thus obtaining total yield values for the roztoka springs altogether three measurement series were performed june july and august 2017 hydrochemical properties were studied in two ways in situ and in laboratory conditions in principle testing and sampling sites corresponded with the hydrometric measurement points fig 2 the following indicators were measured directly in the field water temperature oxygen content electrical conductivity suspension and ph for this purpose a multi parameter probe from the hach company was used measurement error in the range of 0 2 0 5 in the hydrochemical laboratory of the department of hydrology the university of gdańsk the physicochemical properties of water samples collected in the field july and august 2017 were determined by analysing basic macro elements by ion chromatography among them the main anions chlorides cl sulphates so4 2 and bicarbonates hco3 as well as cations potassium k sodium na magnesium mg2 and calcium ca2 were determined the obtained results were used to determine the hydrogeochemical type of outflows according to the alekin altowski szwiec classification macioszczyk 1987 besides contamination of the groundwater outflows by biogenic compounds was determined by estimating the content of phosphorus total nitrogen and its derivatives nitrates and nitrites the obtained results were interpreted using the katalog wybranych fizycznych i chemicznych wskaźników zanieczyszczeń wód podziemnych i metod ich oznaczania 2013 as well as papers by macioszczyk 2012 and macioszczyk dobrzyński 2002 floristic research was based on preliminary and general natural valorisation which consisted in recognising the basic plant species composition zalewska et al 2013 at this stage phytosociological surveys were not done the nomenclature of vascular plants followed mirek et al 2002 and rutkowski 2011 mosses were described according to ochyra et al 2003 while liverworts according to the szweykowski s list 2006 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrogeological conditions the roztoka springs are valley springs leyered and erosive type with groundwater outflows in the surroundings of the spring area sandy formations dominate on the surface to the southwest replaced by glacial till residua on the sand and then by glacial till locally there are also sands of aeolian origin skompski 1982 the surface of the terrain is slightly wavy with dune ridges it rises to the south up to 80 m above sea level in the area of choczewo the presence of groundwater is primarily related to the quaternary water bearing level fig 3 it contains two aquifers phreatic and inter moraine lidzbarski 1999 deeper aquifers are poorly developed and have limited significance in the water cycle the phreatic level is related to sandy glaciofluvial sediments which are covered with fluvial sands of erosion accumulation terraces sierżęga 2006 it encompasses the northern part of the study area near the roztoka springs within the słowińskie coastland and the edge zone of the żarnowiecka plateau the roof of the aquifer is at a depth of about 0 5 m to 15 m the thickness of the water bearing sediments is from 5 to 30 m in lithological terms there is a domination of sands of various granulation predominantly coarse grain sands with gravels the filtration rate is high and exceeds 0 0003 m s 1 and water transmissivity ranges from 9 to 50 m2 h 1 the water table is unconfined and is positioned at an altitude from 17 to 25 m above sea level groundwaters flow north to the baltic sea and are also drained by the roztoka springs the bychowska struga and the drainage system of the coastal depression the phreatic aquifer is separated from the inter moraine one by a complex of glacial tills of the weichselian glaciation despite this the two aquifers remain in an indirect hydraulic relationship and locally are in direct contact via hydrogeological windows the inter moraine aquifer is found throughout the study area in the glaciofluvial sediments from the oder saale and weichselian glaciations mostly forming a single aquifer complex locally it is separated by a relatively thin layer of glacial till forming a two layer system the maximum thickness of the saturated zone is 50 m but generally it is 15 30 m and the average filtration rate is 0 00015 m s 1 the roof of the aquifer is usually situated at a depth of 30 60 m and only in terrain lowerings it is less than 15 m economically the inter moraine aquifer is the source of water supply in the area the water table mostly confined is inclined to the north and stabilised at its highest point about 50 m above sea level in the choczewo area the baltic sea is the main drainage level in some places the groundwater flow is stimulated by local drainage base levels related to the valleys of the bychowska struga and białogórska struga the identification of hydrogeological conditions analysed so far allows for a preliminary determination of the recharge area of the roztoka springs lidzbarski 1999 sierżęga 2006 hydrodynamic conditions determine its boundaries the groundwater flow spreads southwest to a distance of 7 9 km to choczewo the maximum width of the water flow reaches almost 2 9 km the area of the defined recharge area is 17 3 km2 the water table is highest on the southwestern recharge boundary where it stabilises at an altitude of 40 50 m above sea level the hydraulic gradient of the water runoff to the roztoka springs is between 0 3 and 0 4 taking into account the geological structure surface formation lithology the hydrodynamic system and infiltration supply conditions three different hydrostructural zones can be distinguished in the water bearing system fig 4 hydrostructural zone i of 4 1 km2 covers the most distant part of the hydrological cycle where the groundwater flows into the roztoka springs is initiated under two patches of glacial till there is the inter moraine aquifer infiltration of precipitation water into the aquifer system is hampered by the predominant proportion of poorly permeable deposits on the surface there is no phreatic water in this zone hydrostructural zone ii covers an area of about 4 2 km2 and encompasses the central part of the recharge area in this zone both aquifers are well developed and remain in direct hydraulic connection with each other phreatic water is partially isolated on the surface by patches of glacial till between the two aquifers intensive water exchange occurs and where they separate they form two independent groundwater flows towards the roztoka springs hydrostructural zone iii of about 9 km2 surrounds the spring area and extends about 3 5 km upstream of the groundwater flow there are two aquifers there on the surface highly permeable formations prevail sands of river valleys and terraces glaciofluvial sands sands on glacial till and glacial till residua the phreatic level is not isolated which facilitates direct infiltration of precipitation into the aquifer system these waters are entirely drained by the roztoka springs whereas the waters of the inter moraine aquifer flow to the north it is possible that the bychowska struga drains some of it and ascendingly feeds phreatic waters factors affecting the supply of the aquifer and springs include precipitation topography hydraulic properties of the soil hydraulic transmissivities of the unsaturated zone and groundwater conditions trcek zojer 2010 infiltration supply rate is affected by the size of the recharge area a

table 1 the most precipitation approx 65 9 dm s 1 infiltrates down groundwater in the zone iii the lowest infiltration 11 1 dm s 1 occurs in the hydrostructural zone i located farthest from the spring area where poorly permeable deposits limit the supply of groundwater the main factor shaping the water resources of the roztoka springs is direct infiltration supply which amounts to approx 8572 m3 d 1 table 2 it occurs in the entire recharge area although the most significant share belongs to the hydrostructural zone iii located near the source area the groundwater flow is initiated in the zone i

from the inter moraine level constitute about 20 of this flow thus in the phreatic aquifer about 2301 m3 d 1 28 dm3 s 1 flows into zone i however the main factor affecting the resources of this zone is atmospheric precipitation of which about 5692 m3 d 1 infiltrates into the aquifer hence the dynamic phreatic resources in the zone i are 7993 m3 d 1 it can be estimated that the yield of the roztoka springs is about 92 5 dm3 s 1 it is possible however that due to the outflow of some of these waters into the bychowska struga the actual value may be lower explanation to the table 2 a

the only supply source and is additionally limited by the overlying rock formations the renewability of groundwaters supplying the roztoka springs is one of the highest in pomerania and is characteristic of young glacial systems lidzbarski 2015 4 2 hydrographic and hydrological characteristics the roztoka springs originate at an altitude of about 17 5 m surrounded by a pine forest below the outflows in górczyn water is dammed for fish ponds as a result part of the spring area is inundated forming a reservoir the reservoir is used as a water intake site in the past there was a water mill on the springs constructed in the early 17th century the roztoka springs area is composed of a complex of spring niches visible in the terrain as deep hollows each niche is made up of many outflows of a point type spring and non concentrated type sapping seepage bog spring the first type being dominant the niches also contain fragments of watercourses which gather and drain water from the outflows the studied spring area encompasses eleven such niches from which water is concentrated in two streams the northern consisting of five niches and the southern with six besides other spring niches feed the existing reservoir directly the topographic catchment of the roztoka springs reaches far southwest wedging between the settlements of osieki lublewko and słuchowo the outfalls adopted separately for each stream are just before the streams enter the reservoir thus covering the system of spring niches constituting the beginning of the białogórska struga fig 5 the catchment of both streams determined from the dem model covers 6 14 km2 in total fig 5 the drainage area of the southern stream is four times larger 4 96 km2 than the northern one 1 18 km2 the interpretation of the hydro isohypses reveals that the groundwatershed determined for the three hydrostructural zones extends far beyond the boundaries based on topography the difference is as much as 11 2 km2 hence the examined springs show relative stability concentrated form and significant yield as for the conditions of the polish lowland chełmicki et al 2010 the outflow from the roztoka springs is substantial and comparable to the discharge efficiency of the staniszewskie springs or the czarna woda springs fac beneda jereczek 2009 in summer june august 2017 the total outflow from the roztoka springs was on average 85 6 dm3 s 1 which corresponds to the estimates obtained by hydrogeological methods it should be assumed that the volume of actual outflow is slightly higher as in the beds of both streams there are many fallen trees which form ponds and impede the free migration of water moreover the measurements taken during the growing season are generally lower than in the cold season the result shows that the water resources of the catchment deviate significantly from local values the average unit outflow for this area is estimated at 6 8 dm3 s 1 km2 jokiel 2004 while the analysed catchments drain 13 9 dm3 s 1 km2 despite the differences in the topographic catchment area the outflow values from both streams are similar table 3 these preliminary observations indicate that the size of the recharge area influences the yield of both streams inversely this hypothesis however requires confirmation based on further measurement and monitoring of the spring yield most importantly however the exact location of the differences in the surface and groundwatershed is required according to the crenological regionalisation of poland dynowska 1986 amended the roztoka springs are in zone xiii i e the young glacial area of the polish lowland springs in this area show variable yield which generally does not exceed 1 dm3 s 1 the information on the drainage value of a single spring in the area under study is provided by tarnawska 2013 measurements of spring no 1 in 2008 showed an irregular outflow from 3 6 dm3 s 1 to 6 5 dm3 s 1 fig 6 in turn in june august 2017 the yield ranged from 1 1 dm3 s 1 to 5 5 dm3 s 1 as a result this spring to be classified as category v according to the meinzer classification moniewski 2007 the total outflow from single niches i e from springs and non concentrated forms of outflow classifies the roztoka springs to class iv by mainzer the yield ranges from 6 0 28 0 dm3 s 1 4 3 physicochemical features the waters of the roztoka springs show small variations in chemical composition they are fresh waters with the mineralisation of 292 385 mg dm 3 which matches the hydrogeochemical background it is confirmed by measurements of electrical conductivity of 191 331μs cm 1 they are cool waters the temperature at the outflow points is close to the mean annual air temperature in the białogóra region it is on average 9 2 c and varies according to the season and the degree of shading of the springs from 6 1 c to 12 0 c tarnawska 2013 because of poor solubility and atmospheric origin the oxygen content in groundwater is low and does not exceed 10 mg dm 3 o2 dobrzyński 2012 even in shallow waters direct field measurements indicate a large oxygen deficit in the springs the oxygen content of individual outflows is 4 5 mg dm 3 o2 which corresponds to about 40 oxygenation oxygenation increase is observed further from the outflow points the oxygenation of the streams before reaching the reservoir after covering about 250 m reaches 84 the composition of the examined springs is characteristic for quaternary levels of the young glacial lake districts of northern poland fig 7 bicarbonates are the dominating component in the outflows according to kozerski 2007 groundwaters at these levels are distinguished by their dual ion chemical composition hco3 ca according to the alekin hydrochemical classification 1956 the springs belong to the bicarbonate class calcium group water type iii due to the ionic structure ccaiii the structure has the following sequence hco3 64 3 so4 2 23 3 ca2 81 1 mg2 12 2 or cl 12 4 na 6 2 according to the altowski szwiec classification macioszczyk 1987 the waters of the roztoka springs reveal two and more often three ionic hydrochemical types calcium bicarbonate sulphate ca2 hco3 so4 2 with the sulphate content varying in particular outflows from 16 to 27 although concentrations rarely exceed 60 mg so4 dm3 the variability of the sulphate ion concentrations is related to the formation and subsequent washing out of organic and inorganic acids as a result of decomposition of organic matter in soils over time skowrońska filipek 2008 they can also be derived by leaching from material in the żarnowiecka plateau which is the area of recharge of the analysed springs magnesium in concentrations of 4 27 8 80 mg dm 3 indicates that the groundwater environment within the recharge zone of the roztoka springs is deficient in this component fig 8 it is a characteristic feature for pleistocene accumulation formations macioszczyk 1987 the analysed water is also deficient in potassium the potassium content 0 39 1 05 mg dm 3 is closely related to low mineralisation and lack of pollutants from fertilisers and households the roztoka springs carry the water of the first class quality the biogenic load is low due to the forest environment of the catchment among the nitrogen compounds ammonia appears sporadically and does not exceed 0 15 mg dm 3 nh4 the nitrite like phosphate content in most outflows is indeterminable while nitrate concentrations are on average 6 75 mg dm 3 no3 according to the rozporządzenie ministra środowiska 2016 only the concentration of calcium and in individual cases of sulphates has increased and exceeds the norms of the highest class quality at all the measurement sites calcium concentrations range from 58 79 to 80 76 mg dm 3 ca while only at the sites collecting water from the springs sites 5 and 7 and site 4 are sulphate results 60 mg classifying the water as class ii quality 4 4 vegetation cover the structure of land use of the roztoka springs basin is dominated by forests fig 9 which has a direct impact on the excellent quality of spring waters coniferous forests prevail constituting almost 76 of the catchment area which in the vicinity of the water reservoir turn into a mixed forest arable land occupies 24 of the area under study concerning flora the area of the roztoka springs is located within a well preserved pomeranian acidophilic oak beech forest complex fago quercetum petraeae r tx due to the sandy substrate poor coastal coniferous forest habitats empetro nigri pienetum have also developed with a high frequency of pine locally especially in the surroundings of the artificial reservoir there are plantings and self sown plants on formerly cultivated land the species composition of springs depends mainly on hydrochemical conditions availability of biogenes ph and to a lesser extent hydrophysical features temperature discharge audorff et al 2011 plants occupy the lowerings of damp spring niches from a narrow ecological range kucharski 2007 including habitats deficient in nutrients miettinen et al 2005 these are crenophytes which tolerate the low temperatures of spring water table 4 there are also favourable habitat conditions for vegetation growing on damp rocks and stones epipetric communities as well as dead fallen trees epixylic species fig 10 according to a natural inventory and valorisation mieńko et al 1995 the main community inhabiting the niches is sphagno squarrosi alnetum with an old tree stand among trees the dominant species is the black alder alnus glutinosa typically spring related phytocoenoses are represented mainly by montio cardaminetea group spring and snow patch communities where the phyto indicator is the large bittercress cardamine amara in the shallow slow flowing waters of the roztoka springs lesser water parsnip berula erecta water knotweed persicaria amphibia l delarbre and liverwort marchantia polymorpha l occur frequently in the edge zones of the niches where water is stagnant the following are observed common marsh bedstraw galuim palustre brooklime veronica beccabunga water mint mentha aquatica and marsh marigold caltha palustris greater tussock sedge carex paniculata occurs sporadically this species is associated with the edges where it forms cluster phytocenoses of the caricetum paniculatae group on boggy seepages common skullcap scutellaria galericulata hemp agrimony eupatorium cannabinum and marsh willowherb epilobium palustre are also found here in streams created by natural outflows there are many fallen rotting trees populated by polytrichastrum formosum and herb robert geranium robertianum in similar conditions on fertile moist and humic soil mezereon daphne mezereum is also found locally most of the plants which occur in the area of the roztoka springs are common species with only the red stemmed feathermoss and mezereon needing partial protection the area apart from its natural value shows valuable landscape assets it is an argument of krokowa gmina for including the area as an ecological site under protection the roztoka springs are located within the economic forests of the choczewo forest inspectorate the ongoing use of the forest for timber supplies is currently the greatest threat to the ecosystem of the studied springs it can lead to a drop in the groundwater level changes in the insolation and humidity as shown by studies of scandinavian springs heino et al 2005 lehosmaa et al 2018 changes in habitat characteristics as a result of human activity lead to disruption of the proper functioning of spring ecosystems by impoverishment or change in their floristic and faunistic composition such changes often require long term revitalisation according to lehosmaa et al 2017 one of the methods of proper management of spring areas is the delimitation of wide buffer zones around springs which would be excluded from management the roztoka springs so far have been under little anthropopressure thus it is worth protecting them in advance 5 conclusions the paper presents the results of the research into the roztoka springs concluded so far they should be treated as preliminary to identify the geological environment and determining the hydrogeological conditions in which natural drainage of groundwater occurs the research has allowed the formulation of the following conclusions 1 the roztoka springs belong to the rheocrene type with groundwater outflows 2 the recharge area stretches over 17 3 km2 and encompasses the northern slopes of the żarnowiecka plateau the underground and topographic watersheds do not coincide 3 the system of groundwater circulation is related to the quaternary water bearing layer including two aquifers phreatic and inter moraine 4 the main factor determining the regime of the roztoka springs is infiltration supply especially near groundwater outflows hydrostructural zone iii the renewable resources of this area are further supplied by lateral inflow in the remaining part of the recharge area in total about 7993 m3 d 1 the vast majority of these waters are drained by the roztoka springs about 93 dm s 1 which corresponds to the measurements obtained in the field 5 as indicated by hydrogeological calculations the roztoka springs are supplied by infiltration waters with a short circulation it is evidenced by the renewability of the aquifer system in which water resources are formed it is very high as water exchange time ranges from 20 to 27 years 6 spring waters are of the calcium bicarbonate sulphate type ca2 hco3 so4 2 with a very high utility value water quality class i these are cool waters with low mineralisation 7 the flora of the groundwater outflows has adapted to the environment constant but low water temperature of about 9 c swift current and belongs to the montio cardaminetea group the plant inventory is insufficient however and requires a thorough identification through a phytosociological survey 8 due to the existence of real threats to the proper functioning of the spring ecosystem it is justified to continue research into the biodiversity of the roztoka springs and to protect them declaration of competing interest none 
1051,the occurrence of springs in the european lowlands has not yet been satisfactorily recognised this is because crenological research focuses mainly on mountainous areas where springs are common and rich in water the premise to undertake research on the springs of lowland and postglacial areas in poland is the fact that they allow the assessment of spring abundance in the areas with geological structure and hydrological conditions different than in the mountains which is now an extremely important argument the study presents preliminary results of research on roztoka springs located in the polish lowland in the coastal zone of the south baltic covering the hydrogeological hydrological and hydrobiological issues the results indicate that the springs are fed from the quaternary aquifer in which three hydrostructural zones were distinguished the third zone iii with the largest area and water resources is of crucial importance in the recharge of the springs the yield of the springs is relatively high for young glacial areas and in summer exceeds 70 dm 3 s 1 the roztoka springs have a much larger underground recharge area than it is apparent from the topographic course of the watershed bicarbonates dominate the chemical composition of the springs the primary type of water is calcium bicarbonate sulphate the vegetation corresponds to the difficult environmental conditions and is represented primarily by the montio cardaminetea group the roztoka springs area represents high landscape values this is why it should be recommended for protection in order to preserve its natural condition which is threatened by current forest management keywords spring grounwater recharge drainage spring yield chemical composition vegetation cover 1 introduction the issue of the functioning of natural outflows of groundwaters in young glacial areas is relatively poorly understood due to low yields and often dispersed nature of the outflow these areas are not within the interest of hydrogeologists it also applies to eco and hydrobiological approaches small surface areas settled by specialised organisms with a narrow ecological range cantonati et al 2012 these areas are not very attractive for researchers in recent years however this approach has been changing attention is paid to the particularly valuable role of springs in the landscape their natural biodiversity golubev et al 1999 grzelak 2011 martin brunke 2012 czachorowski et al 2013 their morphogenetic role mazurek 2010 afelt 2012 and as an initiator of the development and recharge of the river network michalczyk 1997 fac beneda jereczek 2009 springs constitute a link connecting underground and surface water circulation therefore research is currently being undertaken to assess their yields chemical composition and physical properties koc glińska lewczuk 2004 mazurek 2008 fac beneda 2009 which can then be used to determine the conditions in which plant and animal organisms develop the study of the outflows of the roztoka springs follows this trend since the springs are a place for the development of specialised fauna and flora they are also a good indicator of changes in the environment under anthropopressure research indicates most common anthropogenic stressors include drainage changes in chemical composition through the inflow of biogenic contaminants and metals disturbance of thermal stability and changes in land use lehosmaa et al 2017 ilmonen et al 2012 laini et al 2012 heino et al 2005 in foreign literature one can find examples of research aimed at capturing threats and assessing the sensitivity of crenological objects barquín scarsbrook 2008 rossi et al 2015 lehosmaa et al 2018 these studies are intended to indicate methods for the protection of springs as valuable nature related ecosystems dependent on water the research aims to delineate recharge area of the roztoka springs based on the determination of the hydrochemical type of their water and identification of the seasonal variability of their yield regime for this reason the paper focuses mainly on the following research aspects identification and dynamics of groundwaters verification of their cycle balance and renewability in the recharge area as well as the determination of the physicochemical properties of spring waters another goal is to present the habitat conditions in the spring niches by recognising their floral diversity thus the scope of the work is to determine the impact of environmental conditions on the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the groundwater outflows of the roztoka springs 2 study area the roztoka springs initiate a small river 9 1 km the białogórska struga which discharges its waters into the piaśnica the białogórska struga drains the eastern part of the słowińskie coastland kondracki 1998 in hydrographic terms it is a pomeranian river adjacent to the catchments of the rivers chełst lubiatówka bezimienna and bychowska struga mapa hydrograficzna 2005 natural drainage occurs via outflows which are mainly concentrated and permanent and initiate the river through two well developed streams fig 1 according to the detailed geological map 1 50 000 choczewo sheet skompski 1982 the niches formed by these outflows are situated on the accumulation terrace related to the deposition of sands at the bottom of the river valley hydrogeological hydrological and hydrobiological conditions as well as physicochemical properties of the roztoka springs have been determined only fragmentarily the first research was conducted in 2008 by the polish geological institute marine geology branch in gdańsk the research defined outflow typology and included basic tests of outflow quality and yield tarnawska 2013 later górniak and pietryczuk 2015 estimated the volume of the outflow from the roztoka springs at 20 35 dm 3 s 1 this two year study was initiated in 2017 at the department of hydrology of the university of gdańsk with the aim of monthly measurements the article presents initial conclusions concerning hydrogeological hydrological and hydrobiological conditions 3 materials and methods the research procedure consisted in gathering material using classical methods field laboratory and desk after appropriate preparation the data were subjected to interpretation and assessment in respect of the aims of the study particular emphasis was given to geological and hydrogeological surveys of the study area based on the analysis of thematic maps skompski 1982 lidzbarski 1999 mapa hydrograficzna polski 2005 due to the shallow depth of water within the transverse outflow profiles the valeport 801 electromagnetic flowmeter with a flat sensor was used the device allows the measurement of water velocity even at a depth of 25 mm it is based on the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction thus ensuring high accuracy of the obtained result measurement error at 0 5 the value of the flow volume was obtained after multiplying the measured water velocity by the cross section of the wet profile and applying the appropriate coefficients of bottom roughness reduction the obtained results should be treated as indicative values the flow was measured at the outflow of the selected individual springs and spring niches as well as in the profiles closing the outflow of the two streams fed from these niches fig 2 thus obtaining total yield values for the roztoka springs altogether three measurement series were performed june july and august 2017 hydrochemical properties were studied in two ways in situ and in laboratory conditions in principle testing and sampling sites corresponded with the hydrometric measurement points fig 2 the following indicators were measured directly in the field water temperature oxygen content electrical conductivity suspension and ph for this purpose a multi parameter probe from the hach company was used measurement error in the range of 0 2 0 5 in the hydrochemical laboratory of the department of hydrology the university of gdańsk the physicochemical properties of water samples collected in the field july and august 2017 were determined by analysing basic macro elements by ion chromatography among them the main anions chlorides cl sulphates so4 2 and bicarbonates hco3 as well as cations potassium k sodium na magnesium mg2 and calcium ca2 were determined the obtained results were used to determine the hydrogeochemical type of outflows according to the alekin altowski szwiec classification macioszczyk 1987 besides contamination of the groundwater outflows by biogenic compounds was determined by estimating the content of phosphorus total nitrogen and its derivatives nitrates and nitrites the obtained results were interpreted using the katalog wybranych fizycznych i chemicznych wskaźników zanieczyszczeń wód podziemnych i metod ich oznaczania 2013 as well as papers by macioszczyk 2012 and macioszczyk dobrzyński 2002 floristic research was based on preliminary and general natural valorisation which consisted in recognising the basic plant species composition zalewska et al 2013 at this stage phytosociological surveys were not done the nomenclature of vascular plants followed mirek et al 2002 and rutkowski 2011 mosses were described according to ochyra et al 2003 while liverworts according to the szweykowski s list 2006 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrogeological conditions the roztoka springs are valley springs leyered and erosive type with groundwater outflows in the surroundings of the spring area sandy formations dominate on the surface to the southwest replaced by glacial till residua on the sand and then by glacial till locally there are also sands of aeolian origin skompski 1982 the surface of the terrain is slightly wavy with dune ridges it rises to the south up to 80 m above sea level in the area of choczewo the presence of groundwater is primarily related to the quaternary water bearing level fig 3 it contains two aquifers phreatic and inter moraine lidzbarski 1999 deeper aquifers are poorly developed and have limited significance in the water cycle the phreatic level is related to sandy glaciofluvial sediments which are covered with fluvial sands of erosion accumulation terraces sierżęga 2006 it encompasses the northern part of the study area near the roztoka springs within the słowińskie coastland and the edge zone of the żarnowiecka plateau the roof of the aquifer is at a depth of about 0 5 m to 15 m the thickness of the water bearing sediments is from 5 to 30 m in lithological terms there is a domination of sands of various granulation predominantly coarse grain sands with gravels the filtration rate is high and exceeds 0 0003 m s 1 and water transmissivity ranges from 9 to 50 m2 h 1 the water table is unconfined and is positioned at an altitude from 17 to 25 m above sea level groundwaters flow north to the baltic sea and are also drained by the roztoka springs the bychowska struga and the drainage system of the coastal depression the phreatic aquifer is separated from the inter moraine one by a complex of glacial tills of the weichselian glaciation despite this the two aquifers remain in an indirect hydraulic relationship and locally are in direct contact via hydrogeological windows the inter moraine aquifer is found throughout the study area in the glaciofluvial sediments from the oder saale and weichselian glaciations mostly forming a single aquifer complex locally it is separated by a relatively thin layer of glacial till forming a two layer system the maximum thickness of the saturated zone is 50 m but generally it is 15 30 m and the average filtration rate is 0 00015 m s 1 the roof of the aquifer is usually situated at a depth of 30 60 m and only in terrain lowerings it is less than 15 m economically the inter moraine aquifer is the source of water supply in the area the water table mostly confined is inclined to the north and stabilised at its highest point about 50 m above sea level in the choczewo area the baltic sea is the main drainage level in some places the groundwater flow is stimulated by local drainage base levels related to the valleys of the bychowska struga and białogórska struga the identification of hydrogeological conditions analysed so far allows for a preliminary determination of the recharge area of the roztoka springs lidzbarski 1999 sierżęga 2006 hydrodynamic conditions determine its boundaries the groundwater flow spreads southwest to a distance of 7 9 km to choczewo the maximum width of the water flow reaches almost 2 9 km the area of the defined recharge area is 17 3 km2 the water table is highest on the southwestern recharge boundary where it stabilises at an altitude of 40 50 m above sea level the hydraulic gradient of the water runoff to the roztoka springs is between 0 3 and 0 4 taking into account the geological structure surface formation lithology the hydrodynamic system and infiltration supply conditions three different hydrostructural zones can be distinguished in the water bearing system fig 4 hydrostructural zone i of 4 1 km2 covers the most distant part of the hydrological cycle where the groundwater flows into the roztoka springs is initiated under two patches of glacial till there is the inter moraine aquifer infiltration of precipitation water into the aquifer system is hampered by the predominant proportion of poorly permeable deposits on the surface there is no phreatic water in this zone hydrostructural zone ii covers an area of about 4 2 km2 and encompasses the central part of the recharge area in this zone both aquifers are well developed and remain in direct hydraulic connection with each other phreatic water is partially isolated on the surface by patches of glacial till between the two aquifers intensive water exchange occurs and where they separate they form two independent groundwater flows towards the roztoka springs hydrostructural zone iii of about 9 km2 surrounds the spring area and extends about 3 5 km upstream of the groundwater flow there are two aquifers there on the surface highly permeable formations prevail sands of river valleys and terraces glaciofluvial sands sands on glacial till and glacial till residua the phreatic level is not isolated which facilitates direct infiltration of precipitation into the aquifer system these waters are entirely drained by the roztoka springs whereas the waters of the inter moraine aquifer flow to the north it is possible that the bychowska struga drains some of it and ascendingly feeds phreatic waters factors affecting the supply of the aquifer and springs include precipitation topography hydraulic properties of the soil hydraulic transmissivities of the unsaturated zone and groundwater conditions trcek zojer 2010 infiltration supply rate is affected by the size of the recharge area a

table 1 the most precipitation approx 65 9 dm s 1 infiltrates down groundwater in the zone iii the lowest infiltration 11 1 dm s 1 occurs in the hydrostructural zone i located farthest from the spring area where poorly permeable deposits limit the supply of groundwater the main factor shaping the water resources of the roztoka springs is direct infiltration supply which amounts to approx 8572 m3 d 1 table 2 it occurs in the entire recharge area although the most significant share belongs to the hydrostructural zone iii located near the source area the groundwater flow is initiated in the zone i in which precipitation infiltrates through a complex of glacial tills to the inter moraine aquifer about 960 m3 d 1 i e 11 of the total filtration stream according to the hydrodynamic conditions it flows towards zone ii where it mixes with the infiltration waters supplying that zone the total value of dynamic resources is 2876 m3 d 1 33 of the total all waters enter zone iii via two aquifers the present recognition of hydrogeological conditions does not allow for an assessment of the share of the aquifers in the lateral flow according to preliminary calculations it is estimated that waters from the inter moraine level constitute about 20 of this flow thus in the phreatic aquifer about 2301 m3 d 1 28 dm3 s 1 flows into zone i however the main factor affecting the resources of this zone is atmospheric precipitation of which about 5692 m3 d 1 infiltrates into the aquifer hence the dynamic phreatic resources in the zone i are 7993 m3 d 1 it can be estimated that the yield of the roztoka springs is about 92 5 dm3 s 1 it is possible however that due to the outflow of some of these waters into the bychowska struga the actual value may be lower explanation to the table 2 a

concentrated table 2 phreatic renewability in this zone may be even higher under 20 years a twice as low rate of water exchange is found in the zone i over 52 years where precipitation infiltration is the only supply source and is additionally limited by the overlying rock formations the renewability of groundwaters supplying the roztoka springs is one of the highest in pomerania and is characteristic of young glacial systems lidzbarski 2015 4 2 hydrographic and hydrological characteristics the roztoka springs originate at an altitude of about 17 5 m surrounded by a pine forest below the outflows in górczyn water is dammed for fish ponds as a result part of the spring area is inundated forming a reservoir the reservoir is used as a water intake site in the past there was a water mill on the springs constructed in the early 17th century the roztoka springs area is composed of a complex of spring niches visible in the terrain as deep hollows each niche is made up of many outflows of a point type spring and non concentrated type sapping seepage bog spring the first type being dominant the niches also contain fragments of watercourses which gather and drain water from the outflows the studied spring area encompasses eleven such niches from which water is concentrated in two streams the northern consisting of five niches and the southern with six besides other spring niches feed the existing reservoir directly the topographic catchment of the roztoka springs reaches far southwest wedging between the settlements of osieki lublewko and słuchowo the outfalls adopted separately for each stream are just before the streams enter the reservoir thus covering the system of spring niches constituting the beginning of the białogórska struga fig 5 the catchment of both streams determined from the dem model covers 6 14 km2 in total fig 5 the drainage area of the southern stream is four times larger 4 96 km2 than the northern one 1 18 km2 the interpretation of the hydro isohypses reveals that the groundwatershed determined for the three hydrostructural zones extends far beyond the boundaries based on topography the difference is as much as 11 2 km2 hence the examined springs show relative stability concentrated form and significant yield as for the conditions of the polish lowland chełmicki et al 2010 the outflow from the roztoka springs is substantial and comparable to the discharge efficiency of the staniszewskie springs or the czarna woda springs fac beneda jereczek 2009 in summer june august 2017 the total outflow from the roztoka springs was on average 85 6 dm3 s 1 which corresponds to the estimates obtained by hydrogeological methods it should be assumed that the volume of actual outflow is slightly higher as in the beds of both streams there are many fallen trees which form ponds and impede the free migration of water moreover the measurements taken during the growing season are generally lower than in the cold season the result shows that the water resources of the catchment deviate significantly from local values the average unit outflow for this area is estimated at 6 8 dm3 s 1 km2 jokiel 2004 while the analysed catchments drain 13 9 dm3 s 1 km2 despite the differences in the topographic catchment area the outflow values from both streams are similar table 3 these preliminary observations indicate that the size of the recharge area influences the yield of both streams inversely this hypothesis however requires confirmation based on further measurement and monitoring of the spring yield most importantly however the exact location of the differences in the surface and groundwatershed is required according to the crenological regionalisation of poland dynowska 1986 amended the roztoka springs are in zone xiii i e the young glacial area of the polish lowland springs in this area show variable yield which generally does not exceed 1 dm3 s 1 the information on the drainage value of a single spring in the area under study is provided by tarnawska 2013 measurements of spring no 1 in 2008 showed an irregular outflow from 3 6 dm3 s 1 to 6 5 dm3 s 1 fig 6 in turn in june august 2017 the yield ranged from 1 1 dm3 s 1 to 5 5 dm3 s 1 as a result this spring to be classified as category v according to the meinzer classification moniewski 2007 the total outflow from single niches i e from springs and non concentrated forms of outflow classifies the roztoka springs to class iv by mainzer the yield ranges from 6 0 28 0 dm3 s 1 4 3 physicochemical features the waters of the roztoka springs show small variations in chemical composition they are fresh waters with the mineralisation of 292 385 mg dm 3 which matches the hydrogeochemical background it is confirmed by measurements of electrical conductivity of 191 331μs cm 1 they are cool waters the temperature at the outflow points is close to the mean annual air temperature in the białogóra region it is on average 9 2 c and varies according to the season and the degree of shading of the springs from 6 1 c to 12 0 c tarnawska 2013 because of poor solubility and atmospheric origin the oxygen content in groundwater is low and does not exceed 10 mg dm 3 o2 dobrzyński 2012 even in shallow waters direct field measurements indicate a large oxygen deficit in the springs the oxygen content of individual outflows is 4 5 mg dm 3 o2 which corresponds to about 40 oxygenation oxygenation increase is observed further from the outflow points the oxygenation of the streams before reaching the reservoir after covering about 250 m reaches 84 the composition of the examined springs is characteristic for quaternary levels of the young glacial lake districts of northern poland fig 7 bicarbonates are the dominating component in the outflows according to kozerski 2007 groundwaters at these levels are distinguished by their dual ion chemical composition hco3 ca according to the alekin hydrochemical classification 1956 the springs belong to the bicarbonate class calcium group water type iii due to the ionic structure ccaiii the structure has the following sequence hco3 64 3 so4 2 23 3 ca2 81 1 mg2 12 2 or cl 12 4 na 6 2 according to the altowski szwiec classification macioszczyk 1987 the waters of the roztoka springs reveal two and more often three ionic hydrochemical types calcium bicarbonate sulphate ca2 hco3 so4 2 with the sulphate content varying in particular outflows from 16 to 27 although concentrations rarely exceed 60 mg so4 dm3 the variability of the sulphate ion concentrations is related to the formation and subsequent washing out of organic and inorganic acids as a result of decomposition of organic matter in soils over time skowrońska filipek 2008 they can also be derived by leaching from material in the żarnowiecka plateau which is the area of recharge of the analysed springs magnesium in concentrations of 4 27 8 80 mg dm 3 indicates that the groundwater environment within the recharge zone of the roztoka springs is deficient in this component fig 8 it is a characteristic feature for pleistocene accumulation formations macioszczyk 1987 the analysed water is also deficient in potassium the potassium content 0 39 1 05 mg dm 3 is closely related to low mineralisation and lack of pollutants from fertilisers and households the roztoka springs carry the water of the first class quality the biogenic load is low due to the forest environment of the catchment among the nitrogen compounds ammonia appears sporadically and does not exceed 0 15 mg dm 3 nh4 the nitrite like phosphate content in most outflows is indeterminable while nitrate concentrations are on average 6 75 mg dm 3 no3 according to the rozporządzenie ministra środowiska 2016 only the concentration of calcium and in individual cases of sulphates has increased and exceeds the norms of the highest class quality at all the measurement sites calcium concentrations range from 58 79 to 80 76 mg dm 3 ca while only at the sites collecting water from the springs sites 5 and 7 and site 4 are sulphate results 60 mg classifying the water as class ii quality 4 4 vegetation cover the structure of land use of the roztoka springs basin is dominated by forests fig 9 which has a direct impact on the excellent quality of spring waters coniferous forests prevail constituting almost 76 of the catchment area which in the vicinity of the water reservoir turn into a mixed forest arable land occupies 24 of the area under study concerning flora the area of the roztoka springs is located within a well preserved pomeranian acidophilic oak beech forest complex fago quercetum petraeae r tx due to the sandy substrate poor coastal coniferous forest habitats empetro nigri pienetum have also developed with a high frequency of pine locally especially in the surroundings of the artificial reservoir there are plantings and self sown plants on formerly cultivated land the species composition of springs depends mainly on hydrochemical conditions availability of biogenes ph and to a lesser extent hydrophysical features temperature discharge audorff et al 2011 plants occupy the lowerings of damp spring niches from a narrow ecological range kucharski 2007 including habitats deficient in nutrients miettinen et al 2005 these are crenophytes which tolerate the low temperatures of spring water table 4 there are also favourable habitat conditions for vegetation growing on damp rocks and stones epipetric communities as well as dead fallen trees epixylic species fig 10 according to a natural inventory and valorisation mieńko et al 1995 the main community inhabiting the niches is sphagno squarrosi alnetum with an old tree stand among trees the dominant species is the black alder alnus glutinosa typically spring related phytocoenoses are represented mainly by montio cardaminetea group spring and snow patch communities where the phyto indicator is the large bittercress cardamine amara in the shallow slow flowing waters of the roztoka springs lesser water parsnip berula erecta water knotweed persicaria amphibia l delarbre and liverwort marchantia polymorpha l occur frequently in the edge zones of the niches where water is stagnant the following are observed common marsh bedstraw galuim palustre brooklime veronica beccabunga water mint mentha aquatica and marsh marigold caltha palustris greater tussock sedge carex paniculata occurs sporadically this species is associated with the edges where it forms cluster phytocenoses of the caricetum paniculatae group on boggy seepages common skullcap scutellaria galericulata hemp agrimony eupatorium cannabinum and marsh willowherb epilobium palustre are also found here in streams created by natural outflows there are many fallen rotting trees populated by polytrichastrum formosum and herb robert geranium robertianum in similar conditions on fertile moist and humic soil mezereon daphne mezereum is also found locally most of the plants which occur in the area of the roztoka springs are common species with only the red stemmed feathermoss and mezereon needing partial protection the area apart from its natural value shows valuable landscape assets it is an argument of krokowa gmina for including the area as an ecological site under protection the roztoka springs are located within the economic forests of the choczewo forest inspectorate the ongoing use of the forest for timber supplies is currently the greatest threat to the ecosystem of the studied springs it can lead to a drop in the groundwater level changes in the insolation and humidity as shown by studies of scandinavian springs heino et al 2005 lehosmaa et al 2018 changes in habitat characteristics as a result of human activity lead to disruption of the proper functioning of spring ecosystems by impoverishment or change in their floristic and faunistic composition such changes often require long term revitalisation according to lehosmaa et al 2017 one of the methods of proper management of spring areas is the delimitation of wide buffer zones around springs which would be excluded from management the roztoka springs so far have been under little anthropopressure thus it is worth protecting them in advance 5 conclusions the paper presents the results of the research into the roztoka springs concluded so far they should be treated as preliminary to identify the geological environment and determining the hydrogeological conditions in which natural drainage of groundwater occurs the research has allowed the formulation of the following conclusions 1 the roztoka springs belong to the rheocrene type with groundwater outflows 2 the recharge area stretches over 17 3 km2 and encompasses the northern slopes of the żarnowiecka plateau the underground and topographic watersheds do not coincide 3 the system of groundwater circulation is related to the quaternary water bearing layer including two aquifers phreatic and inter moraine 4 the main factor determining the regime of the roztoka springs is infiltration supply especially near groundwater outflows hydrostructural zone iii the renewable resources of this area are further supplied by lateral inflow in the remaining part of the recharge area in total about 7993 m3 d 1 the vast majority of these waters are drained by the roztoka springs about 93 dm s 1 which corresponds to the measurements obtained in the field 5 as indicated by hydrogeological calculations the roztoka springs are supplied by infiltration waters with a short circulation it is evidenced by the renewability of the aquifer system in which water resources are formed it is very high as water exchange time ranges from 20 to 27 years 6 spring waters are of the calcium bicarbonate sulphate type ca2 hco3 so4 2 with a very high utility value water quality class i these are cool waters with low mineralisation 7 the flora of the groundwater outflows has adapted to the environment constant but low water temperature of about 9 c swift current and belongs to the montio cardaminetea group the plant inventory is insufficient however and requires a thorough identification through a phytosociological survey 8 due to the existence of real threats to the proper functioning of the spring ecosystem it is justified to continue research into the biodiversity of the roztoka springs and to protect them declaration of competing interest none

measurements of spring discharge were made in april 2009 by an indirect method measuring the parameters of water flow velocity v and the cross sectional area of the watercourse channel f to measure the water speed a miniature hydrometric mill type hega 1 was used mounted on a pipe and equipped with a ø 50 mm impeller this apparatus is used for measuring water speed in small watercourses at low water levels in the speed range up to 2 00 m3 s diatoms were sampled once on 21st august 2010 from seven outflows no 1 3 5 6 11 12 13 fig 1 the samples were collected separately from the following microhabitats epilithon stones periphyton bryophyte and epipelon mud the epilithon was sampled by brushing the upper surface of submerged stones the periphyton by squeezing submerged plants and the epipelon by sampling by syringe the upper layer of mud or sediments samples were processed using hot peroxide h2o2 oxidation krammer and lange bertalot 1986 and permanent slides were made using

mineral composition of reservoir rocks and spring niche sediments the studied springs are supplied mainly by limestone water bearing formations with the exception of centuria spring which discharges sandy water bearing formations table 1 the mineral composition of the upper jurassic limestone does not vary a lot the mineral pattern of centuria spring is dominated by concentration of low magnesium calcite with the addition of quartz clay minerals feldspars and iron compounds the composition of the spring niche sediments shows great variability in addition to calcite sandy gravel quartz is the dominant component table 1 accompanying clay minerals feldspars dolomite iron compounds may be associated with both carbonate rocks associated with the weathering processes and lithological development of cenozoic rocks różkowski et al 2009 4 3 hydrogeology geomorphology and ecohydrology due to the location of the recharge area and the nature of the outflow the studied springs are mainly descending ascending table 1 few ascending descending springs like bielny młyn form large spring niches according to the geomorphological criterion subslope springs nine springs are the most common the three slope springs zygmunta spod brzozy jaworznik and the riverbed spring spod brzozy riverbed spring were much more rare table 1 at the same time the anthropogenic transformations through artificial spring swelling caused the increase of a number of spring niches including rozlewisko błękitne źródła krztyni and bielny młyn the springs discharge was estimated on the background of water

subject to the least impact of anthropogenic changes this spring is located in a forested area in a significant depression and has an extensive spring niche the concentrations of ca 2 na cl and no3 are the highest in the water of the pióro spring which is anthropogenically transformed the pióro spring is exposed to pollution flowing into it from predominantly agricultural type of fields the differences between these springs also results from the draining of different aquifers the centuria spring is of descending porous character of hco3 so4 ca hydrochemical type and the pióro spring is

were gammarus with individual trichoptera coleoptera baetidae dugesia gonocephala duges bythinella austriaca frauenfeld eiseniella tetraedra savigny according to dumnicka et al 2007 who also studied the ccu springs the number of species on coarse ground was higher both species which belong to gammaridae gammarus fossarum and the bythinellinae bythinella austriaca were dominant on coarse and fine grained surfaces dumnicka et al 2007 in our study gammarus fossarum was found in all the springs bythinella austriaca was found in objects of various types of ground and is especially common in springs jaworznik krztynia pilica piaski bielny młyn pióro and łączki kobylańskie bottom sediments are also among factors influencing biodiversity in spring environment in the case of springs with a lack of sediment or mud and sand subsoil the diversity and number of species was lower the spring spod brzozy spod brzozy riverbed spring and the centuria in other cases the values were much higher 4 6 factors influencing the biodiversity in spring environment according to the regulation of the minister of the environment of december 21 2015 dz u 2016 item 85 on the criteria and method of assessment of the status of groundwater bodies gwb 2020 implementing directives 2000 60 ec and 2006 118 ec of the european parliament and of the council the assayed spring waters are generally of a high quality the concentrations of the majority of parameters tested in spring water are on the scale of classes i and ii and correspond to water quality classes i very good quality water and ii good quality water therefore they correspond to good chemical status of groundwater table 2 the presence of crenobiontic species of flora and fauna in the studied springs is related to constantly low water temperature and the natural state of the environment the springs in centuria zygmunta and błękitne źródła have the least anthropogenically changed environment table 6 summarizes spring environmental variability and the presence of crenobiontic species of flora and fauna the best results were estimated for the springs centuria and zygmunta 12 pt the large wet outflow niche of centuria spring is overgrown with herbaceous vegetation making it very favorable for the occurrence of various organisms from the diatom achnanthidium polonicum van de vijver et al wojtal et al 2011 to a rare reintroduced vascular plant cochlearia polonica cieślak et al 2010 moreover in the centuria spring a rare flatworm was found crenobia alpina the weakest value of environmental variability was estimated for riverbed spring spod brzozy 5 pt the periodic nature of the spod brzozy spring 6pt is not conducive to environmental stability and limits their biodiversity the springs pióro and łączki kobylańskie were also anthropogenically transformed in the jaworznik outflow which also received a low score 7 pt a high number of benthic fauna was found 8 taxonomic groups along with species rarely found in ccu springs such as a snail ancylus fluviatilis o f müller 5 conclusions among the factors controlling the biodiversity in the 13 springs are their niche morphology mineralogically and petrographically diversified bottom sediment discharge and flow velocity relatively periodic nature spring swelling vulnerability and sustainability of aquifers other factors which influence the biodiversity are physical including constant thermal conditions and chemical water parameters related to rock reservoirs carbonate silicate and human economic activity and anthropopressure delivery of biogenic compounds and water fertilisation flora is represented by the following indicators diatoms achnanthidium pyrenaicum planothidium reichardtii and nitzschia fonticola bryophytes cratoneuron filicinum pallustriella commutata and vascular plants cardamine amara cochlearia polonica the fauna indicators are flatworms crenobia alpina snails bythinella austriaca caddisflies including apatania sp potamophylax nigricornis watermites hydracarina and gammarus fossarum crustacea high nitrate concentrations have been observed in several springs of this upland for decades and had a strong effect on the structure of the diatom assemblages studied changes in these assemblages were associated mostly with nutrient concentration which was higher in spring in a village as reflected in the spi index the increased na cl and so4 2 concentrations are anthropogenic in nature chełmicki et al 2001 attributable to animal husbandry agriculture and the absence of sewage treatment systems in villages the analyses showed that the species presence is controlled by both natural and anthropogenic factors in the springs the most important factors shaping species distribution were 1 water mineralisation expressed by electrical conductivity 2 water temperature 3 oxygen content 4 eh potential and 5 concentrations of so4 2 sio2 no3 po4 3 and ca 2 ions the large number of springs in ccu supports regional

1052,the thirteen springs of cracow częstochowa upland were analized in respected of their geological structure hydrogeology physical and chemical water conditions and groundwater pollution the study of the causes and consequences of land use and other human induced changes was examined by the estimation of biodiversity and environmental requirements of individual species the studied biotic variables in spring habitats referred to diatoms algae mosses vascular flora and benthic fauna the species presence was controlled by both natural and anthropogenic factors the results showed that the heterogeneity of diatoms mosses and vascular flora of springs are mainly constrained by physical and chemical water parameters among other factors reflecting species requirements including benthic fauna in the springs were the mineralogical diversification of bottom sediment discharge and flow velocity physical and chemical water parameters and anthropopressure the most natural springs were

water was carried out seasonally in eight series in the period of november 2008 january 2011 field studies included measurements of air and water temperatures electrical conductivity ph eh and dissolved oxygen concentration in water using elmetron and wtw instrumentation the chemical analyses of the tested waters were performed in the scientific and educational laboratory of the geographical department of the faculty of earth sciences university of silesia the concentration of macrocomponents in water hco3 cl so4 2 and no3 po4 3 sio2 was determined with the use of a 850 professional chromatograph of metrohn table 2 to explain variability of physical and chemical characteristic in the studied springs the data were analyzed by principal correspondence analysis pca using correlation matrix canoco v4 5 software ter braak and šmilauer 2002 the analyses were performed using the whole data set fig 2 the analysed values were log transformed natural logarithm measurements of spring discharge were made in april 2009 by an indirect method measuring the parameters of water flow velocity v and the cross sectional area of the watercourse channel f to measure the water speed a miniature hydrometric mill type hega 1 was used mounted on a pipe and equipped with a ø 50 mm impeller this apparatus is used for measuring water speed in small watercourses at low water levels in the speed range up to 2 00 m3 s diatoms were sampled once on 21st august 2010 from seven outflows no 1 3 5 6 11 12 13 fig 1 the samples were collected separately from the following microhabitats epilithon stones periphyton bryophyte and epipelon mud the epilithon was sampled by brushing the upper surface of submerged stones the periphyton by squeezing submerged plants and the epipelon by sampling by syringe the upper layer of mud or sediments samples were processed using hot peroxide h2o2 oxidation krammer and lange bertalot 1986 and permanent slides were made using naphraxr identification of diatoms was based on the publications by krammer and lange bertalot 1986 1988 1991 a 1991 b bąk et al 2012 lowe et al 2014 and wetzel et al 2015 the relative abundance of particular taxa and the species richness of the assemblages were estimated on the basis of at least 300 diatom valves in every permanent slide the estimation of an environment state and the water quality were based on epilithon samples tables 3 and 5 to examine differences between diatom assemblages we compared the species richness and the following indices for assessing water quality were computed with omnidia 4 1 software h shannon wiener diversity index and spi specific pollution sensitivity index the mosses and vascular flora study was carried out in the period of july august 2009

partial shading and in krztyni spring where there are species preferring full insolation these results confirm outputs of phytoindication study made in ojcowski national park różkowski et al 2011 4 2 mineral composition of reservoir rocks and spring niche sediments the studied springs are supplied mainly by limestone water bearing formations with the exception of centuria spring which discharges sandy water bearing formations table 1 the mineral composition of the upper jurassic limestone does not vary a lot the mineral pattern of centuria spring is dominated by concentration of low magnesium calcite with the addition of quartz clay minerals feldspars and iron compounds the composition of the spring niche sediments shows great variability in addition to calcite sandy gravel quartz is the dominant component table 1 accompanying clay minerals feldspars dolomite iron compounds may be associated with both carbonate rocks associated with the weathering processes and lithological development of cenozoic rocks różkowski et al 2009 4 3 hydrogeology geomorphology and ecohydrology due to the location of the recharge area and the nature of the outflow the studied springs are mainly descending ascending table 1 few ascending descending springs like bielny młyn form large spring niches according to the geomorphological criterion subslope springs nine springs are the most common the three slope springs zygmunta spod brzozy jaworznik and the riverbed spring spod brzozy riverbed spring were much more rare table 1 at the same time the anthropogenic transformations through artificial spring swelling caused the increase of a number of spring niches including rozlewisko błękitne źródła krztyni and bielny młyn the springs discharge was estimated on the background of water bearing capacity of groundwater reservoir the research carried out in april 2009 documented the varied discharge of the springs from 8 l s 1 in łączki kobylańskie 13 to 135 l s 1 in bielny młyn spring

subject to the least impact of anthropogenic changes this spring is located in a forested area in a significant depression and has an extensive spring niche the concentrations of ca 2 na cl and no3 are the highest in the water of the pióro spring which is anthropogenically transformed the pióro spring is exposed to pollution flowing into it from predominantly agricultural type of fields the differences between these springs also results from the draining of different aquifers the centuria spring is of descending porous character of hco3 so4 ca hydrochemical type and the pióro spring is

were gammarus with individual trichoptera coleoptera baetidae dugesia gonocephala duges bythinella austriaca frauenfeld eiseniella tetraedra savigny according to dumnicka et al 2007 who also studied the ccu springs the number of species on coarse ground was higher both species which belong to gammaridae gammarus fossarum and the bythinellinae bythinella austriaca were dominant on coarse and fine grained surfaces dumnicka et al 2007 in our study gammarus fossarum was found in all the springs bythinella austriaca was found in objects of various types of ground and is especially common in springs jaworznik krztynia pilica piaski bielny młyn pióro and łączki kobylańskie bottom sediments are also among factors influencing biodiversity in spring environment in the case of springs with a lack of sediment or mud and sand subsoil the diversity and number of species was lower the spring spod brzozy spod brzozy riverbed spring and the centuria in other cases the values were much higher 4 6 factors influencing the biodiversity in spring environment according to the regulation of the minister of the environment of december 21 2015 dz u 2016 item 85 on the criteria and method of assessment of the status of groundwater bodies gwb 2020 implementing directives 2000 60 ec and 2006 118 ec of the european parliament and of the council the assayed spring waters are generally of a high quality the concentrations of the majority of parameters tested in spring water are on the scale of classes i and ii and correspond to water quality classes i very good quality water and ii good quality water therefore they correspond to good chemical status of groundwater table 2 the presence of crenobiontic species of flora and fauna in the studied springs is related to constantly low water temperature and the natural state of the environment the springs in centuria zygmunta and błękitne źródła have the least anthropogenically changed environment table 6 summarizes spring environmental variability and the presence of crenobiontic species of flora and fauna the best results were estimated for the springs centuria and zygmunta 12 pt the large wet outflow niche of centuria spring is overgrown with herbaceous vegetation making it very favorable for the occurrence of various organisms from the diatom achnanthidium polonicum van de vijver et al wojtal et al 2011 to a rare reintroduced vascular plant cochlearia polonica cieślak et al 2010 moreover in the centuria spring a rare flatworm was found crenobia alpina the weakest value of environmental variability was estimated for riverbed spring spod brzozy 5 pt the periodic nature of the spod brzozy spring 6pt is not conducive to environmental stability and limits their biodiversity the springs pióro and łączki kobylańskie were also anthropogenically transformed in the jaworznik outflow which also received a low score 7 pt a high number of benthic fauna was found 8 taxonomic groups along with species rarely found in ccu springs such as a snail ancylus fluviatilis o f müller 5 conclusions among the factors controlling the biodiversity in the 13 springs are their niche morphology mineralogically and petrographically diversified bottom sediment discharge and flow velocity relatively periodic nature spring swelling vulnerability and sustainability of aquifers other factors which influence the biodiversity are physical including constant thermal conditions and chemical water parameters related to rock reservoirs carbonate silicate and human economic activity and anthropopressure delivery of biogenic compounds and water fertilisation flora is represented by the following indicators diatoms achnanthidium pyrenaicum planothidium reichardtii and nitzschia fonticola bryophytes cratoneuron filicinum pallustriella commutata and vascular plants cardamine amara cochlearia polonica the fauna indicators are flatworms crenobia alpina snails bythinella austriaca caddisflies including apatania sp potamophylax nigricornis watermites hydracarina and gammarus fossarum crustacea high nitrate concentrations have been observed in several springs of this upland for decades and had a strong effect on the structure of the diatom assemblages studied changes in these assemblages were associated mostly with nutrient concentration which was higher in spring in a village as reflected in the spi index the increased na cl and so4 2 concentrations are anthropogenic in nature chełmicki et al 2001 attributable to animal husbandry agriculture and the absence of sewage treatment systems in villages the analyses showed that the species presence is controlled by both natural and anthropogenic factors in the springs the most important factors shaping species distribution were 1 water mineralisation expressed by electrical conductivity 2 water temperature 3 oxygen content 4 eh potential and 5 concentrations of so4 2 sio2 no3 po4 3 and ca 2 ions the large number of springs in ccu supports regional

1053,groundwater outflows are an important feature of water circulation in nature which is why they are extremely important in the natural environment the main purpose of the study was to identify groundwater outflows across the fringe zone of lake wieprznickie as well as their hydrochemical characterization studies were conducted four times per year in the period from november 2010 to october 2013 for three hydrologic years fieldwork has shown the presence of 9 groundwater outflows northwest of the studied lake the elevation of the outflows ranged from 150 to 155 meters the outflows were found to be hillslope outflows that yield water continuously throughout the study period the total mean discharge for all 9 outflows was 0 73 dm3 s 1 which can be regarded as weak and average the obtained results indicate that groundwater outflows to the lake wieprznickie provide 4 of the lake s volume most outflows created clusters of two or three outflows that formed the spring physical conditions such as specific conductivity and water temperature were subject to significant seasonal changes while large stabilization was observed at individual measuring points total mineral content ranged from 320 to 610 mg dm 3 calcium was the main cation identified in the study and bicarbonate was the main anion which is characteristic of shallow groundwater keywords groundwater outflows springs hillslope outflows post glacial areas fringe zone lake wieprznickie 1 introduction groundwater outflows are naturally occurring sites producing concentrated or areal water flow to the land surface which is defined in the literature not only as process but also as a kind of water body daniel 1976 johansson 1987 outflows represent an important element of the water balance in nature by serving as a link between groundwater and surface water harvey et al 2000 in effect outflows are a main constituent of the hydrologic cycle jia et al 2015 and their occurrence does closely follow local geology relief and climate conditions the number of outflows tends to increase when the following conditions are present variable relief presence of alternating permeable and poorly permeable layers relatively high atmospheric precipitation outflows are an important component of the landscape shaping relevant for human functioning and also a very sensitive point in the environment reacting to processes caused naturally or anthropogenically their natural economic and cultural significance calls for the need to protect them outflows are important in shaping the specific habitat conditions for the functioning and development of wetland fauna martin and brunke 2012 for humans groundwater outflows have always been a key source of clean drinking water while some have become sites of worship knutsson 2014 groundwater outflows springs can be natural related to geological climatic and hydrological conditions hartmann et al 2014 or anthropogenic related to e g drainage from subsurface excavations powell et al 2015 they can be classified according to many indicators among others on hydrology active vs inactive fensham et al 2016 discharge rate netopil 1971 or recession

of the most diverse and unique ecosystems on earth but their stewardship has been hindered by the lack of knowledge of the distribution and density of springs across landscapes springs may function as keystone ecosystems small patches of habitat that play disproportionally large roles in landscape ecology decide also on water circulation in the catchment hydrological functions of the catchment whether they are an economic element supply of drinking water junghans et al 2016 it is important to maintain a good quality status of groundwater which can be a source of pollution for surface waters eg lakes many studies have addressed the effects of inflow of groundwater on the quality of surface water bodies kenoyer and anderson 1989 conant 2004 hayashi and rosenberry 2002 rautio and korkka niemi 2011 the physical territory of poland has been studied quite extensively in terms of hydrography the mainstream view in the 20th century was that northern poland does not possess a large number of groundwater outflows unlike other regions of poland dynowska 1986 only a small number of publications are available on this subject matter including those of błaszkowski 1969 nowakowski 1977 and maksymiuk 1977 this short list of previous research makes it difficult to present a comprehensive picture of the distribution of outflows in this region as well as their hydrologic characteristics however the current study has shown that this common view is not accurate close to 70 groundwater outflows were identified near the town of lębork on lake lubowidzkie this study area was located in the ancient valley of the reda and łeba rivers fac beneda and hryniszak 2006 this finding was then confirmed by research work by górniak and pietryczuk 2015 a total of 2 611 outflows were also noted by choiński and ptak 2009 in the odra river drainage basin choiński 2009 also was able to show the presence of 336 outflows on 94 sheets of hydrographic maps of catchments in the baltic coastal area and the bay of szczecin most of the outflows were permanent outflows 211 62 8 some were leaks 58 17 3 intermittent outflows accounted for 15 8 53 while meadow outflows accounted for 2 4 8 smerdon et al 2005 for a shallow lake in canada found that it is fed by 16 fixed sources located in its edge zone cieśliński and leśniowski 2013 utilized hydrographic maps of poland scale 1 50 000 to show the presence of 361 groundwater outflows in pomorskie province in the north of poland when published field data were included the total reached 734 it is consequently sensible to assert that the number of groundwater outflows noted across post glacial areas in the north of poland is quite large post glacial areas belong to regions with relatively good water circulation facilitated by the drainage of both the first and second water table the occurrence of groundwater outflows across post glacial areas is caused by the crossing of water tables along zones of contact in river channels and valleys drwal and trapp 1992 natural groundwater outflows in young glacial areas have a different forms ranging from single springs to leaks and meadow springs and entire clusters of springs or areal springs springs also occur at the bottom of the lake cieśliński et al 2016 leaks should be understood as unconcentrated outflows of groundwater in exposed aquifers periodically giving an outflow in turn point and meadow outflows are natural groundwater outflows active periodically outflows are an element of the hydrographic network and reflect local and regional changes in groundwater circulation patterns changes in the circulation pattern yield changes in outflow discharge and may even lead to a decline of an outflow mazurek 2006 the main purpose of the work is to determine the problem of water circulation in the post glacial catchment of a shallow lake and the role of groundwater supply in the form of springs or direct inflow to the lake fig 1 an additional goal was to determine the potential impact of the outflows on the functioning of the lake furthermore an additional purpose of the work is to determine the human impact on the quality of waters of the analyzed outflows in terms of ecohydrology this is very important that the obtained results can be used to improve water quality and design changes in the water management of the studied region which in turn will improve the state of the natural environment 2 study area human activity can be a potential source of pollution for the studied lake and affect landscape biogeochemistry as a result it is important to determine the volume of outflows in relation to the volume of the lake and to identify groundwater outflows in the fringe zone of lake wieprznickie fig 1 and determine their discharge and water quality this process is associated with the determination of land relief and local geology in the study area the study area is part of the peri baltic syneclise featuring mostly paleozoic formations up to 4 000 meters thick these include clastic and carbonate rocks such as sandstone siltstone silty shale limestone and marl meltwaters associated with the scandinavian ice sheet had played an important role in shaping the relief of the study area the sheet s northward recession caused gradual washing down of sandstone levels by meltwater which are separated from one another via distinct edges up to more than 20 meters in height augustowski and sylwestrzak 1979 the surface geology of the studied area is formed mostly by pleistocene deposits associated with the pomeranian phase of the main stadial of the last glaciation predominant here are sediments of hydrocarbon accumulation developed as a series of sands with gravels the thickness of which ranges from several meters to more than a dozen meters in addition holocene deposits found in local depressions river valleys and gully type landforms consist mostly of silts peats and limestone sands and river silts staszek 2006 the relief of the study area is highly variable with numerous hills sitting atop a wavelike and hilly moraine as well as concave landforms in the form of deeply cut lake gutters augustowski and sylwestrzak 1979 one of these gutters is home to lake wieprznickie fig 2 denivelations of the study area are about 30 meters the elevation ranges from 175 meters above sea level at the edge of lake wieprznickie to 145 meters south of the studied lake fig 2 most of the soils surrounding lake wieprznickie are medium permeability soils fig 3 a poorly permeable area can be found by the northwestern edge of the lake the geological structure is dominated by gravelly sands to the north of the lake are additional diamicton while along the inflow and outflow occurs peat fig 4 the dominant values of hydroisobat are 1 5 and 10 m fig 4 in the study area there is a predominance of oceanic influences with the weakening influence of the baltic sea this results in small annual temperature amplitudes of around 20 c the variability of precipitation depends on the terrain exposure relative to the predominant direction of western circulation average precipitation in poland is about 600 mm therefore if maximum precipitation in the region is 900 it exceeds the mean national precipitation by 300 mm the highest rainfall is recorded in june and july and the lowest from february to april fig 5 lake wieprznickie is located in the rakownica river catchment fig 1 the studied river joins the wda river via the trzebiocha river the lake is connected via a narrow channel with lake garczyn lake wieprznickie is not deep mean depth 2 2 m maximum 3 5 m but does retain certain characteristics of a gutter type lake steep shoreline elongated shape the channel lake is formed by a series of three lakes lake wieprznickie lake garczyn lake graniczne the surface area of the studied lake is 26 0 ha its volume is 605 000 m3 the catchment of the lake is 31 3 km2 the surface of the lake s water stands at 149 3 meters above sea level the main tributary feeding the lake is the rakownica river discharge in the rakownica measured at the łubiana site about 7 km downstream from lake wieprznickie on august 2 2006 was 0 57 m3 s 1 staszek 2006 the northern shore of the lake is surrounded by wetlands due to the fact that the lake is shallow max 3 5 m it does not have a bathymetric plan nor morphometric card that s why authors decided to prepare cross section through the deepest part of the lake based on dem and information about the location of the deepest point fig 6 the study area is located at the pleistocene water table elevation which may be divided into two distinct soil horizons upper sander horizon and lower inter moraine horizon the sander horizon most often occurs at depths between 15 and 50 meters while the inter moraine horizon occurs at depths between 50 and 100 meters the second horizon features a water table under pressure groundwater is found here at depths between 1 and 2 meters groundwater levels were measured at the kartuzy site and were characterized by the occurrence of one maximum per spring snowmelt season april and one minimum in september or october fluctuations in the water level reached 8 5 meters staszek 2006 groundwater flows in the study area are directed towards local hydrographic axes lake wieprznickie groundwater can be found merely one meter below the surface at the edge of the lake and two meters below the surface across the catchment this favors the formation of groundwater outflows which occur in places where the soil is poorly permeable generally groundwater flows from north west to south east the flow undergoes local modifications in the vicinity of river valleys and gutters where water drains the pleistocene aquifer has a capacity of usually around 30 to 50 70 m3 h 1 3 methods the main research effort consisted of hydrographic surveys designed to note all groundwater outflows as well as measure discharge using the volumetric method and thompson s triangular valve fieldwork also included measurement of physical spring water properties such as water temperature specific conductivity and ph these data were collected using a multi parameter device manufactured by wtw i350 in addition water samples were collected for laboratory analysis including determination of the concentration of main cations and anions chlorides sulphates sodium potassium calcium magnesium nitrates phosphates ammonia using a dionex 1100 chromatograph and a merck nova 400 spectrophotometer total nitrogen total phosphorus the results of the analyzes performed on the chromatograph were processed by the peaknet 6 data collection system chromeleon 6 and were exported to microsoft office excel a colorimetric technique was used to analyse total nitrogen ntot and total phosphorus ptot the determination of total nitrogen was based on the transformation of organic and inorganic compounds to nitrates using the koroleff method the test sample is treated with an oxidizing agent while the sample is heated the resulting nitrates in a sulfuric and phosphoric acid environment react with 2 6 dimethylphenol dmf forming orange 4 nitro 2 6 dimethylphenol which is determined photometrically for determining the concentration of total phosphorus applied colorimetric method with ammonium molybdate and tin chloride ii as a reducing agent based on measured concentrations of total nitrogen and total phosphorus and measured discharges instantaneous nutrient loads were calculated according to the formula l q c where l total nitrogen or total phosphorus loads q measured discharge m3 s 1 c concentrations of total nitrogen or total phosphorus mg dm 3 the principle of determination is based on the formation in an acidic solution phosphomolybdic acid h7 p moo2 o4 6 with a yellow color which is reduced under the influence of tin chloride ii to form a compound of intense blue color the intensity of the color is proportional to the content of phosphates the titration method was used to analyze the content of bicarbonates which consisted of regular addition of the reagent the samples were titrated with a standard solution of hydrochloric acid with a concentration of 0 1 mol dm 3 in the presence of methyl orange as a reaction indicator finally fieldwork was supplemented with a review of main literature sources as well as calculations on the field results obtained the research was conducted between november 2010 and october 2013 or for three hydrologic years four measurements were conducted per year october february april july in total 12 hydrological measurements and 12 hydrochemical measurements were performed 4 results and discussion field survey revealed the presence of 9 groundwater outflows distributed fairly evenly across the area west of the studied lake fig 7 no other groundwater outflows around the lake were found during the entire measurement period the surface geological structure where groundwater outflows are found is not complicated it is mostly formed by pleistocene deposits genetically related with the pomeranian phase of the main stage of the last glaciation sediments of glacial accumulation which are moderately permeable predominate in the studied area the thickness of these deposits ranges from several to even several dozen meters marks et al 2016 these outflows are arranged in groups of 2 or 3 and are found close to one another creating spring fens eight outflows were unconcentrated leaks and one with a point character number 6 spring in addition they serve as the starting point of headwater areas as shown by stach et al 2003 it may be argued that these groups of outflows serve as connectors between slope systems and channel systems as noted by jones 1987 in this sense they are areal springs the outflows in this study are located at elevations ranging from 150 to 155 meters table 1 the best way to classify them is under slope type outflows no 3 and no 8 are located at the highest elevations while outflow no 9 is located at the lowest elevation by the lake s shoreline eight of the studied outflows were not concentrated outflows leaks and one outflow was a point outflow or spring no 6 in the hydrologic years 2011 2013 table 1 mean discharge for the studied outflows ranged from 0 011 dm3 s 1 site no 4 to 0 221 dm3 s 1 site no 8 extreme values ranged from less than 0 01 to 0 39 dm3 s 1 according to the mainzer discharge scale the studied outflows may be classified as medium or low discharge type generally the discharge rates of most springs in poland are low chełmicki et al 2011 considering the seasonal variability of groundwater effluent performance the highest productivity should be noted in april and february while its decline in july and october the lowest values were always recorded in october this is primarily related to the snowmelt supply of groundwater followed by the amount of precipitation an example distribution of the variability of groundwater outflow efficiency over time is shown in figure 8 the groundwater drainage pattern in this area both in terms of form and discharge is affected by the alternating horizons of permeable and impermeable soils lack of continuity in water tables and their variable depth and variable young glacial relief cieśliński et al 2016 the temperature of the analyzed water samples ranged from 5 0 to 14 9 c in the classification system by wieczysty 1982 the studied outflows would receive a designation of cool mean temperature values were quite stable for each month in october mean water temperatures ranged from 7 4 to 8 6 c in february from 5 0 to 8 0 c in april from 8 2 to 11 0 c and in july from 10 4 to 14 9 c fig 9 specific conductivity for the studied water samples ranged from 240 to 350 µs cm 1 mean values for individual months are noted in the range from 260 to 350 µs cm 1 for october from 240 to 320 µs cm 1 for february from 260 to 300 µs cm 1 for april and from 260 to 310 µs cm 1 for july fig 10 no significant differences in values of specific conductivity are observed on a monthly basis for the entire period of measurement example of which are the values presented in figure 11 these are due to the scale of recharge in water tables and outflow discharge sarma et al 1979 the ph of the studied water samples ranged from 7 2 to 8 5 which yields a neutral or poorly basic range this is normal in the case of groundwater magesh et al 2013 total mineral content ranged from 320 to 610 mg dm 3 the main cation was calcium with 69 2 to 85 8 of the cation content the mean magnesium content was 8 8 the total sodium and potassium content ranged from 4 5 to 12 1 the main anion was bicarbonate at a mean value of 75 1 chloride content did not exceed a value of 10 of the anion content sulfate and nitrate content ranged anywhere from 10 to 25 of the anion total fig 12 the list of physical and chemical properties data average minimum and maximum values for all the outflows is presented in table 2 they confirm high homogeneity in obtained results for physical properties conductivity ph and concentrations of main cations and anions for all measurement points in terms of average and extreme values the dominant ions are calcium and bicarbonate greater variation is observed for nutrients this is particularly true for outflows 7 8 and 9 located in the north western fringe zone of lake wieprznickie increased values of instantaneous charges of both total phosphorus and total nitrogen are particularly visible in outflow no 8 fig 13 the examined water samples are classified as two hydrochemical types based on the classification system by szczukariew and prikłoński in this system the two water types are bicarbonate calcium 89 of studied outflows and bicarbonate sulfate calcium 11 the latter is characteristic of shallow groundwater in the hypergenesis zone macioszczyk and dobrzyński 2007 and water obtained in young glacial areas built of formations rich in calcium carbonate mazurek 2000 these two water types describe groundwater with a specific water chemistry as well as few effects produced by human impact according to kozerski 2007 the bicarbonate calcium water type is dominant in quaternary area outflows regardless of depth although other water types may also be detected locally also it is the case that bicarbonate sulfate calcium type outflows represent drainage from a quaternary water table according to baraer et al 2015 the chemistry of outflows depends first and foremost on the source of water the main hydrogeologic factors for assessing lake environments are 1 regime dominance the relative groundwater flow in total water budget of a lake 2 system efficiency a description of the rate aspects of surface and groundwater movement through a lake system and 3 position within a groundwater flow system born et al 1979 the wieprznickie lake in this aspect is characterized by a small contribution of the examined groundwater outflows in the total supply of the lake potamic inflow and water supply from deeper aquifers dominate here according to morgenstern et al 2015 to understand the lake pollution mechanism it is important to define in detail the origin of groundwater flow paths delay times and future pollution concentrations unfortunately this type of research was not carried out for the wieprznickie lake it seems that further research should be extended for such analyzes surface water bodies are always connected to groundwater hayashi and rosenberry 2002 fleckenstein et al 2010 and interact with aquifers in many ways winter et al 1998 the utilization or contamination of one resource can present associated risks for the other winter et al 1998 rosenberry and labaugh 2008 groundwater surface water interactions are complex and exchange rates are both spatially and temporally highly variable winter et al 1998 depending on shoreline and bed substrates aquifer characteristics topography and meteorological conditions schneider et al 2005 rosenberry and labaugh 2008 management of one component of the hydrologic system is only partly effective because each hydrologic component is in continuing interaction with other components korkka niemi et al 2012 because the interaction is difficult to observe it is usually ignored in water management considerations krause et al 2007 previous studies of lakes have revealed some having negligible groundwater exchange lenters 2004 some being dominated by groundwater schwalb et al 1999 the obtained results indicate that groundwater flows for the lake wieprznickie are significant in evaluating the total supply annual inflow is 4 of the lake s volume just like for large lakes harvey et al 2000 yihdego and becht 2013 although there are more values such as lake purrumbete which has an underground supply of about 17 yihdego et al 2014a according zacharias et al 2003 and ayenew and gebreegziabher 2006 some lakes have the net groundwater flux varying about 30 of total inflow however even if the net groundwater flux is a relatively small component of the lake s water balance groundwater discharges to the lake might have a more significant role locally in shaping the shore environment through direct or indirect effects on environmental factors hayashi and rosenberry 2002 rautio and korkka niemi 2015 discharging groundwater also provides a relatively stable thermal environment and nutrient supply for the fish population throughout the year sinokrot et al 1995 the inflow of groundwater to the lake may increase the loads of biogenic compounds as indicated ekholm et al 1997 the outflows provided to the lake wieprznickie average about 23000 m3 annually they may decide to some extent on the quality status dash et al 2008 and primarily on the degree of salinity yihdego et al 2014b nutrient exchange between lakes and groundwater li and wang 2007 and modeling mechanisms of pollution artfib et al 2002 according to rautio and korkka niemi 2015 locally near the shoreline the impact of drainage of groundwater on the lake s water quality is clearly visible a well estimated amount of groundwater inflows to the lake on an annual scale can provide valuable information in the aspect of assessing lake pollution loads such as nutrient fluxes and subsequent contribution of groundwater in eutrophication what was done for the research area the conducted research shows that groundwater outflows to the lake wieprznickie do not constitute a significant source of pollution also in terms of nutrient supply lack of complete information on influencing elements preclude accurate estimation of the groundwater inflows on which the assessment of pollutant concentrations may depend wiebe 2012 timchenko 2016 claims that the work must take into account the ecohydrological approach that is to study hydrological processes which are responsible for the functioning of aquatic ecosystems vital activity of hydrobionts bioproductivity of the aquatic environment and its quality it was limited to assessing the water quality for the lake wieprznickie the results indicate good quality the obtained results of the quality of groundwater in the coastal zone of wieprznickie lake indicate seasonal surface water intrusion groundwater quality may be sensitive to seasonal changes and to future warming which will increase the rate of evaporation and precipitation and consequently change the water cycle kundzewicz 2008 the results are confirmed by studies conducted by okkonen and kløve 2012 in northern finland according by rossenbery et al 2003 much of the groundwater discharge to lakes is focused at near shore springs which are conspicuously absent of aquatic vegetation strong groundwater discharge in the northern part of the lake reduces the thickness of the hyporheic zone where microbes consume ammonium and reduce the amount of nitrogen that reaches the stream groundwater discharge also provides nutrients and a stable environment for establishment of aquatic vegetation in the streambed according to kidmose 2010 well drained materials contribute to the fact that 94 of the water is groundwater morphometric conditions lake geometry townley and trefry 2010 and direct basin morphometry zecharias and brutsaert 1988 are also important in turn according to smith and townley 2002 interactions between surface waters and groundwaters depend on the location of the lake in the regional flow system in the case of lake wieprznickie it is confirmed that changes in lake water balance resources fluctuations in surface water levels hydraulic connections sophocleous 2002 or changes in water quality li and wang 2007 dash et al 2008 are the result of changes in the lake s groundwater supply 5 conclussion the occurrence of groundwater outflows in post glacial areas is triggered by the crossing of water bearing horizons near lines of contact in river channels and valleys drwal 1979 it was found that 9 outflows of groundwater occur in the north western the fringe zone of the lake wieprznickie these outflows can be devided in groups of 2 or 3 and are found close to one another creating spring fens serve as links between slope systems and channel systems eight outflows were unconcentrated leaks and one with a point character no 6 it was determined that the examined outflows are permanent outflows the mean discharge for all the examined groundwater outflows was 0 73 dm3 s 1 while mean total discharge for the studied outflows ranged from 0 011 dm3 s 1 no 4 to 0 221 dm3 s 1 site no 8 this may be considered low and medium discharge the groundwater drainage pattern of the fringe zone of lake wieprznickie is affected by the alternating horizons of permeable and impermeable soils lack of continuity in water tables and their variable depth and variable post glacial relief cieśliński et al 2016 in addition physical characteristics such as specific conductivity and water temperature changed quite substantially from season to season however values were quite stable for each given study site the values of physical and chemical properties data confirm high homogeneity in obtained results for physical properties conductivity ph and concentrations of main cations and anions for all measurement points in terms of average and extreme values this may indicate greater anthropopressure in this area the examined water samples are classified as two hydrochemical types bicarbonate calcium 8 of 9 studied outflows and bicarbonate sulfate calcium 1 of 9 studied outflows which describe groundwaters with specific water chemistry as well as the few effects caused by anthropopressure problems related to water pollution due to human activities have changed over time groundwater pollution can be caused by irrigation or excessive exploitation of groundwater human activity is associated with the risk of supplying both surface and groundwater residues of artificial fertilizers but also household contribute to water contamination which affect environmental biogeochemistry the obtained results show a high impact of surface water on groundwater both their physical and chemical properties moreover groundwater quality may be sensitive to seasonal changes and to future warming the results obtained in this work is extremely important in the context of ecohydrology data on quality and quantity of groundwater outflows in the direct catchment of lake wieprznickie can give information on environmental sustainability in this region zalewski et al 1997 it will allow to determine forms of improving water quality and increasing the capacity of the environment for absorbing intensifying anthropogenic

1053,groundwater outflows are an important feature of water circulation in nature which is why they are extremely important in the natural environment the main purpose of the study was to identify groundwater outflows across the fringe zone of lake wieprznickie as well as their hydrochemical characterization studies were conducted four times per year in the period from november 2010 to october 2013 for three hydrologic years fieldwork has shown the presence of 9 groundwater outflows northwest of the studied lake the elevation of the outflows ranged from 150 to 155 meters the outflows were found to be hillslope outflows that yield water continuously throughout the study period the total mean discharge for all 9 outflows was 0 73 dm3 s 1 which can be regarded as weak and average the obtained results indicate that groundwater outflows to the lake wieprznickie provide 4 of the lake s volume most outflows created clusters of two or three outflows that formed the spring physical conditions such as specific conductivity and water temperature were subject to significant seasonal changes while large stabilization was observed at individual measuring points total mineral content ranged from 320 to 610 mg dm 3 calcium was the main cation identified in the study and bicarbonate was the main anion which is characteristic of shallow groundwater keywords groundwater outflows springs hillslope outflows post glacial areas fringe zone lake wieprznickie 1 introduction groundwater outflows are naturally occurring sites producing concentrated or areal water flow to the land surface which is defined in the literature not only as process but also as a kind of water body daniel 1976 johansson 1987 outflows represent an important element of the water balance in nature by serving as a link between groundwater and surface water harvey et al 2000 in effect outflows are a main constituent of the hydrologic cycle jia et al 2015 and their occurrence does closely follow local geology relief and climate conditions the number of outflows tends to increase when the following conditions are present variable relief presence of alternating permeable and poorly permeable layers relatively high atmospheric precipitation outflows are an important component of the landscape shaping relevant for human functioning and also a very sensitive point in the environment reacting to processes caused naturally or anthropogenically their natural economic and cultural significance calls for the need to protect them outflows are important in shaping the specific habitat conditions for the functioning and development of wetland fauna martin and brunke 2012 for humans groundwater outflows have always been a key source of clean drinking water while some have become sites of worship knutsson 2014 groundwater outflows springs can be natural related to geological climatic and hydrological conditions hartmann et al 2014 or anthropogenic related to e g drainage from subsurface excavations powell et al 2015 they can be classified according to many indicators among others on hydrology active vs inactive fensham et al 2016 discharge rate netopil 1971 or recession

of the most diverse and unique ecosystems on earth but their stewardship has been hindered by the lack of knowledge of the distribution and density of springs across landscapes springs may function as keystone ecosystems small patches of habitat that play disproportionally large roles in landscape ecology decide also on water circulation in the catchment hydrological functions of the catchment whether they are an economic element supply of drinking water junghans et al 2016 it is important to maintain a good quality status of groundwater which can be a source of pollution for surface waters eg lakes many studies have addressed the effects of inflow of groundwater on the quality of surface water bodies kenoyer and anderson 1989 conant 2004 hayashi and rosenberry 2002 rautio and korkka niemi 2011 the physical territory of poland has been studied quite extensively in terms of hydrography the mainstream view in the 20th century was that northern poland does not possess a large number of groundwater outflows unlike other regions of poland dynowska 1986 only a small number of publications are available on this subject matter including those of błaszkowski 1969 nowakowski 1977 and maksymiuk 1977 this short list of previous research makes it difficult to present a comprehensive picture of the distribution of outflows in this region as well as their hydrologic characteristics however the current study has shown that this common view is not accurate close to 70 groundwater outflows were identified near the town of lębork on lake lubowidzkie this study area was located in the ancient valley of the reda and łeba rivers fac beneda and hryniszak 2006 this finding was then confirmed by research work by górniak and pietryczuk 2015 a total of 2 611 outflows were also noted by choiński and ptak 2009 in the odra river drainage basin choiński 2009 also was able to show the presence of 336 outflows on 94 sheets of hydrographic maps of catchments in the baltic coastal area and the bay of szczecin most of the outflows were permanent outflows 211 62 8 some were leaks 58 17 3 intermittent outflows accounted for 15 8 53 while meadow outflows accounted for 2 4 8 smerdon et al 2005 for a shallow lake in canada found that it is fed by 16 fixed sources located in its edge zone cieśliński and leśniowski 2013 utilized hydrographic maps of poland scale 1 50 000 to show the presence of 361 groundwater outflows in pomorskie province in the north of poland when published field data were included the total reached 734 it is consequently sensible to assert that the number of groundwater outflows noted across post glacial areas in the north of poland is quite large post glacial areas belong to regions with relatively good water circulation facilitated by the drainage of both the first and second water table the occurrence of groundwater outflows across post glacial areas is caused by the crossing of water tables along zones of contact in river channels and valleys drwal and trapp 1992 natural groundwater outflows in young glacial areas have a different forms ranging from single springs to leaks and meadow springs and entire clusters of springs or areal springs springs also occur at the bottom of the lake cieśliński et al 2016 leaks should be understood as unconcentrated outflows of groundwater in exposed aquifers periodically giving an outflow in turn point and meadow outflows are natural groundwater outflows active periodically outflows are an element of the hydrographic network and reflect local and regional changes in groundwater circulation patterns changes in the circulation pattern yield changes in outflow discharge and may even lead to a decline of an outflow mazurek 2006 the main purpose of the work is to determine the problem of water circulation in the post glacial catchment of a shallow lake and the role of groundwater supply in the form of springs or direct inflow to the lake fig 1 an additional goal was to determine the potential impact of the outflows on the functioning of the lake furthermore an additional purpose of the work is to determine the human impact on the quality of waters of the analyzed outflows in terms of ecohydrology this is very important that the obtained results can be used to improve water quality and design changes in the water management of the studied region which in turn will improve the state of the natural environment 2 study area human activity can be a potential source of pollution for the studied lake and affect landscape biogeochemistry as a result it is important to determine the volume of outflows in relation to the volume of the lake and to identify groundwater outflows in the fringe zone of lake wieprznickie fig 1 and determine their discharge and water quality this process is associated with the determination of land relief and local geology in the study area the study area is part of the peri baltic syneclise featuring mostly paleozoic formations up to 4 000 meters thick these include clastic and carbonate rocks such as sandstone siltstone silty shale limestone and marl meltwaters associated with the scandinavian ice sheet had played an important role in shaping the relief of the study area the sheet s northward recession caused gradual washing down of sandstone levels by meltwater which are separated from one another via distinct edges up to more than 20 meters in height augustowski and sylwestrzak 1979 the surface geology of the studied area is formed mostly by pleistocene deposits associated with the pomeranian phase of the main stadial of the last glaciation predominant here are sediments of hydrocarbon accumulation developed as a series of sands with gravels the thickness of which ranges from several meters to more than a dozen meters in addition holocene deposits found in local depressions river valleys and gully type landforms consist mostly of silts peats and limestone sands and river silts staszek 2006 the relief of the study area is highly variable with numerous hills sitting atop a wavelike and hilly moraine as well as concave landforms in the form of deeply cut lake gutters augustowski and sylwestrzak 1979 one of these gutters is home to lake wieprznickie fig 2 denivelations of the study area are about 30 meters the elevation ranges from 175 meters above sea level at the edge of lake wieprznickie to 145 meters south of the studied lake fig 2 most of the soils surrounding lake wieprznickie are medium permeability soils fig 3 a poorly permeable area can be found by the northwestern edge of the lake the geological structure is dominated by gravelly sands to the north of the lake are additional diamicton while along the inflow and outflow occurs peat fig 4 the dominant values of hydroisobat are 1 5 and 10 m fig 4 in the study area there is a predominance of oceanic influences with the weakening influence of the baltic sea this results in small annual temperature amplitudes of around 20 c the variability of precipitation depends on the terrain exposure relative to the predominant direction of western circulation average precipitation in poland is about 600 mm therefore if maximum precipitation in the region is 900 it exceeds the mean national precipitation by 300 mm the highest rainfall is recorded in june and july and the lowest from february to april fig 5 lake wieprznickie is located in the rakownica river catchment fig 1 the studied river joins the wda river via the trzebiocha river the lake is connected via a narrow channel with lake garczyn lake wieprznickie is not deep mean depth 2 2 m maximum 3 5 m but does retain certain characteristics of a gutter type lake steep shoreline elongated shape the channel lake is formed by a series of three lakes lake wieprznickie lake garczyn lake graniczne the surface area of the studied lake is 26 0 ha its volume is 605 000 m3 the catchment of the lake is 31 3 km2 the surface of the lake s water stands at 149 3 meters above sea level the main tributary feeding the lake is the rakownica river discharge in the rakownica measured at the łubiana site about 7 km downstream from lake wieprznickie on august 2 2006 was 0 57 m3 s 1 staszek 2006 the northern shore of the lake is surrounded by wetlands due to the fact that the lake is shallow max 3 5 m it does not have a bathymetric plan nor morphometric card that s why authors decided to prepare cross section through the deepest part of the lake based on dem and information about the location of the deepest point fig 6 the study area is located at the pleistocene water table elevation which may be divided into two distinct soil horizons upper sander horizon and lower inter moraine horizon the sander horizon most often occurs at depths between 15 and 50 meters while the inter moraine horizon occurs at depths between 50 and 100 meters the second horizon features a water table under pressure groundwater is found here at depths between 1 and 2 meters groundwater levels were measured at the kartuzy site and were characterized by the occurrence of one maximum per spring snowmelt season april and one minimum in september or october fluctuations in the water level reached 8 5 meters staszek 2006 groundwater flows in the study area are directed towards local hydrographic axes lake wieprznickie groundwater can be found merely one meter below the surface at the edge of the lake and two meters below the surface across the catchment this favors the formation of groundwater outflows which occur in places where the soil is poorly permeable generally groundwater flows from north west to south east the flow undergoes local modifications in the vicinity of river valleys and gutters where water drains the pleistocene aquifer has a capacity of usually around 30 to 50 70 m3 h 1 3 methods the main research effort consisted of hydrographic surveys designed to note all groundwater outflows as well as measure discharge using the volumetric method and thompson s triangular valve fieldwork also included measurement of physical spring water properties such as water temperature specific conductivity and ph these data were collected using a multi parameter device manufactured by wtw i350 in addition water samples were collected for laboratory analysis including determination of the concentration of main cations and anions chlorides sulphates sodium potassium calcium magnesium nitrates phosphates ammonia using a dionex 1100 chromatograph and a merck nova 400 spectrophotometer total nitrogen total phosphorus the results of the analyzes performed on the chromatograph were processed by the peaknet 6 data collection system chromeleon 6 and were exported to microsoft office excel a colorimetric technique was used to analyse total nitrogen ntot and total phosphorus ptot the determination of total nitrogen was based on the transformation of organic and inorganic compounds to nitrates using the koroleff method the test sample is treated with an oxidizing agent while the sample is heated the resulting nitrates in a sulfuric and phosphoric acid environment react with 2 6 dimethylphenol dmf forming orange 4 nitro 2 6 dimethylphenol which is determined photometrically for determining the concentration of total phosphorus applied colorimetric method with ammonium molybdate and tin chloride ii as a reducing agent based on measured concentrations of total nitrogen and total phosphorus and measured discharges instantaneous nutrient loads were calculated according to the formula l q c where l total nitrogen or total phosphorus loads q measured discharge m3 s 1 c concentrations of total nitrogen or total phosphorus mg dm 3 the principle of determination is based on the formation in an acidic solution phosphomolybdic acid h7 p moo2 o4 6 with a yellow color which is reduced under the influence of tin chloride ii to form a compound of intense blue color the intensity of the color is proportional to the content of phosphates the titration method was used to analyze the content of bicarbonates which consisted of regular addition of the reagent the samples were titrated with a standard solution of hydrochloric acid with a concentration of 0 1 mol dm 3 in the presence of methyl orange as a reaction indicator finally fieldwork was supplemented with a review of main literature sources as well as calculations on the field results obtained the research was conducted between november 2010 and october 2013 or for three hydrologic years four measurements were conducted per year october february april july in total 12 hydrological measurements and 12 hydrochemical measurements were performed 4 results and discussion field survey revealed the presence of 9 groundwater outflows distributed fairly evenly across the area west of the studied lake fig 7 no other groundwater outflows around the lake were found during the entire measurement period the surface geological structure where groundwater outflows are found is not complicated it is mostly formed by pleistocene deposits genetically related with the pomeranian phase of the main stage of the last glaciation sediments of glacial accumulation which are moderately permeable predominate in the studied area the thickness of these deposits ranges from several to even several dozen meters marks et al 2016 these outflows are arranged in groups of 2 or 3 and are found close to one another creating spring fens eight outflows were unconcentrated leaks and one with a point character number 6 spring in addition they serve as the starting point of headwater areas as shown by stach et al 2003 it may be argued that these groups of outflows serve as connectors between slope systems and channel systems as noted by jones 1987 in this sense they are areal springs the outflows in this study are located at elevations ranging from 150 to 155 meters table 1 the best way to classify them is under slope type outflows no 3 and no 8 are located at the highest elevations while outflow no 9 is located at the lowest elevation by the lake s shoreline eight of the studied outflows were not concentrated outflows leaks and one outflow was a point outflow or spring no 6 in the hydrologic years 2011 2013 table 1 mean discharge for the studied outflows ranged from 0 011 dm3 s 1 site no 4 to 0 221 dm3 s 1 site no 8 extreme values ranged from less than 0 01 to 0 39 dm3 s 1 according to the mainzer discharge scale the studied outflows may be classified as medium or low discharge type generally the discharge rates of most springs in poland are low chełmicki et al 2011 considering the seasonal variability of groundwater effluent performance the highest productivity should be noted in april and february while its decline in july and october the lowest values were always recorded in october this is primarily related to the snowmelt supply of groundwater followed by the amount of precipitation an example distribution of the variability of groundwater outflow efficiency over time is shown in figure 8 the groundwater drainage pattern in this area both in terms of form and discharge is affected by the alternating horizons of permeable and impermeable soils lack of continuity in water tables and their variable depth and variable young glacial relief cieśliński et al 2016 the temperature of the analyzed water samples ranged from 5 0 to 14 9 c in the classification system by wieczysty 1982 the studied outflows would receive a designation of cool mean temperature values were quite stable for each month in october mean water temperatures ranged from 7 4 to 8 6 c in february from 5 0 to 8 0 c in april from 8 2 to 11 0 c and in july from 10 4 to 14 9 c fig 9 specific conductivity for the studied water samples ranged from 240 to 350 µs cm 1 mean values for individual months are noted in the range from 260 to 350 µs cm 1 for october from 240 to 320 µs cm 1 for february from 260 to 300 µs cm 1 for april and from 260 to 310 µs cm 1 for july fig 10 no significant differences in values of specific conductivity are observed on a monthly basis for the entire period of measurement example of which are the values presented in figure 11 these are due to the scale of recharge in water tables and outflow discharge sarma et al 1979 the ph of the studied water samples ranged from 7 2 to 8 5 which yields a neutral or poorly basic range this is normal in the case of groundwater magesh et al 2013 total mineral content ranged from 320 to 610 mg dm 3 the main cation was calcium with 69 2 to 85 8 of the cation content the mean magnesium content was 8 8 the total sodium and potassium content ranged from 4 5 to 12 1 the main anion was bicarbonate at a mean value of 75 1 chloride content did not exceed a value of 10 of the anion content sulfate and nitrate content ranged anywhere from 10 to 25 of the anion total fig 12 the list of physical and chemical properties data average minimum and maximum values for all the outflows is presented in table 2 they confirm high homogeneity in obtained results for physical properties conductivity ph and concentrations of main cations and anions for all measurement points in terms of average and extreme values the dominant ions are calcium and bicarbonate greater variation is observed for nutrients this is particularly true for outflows 7 8 and 9 located in the north western fringe zone of lake wieprznickie increased values of instantaneous charges of both total phosphorus and total nitrogen are particularly visible in outflow no 8 fig 13 the examined water samples are classified as two hydrochemical types based on the classification system by szczukariew and prikłoński in this system the two water types are bicarbonate calcium 89 of studied outflows and bicarbonate sulfate calcium 11 the latter is characteristic of shallow groundwater in the hypergenesis zone macioszczyk and dobrzyński 2007 and water obtained in young glacial areas built of formations rich in calcium carbonate mazurek 2000 these two water types describe groundwater with a specific water chemistry as well as few effects produced by human impact according to kozerski 2007 the bicarbonate calcium water type is dominant in quaternary area outflows regardless of depth although other water types may also be detected locally also it is the case that bicarbonate sulfate calcium type outflows represent drainage from a quaternary water table according to baraer et al 2015 the chemistry of outflows depends first and foremost on the source of water the main hydrogeologic factors for assessing lake environments are 1 regime dominance the relative groundwater flow in total water budget of a lake 2 system efficiency a description of the rate aspects of surface and groundwater movement through a lake system and 3 position within a groundwater flow system born et al 1979 the wieprznickie lake in this aspect is characterized by a small contribution of the examined groundwater outflows in the total supply of the lake potamic inflow and water supply from deeper aquifers dominate here according to morgenstern et al 2015 to understand the lake pollution mechanism it is important to define in detail the origin of groundwater flow paths delay times and future pollution concentrations unfortunately this type of research was not carried out for the wieprznickie lake it seems that further research should be extended for such analyzes surface water bodies are always connected to groundwater hayashi and rosenberry 2002 fleckenstein et al 2010 and interact with aquifers in many ways winter et al 1998 the utilization or contamination of one resource can present associated risks for the other winter et al 1998 rosenberry and labaugh 2008 groundwater surface water interactions are complex and exchange rates are both spatially and temporally highly variable winter et al 1998 depending on shoreline and bed substrates aquifer characteristics topography and meteorological conditions schneider et al 2005 rosenberry and labaugh 2008 management of one component of the hydrologic system is only partly effective because each hydrologic component is in continuing interaction with other components korkka niemi et al 2012 because the interaction is difficult to observe it is usually ignored in water management considerations krause et al 2007 previous studies of lakes have revealed some having negligible groundwater exchange lenters 2004 some being dominated by groundwater schwalb et al 1999 the obtained results indicate that groundwater flows for the lake wieprznickie are significant in evaluating the total supply annual inflow is 4 of the lake s volume just like for large lakes harvey et al 2000 yihdego and becht 2013 although there are more values such as lake purrumbete which has an underground supply of about 17 yihdego et al 2014a according zacharias et al 2003 and ayenew and gebreegziabher 2006 some lakes have the net groundwater flux varying about 30 of total inflow however even if the net groundwater flux is a relatively small component of the lake s water balance groundwater discharges to the lake might have a more significant role locally in shaping the shore environment through direct or indirect effects on environmental factors hayashi and rosenberry 2002 rautio and korkka niemi 2015 discharging groundwater also provides a relatively stable thermal environment and nutrient supply for the fish population throughout the year sinokrot et al 1995 the inflow of groundwater to the lake may increase the loads of biogenic compounds as indicated ekholm et al 1997 the outflows provided to the lake wieprznickie average about 23000 m3 annually they may decide to some extent on the quality status dash et al 2008 and primarily on the degree of salinity yihdego et al 2014b nutrient exchange between lakes and groundwater li and wang 2007 and modeling mechanisms of pollution artfib et al 2002 according to rautio and korkka niemi 2015 locally near the shoreline the impact of drainage of groundwater on the lake s water quality is clearly visible a well estimated amount of groundwater inflows to the lake on an annual scale can provide valuable information in the aspect of assessing lake pollution loads such as nutrient fluxes and subsequent contribution of groundwater in eutrophication what was done for the research area the conducted research shows that groundwater outflows to the lake wieprznickie do not constitute a significant source of pollution also in terms of nutrient supply lack of complete information on influencing elements preclude accurate estimation of the groundwater inflows on which the assessment of pollutant concentrations may depend wiebe 2012 timchenko 2016 claims that the work must take into account the ecohydrological approach that is to study hydrological processes which are responsible for the functioning of aquatic ecosystems vital activity of hydrobionts bioproductivity of the aquatic environment and its quality it was limited to assessing the water quality for the lake wieprznickie the results indicate good quality the obtained results of the quality of groundwater in the coastal zone of wieprznickie lake indicate seasonal surface water intrusion groundwater quality may be sensitive to seasonal changes and to future warming which will increase the rate of evaporation and precipitation and consequently change the water cycle kundzewicz 2008 the results are confirmed by studies conducted by okkonen and kløve 2012 in northern finland according by rossenbery et al 2003 much of the groundwater discharge to lakes is focused at near shore springs which are conspicuously absent of aquatic vegetation strong groundwater discharge in the northern part of the lake reduces the thickness of the hyporheic zone where microbes consume ammonium and reduce the amount of nitrogen that reaches the stream groundwater discharge also provides nutrients and a stable environment for establishment of aquatic vegetation in the streambed according to kidmose 2010 well drained materials contribute to the fact that 94 of the water is groundwater morphometric conditions lake geometry townley and trefry 2010 and direct basin morphometry zecharias and brutsaert 1988 are also important in turn according to smith and townley 2002 interactions between surface waters and groundwaters depend on the location of the lake in the regional flow system in the case of lake wieprznickie it is confirmed that changes in lake water balance resources fluctuations in surface water levels hydraulic connections sophocleous 2002 or changes in water quality li and wang 2007 dash et al 2008 are the result of changes in the lake s groundwater supply 5 conclussion the occurrence of groundwater outflows in post glacial areas is triggered by the crossing of water bearing horizons near lines of contact in river channels and valleys drwal 1979 it was found that 9 outflows of groundwater occur in the north western the fringe zone of the lake wieprznickie these outflows can be devided in groups of 2 or 3 and are found close to one another creating spring fens serve as links between slope systems and channel systems eight outflows were unconcentrated leaks and one with a point character no 6 it was determined that the examined outflows are permanent outflows the mean discharge for all the examined groundwater outflows was 0 73 dm3 s 1 while mean total discharge for the studied outflows ranged from 0 011 dm3 s 1 no 4 to 0 221 dm3 s 1 site no 8 this may be considered low and medium discharge the groundwater drainage pattern of the fringe zone of lake wieprznickie is affected by the alternating horizons of permeable and impermeable soils lack of continuity in water tables and their variable depth and variable post glacial relief cieśliński et al 2016 in addition physical characteristics such as specific conductivity and water temperature changed quite substantially from season to season however values were quite stable for each given study site the values of physical and chemical properties data confirm high homogeneity in obtained results for physical properties conductivity ph and concentrations of main cations and anions for all measurement points in terms of average and extreme values this may indicate greater anthropopressure in this area the examined water samples are classified as two hydrochemical types bicarbonate calcium 8 of 9 studied outflows and bicarbonate sulfate calcium 1 of 9 studied outflows which describe groundwaters with specific water chemistry as well as the few effects caused by anthropopressure problems related to water pollution due to human activities have changed over time groundwater pollution can be caused by irrigation or excessive exploitation of groundwater human activity is associated with the risk of supplying both surface and groundwater residues of artificial fertilizers but also household contribute to water contamination which affect environmental biogeochemistry the obtained results show a high impact of surface water on groundwater both their physical and chemical properties moreover groundwater quality may be sensitive to seasonal changes and to future warming the results obtained in this work is extremely important in the context of ecohydrology data on quality and quantity of groundwater outflows in the direct catchment of lake wieprznickie can give information on environmental sustainability in this region zalewski et al 1997 it will allow to determine forms of improving water quality and increasing the capacity of the environment for absorbing intensifying anthropogenic

1054,the paper summarises the results of bacteriological and hydrochemical studies on the lowland springs in the big forest complex of the podlasie region in ne poland in this area 75 springs were investigated in the summer period of 2014 and 2015 to determine bacterial number biomass and hydrolytic activity all investigated objects were categorized by direct catchment land use and hydrobiological type the number and biomass of bacteria in the water of the investigated springs is much smaller than in other types of surface water in lowland areas and ranges from 0 29 to 2 94 106 cells cm 3 the best reflection of the habitat quality within lowland groundwater outflows is their hydrobiological typology helocrene rheocrene and limnocrene despite differing development of spring niches their hydrology as well as the geological material and its graining cause unification of the bacterial numbers the number of bacteria cells were correlated with the concentration of some nitrogen compounds nh4 no2 and the hydrolytic activity of bacteria with phosphorus compounds mainly dissolved phosphorus the presence of dissolved organic carbon compounds turned out to be the most disturbing factor in the development of bacterioplankton concentrations of these parameters were found to be conditioned by the management of the direct outflow catchment furthermore in rheocrene springs bacterial activity during hydrological stress is clearly lower despite a large number of bacterial cells in the water r 0 38 p 0 005 our results show that lowland springs are a very sensitive objects to changes in land use which has a significant impact on water quality and thus the number and activity of bacteria 1 introduction springs are complex ecosystems characterized by thermal stability a patchy ecotonal structure rich biodiversity and a high occurrence of rare and often endemic species cantonati et al 2012 however springs are habitats still neglected by researchers and nature conservation services over the past several decades many springs have exhibited an alarming transition state due to changes in land development and hydrological alterations resulting mainly from the lowering of the groundwater table hensley and cohen 2017 within microbial communities impacts from land use are mirrored by higher bacterial number and biodiversity values that are atypical in the pristine groundwater of comparable systems stein et al 2010 large forest complexes are areas in which changes resulting from economic and hydrological factors are still barely visible in the past few decades interest in bacteria living in freshwater has increased mainly for sanitary and epidemiological reasons however most of the research has concerned lakes okoniewska et al 2011 makarewicz 2004 rivers chomutowska 2009 and dam reservoirs zieliński and leśniewska 2006 in particular sources of drinking water there are only a few references to the abundance biomass and activity of bacteria in natural outflows of groundwater literature data concern mainly hot and mineral springs used in balneology tekere et al 2015 panda et al 2016 springs must actually be considered ecosystems harbouring indigenous biocenoses danielopol et al 2003 danielopol and griebler 2008 in this case the microbiological status of groundwater not only should examine the presence of pathogenic i e faecal microorganisms but should also address the issue of naturally occurring bacteria sinreich et al 2014 each water reservoir has diverse physicochemical conditions that affect microflora de caro et al 2017 in groundwater fed springs habitat features are determined primarily by a complex combination of geomorphic features and physicochemical parameters serov et al 2012 stoch et al 2016 due to the oligotrophic nature of the majority of springs the microflora is not very diverse it is assumed that the number of bacteria cells is dependent mainly on the content and quality of available organic matter om del giorgio and davis 2003 duarte et al 2010 the amount of om in springs is usually very low and the bacterial number bn does not exceed 1 106 cells cm 3 in contaminated water the population of bacterioplankton can reach several million cells cm 3 hydrology is an important factor controlling the export of om crucial to bacterial growth wet organic soils accumulate detritus faster than they can mineralize it and thus om is more available for export freeman et al 2001 export may vary among neighbouring spring catchments due to differences in hydrology or other factors such as watershed size or the areal extent of wetlands and their proximity to surface water jansson et al 2008 the presence and activity of bacteria in water also depends on biotic fauna flora plankton and abiotic factors temperature water acidity dissolved oxygen content solar irradiation mineral composition etc the bn depends primarily on the content and concentration of the nutrients in the settled waters in general spring waters are not considered to be a very variable environment over time in terms of hydrochemistry in this case lowland springs are an exception in this respect shallow lowland groundwater flowing to the surface is characterized by a relatively high nutrients content and consists changes in their concentration during the year that often exceed 100 jekatierynczuk rudczyk 2010 in this study the number biomass and hydrolytic activity of bacteria were investigated in the natural groundwater outflows of large forest complex in ne poland the aim of this study was to evaluate the bacterial abundance and hydrolytic activity of bacteria in lowland springs characterized with different land use of direct catchment and representing different hydrobiological types we also wanted to identify hydrochemical parameters influencing bacterioplankton growth and bacterial hydrolytic activity in forest springs during the summer season 2 study area the study was conducted in north eastern poland in the area of a large protected forest complex known as knyszyn forest landscape park kflp fig 1 knyszyn forest is the second largest forest complex after białowieża forest in the podlasie province ne poland and covers an area of over 126 000 ha knyszyn forest is also included in the natura 2000 network this area is distinguished by a complex hydrographic network owing its shape to varied terrain formed during the weichselian glaciation the area is characterized by the presence of moraine plateaus the slopes of which are cut by numerous small river valleys quaternary deposits in kflp were formed during the pleistocene glaciations and their thickness varies from 130 to 220 m banaszuk 1995 hydrogeological map of poland 2009 they are represented by boulder clay gravel and sandy formations mud and silt deposits and varved clays the upper narew river catchment and especially the supraśl river catchment are richly carved similar to areas from the last glaciation period musiał 1992 mojski 2005 the diversity of the terrain has resulted in numerous springs the main and most important groundwater environments in north eastern poland are quaternary formations their porous character is the common feature of groundwater in the region they occur mainly in the infiltration equilibrium and the hardest occurring aquifer appears in sands and gravels deposited on the clays of the warta glaciation jekatierynczuk rudczyk 2010 the outflows of groundwater in the study area are usually located on the slopes of river valleys and occasionally in the valley bottom and riverbed jekatierynczuk rudczyk et al 2017 jonczak 2013 in kflp a majority of natural springs are of the valley type the yield of the forest springs varies from 0 02 to 27 dm3 s 1 however the most common yield for the forest springs is 0 1 to 0 5 dm3 s 1 jekatierynczuk rudczyk 2010 puczko et al 2018 the dominating influence on the shaping of water efficiency is exerted by climate characterized by the greatest impact of continentalism in poland on the investigated area podlasie province has a moderate transitional climate that is markedly influenced by continentalism górniak 2000 the average annual air temperature over many years is 6 8 c in białystok with an annual rainfall of 600 650 mm górniak 2000 in 2014 2015 the average annual air temperature was much higher 8 6 c while the average annual sum of atmospheric precipitation was relatively small and amounted to just over 530 mm 3 methods field studies were conducted during the summer period of two years 2014 and 2015 the research was carried out in august 2014 7 8 20 21 when 35 springs were investigated and in august 2015 4 5 6 10 when 40 additional springs were sampled the distribution of studied springs in the knyszyn forest is shown on the map fig 1 the vast majority of the examined natural outflows of groundwater are located in forested areas the surface area and saturation zone structure of the spring niches were investigated and specified directly in the field in each of the studied niches the following three zones can be distinguished exfiltration of groundwater in the foot slope zones the hyporheic zone covering niche bottoms and the stream flowing out of the channel head referring to the location of spring niches and land use of their direct catchment we divided investigated springs for four areas forest meadow wasteland rural area classification of springs was based on topographic map analyzes and field observations the best reflection of the nature of the habitat in the niches of lowland springs is the hydrobiological classification proposed by thienemann 1926 according to this classification all 75 investigated springs were divided for three groups a rheocrenes as a flowing springs emerges into one or more stream channels springer et al 2008 b helocrenes springs usually emerge from low gradient wetlands often indistinct or multiple sources with marshy or wet meadow settings springer and stevens 2009 c limnocrenes occur where discharge from confined or unconfined aquifers emerges as one or more lentic pools studies have not been conducted in the outflow zone where habitat conditions were considerably altered due to an increased flow rate measurements of physical parameters temperature electrolytic conductivity ec ph dissolved oxygen do concentration and saturation were carried out directly in the field using an hq40d multi meter hach lange gmbh the basic discharge measurement of the springs were carried out using the container stopwatch method the water samples were collected into sterile 1 liter plastic bottles then they were transported to the laboratory where further analyses were carried out formalin preserved and 4 6 diamidino 2 phenyloindole dapi stained samples were counted for bacterial number bn with olympus epifluorescence microscopy bx61 japan using the porter and feig 1980 method bacterial biomass bb was calculated from bn according to method by thiel nielsen and søndergaard 1998 the general hydrolase bacterial activity ba in spring waters was determined only in 2015 40 springs using the fluorescein diacetate fda method fda is a non specific substrate for hydrolases and it was applied using a modified method described by adam and duncan 2001 after burkowska but et al 2014 after adding 50 μl fda then samples were incubated in the dark for 1 hour at 30 c the fluorescence intensity was measured using a specramax m2 spectrofluorometer at an emission wavelength of 505 nm and at an excitation wavelength of 480 nm the main hydrochemical parameters were determined within ca 24 hours of sampling to avoid sample deterioration on storage using standard methods described in apha 2001 bicarbonate hco3 content was measured by titration with 0 01 m hydrochloric acid using methyl orange as an indicator the concentration of iron ions fe3 was measured spectrophotometrically using the 1 10 phenanthroline method for phosphorus p determination two measurements were made soluble reactive p srp in below 0 45 µm fraction dissolved p dp sample below 0 45 µm and total p tp unfiltered sample both mineralized by peroxodisulphate uv digestion the srp dp and tp fractions were analyzed spectrophotometrically with the molybdenum blue method dissolved organic phosphorus dop was calculated as the difference between dp and srp particulate phosphorus pp was calculated as the difference between tp and dp nitrogen n forms were analyzed spectrophotometrically using reagents by riedel de häen according to the following methods nh4 indophenol blue method no2 with sulphanilic acid by the chromotropic acid method no3 with n 1 naphthyl ethylenediamine with the zinc catalyst method the total inorganic nitrogen tin concentration was calculated as the sum of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n analyses of dissolved organic carbon doc total nitrogen tn concentrations were carried out using the high temperature catalytic combustion method with a shimadzu carbon analyzer toc l japan water samples for doc determinations were filtered through a 0 45 µm filter acidified with 2 m hcl to about ph 2 and rinsed with pure nitrogen to remove traces of inorganic carbon water colour in platinum scale was determined spectrophotometrically using hongve and åkesson 1996 method specific uv absorbance suva was used to evaluate aromaticity of organic matter for this purpose the uv absorbance was normalized to doc of the sample suva values were computed using the formula suva a b s 260 1000 d o c abs260 gc 1 chin et al 1994 modified the statistical analyses were conducted with the application of xlstat 2016 1 and ps imago 4 0 spearman correlation was used to find relationships between the bn or ba and the hydrochemical parameters of spring water principal component analysis pca ouyang 2005 and principal factor analysis pfa were used to determine the number of principal components or factors to be retained for further study a commonly used criterion for the number of factors to rotate is the eigenvalues greater than one rule proposed by kaiser 1960 an eigenvalue less than one implies that the scores on the component would have negative reliability and there are as many reliable factors as there are eigenvalues greater than one cliff 1988 the variability of the distribution of the main analysed parameters was described with the coefficient of variation cv defined as the ratio of the standard variation from a given sample to its arithmetic mean and expressed as a percent value subrahmanya nairy and aruna rao 2003 4 results during low groundwater level in the summers of 2014 and 2015 the spring yields of the knyszyn forest mostly oscillated between 0 5 and 2 0 dm3 s 1 in the alekin classification tested waters belonged to the bicarbonate class c from the ca group of the second type r hco3 r ca2 mg2 r hco3 r so4 2 c ii ca they were two or three ion water types hco3 ca hco3 ca mg the average water temperature in the analyzed springs during the summers of 2014 and 2015 was 14 3 c in the complex of the most efficient springs the summer water temperature fluctuated around 9 c in most springs the water was slightly alkaline ph 7 82 with moderate water oxygen saturation 62 and concentration of dissolved mineral compounds ec 400 µs cm 1 the redox potential was characterised within wide limits slightly above 50 mv on average table 1 relatively high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds were also reported in kflp springs table 1 statistical analyses show that the concentration of mineral and organic forms of these nutrients exceeded average values conditioning exceptionally high fertility of the spring niches environment in over 70 of samples the average summer concentration of doc in kflp springs water exceeded 4 mg dm 3 in some groundwater outflows most often in the form of a bog spring or located in peaty areas the concentration of doc exceeded 10 mg dm 3 a different quality of dissolved organic matter in these springs was demonstrated by suva reaching an average of 23 abs260 gc 1 but the range of variation of this parameter was very wide from 1 to 32 abs260 gc 1 the colour of the water was also characterized by high variability reaching over 15 mgpt dm 3 on average table 1 the average value of bn in the studied kflp springs during the 2014 and 2015 summer research was 0 88 106 cells cm 3 the bn values ranged from 0 29 106 cells cm 3 in outflow in sokołda site no 25 to 2 94 106 cells cm 3 in the sampling station in radulin site no 10 the coefficient of variation for this parameter was over 48 table 2 the average bb was 30 96 μgc dm 3 the minimum value of bb was only 10 32 μgc dm 3 and the maximum was almost 10 fold higher and concerned the same springs as those in the case of bn table 2 during analysis of the average number of bacterioplankton in the springs located in areas with different land use small differences were found among the types of studied environments the highest average bn value was recorded in springs located in rural areas amounted to 1 106 cells cm 3 while the cv was 34 table 3 in typical forest springs the bn was 0 87 106 cells cm 3 table 3 similar mean bn values were recorded in springs of wasteland areas however the variability of this parameter within forest areas was the largest amounting to over 47 the lowest average bn value was recorded in springs located on meadows table 3 some hydrochemical parameters of water in kflp springs with different types of catchment use show statistically significant differences we have observed that doc concentration in meadow springs is statistically significant different than in other land use types table 3a mean concentration of tp is two times higher in springs located in forested and rural areas then in meadows and wastelands no statistically significant differences were found in the case of tin tn and srp concentrations table 3a a comparison of the average values of hydrolytic ba in springs functioning in different areas found that mean values in the case of forest meadow and wasteland oscillated around 4 μgfl cm 3 h 1 fig 2 the coefficient of variation was 58 75 however the average value of ba in the springs in built up having significant human activity rural areas was 3 04 μgfl cm 3 h 1 during comparison of bn in three hydrobiological spring types the highest mean value was observed in helocrenes 0 94 106 cells cm 3 which were also characterized by the highest variability over 45 the value of bn in helocrenes fluctuated from 0 29 106 cells cm 3 to 2 94 106 cells cm 3 table 4 mean values of bn in rheocrenes and limnocrenes were similar 0 87 106 cells cm 3 and 0 85 106 cells cm 3 respectively table 4 higher than average hydrolytic activity of bacteria characterized rheocrenes rather than helocrenes of 3 98 μgfl cm 3 h 1 and 3 59 μgfl cm 3 h 1 respectively the highest coefficient of variation was found for helocrenes 66 89 table 5 an interesting observation was noted in springs classified as rheocrene where negative relationship between ba and bn was described fig 3 in kflp springs located in meadows we observed positive correlation between silicates concentration in water and bn r 0 474 p 0 005 fig 4 it this same type of springs statistically significant positive correlation between bn and bicarbonate concentration was observed fig 5 the pca analysis showed a small effect of the physical properties of water on the number and activity of bacteria in lowland springs fig 6 7 a b table 6 presents the eigenvalues variance and cumulative variance the eigenvectors of the individual physical water quality parameters are shown in fig 6 the first component which explains 27 6 of the total variance within the dataset is characterized by high positive loading for bn water temperature ph and ec the second component explaining 22 7 of the variance characterizes a high positive impact of oxygen conditions temperature and ph on ba fig 6 the ordination of samples and variables on the pca biplot is displayed in fig 7a b samples from limnocrenes are situated mostly on the left side of the biplot fig 7a samples taken from the rheocrenes and helocrenes are found side by side without showing dependence on the water s physical features a much greater influence on the number bn and hydrolytic activity of bacteria ba in the water of lowland kflp springs was demonstrated in relation to the content of different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus fig 8 9 a b positive correlation between bn and nh4 in 2014 r 0 37 p 0 005 or negative correlation in the meadow springs between bn and no2 r 0 44 p 0 005 were noted table 7 presents the eigenvalues variance and cumulative variance the eigenvectors of individual hydrochemical parameters are shown in fig 8 the first component which explains 33 8 of the total variance within the dataset is characterized by high positive loadings for tp dp srp dop and no3 concentration the second component explaining 15 7 of the variance characterizes positive dependence of bn from tn nitrate nitrite ions and doc concentration fig 8 the ordination of samples and physical variables of water on the pca biplot is displayed in fig 9 samples taken from the rheocrenes are concentrated in the middle part of the biplot fig 9a bn is generally positively correlated with the concentration of most nitrogen compounds fig 9b and the hydrolytic activity of bacteria is positively correlated with phosphorus compounds mainly dop the presence of doc compounds proved to be the most disturbing factor in the development of forest spring bacteria fig 9b 5 discussion springs can be extremely long lived habitats and support specialised communities of invertebrates lower plants and microorganisms including species that are now exceedingly rare elsewhere water in springs arises from groundwater and is usually cold throughout the year unpolluted and well oxygenated with excellent clarity however it is vulnerable to damage due to changes in land management as well as due to changes in the supply and quality of groundwater therefore the kflp being a mosaic of habitats and different ways of using the land is a good place to recognize factors affecting bacterioplankton in spring water springs are a specific environment for bacterial life this environment has intermediate features between ground and surface water the average bn in springs of the kflp during the entire research period was about 0 9 106 cells cm 3 table 2 this value is one of the highest recorded in the springs in the waters of upland and mountain areas bn is usually much lower ranging from several dozen to several hundred thousand cells per milliliter sinreich et al 2014 elevated bn in studied crenological objects is mainly the result of geochemical processes taking place in the direct forested catchment of the spring and within usually shallow and wide spring niches these phenomenon can by modified by the availability of om and nutrients the lowland spring niches like those found in kflp are usually covered with vast shallow water that has a high content of detritus and are often overgrown with macrophytes puczko et al 2018 as it was estimated by duarte et al 2010 in macrophyte dominated spring systems assuming that even 17 of macrophyte primary production can be lost as dissolved organic matter which can be the basis for faster bacterial growth elevated bn may also indicate the appearance of mesophilic bacteria besides the psychrophilic bacteria due to a higher water temperature in kflp table 1 niches than in fissure or karst springs in the case of the studied typically lowland springs elevated bn are also favored by the extent of the hyporheic zone whose role in shaping of the water quality and complexes of organisms is often unappreciated jekatierynczuk rudczyk 2010 zieliński and jekatierynczuk rudczyk 2010 several organisms i e invertebrates and bacteria of this zone were considered good ecological indicators of groundwater surface water ecosystems stein et al 2010 however values of bn in water of the kflp springs is several times lower than it is in the region s surface waters zieliński and leśniewska 2006 the springs of the knyszyn forest are less exposed to anthropogenic pressure in comparison to those from neighboring urbanized areas e g nearby białystok city 300 000 inhabitants this is evidenced by differences in water quality obtained for many parameters and crenophytes puczko et al 2018 as we expected the largest bn were recorded in outflows located in areas with significant anthropogenic transformations rural and wasteland springs table 3 such a bn value may result from the surface runoff and rinsing of microorganisms from decomposing organic residues sewage and animal waste the lowest number of bacteria was found in meadows table 3 in which the concentration of nutrients and organic compounds were very high table 3a similar regularities were observed by findlay et al 2001 for different landcovers in new zealand on the other hand clear relationships between water quality parameters e g dissolved silicate fig 4 or hco3 fig 5 and bn can be observed in the meadow springs this demonstrates the high dynamics of biogeochemical changes occurring in these environments the sources of silicates are sedimentary rocks from which these ions are washed away their amount may depend on the degree of fragmentation of the rocks forming the saturation zone it is possible that increased bn is associated with the development of diatoms which can be a source of readily available om for bacteria there are numerous reports on the intensive development of diatoms in lowland springs wojtal and sobczyk 2012 wojtal 2013 grabowska et al 2016 in the case of bicarbonate ions observed correlation fig 5 is partly the result of organic matter decomposition by bacteria and can also stem from geological formations through which groundwater flows additionally their content may be a result of increased respiration and a long lasting lack of precipitation groundwater status in highly urbanized and farmland areas is especially affected by anthropogenic influence due to diffuse pollution from agricultural practices and wastewater appelo et al 1994 de caro et al 2017 superficial aquifers rarely reflect the natural concentration of hydrochemical parameters which is typical for kflp whereas only deep aquifers can be free of anthropogenic impacts müller et al 2006 despite the fact that rural areas had the highest bn value ba in this type of land use was the lowest fig 2 which may be the result of land transformations the chemical structure of organic matter or permanent hydrological stress allochtonous bacteria in connection with hydrological stress are present in the water in dormant form and their activity is reduced to the minimal level with lower efficiency of springs leaching of dissolved organic matter and bacteria cells from the catchment is limited table 3 3a which can result with decrease in hydrolytic activity fig 2 in addition this indicates that the aquatic environment for most of the recorded bacteria is not natural a change in bacteria s habitat is associated with the emergence of stress a similar stress phenomenon was observed in lowland river during hydrological drought which had a significant effect on the doc concentration and bacteria zielinski et al 2016 the highest ba was recorded in springs located on wasteland fig 2 springs of forest areas are usually characterized by better water quality due to the lack of land transformation as a result of smaller human activity jekatierynczuk rudczyk 1999 2010 the presence of higher bn in natural outflows of groundwater may be also a result of the use of springs by wild animals e g as a waterhole or feeding place for beavers such a phenomenon can be observed in some kflp springs located in nature reserves where beaver lodges have periodically changed the nature of outflows from the rheocrene to artificial limnocrene there was a negative correlation observed between the bn and nitrite nitrogen concentration in the meadow springs r 0 44 p 0 005 this correlation can confirm the intensive nitrification processes occurring in meadow springs nitrification is carried out under aerobic conditions there was a quite high concentration of dissolved oxygen in the kflp springs table 1 which accelerated the course of this process the content of inorganic nitrogen including ammonium ions table 3a was higher in the meadow niches in comparison to the other forms of land use much lower concentration of tin in forest niches table 3a are evidence of a lack of anthropogenic pollution chomutowska and kryjan 2014 these slightly human impacted kflp springs and their watersheds still maintain their capacity to buffer excess nutrient loads soana et al 2017 the opposite situation was observed in florida s springs where a significant increase in no3 concentration was observed due to anthropogenic transformations thus changes together with flow reduction were reflected in intensive ecological modifications hensley and cohen 2017 such scenario seems to be very likely in the near future for more anthropogenically transformed kflp springs among the natural outflows of groundwater located in rural areas there was a positive correlation between the bn and the concentration of dissolved phosphorus r 0 61 p 0 005 probably bacteria present in these areas are functioning under phosphorus deficit conditions therefore they must obtain this element in the form of dissolved phosphorus the process of organic matter mineralization is an important source for example phosphates can be released from humic mineral organic complexes górniak 1996 the most popular hydrobiological type of springs in the kflp are rheocrenes as a flowing spring emerges into one rarely more stream channels and helocrenes usually emerge from low gradient wetlands helocrenes of kflp have low oxygen concentrations they support species characteristic of wetlands and primarily support bacteria table 4 limnocrenes are the smallest group of kflp springs were created naturally or as the effect of beaver lodges a comparison of bn in three hydrobiological types of springs helocrene rheocrene and limnocrene revealed no statistically significant differences in the case of kflp typically lowland springs despite the different development of niches their hydrology as well as geological material and its graining cause bn unification in three types of springs stoch et al 2016 some kind of differentiation is observed in terms of cv table 4 it is very likely that all year more detailed research on hydrobiological spring types would reveal larger and significant differences perhaps the limnocren and helocrene springs investigated groups were too small to highlight the expected differences therefore this aspect requires further analysis with the increase of bn in the rheocrene springs significant decrease of ba was noted fig 3 august 2015 was a period of hydrological drought then spring niches were smaller in size and hydrological stress availability of organic matter probably occurred which is why despite large bn their activity decreased although limnocrene springs may contain pond and aquatic species their relatively uniform low temperature and stable water quality fig 7a may result in the presence of species different from those in other types or in an adjacent surface waters springflow dominated springs may be stable enough habitats to allow for evolutionary microadaptation and ultimately speciation whereas surface flow dominated systems are typically occupied by weedy generalist species mccabe 1998 different types of channels along this continuum are distinctively different in turn influencing the types of micro habits that exist in them griffiths and pavajeau 2008 the main factors limiting bacterial growth in springs environment are habitat conditions including temperature oxygen and organic matter level or the availability of nutrients fig 6 7 8 9 in the studied kflp springs due to the fact that the temperature does not exceed 15 c even during the warmest summer period table 1 psychrophilic bacteria are most likely to dominate the concentration of dissolved oxygen and saturation in the waters of kflp springs were relatively high as for groundwater table 1 the main source of oxygen in this type of lowland spring is usually atmospheric air in contact with shallow groundwater through the aeration zone oxygen conditions in studied waters significantly affected bacterioplankton activity fig 6 redox conditions depend mainly on temperature the depth of the groundwater level and the rate at which surface water in the spring niche mixes with outflowing groundwater chomutowska and kryjan 2014 presented studies confirm the high sensitivity of lowland springs to anthropogenic changes this knowledge can help to better understand specific bacterioplankton role in biogeochemical cycling in forest springs and appropriate management of these threatened environments 6 conclusions the best reflection of the habitat quality within lowland springs is their hydrobiological typology helocrene rheocrene and limnocrene despite the differing development of spring niches their hydrology as well as geological material and its graining favors the unification of the bacterial number the number of bacteria cells was positively correlated with the concentration of some nitrogen compounds and the hydrolytic activity of bacteria with phosphorus compounds mainly dissolved organic phosphorus the presence of doc turned out to be the most disturbing factor in the development of springs bacteria concentrations of these parameters in the water are conditioned by management of the direct springs catchment in rheocrene springs bacterial activity during hydrological stress is clearly lower despite a large number of bacterial cells in the water lowland springs are a very sensitive objects to changes in land use which has a significant impact on water quality and thus the number and activity of bacteria conflict of interest none declared

1054,the paper summarises the results of bacteriological and hydrochemical studies on the lowland springs in the big forest complex of the podlasie region in ne poland in this area 75 springs were investigated in the summer period of 2014 and 2015 to determine bacterial number biomass and hydrolytic activity all investigated objects were categorized by direct catchment land use and hydrobiological type the number and biomass of bacteria in the water of the investigated springs is much smaller than in other types of surface water in lowland areas and ranges from 0 29 to 2 94 106 cells cm 3 the best reflection of the habitat quality within lowland groundwater outflows is their hydrobiological typology helocrene rheocrene and limnocrene despite differing development of spring niches their hydrology as well as the geological material and its graining cause unification of the bacterial numbers the number of bacteria cells were correlated with the concentration of some nitrogen compounds nh4 no2 and the hydrolytic activity of bacteria with phosphorus compounds mainly dissolved phosphorus the presence of dissolved organic carbon compounds turned out to be the most disturbing factor in the development of bacterioplankton concentrations of these parameters were found to be conditioned by the management of the direct outflow catchment furthermore in rheocrene springs bacterial activity during hydrological stress is clearly lower despite a large number of bacterial cells in the water r 0 38 p 0 005 our results show that lowland springs are a very sensitive objects to changes in land use which has a significant impact on water quality and thus the number and activity of bacteria 1 introduction springs are complex ecosystems characterized by thermal stability a patchy ecotonal structure rich biodiversity and a high occurrence of rare and often endemic species cantonati et al 2012 however springs are habitats still neglected by researchers and nature conservation services over the past several decades many springs have exhibited an alarming transition state due to changes in land development and hydrological alterations resulting mainly from the lowering of the groundwater table hensley and cohen 2017 within microbial communities impacts from land use are mirrored by higher bacterial number and biodiversity values that are atypical in the pristine groundwater of comparable systems stein et al 2010 large forest complexes are areas in which changes resulting from economic and hydrological factors are still barely visible in the past few decades interest in bacteria living in freshwater has increased mainly for sanitary and epidemiological reasons however most of the research has concerned lakes okoniewska et al 2011 makarewicz 2004 rivers chomutowska 2009 and dam reservoirs zieliński and leśniewska 2006 in particular sources of drinking water there are only a few references to the abundance biomass and activity of bacteria in natural outflows of groundwater literature data concern mainly hot and mineral springs used in balneology tekere et al 2015 panda et al 2016 springs must actually be considered ecosystems harbouring indigenous biocenoses danielopol et al 2003 danielopol and griebler 2008 in this case the microbiological status of groundwater not only should examine the presence of pathogenic i e faecal microorganisms but should also address the issue of naturally occurring bacteria sinreich et al 2014 each water reservoir has diverse physicochemical conditions that affect microflora de caro et al 2017 in groundwater fed springs habitat features are determined primarily by a complex combination of geomorphic features and physicochemical parameters serov et al 2012 stoch et al 2016 due to the oligotrophic nature of the majority of springs the microflora is not very diverse it is assumed that the number of bacteria cells is dependent mainly on the content and quality of available organic matter om del giorgio and davis 2003 duarte et al 2010 the amount of om in springs is usually very low and the bacterial number bn does not exceed 1 106 cells cm 3 in contaminated water the population of bacterioplankton can reach several million cells cm 3 hydrology is an important factor controlling the export of om crucial to bacterial growth wet organic soils accumulate detritus faster than they can mineralize it and thus om is more available for export freeman et al 2001 export may vary among neighbouring spring catchments due to differences in hydrology or other factors such as watershed size or the areal extent of wetlands and their proximity to surface water jansson et al 2008 the presence and activity of bacteria in water also depends on biotic fauna flora plankton and abiotic factors temperature water acidity dissolved oxygen content solar irradiation mineral composition etc the bn depends primarily on the content and concentration of the nutrients in the settled waters in general spring waters are not considered to be a very variable environment over time in terms of hydrochemistry in this case lowland springs are an exception in this respect shallow lowland groundwater flowing to the surface is characterized by a relatively high nutrients content and consists changes in their concentration during the year that often exceed 100 jekatierynczuk rudczyk 2010 in this study the number biomass and hydrolytic activity of bacteria were investigated in the natural groundwater outflows of large forest complex in ne poland the aim of this study was to evaluate the bacterial abundance and hydrolytic activity of bacteria in lowland springs characterized with different land use of direct catchment and representing different hydrobiological types we also wanted to identify hydrochemical parameters influencing bacterioplankton growth and bacterial hydrolytic activity in forest springs during the summer season 2 study area the study was conducted in north eastern poland in the area of a large protected forest complex known as knyszyn forest landscape park kflp fig 1 knyszyn forest is the second largest forest complex after białowieża forest in the podlasie province ne poland and covers an area of over 126 000 ha knyszyn forest is also included in the natura 2000 network this area is distinguished by a complex hydrographic network owing its shape to varied terrain formed during the weichselian glaciation the area is characterized by the presence of moraine plateaus the slopes of which are cut by numerous small river valleys quaternary deposits in kflp were formed during the pleistocene glaciations and their thickness varies from 130 to 220 m banaszuk 1995 hydrogeological map of poland 2009 they are represented by boulder clay gravel and sandy formations mud and silt deposits and varved clays the upper narew river catchment and especially the supraśl river catchment are richly carved similar to areas from the last glaciation period musiał 1992 mojski 2005 the diversity of the terrain has resulted in numerous springs the main and most important groundwater environments in north eastern poland are quaternary formations their porous character is the common feature of groundwater in the region they occur mainly in the infiltration equilibrium and the hardest occurring aquifer appears in sands and gravels deposited on the clays of the warta glaciation jekatierynczuk rudczyk 2010 the outflows of groundwater in the study area are usually located on the slopes of river valleys and occasionally in the valley bottom and riverbed jekatierynczuk rudczyk et al 2017 jonczak 2013 in kflp a majority of natural springs are of the valley type the yield of the forest springs varies from 0 02 to 27 dm3 s 1 however the most common yield for the forest springs is 0 1 to 0 5 dm3 s 1 jekatierynczuk rudczyk 2010 puczko et al 2018 the dominating influence on the shaping of water efficiency is exerted by climate characterized by the greatest impact of continentalism in poland on the investigated area podlasie province has a moderate transitional climate that is markedly influenced by continentalism górniak 2000 the average annual air temperature over many years is 6 8 c in białystok with an annual rainfall of 600 650 mm górniak 2000 in 2014 2015 the average annual air temperature was much higher 8 6 c while the average annual sum of atmospheric precipitation was relatively small and amounted to just over 530 mm 3 methods field studies were conducted during the summer period of two years 2014 and 2015 the research was carried out in august 2014 7 8 20 21 when 35 springs were investigated and in august 2015 4 5 6 10 when 40 additional springs were sampled the distribution of studied springs in the knyszyn forest is shown on the map fig 1 the vast majority of the examined natural outflows of groundwater are located in forested areas the surface area and saturation zone structure of the spring niches were investigated and specified directly in the field in each of the studied niches the following three zones can be distinguished exfiltration of groundwater in the foot slope zones the hyporheic zone covering niche bottoms and the stream flowing out of the channel head referring to the location of spring niches and land use of their direct catchment we divided investigated springs for four areas forest meadow wasteland rural area classification of springs was based on topographic map analyzes and field observations the best reflection of the nature of the habitat in the niches of lowland springs is the hydrobiological classification proposed by thienemann 1926 according to this classification all 75 investigated springs were divided for three groups a rheocrenes as a flowing springs emerges into one or more stream channels springer et al 2008 b helocrenes springs usually emerge from low gradient wetlands often indistinct or multiple sources with marshy or wet meadow settings springer and stevens 2009 c limnocrenes occur where discharge from confined or unconfined aquifers emerges as one or more lentic pools studies have not been conducted in the outflow zone where habitat conditions were considerably altered due to an increased flow rate measurements of physical parameters temperature electrolytic conductivity ec ph dissolved oxygen do concentration and saturation were carried out directly in the field using an hq40d multi meter hach lange gmbh the basic discharge measurement of the springs were carried out using the container stopwatch method the water samples were collected into sterile 1 liter plastic bottles then they were transported to the laboratory where further analyses were carried out formalin preserved and 4 6 diamidino 2 phenyloindole dapi stained samples were counted for bacterial number bn with olympus epifluorescence microscopy bx61 japan using the porter and feig 1980 method bacterial biomass bb was calculated from bn according to method by thiel nielsen and søndergaard 1998 the general hydrolase bacterial activity ba in spring waters was determined only in 2015 40 springs using the fluorescein diacetate fda method fda is a non specific substrate for hydrolases and it was applied using a modified method described by adam and duncan 2001 after burkowska but et al 2014 after adding 50 μl fda then samples were incubated in the dark for 1 hour at 30 c the fluorescence intensity was measured using a specramax m2 spectrofluorometer at an emission wavelength of 505 nm and at an excitation wavelength of 480 nm the main hydrochemical parameters were determined within ca 24 hours of sampling to avoid sample deterioration on storage using standard methods described in apha 2001 bicarbonate hco3 content was measured by titration with 0 01 m hydrochloric acid using methyl orange as an indicator the concentration of iron ions fe3 was measured spectrophotometrically using the 1 10 phenanthroline method for phosphorus p determination two measurements were made soluble reactive p srp in below 0 45 µm fraction dissolved p dp sample below 0 45 µm and total p tp unfiltered sample both mineralized by peroxodisulphate uv digestion the srp dp and tp fractions were analyzed spectrophotometrically with the molybdenum blue method dissolved organic phosphorus dop was calculated as the difference between dp and srp particulate phosphorus pp was calculated as the difference between tp and dp nitrogen n forms were analyzed spectrophotometrically using reagents by riedel de häen according to the following methods nh4 indophenol blue method no2 with sulphanilic acid by the chromotropic acid method no3 with n 1 naphthyl ethylenediamine with the zinc catalyst method the total inorganic nitrogen tin concentration was calculated as the sum of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n analyses of dissolved organic carbon doc total nitrogen tn concentrations were carried out using the high temperature catalytic combustion method with a shimadzu carbon analyzer toc l japan water samples for doc determinations were filtered through a 0 45 µm filter acidified with 2 m hcl to about ph 2 and rinsed with pure nitrogen to remove traces of inorganic carbon water colour in platinum scale was determined spectrophotometrically using hongve and åkesson 1996 method specific uv absorbance suva was used to evaluate aromaticity of organic matter for this purpose the uv absorbance was normalized to doc of the sample suva values were computed using the formula suva a b s 260 1000 d o c abs260 gc 1 chin et al 1994 modified the statistical analyses were conducted with the application of xlstat 2016 1 and ps imago 4 0 spearman correlation was used to find relationships between the bn or ba and the hydrochemical parameters of spring water principal component analysis pca ouyang 2005 and principal factor analysis pfa were used to determine the number of principal components or factors to be retained for further study a commonly used criterion for the number of factors to rotate is the eigenvalues greater than one rule proposed by kaiser 1960 an eigenvalue less than one implies that the scores on the component would have negative reliability and there are as many reliable factors as there are eigenvalues greater than one cliff 1988 the variability of the distribution of the main analysed parameters was described with the coefficient of variation cv defined as the ratio of the standard variation from a given sample to its arithmetic mean and expressed as a percent value subrahmanya nairy and aruna rao 2003 4 results during low groundwater level in the summers of 2014 and 2015 the spring yields of the knyszyn forest mostly oscillated between 0 5 and 2 0 dm3 s 1 in the alekin classification tested waters belonged to the bicarbonate class c from the ca group of the second type r hco3 r ca2 mg2 r hco3 r so4 2 c ii ca they were two or three ion water types hco3 ca hco3 ca mg the average water temperature in the analyzed springs during the summers of 2014 and 2015 was 14 3 c in the complex of the most efficient springs the summer water temperature fluctuated around 9 c in most springs the water was slightly alkaline ph 7 82 with moderate water oxygen saturation 62 and concentration of dissolved mineral compounds ec 400 µs cm 1 the redox potential was characterised within wide limits slightly above 50 mv on average table 1 relatively high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds were also reported in kflp springs table 1 statistical analyses show that the concentration of mineral and organic forms of these nutrients exceeded average values conditioning exceptionally high fertility of the spring niches environment in over 70 of samples the average summer concentration of doc in kflp springs water exceeded 4 mg dm 3 in some groundwater outflows most often in the form of a bog spring or located in peaty areas the concentration of doc exceeded 10 mg dm 3 a different quality of dissolved organic matter in these springs was demonstrated by suva reaching an average of 23 abs260 gc 1 but the range of variation of this parameter was very wide from 1 to 32 abs260 gc 1 the colour of the water was also characterized by high variability reaching over 15 mgpt dm 3 on average table 1 the average value of bn in the studied kflp springs during the 2014 and 2015 summer research was 0 88 106 cells cm 3 the bn values ranged from 0 29 106 cells cm 3 in outflow in sokołda site no 25 to 2 94 106 cells cm 3 in the sampling station in radulin site no 10 the coefficient of variation for this parameter was over 48 table 2 the average bb was 30 96 μgc dm 3 the minimum value of bb was only 10 32 μgc dm 3 and the maximum was almost 10 fold higher and concerned the same springs as those in the case of bn table 2 during analysis of the average number of bacterioplankton in the springs located in areas with different land use small differences were found among the types of studied environments the highest average bn value was recorded in springs located in rural areas amounted to 1 106 cells cm 3 while the cv was 34 table 3 in typical forest springs the bn was 0 87 106 cells cm 3 table 3 similar mean bn values were recorded in springs of wasteland areas however the variability of this parameter within forest areas was the largest amounting to over 47 the lowest average bn value was recorded in springs located on meadows table 3 some hydrochemical parameters of water in kflp springs with different types of catchment use show statistically significant differences we have observed that doc concentration in meadow springs is statistically significant different than in other land use types table 3a mean concentration of tp is two times higher in springs located in forested and rural areas then in meadows and wastelands no statistically significant differences were found in the case of tin tn and srp concentrations table 3a a comparison of the average values of hydrolytic ba in springs functioning in different areas found that mean values in the case of forest meadow and wasteland oscillated around 4 μgfl cm 3 h 1 fig 2 the coefficient of variation was 58 75 however the average value of ba in the springs in built up having significant human activity rural areas was 3 04 μgfl cm 3 h 1 during comparison of bn in three hydrobiological spring types the highest mean value was observed in helocrenes 0 94 106 cells cm 3 which were also characterized by the highest variability over 45 the value of bn in helocrenes fluctuated from 0 29 106 cells cm 3 to 2 94 106 cells cm 3 table 4 mean values of bn in rheocrenes and limnocrenes were similar 0 87 106 cells cm 3 and 0 85 106 cells cm 3 respectively table 4 higher than average hydrolytic activity of bacteria characterized rheocrenes rather than helocrenes of 3 98 μgfl cm 3 h 1 and 3 59 μgfl cm 3 h 1 respectively the highest coefficient of variation was found for helocrenes 66 89 table 5 an interesting observation was noted in springs classified as rheocrene where negative relationship between ba and bn was described fig 3 in kflp springs located in meadows we observed positive correlation between silicates concentration in water and bn r 0 474 p 0 005 fig 4 it this same type of springs statistically significant positive correlation between bn and bicarbonate concentration was observed fig 5 the pca analysis showed a small effect of the physical properties of water on the number and activity of bacteria in lowland springs fig 6 7 a b table 6 presents the eigenvalues variance and cumulative variance the eigenvectors of the individual physical water quality parameters are shown in fig 6 the first component which explains 27 6 of the total variance within the dataset is characterized by high positive loading for bn water temperature ph and ec the second component explaining 22 7 of the variance characterizes a high positive impact of oxygen conditions temperature and ph on ba fig 6 the ordination of samples and variables on the pca biplot is displayed in fig 7a b samples from limnocrenes are situated mostly on the left side of the biplot fig 7a samples taken from the rheocrenes and helocrenes are found side by side without showing dependence on the water s physical features a much greater influence on the number bn and hydrolytic activity of bacteria ba in the water of lowland kflp springs was demonstrated in relation to the content of different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus fig 8 9 a b positive correlation between bn and nh4 in 2014 r 0 37 p 0 005 or negative correlation in the meadow springs between bn and no2 r 0 44 p 0 005 were noted table 7 presents the eigenvalues variance and cumulative variance the eigenvectors of individual hydrochemical parameters are shown in fig 8 the first component which explains 33 8 of the total variance within the dataset is characterized by high positive loadings for tp dp srp dop and no3 concentration the second component explaining 15 7 of the variance characterizes positive dependence of bn from tn nitrate nitrite ions and doc concentration fig 8 the ordination of samples and physical variables of water on the pca biplot is displayed in fig 9 samples taken from the rheocrenes are concentrated in the middle part of the biplot fig 9a bn is generally positively correlated with the concentration of most nitrogen compounds fig 9b and the hydrolytic activity of bacteria is positively correlated with phosphorus compounds mainly dop the presence of doc compounds proved to be the most disturbing factor in the development of forest spring bacteria fig 9b 5 discussion springs can be extremely long lived habitats and support specialised communities of invertebrates lower plants and microorganisms including species that are now exceedingly rare elsewhere water in springs arises from groundwater and is usually cold throughout the year unpolluted and well oxygenated with excellent clarity however it is vulnerable to damage due to changes in land management as well as due to changes in the supply and quality of groundwater therefore the kflp being a mosaic of habitats and different ways of using the land is a good place to recognize factors affecting bacterioplankton in spring water springs are a specific environment for bacterial life this environment has intermediate features between ground and surface water the average bn in springs of the kflp during the entire research period was about 0 9 106 cells cm 3 table 2 this value is one of the highest recorded in the springs in the waters of upland and mountain areas bn is usually much lower ranging from several dozen to several hundred thousand cells per milliliter sinreich et al 2014 elevated bn in studied crenological objects is mainly the result of geochemical processes taking place in the direct forested catchment of the spring and within usually shallow and wide spring niches these phenomenon can by modified by the availability of om and nutrients the lowland spring niches like those found in kflp are usually covered with vast shallow water that has a high content of detritus and are often overgrown with macrophytes puczko et al 2018 as it was estimated by duarte et al 2010 in macrophyte dominated spring systems assuming that even 17 of macrophyte primary production can be lost as dissolved organic matter which can be the basis for faster bacterial growth elevated bn may also indicate the appearance of mesophilic bacteria besides the psychrophilic bacteria due to a higher water temperature in kflp table 1 niches than in fissure or karst springs in the case of the studied typically lowland springs elevated bn are also favored by the extent of the hyporheic zone whose role in shaping of the water quality and complexes of organisms is often unappreciated jekatierynczuk rudczyk 2010 zieliński and jekatierynczuk rudczyk 2010 several organisms i e invertebrates and bacteria of this zone were considered good ecological indicators of groundwater surface water ecosystems stein et al 2010 however values of bn in water of the kflp springs is several times lower than it is in the region s surface waters zieliński and leśniewska 2006 the springs of the knyszyn forest are less exposed to anthropogenic pressure in comparison to those from neighboring urbanized areas e g nearby białystok city 300 000 inhabitants this is evidenced by differences in water quality obtained for many parameters and crenophytes puczko et al 2018 as we expected the largest bn were recorded in outflows located in areas with significant anthropogenic transformations rural and wasteland springs table 3 such a bn value may result from the surface runoff and rinsing of microorganisms from decomposing organic residues sewage and animal waste the lowest number of bacteria was found in meadows table 3 in which the concentration of nutrients and organic compounds were very high table 3a similar regularities were observed by findlay et al 2001 for different landcovers in new zealand on the other hand clear relationships between water quality parameters e g dissolved silicate fig 4 or hco3 fig 5 and bn can be observed in the meadow springs this demonstrates the high dynamics of biogeochemical changes occurring in these environments the sources of silicates are sedimentary rocks from which these ions are washed away their amount may depend on the degree of fragmentation of the rocks forming the saturation zone it is possible that increased bn is associated with the development of diatoms which can be a source of readily available om for bacteria there are numerous reports on the intensive development of diatoms in lowland springs wojtal and sobczyk 2012 wojtal 2013 grabowska et al 2016 in the case of bicarbonate ions observed correlation fig 5 is partly the result of organic matter decomposition by bacteria and can also stem from geological formations through which groundwater flows additionally their content may be a result of increased respiration and a long lasting lack of precipitation groundwater status in highly urbanized and farmland areas is especially affected by anthropogenic influence due to diffuse pollution from agricultural practices and wastewater appelo et al 1994 de caro et al 2017 superficial aquifers rarely reflect the natural concentration of hydrochemical parameters which is typical for kflp whereas only deep aquifers can be free of anthropogenic impacts müller et al 2006 despite the fact that rural areas had the highest bn value ba in this type of land use was the lowest fig 2 which may be the result of land transformations the chemical structure of organic matter or permanent hydrological stress allochtonous bacteria in connection with hydrological stress are present in the water in dormant form and their activity is reduced to the minimal level with lower efficiency of springs leaching of dissolved organic matter and bacteria cells from the catchment is limited table 3 3a which can result with decrease in hydrolytic activity fig 2 in addition this indicates that the aquatic environment for most of the recorded bacteria is not natural a change in bacteria s habitat is associated with the emergence of stress a similar stress phenomenon was observed in lowland river during hydrological drought which had a significant effect on the doc concentration and bacteria zielinski et al 2016 the highest ba was recorded in springs located on wasteland fig 2 springs of forest areas are usually characterized by better water quality due to the lack of land transformation as a result of smaller human activity jekatierynczuk rudczyk 1999 2010 the presence of higher bn in natural outflows of groundwater may be also a result of the use of springs by wild animals e g as a waterhole or feeding place for beavers such a phenomenon can be observed in some kflp springs located in nature reserves where beaver lodges have periodically changed the nature of outflows from the rheocrene to artificial limnocrene there was a negative correlation observed between the bn and nitrite nitrogen concentration in the meadow springs r 0 44 p 0 005 this correlation can confirm the intensive nitrification processes occurring in meadow springs nitrification is carried out under aerobic conditions there was a quite high concentration of dissolved oxygen in the kflp springs table 1 which accelerated the course of this process the content of inorganic nitrogen including ammonium ions table 3a was higher in the meadow niches in comparison to the other forms of land use much lower concentration of tin in forest niches table 3a are evidence of a lack of anthropogenic pollution chomutowska and kryjan 2014 these slightly human impacted kflp springs and their watersheds still maintain their capacity to buffer excess nutrient loads soana et al 2017 the opposite situation was observed in florida s springs where a significant increase in no3 concentration was observed due to anthropogenic transformations thus changes together with flow reduction were reflected in intensive ecological modifications hensley and cohen 2017 such scenario seems to be very likely in the near future for more anthropogenically transformed kflp springs among the natural outflows of groundwater located in rural areas there was a positive correlation between the bn and the concentration of dissolved phosphorus r 0 61 p 0 005 probably bacteria present in these areas are functioning under phosphorus deficit conditions therefore they must obtain this element in the form of dissolved phosphorus the process of organic matter mineralization is an important source for example phosphates can be released from humic mineral organic complexes górniak 1996 the most popular hydrobiological type of springs in the kflp are rheocrenes as a flowing spring emerges into one rarely more stream channels and helocrenes usually emerge from low gradient wetlands helocrenes of kflp have low oxygen concentrations they support species characteristic of wetlands and primarily support bacteria table 4 limnocrenes are the smallest group of kflp springs were created naturally or as the effect of beaver lodges a comparison of bn in three hydrobiological types of springs helocrene rheocrene and limnocrene revealed no statistically significant differences in the case of kflp typically lowland springs despite the different development of niches their hydrology as well as geological material and its graining cause bn unification in three types of springs stoch et al 2016 some kind of differentiation is observed in terms of cv table 4 it is very likely that all year more detailed research on hydrobiological spring types would reveal larger and significant differences perhaps the limnocren and helocrene springs investigated groups were too small to highlight the expected differences therefore this aspect requires further analysis with the increase of bn in the rheocrene springs significant decrease of ba was noted fig 3 august 2015 was a period of hydrological drought then spring niches were smaller in size and hydrological stress availability of organic matter probably occurred which is why despite large bn their activity decreased although limnocrene springs may contain pond and aquatic species their relatively uniform low temperature and stable water quality fig 7a may result in the presence of species different from those in other types or in an adjacent surface waters springflow dominated springs may be stable enough habitats to allow for evolutionary microadaptation and ultimately speciation whereas surface flow dominated systems are typically occupied by weedy generalist species mccabe 1998 different types of channels along this continuum are distinctively different in turn influencing the types of micro habits that exist in them griffiths and pavajeau 2008 the main factors limiting bacterial growth in springs environment are habitat conditions including temperature oxygen and organic matter level or the availability of nutrients fig 6 7 8 9 in the studied kflp springs due to the fact that the temperature does not exceed 15 c even during the warmest summer period table 1 psychrophilic bacteria are most likely to dominate the concentration of dissolved oxygen and saturation in the waters of kflp springs were relatively high as for groundwater table 1 the main source of oxygen in this type of lowland spring is usually atmospheric air in contact with shallow groundwater through the aeration zone oxygen conditions in studied waters significantly affected bacterioplankton activity fig 6 redox conditions depend mainly on temperature the depth of the groundwater level and the rate at which surface water in the spring niche mixes with outflowing groundwater chomutowska and kryjan 2014 presented studies confirm the high sensitivity of lowland springs to anthropogenic changes this knowledge can help to better understand specific bacterioplankton role in biogeochemical cycling in forest springs and appropriate management of these threatened environments 6 conclusions the best reflection of the habitat quality within lowland springs is their hydrobiological typology helocrene rheocrene and limnocrene despite the differing development of spring niches their hydrology as well as geological material and its graining favors the unification of the bacterial number the number of bacteria cells was positively correlated with the concentration of some nitrogen compounds and the hydrolytic activity of bacteria with phosphorus compounds mainly dissolved organic phosphorus the presence of doc turned out to be the most disturbing factor in the development of springs bacteria concentrations of these parameters in the water are conditioned by management of the direct springs catchment in rheocrene springs bacterial activity during hydrological stress is clearly lower despite a large number of bacterial cells in the water lowland springs are a very sensitive objects to changes in land use which has a significant impact on water quality and thus the number and activity of bacteria conflict of interest none declared
