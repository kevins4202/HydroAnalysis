associated with dense population high crop yield and advanced economies thus polders are likely to suffer serious life and financial losses in case of natural disaster this risk has raised special concern in the south of china which includes thousands of polders with a total population of 0 48 billion people accurate identification and assessment of the effects of the key factors affecting hydrological processes are vital to develop early warning system and provide enough preparation time for flooding and water pollution especially in the context of accelerated global climate and land use changes a variety of researches have focused on the impacts of driving factors on the hydrological processes of freely draining catchments by applying various methods such as sensitivity and comparative analysis de paulo rodrigues da silva et al 2018 hesse et al 2008 huang et al 2016a jiang et al 2009 kim et al 2005 lintern et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 however efforts to evaluate the relationship between driving factors and hydrological processes and then identify principal factors especially for lowland polders are complicated odongo et al 2014 for the following reasons firstly a polder is strongly affected not only by natural factors but also by human factors lai et al 2018 normally asian polders are situated in subtropical monsoon areas with drastic fluctuations in seasonal precipitation and temperature that challenge the analysis of the relationship between drivers and hydrological processes moreover the polder water exchange with surrounding rivers is highly regulated by water management through pump discharge and irrigation hesse et al 2008 vernooij and vermaat 2009 such regulation complicates the hydrological response to changes in driving factors in polders secondly the driving forces of hydrological processes have nonlinear influences on the hydrological cycle amorocho 1973 builes jaramillo et al 2018 khan et al 2006 lee 2005 sivakumar 2009 some threshold points around which the factor hydrological response may be totally different are likely to occur however very few papers have focused on the identification of threshold points of driving forces sivakumar 2005 thomas et al 2018 thirdly interactions among factors commonly exist zhang et al 2016 if the collinearity problem is ignored the analytical result may not be representative of the truth last but not least the scarcity of data on chinese polders restricts the improvement of studies in most cases chinese polders lack hydrological observation stations to collect continuous detailed and long term data yan et al 2016b this deficiency restricts the quantification of the relationship between drivers and hydrological cycle in response to this situation this study combines boosted regression tree brt model with the lowland polder hydrology and phosphorus modeling system phps yan et al 2017 and the polder hydrology and nitrogen modeling system phns yan et al 2020 to address the complexity nonlinearity collinearity data deficiency and identification of threshold points problems during analysis of the relationship between the hydrological cycle and driving forces in polders the brt model is a state of the art tool that combines the advances of the traditional regression model and machine learning methods elith et al 2008 rodrigues and de la riva 2014 brt can accommodate complex linear and nonlinear problems and is insensitive to collinearity problems additionally the hydrology model after calibration is often an efficient tool to produce long term data which can efficiently compensate for the insufficiency of hydrological data based on the previous works brauer et al 2014 huang et al 2016b williams and berndt 1977 yan et al 2019 proposed the phps and phns models to better describe the hydrological and water quality processes these models consider detailed polder specific natural and human characteristics and present good performance thus the calibrated phps and phns here are used to provide continuous and long term data which is the basis of the implementing brt analysis this study aimed to integrate the brt model with the phps and phns models to 1 quantify the effects of various driving factors on the main component of hydrological cycle 2 screen the principal factors influencing discharge soil erosion and nitrogen and phosphorus processes and 3 propose some strategies for the water risk management based on the analysis results this research proposes a new way to identify the key factors of polder hydrological processes and their threshold points which is of major importance for developing an early natural hazardous warning system to reduce the adverse effects of polder flooding and eutrophication our study will deepen the understanding of the relationship between the hydrological processes and driving factors and provide important references for sustainable water resources management 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the jianwei polder situated in the northwestern portion of taihu basin in southern china is an enclosed area of 1 06 105 m2 by dike which isolates the catchment from surrounding rivers to prevent inundation fig 1 the polder is a typical agricultural chinese polder in terms of hydrological conditions land use and cropping system in contrast to those of freely draining catchments the hydrological connection of the polder with its surrounding rivers are highly regulated by a culvert and three pumps p1 for floodwater drainage and p2 and p3 for agricultural irrigation during precipitation events rainfall runoff from multiple land uses is firstly delivered by ditches to ponds and then exported by a culvert or pump to the outside if the pond water level exceeds the threshold level for the starting pump during the rice growth period or culvert h s min during the wheat growth period rice wheat rotation is the cropping system for the paddy fields in this system rice is planted from june to october and wheat is planted from november to may the paddy field must maintain an appropriate ponded water depth for optimal rice growth therefore when the water depth in the paddy field decreases to lower limit of the appropriate water level h q min1 for the paddy rice irrigation water has to be pumped from the outside river to the paddy field on the contrary if the water depth in the paddy field increases to maximum submergence tolerant water level h q flood1 for rice growth drainage has to be implemented for removing surplus water inorganic fertilization nitrogen 450 kg ha yr phosphorus 7 88 kg ha yr is operated to meet crop nutrient requirements the soil texture is silt loam no industrial pollution source was observed within the polder the jianwei polder has a semi tropical monsoon climate which facilitates rice growth the average annual precipitation is 1082 mm most of which falls between march and september 2 2 data sources meteorological land use polder outlet discharge soil texture vegetation coverage and water quality data collected from the jianwei polder between jan 2014 and dec 2016 were used to drive the phps phns and brt models the meteorological data were e g precipitation pan evaporation air temperature derived from a rain gage on site and the nearest national weather station at a daily scale soil texture data was obtained from a grain size distribution analysis result of soil samples collected at g1 3 fig 1 the vegetation coverage in the ditch and pond was measured monthly at v1 5 daily

2019 2 2 polder hydrology and nitrogen modeling system phns and polder hydrology and phosphorus modeling system phps the phns with semi distributed structure and daily time steps was proposed by yan et al submitted to journal of cleaner production 2020 through coupling the walrus paddy musle and inca models fig a1 the phns model includes four water balance modules paddy field dryland residential area surface water modules and four nitrogen balance modules paddy field dryland residential area surface water modules similar to phns the phps was developed by integrating the walrus paddy musle and inca p models yan et al 2019 the phps consists of four water balance modules and four phosphorus balance modules paddy field dryland residential area surface water modules fig a2 different from

water for more information please see yan et al 2019 the phns and phps models have been calibrated and validated in the jianwei polder eastern china yan et al 2016b yan et al 2019 and the results obtained showed that the models have good performance for simulating polder discharge and phosphorus and nitrogen processes more information can be obtained from the studies of yan et al 2019 2 4 boosted regression trees brt analyses the brt model was applied to quantify the impact of driving factors on discharge soil erosion and nitrogen and phosphorus exports brt integrates the important advantages of traditional regression method and the machine learning to improve performance where a large ensemble of simple tree models is combined adaptively it handles complicated linear and nonlinear responses to various types of predictor variables without pretransformation missing data and collinearity problems brt provides excellent forecasting results and enables the reliable identification of relevant variables brt requires the user to provide the values of four parameters loss function ls learning rate lr tree complexity tc and bag fraction bf the ls indicates the nature of error distribution including the gaussian poisson and binomial distribution which can be simulated by brt lr determines the contribution of each tree to the final optimized model tc represents whether the interactions between predictor variables should be considered the combination of lr and tc controls the number of trees used for the optimal model the bf determines the proportion of data to be used for building the model at random from a full training dataset at each iteration and is defaulted to be as a value of 0 5 the optimal combination of the four parameter values is what generates the minimum forecasting error numerous combinations of different parameter values were tested finally the gaussian function 0 0001 1 and 0 5 were defined as the parameter values of ls lr tc and bf respectively to obtain the minimum deviation for discharge whilst the gaussian function 0 001 1 and 0 5 were set for these parameter values to gain minimum deviation for soil erosion nitrogen and phosphorus exports these combinations produced more than 1000 trees using a 10 foldcross validation method burden et al 1997 stone 1974 during the 10 foldcross validation procedure the dataset was randomly and equivalently separated into 10 subsets nine of 10 subsets were selected to train the model and the withheld subset was used for testing the model the cross validation process was then repeated 10 times making sure that each subset was used once as test data no fewer than 1000 trees were required in brt as recommended by elith et al 2008 we implemented brt analysis in r 3 4 4 using the gbm package ridgeway 2007 and a supplemental code provided by elith et al 2008 after reviewing previous papers studying the driving factors influencing hydrological processes genxu et al 2012 huang et al 2016a wei et al 2009 and considering the actual conditions of our study ten environmental variables including p ir1 h q min1 h q max1 h q flood1 f xg f xs h s min et pot and h s p u m p s t o p were chosen to detect the driving factors that are key to the discharge in addition to the above mentioned variables c1 and c2 were used for identifying the determinant factors of soil erosion c1 c2 t d i p fert 1 t d i p fert 2 and vi were used for phosphorus export and c1 c2 t d i n fert 1 t d i n fert 2 and vi were used for nitrogen export the meanings of each symbol can be found in table 1 discharge soil erosion nitrogen and phosphorus exports ir1 data used in the brt were obtained from the daily simulated results of phns and other variables were obtained from field monitoring these variables underwent daily variation the above mentioned data for analysis of relationship between driving factors and discharge soil erosion and phosphorus export spanned from jan 2015 to dec 2016 while those for analysis of relationship between driving factors and nitrogen export was from jan 2014 to dec 2016 3 results table 1 lists the relative importance of each factor for different hydrological components based on brt analyses weather elements exerted a 63 7 total relative effect on discharge q variation 51 5 from precipitation and 12 2 from pan evaporation specifically the discharge curve increased sharply with precipitation from 0 to 50 mm d and then stabilized when precipitation 50 mm d fig 2 discharge decreased substantially with the pan evaporation increasing from 0 to approximately 2 mm d however pan evaporation exceeding 2 mm d had a negligible impact on discharge water management factors were responsible for 36 of the total discharge q variation of which 20 9 was the h q flood1 and 15 1 was h s min when h q flood1 was greater than 58 mm and less than 55 mm the discharge was insignificantly affected by h q flood1 by comparison when h q flood1 was between the 55 mm and 58 mm discharge sharply increased fig 2 similarly discharge rapidly increased in case h s min ranged from 1450 mm to 1480 mm in contrast the remaining values of h s min slightly affected the discharge h q min1 and h q max1 respectively contributed only 0 2 and 0 1 of the explained variation implying that they were not important for interpreting the discharge variation weather elements showed a relative influence of 71 5 on the change in soil erosion precipitation and pan evaporation contributed 69 4 and 2 2 of this variation respectively two threshold points were observed on the precipitation soil erosion function curve one at 20 mm d and the other between 40 mm d and 46 mm d fig 3 when the precipitation exceeded the first threshold of 20 mm d the risk of soil erosion showed a sharp and large increase until the second threshold point of around 50 mm d thereafter the curve become flat c2 explained 17 3 of the soil loss variation soil loss generally increased with c2 until a threshold point around 0 34 h q min1 and c1 had negligible effect on soil loss variation human factors accounted for 72 4 of the nitrogen export variation 48 2 from h s p u m p s t o p and 24 2 from c1 when h s p u m p s t o p was between 1300 mm and 1800 mm the nitrogen export showed a generally increasing trend fig 4 nitrogen export curve increased substantially when c1 ranged from 0 to 0 28 and then became steady when c1 0 28 as et pot increased nitrogen export displayed two sharp change periods a decreasing one between 0 and 1 mm d and an increasing one between 1 9 and 2 1 mm d above 2 1 mm d nitrogen export became constant nitrogen export significantly increased as precipitation increased from 0 to 50 mm d whereas it reached a plateau when precipitation 50 mm d c2 and tdip fert1 contribute 34 5 and 30 7 of the variation in phosphorus export respectively c2 contributes to the increase in phosphorus export until a threshold value of approximately 0 34 fig 5 when tdip fert1 ranged from 0 to 1 10 4 kg m2 phosphorus exports increased however when tdip fert1 was larger than 1 10 4 kg m2 phosphorus exports curve stabilized precipitation caused 17 6 of the variation in phosphorus exports thus implying that the influence of precipitation is smaller than that of c2 and tdip fert1 with precipitation increasing from 0 to 50 mm d phosphorus export significantly increased but plateaued after precipitation 50 mm d as the h s min increased phosphorus export slightly increased the relative contribution of h s min to change in phosphorus export was 9 2 4 discussion 4 1 major influential factors of discharge the dominant role of weather variables 63 7 on the variation of polder discharge proved that the precipitation and evaporation substantially affected temporal change in discharge precipitation facilitated the increase in discharge until a threshold value around 50 mm d fig 2 high precipitation contributed to high discharge whereas low precipitation was related to low discharge in china polders are mainly located in rainfall dominated hydrological areas yan et al 2019 precipitation directly determines the magnitudes and fluctuations of net runoff and is therefore the most influential variable for polder discharge yan et al 2016a zhao et al 2011 pan evaporation represents the capability of water to evaporate in air due to the combined results of temperature humidity rainfall solar radiation wind etc shan et al 2015 tyagi et al 2019 yu et al 2002 and clearly had a negative influence on the discharge due to water loss however discharge curve remained stable in case the pan evaporation exceeded the threshold value of 2 mm d this effect may be because the high pan evaporation such as above 2 mm d mostly occurred on sunny days with high temperature and no precipitation liu et al 2002 thus no rainfall runoff occurred on days with pan evaporation above 2 mm d leading to the negligible correlation between pan evaporation and discharge we also noted that although irrigation was another important water input entry it had little effect on the discharge variation this was because irrigation was generally implemented when the amount of water available would not meet the water requirement for rice growth in paddy fields and irrigation water was thus intercepted by field ridge to create favorable moisture condition xie and cui 2011 accordingly no discharge occurred water resources management including h q flood1 and h s min also exerted an important influence on the discharge q variation 36 0 h q flood1 revealed a strong positive effect on the discharge when it ranged from 55 mm to 58 mm in the phns model h q flood1 means the maximum submergence tolerant water level for paddy rice once the water level in a paddy field exceeds h q flood1 the farmer has to drain excess water out of the paddy field until the water level drops to h q max1 xie and cui 2011 yan et al 2016a as a result a large h q flood1 increased the drainage volume amounts to h q flood1 minus h q max1 into surface water thereby promoting the polder discharge peak similar to h q flood1 h smin was also positively correlated with discharge h s min refers to the surface water level for starting the culvert or pump drainage at the polder outlet during heavy rainfall events runoff water from various land uses is routed and temporarily stored in the pond then in case the water level in the pond exceeds h s min the culvert or pump is initiated to drain floodwater until the water level decreases to h s p u m p s t o p huang et al 2016b here h s p u m p s t o p was often lower than h s min to drain more water in order to leave sufficient flood storage in the pond as a result a high value of h smin means more floodwater amounts to h s min minus h s p u m p s t o p is discharged into the extraterritorial area and induces a higher peak value of discharge thereby increasing the discharge variation 4 2 major influential factors of soil erosion weather elements were also variables determining soil loss at the polder precipitation had no impact on the soil erosion until it reached 20 mm d fig 3 precipitation under 20 mm hardly caused the soil denudation due to the small rainfall erosivity soil erosion increased with precipitation above 20 mm d large precipitation means high rainfall intensity which increased the erosive energy of the rainfall and consequently flushed large amounts of soil particles into the water however the soil erosion curve did not continue to increase and instead remained stable when precipitation exceeded 50 mm d because intense precipitation above 50 mm d often occurred on consecutive rainy days most of the soil particles that are easily to be eroded had already been flushed away from farmland during the initial rainfall period therefore the amount of soil erosion didn t significantly increase even when precipitation continuously increased during the later rainfall period the agricultural practices c2 also had an important influence on the soil loss variation 17 3 soil loss generally increased with c2 until it reached around 0 34 overall larger c2 was associated with more soil erosion c2 is the vegetation cover and management factor defined as the ratio of sediment loss from cropland to the corresponding loss from clean tilled continuous fallow in relation to the vegetation coverage and crop residues that protect the dryland soil from erosion in the musle model this index is calculated as the ratio of sediment loss from cropland under specific conditions to the corresponding loss from clean tilled continuously fallow land williams and berndt 1977 thus c1 or c2 approaching 0 indicate dense vegetation cover and large amounts of crop residues were retained on the soil surface increased surface roughness decreases surface splash erosion from direct raindrop bullard et al 2018 and reduces runoff velocity to inhibit the transport of detached soil particles by contrast large values of c2 indicate sparse vegetation cover and limited crop residues which consequently increase soil erosion however when c2 exceeded the threshold value of 0 34 the curve began to stabilize owing to the specific cropping system in taihu basin a c2 above 0 34 only occurred in the wheat over wintering period or reviving period during this period the crop cover was low but precipitation significantly decreased simultaneously the soil erosion caused by rainfall runoff was largely reduced and did not significantly change even as c2 increased as a result c2 was not strongly correlated with soil erosion when it was above 0 34 the effect of c1 on the paddy field was larger than that of c2 on dryland which may be due to differences in the hydrological behaviors between paddy field and dryland paddy fields are often kept ponded for optimal rice growth wu et al 2019 ponding water alleviates the splash erosion of the raindrop and weakened the correlation between the vegetation cover factor c1 and soil erosion similar to that on discharge the impact of agricultural practices on soil loss was not comparable with that of weather elements 4 3 major influential factors of nitrogen export nitrogen export was controlled by agricultural management factor h s p u m p s t o p 48 2 and c1 24 2 were the most important factors influencing temporal changes in nitrogen export in general h s p u m p s t o p generated a positive effect on temporal nitrogen export h s p u m p s t o p was the water level for stopping pump drainage when the water level decreases to h s p u m p s t o p the pump stopped pumping water and nitrogen out of polder normally h s p u m p s t o p was lower than the h s p u m p s t a r t water level for starting pump drainage to provide water holding capacity for floodwater yan et al 2016a thus a large h s p u m p s t o p increases discharge amounts to h s p u m p s t o p minus h s p u m p s t a r t and its attached nitrogen export as c1 increased until 0 28 the vegetation cover of paddy field becomes sparse fig 4 consequently more bare soil was eroded and flushed away thereby increasing the amount of nitrogen adsorbed in the soil particles exported to the surrounding river values of c1 above 0 28 mostly happened in winter or spring i e the dry period when the nitrogen export stayed at low levels because polder discharge is low due to low precipitation this state minimizes nitrogen export out of the polder even when c1 increases weather elements including precipitation and pan evaporation contributed to 16 8 of the variation in nitrogen exports similar to the responses of discharge soil erosion and phosphorus and nitrogen exports to precipitation the precipitation fitted and pan evaporation fitted functions showed threshold values of 50 mm d and 2 mm d respectively 4 4 major influential factors of phosphorus export distinct from the discharge and soil loss which primarily depended on weather variables phosphorus export was governed by agricultural practices c2 and tdip fert1 c2 was the most important contributing factor 34 5 followed by tdip fert1 30 7 in general the larger c2 and tdip fert1 are closely related to more phosphorus export a large c2 represents poor vegetation cover and low availability of crop residues which facilitated soil erosion and increases the amount of phosphorus adsorbed onto soil particles scoured into freshwater similar to the response of soil erosion to c2 there was also a threshold value of 0 34 above which the phosphorus export curve didn t continue to increase fig 5 moreover particulate phosphorus was closely associated with the soil erosion which was more dependent on c2 than on c1 section 4 2 particulate phosphorus constituted more than 70 of total phosphorus consequently c2 exerted a stronger effect on phosphorus exports than c1 tdip fert1 is the amount of inorganic phosphorus inputted into paddy field by manual fertilization in fact inorganic fertilization usually provides the largest phosphorus input into agricultural polders yan et al 2017 therefore the amount of phosphorus export was highly sensitive to a large tdip fert1 because of an increase in phosphorus availability however the relative importance of precipitation decreased from first place in the discharge and soil erosion processes to third in the phosphorus export process h s min had a weak but positive correlation with phosphorus export 9 2 4 5 potential implication of the current study for agricultural water management 4 5 1 avoiding over application of phosphorus fertilizer and retaining crop residues the brt analysis results showed that the vegetation cover factor c largely determined the soil loss and its associated nitrogen and phosphorus exports good crop cover can efficiently prevent soil erosion zhou et al 2008 and reduce nutrient loss in the context of planting system remaining crop residue stems and stalks left after harvesting is a feasible option for promoting crop cover but most of the time the local farmers in developing countries remove crop residues in an oversimplified and crude manner i e burning to save labor feng et al 2019 oanh et al 2018 ravindra et al 2019 for example more than 80 of the crop residues in northeast china are directly burned hou et al 2019 open burning of crop residues not only causes loss of nutrient contained in the crop residue to freshwater and air pollution but also decreases the soil moisture as a result encouraging farmers to retain and utilize crop residue to prevent soil erosion reduce nutrient loss and air pollution has been listed in the chinese government s schedule ren et al 2019 phosphorus fertilizer contributed the second largest amount to phosphorus export most farmland in agricultural polders are applied excessive fertilizer by local farmer for high crop yield this practice decreases the fertilizer utilization rate to 10 25 which led to a large portion of applied fertilizer flushed into the surrounding freshwater and thus put great stress on downstream aquatic health accordingly gradually abandoning this injudicious fertilizer application and adopting advanced technique e g dripping fertilizer are necessary to reduce the environmental risk and attain the sustainable development 4 5 3 drafting and initiating emergency plans to protect the polders from disasters the brt analysis results revealed that when the daily precipitation increased from 0 to 50 mm d rapid increases in the discharge soil erosion 20 to 50 mm d nitrogen and phosphorus exports from the polder were more likely to occur the same rule also applied when c1 ranged from 0 39 to 0 40 and from 0 63 to 0 65 and h q flood1 varied between 55 mm and 58 mm these critical values were considered as early warning threshold levels for steep changes in discharge sediment and nitrogen and phosphorus loss of the polder they provide key parameters values when developing an early natural hazardous warning system which offer information on ongoing natural disasters and increase the time for preparatory works schanze et al 2007 they are of importance for carrying out risk analysis with complex models e g sprc model narayan et al 2011 foresight sayah mofazali and jahangiri 2018 and drafting risk management strategies that initiate a series of emergency procedures to prevent or reduce the adverse effects of polder flooding and eutrophication 4 6 advantages and disadvantages of the study this study has some advantages first to the best of our knowledge this study is the first study to integrate the strength of the brt model and polder hydrology models the brt model provides reliable estimation no matter whether the problem is collinearity and nonlinearity to our knowledge brt model has been mostly used in the ecology and biology segurado et al 2016 this was the one of the few times to couple the brt and hydrology model to address hydrological cycle problem erdal and karakurt 2013 nolan et al 2015 most chinese polders lack permanent hydrological stations for monitoring the detailed hydrological processes relative to natural catchments consequently long time series hydro climate data for most polders are scarce faced with this problem the calibrated polder hydrology model was used here to obtain a dataset with sufficient size through outputting the daily model results of hydrological variables although the study period was confined to two years the daily scale analysis was able to provide the accurate quantification of the effect of contributing factors second previous studies mostly focused on one or two segments of the hydrological cycle e g streamflow soil loss or nutriment transportation despite the numerous studies on the relationship between driving factors and hydrological processes here the four main components of hydrological cycle i e discharge soil erosion nitrogen and phosphorus exports were all considered to conduct comprehensive and comparative analyses these analyses provide us a deep understanding of the hydrological response to environmental change in the context of global change and references for adopting differential measures when the administrator emphasises different aspects of natural risks however some limitations still existed in this study for instance it did not analyze the interaction between driving factors it mainly presented the impact of environmental factors on temporal changes in the hydrological processes of a typical agricultural polder collecting more data from more polders across a large zone such as taihu basin and exploring the key factors that influence the spatial changes of hydrological processes in such a large basin will provide comprehensive insights into natural risk management 5 conclusions temporal changes in discharge and soil erosion were dominated by weather factors while those of nitrogen and phosphorus exports were mainly influenced by artificial factors precipitation had a significant facilitating effect on discharge soil erosion nitrogen and phosphorus exports but negligible effects on these processes when it exceeded 50 mm d in contrast discharge and nitrogen export decreased when pan evaporation increased from 0 to 2 mm d a c2 below 0 34 increased soil loss and phosphorus export and a c1 below 0 28 led to an elevated risk of nitrogen export when these factors fell out of the range their corresponding dependent hydrological variables hardly showed significant response the results of

keywords lowland polder hydrological modeling brt key factors threshold points 1 introduction lowland polders that are widely distributed throughout river deltas seaside and lakeside zones are associated with dense population high crop yield and advanced economies thus polders are likely to suffer serious life and financial losses in case of natural disaster this risk has raised special concern in the south of china which includes thousands of polders with a total population of 0 48 billion people accurate identification and assessment of the effects of the key factors affecting hydrological processes are vital to develop early warning system and provide enough preparation time for flooding and water pollution especially in the context of accelerated global climate and land

evaluate the relationship between driving factors and hydrological processes and then identify principal factors especially for lowland polders are complicated odongo et al 2014 for the following reasons firstly a polder is strongly affected not only by natural factors but also by human factors lai et al 2018 normally asian polders are situated in subtropical monsoon areas with drastic fluctuations in seasonal precipitation and temperature that challenge the analysis of the relationship between drivers and hydrological processes moreover the polder water exchange with surrounding rivers is highly regulated by water management through pump discharge and irrigation hesse et al 2008 vernooij and vermaat 2009 such regulation complicates the hydrological response to changes in driving factors in polders secondly the driving forces of hydrological processes have nonlinear influences on the hydrological cycle amorocho 1973 builes jaramillo et al 2018 khan et al 2006 lee 2005

representative of the truth last but not least the scarcity of data on chinese polders restricts the improvement of studies in most cases chinese polders lack hydrological observation stations to collect continuous detailed and long term data yan et al 2016b this deficiency restricts the quantification of the relationship between drivers and hydrological cycle in response to this situation this study combines boosted regression tree brt model with the lowland polder hydrology and phosphorus modeling system phps yan et al 2017 and the polder hydrology and nitrogen modeling system phns yan et al 2020 to address the complexity nonlinearity collinearity data deficiency and identification of threshold points problems during analysis of the relationship between the hydrological cycle and driving forces in polders the brt model is a state of the art tool that combines the advances of the traditional regression model and machine learning methods elith et al 2008 rodrigues and de la riva 2014 brt can accommodate complex linear and nonlinear problems and is insensitive to collinearity problems additionally the hydrology model after calibration is often an efficient tool to produce long term data which can efficiently compensate for the insufficiency of hydrological data based on the previous works brauer et al 2014 huang et al 2016b williams and berndt 1977 yan et al 2019 proposed the phps and phns models to better describe the hydrological and water quality processes these models consider detailed polder specific natural and human characteristics and present good performance thus the calibrated phps and phns here are used to provide continuous and long term data which is the basis of the implementing brt analysis this study aimed to integrate the brt model with the phps and phns models to 1 quantify the effects of various driving factors on the main component of hydrological cycle 2 screen the principal factors influencing discharge soil erosion and nitrogen and phosphorus processes and 3 propose some strategies for the water risk management based on the analysis results this research proposes a new way to identify the key factors of polder hydrological processes and their threshold points which is of major importance for developing an early natural hazardous warning system to reduce the adverse effects of polder flooding and eutrophication our study will deepen the understanding of the relationship between the hydrological processes and driving factors and provide important references for sustainable water resources management 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the jianwei polder situated in the northwestern portion of taihu basin in southern china is an enclosed area of 1 06 105 m2 by dike which isolates the catchment from surrounding rivers to prevent inundation fig 1 the polder is a typical agricultural chinese polder in terms of hydrological conditions land use and cropping system in contrast to those of freely draining catchments the hydrological connection of the polder with its surrounding rivers are highly regulated by a culvert and three pumps p1 for floodwater drainage and p2 and p3 for agricultural irrigation during precipitation events rainfall runoff from multiple land uses is firstly delivered by ditches to ponds and then exported by a culvert or pump to the outside if the pond water level exceeds the threshold level for the starting pump during the rice growth period or culvert h s min during the wheat growth period rice wheat rotation is the cropping system for the paddy fields in this system rice is planted from june to october and wheat is planted from november to may the paddy field must maintain an appropriate ponded water depth for optimal rice growth therefore when the water depth in the paddy field decreases to lower limit of the appropriate water level h q min1 for the paddy rice irrigation water has to be pumped from the outside river to the paddy field on the contrary if the water depth in the paddy field increases to maximum submergence tolerant water level h q flood1 for rice growth drainage has to be implemented for removing surplus water inorganic fertilization nitrogen 450 kg ha yr phosphorus 7 88 kg ha yr is operated to meet crop nutrient requirements the soil texture is silt loam no industrial pollution source was observed within the polder the jianwei polder has a semi tropical monsoon climate which facilitates rice growth the average annual precipitation is 1082 mm most of which falls between march and september 2 2 data

obtained showed that the models have good performance for simulating polder discharge and phosphorus and nitrogen processes more information can be obtained from the studies of yan et al 2019 2 4 boosted regression trees brt analyses the brt model was applied to quantify the impact of driving factors on discharge soil erosion and nitrogen and phosphorus exports brt integrates the important advantages of traditional regression method and the machine learning to improve performance where a large ensemble of simple tree models is combined adaptively it handles complicated linear and nonlinear responses to various types of predictor variables without pretransformation missing data and collinearity problems brt provides excellent forecasting results and enables the reliable identification of relevant variables brt requires the user to provide the values of four parameters loss function ls learning rate lr tree complexity tc and bag fraction bf the ls indicates the nature of error distribution including the gaussian poisson and binomial distribution which can be simulated by brt lr determines the contribution of each tree to the final optimized model tc represents whether the interactions between predictor variables should be considered the combination of lr and tc controls the number of trees used for the optimal model the bf determines the proportion of data to be used for building the model at random from a full training dataset at each iteration and is defaulted to be as a value of 0 5 the optimal combination of the four parameter values is what generates the minimum forecasting error numerous combinations of different parameter values were tested finally the gaussian function 0 0001 1 and 0 5 were defined as the parameter values of ls lr tc and bf respectively to obtain the minimum deviation for discharge whilst the gaussian function 0 001 1 and 0 5 were set for these parameter values to gain minimum deviation for soil erosion nitrogen and phosphorus exports these combinations produced more than 1000 trees using a 10 foldcross validation method burden et al 1997 stone 1974 during the 10 foldcross validation procedure the dataset was randomly and equivalently separated into 10 subsets nine of 10 subsets were selected to train the model and the withheld subset was used for testing the model the cross validation process was then repeated 10 times making sure that each subset was used once as test data no fewer than 1000 trees were required in brt as recommended by elith et al 2008 we implemented brt analysis in r 3 4 4 using the gbm package ridgeway 2007 and a supplemental code provided by elith et al 2008 after reviewing previous papers studying the driving factors influencing hydrological processes genxu et al 2012 huang et al 2016a wei et al 2009 and considering the actual conditions of our study ten environmental variables including p ir1 h q min1 h q max1 h q flood1 f xg f xs h s min et pot and h s p u m p s t o p were chosen to detect the driving factors that are key to the discharge in addition to the above mentioned variables c1 and c2 were used for identifying the determinant factors of soil erosion c1 c2 t d i p fert 1 t d i p fert 2 and vi were used for phosphorus export and c1 c2 t d i n fert 1 t d i n fert 2 and vi were used for nitrogen export the meanings of each symbol can be found in table 1 discharge soil erosion nitrogen and phosphorus exports ir1 data used in the brt were obtained from the daily simulated results of phns and other variables were obtained from field monitoring these variables underwent daily variation the above mentioned data for analysis of relationship between driving factors and discharge soil erosion and phosphorus export spanned from jan 2015 to dec 2016 while those for analysis of relationship between driving factors and nitrogen export was from jan 2014 to dec 2016 3 results table 1 lists the relative importance of each factor for different hydrological components based on brt analyses weather elements exerted a 63 7 total relative effect on discharge q variation 51 5 from precipitation and 12 2 from pan evaporation specifically the discharge curve increased sharply with precipitation from 0 to 50 mm d and then stabilized when precipitation 50 mm d fig 2 discharge decreased substantially with the pan evaporation increasing from 0 to approximately 2 mm d however pan evaporation exceeding 2 mm d had a negligible impact on discharge water management factors were responsible for 36 of the total discharge q variation of which 20 9 was the h q flood1 and 15 1 was h s min when h q flood1 was greater than 58 mm and less than 55 mm the discharge was insignificantly affected by h q flood1 by comparison when h q flood1 was between the 55 mm and 58 mm discharge sharply increased fig 2 similarly discharge rapidly increased in case h s min ranged from 1450 mm to 1480 mm in contrast the remaining values of h s min slightly affected the discharge h q min1 and h q max1 respectively contributed only 0 2 and 0 1 of the explained variation implying that they were not important for interpreting the discharge variation weather elements showed a relative influence of 71 5 on the change in soil erosion precipitation and pan evaporation contributed 69 4 and 2 2 of this variation respectively two threshold points were observed on the precipitation soil erosion function curve one at 20 mm d and the other between 40 mm d and 46 mm d fig 3 when the precipitation exceeded the first threshold of 20 mm d the risk of soil erosion showed a sharp and large increase until the second threshold point of around 50 mm d thereafter the curve become flat c2 explained 17 3 of the soil loss variation soil loss generally increased with c2 until a threshold point around 0 34 h q min1 and c1 had negligible effect on soil loss variation human factors accounted for 72 4 of the nitrogen export variation 48 2 from h s p u m p s t o p and 24 2 from c1 when h s p u m p s t o p was between 1300 mm and 1800 mm the nitrogen export showed a generally increasing trend fig 4 nitrogen export curve increased substantially when c1 ranged from 0 to 0 28 and then became steady when c1 0 28 as et pot increased nitrogen export displayed two sharp change periods a decreasing one between 0 and 1 mm d and an increasing one between 1 9 and 2 1 mm d above 2 1 mm d nitrogen export became constant nitrogen export significantly increased as precipitation increased from 0 to 50 mm d whereas it reached a plateau when precipitation 50 mm d c2 and tdip fert1 contribute 34 5 and 30 7 of the variation in phosphorus export respectively c2 contributes to the increase in phosphorus export until a threshold value of approximately 0 34 fig 5 when tdip fert1 ranged from 0 to 1 10 4 kg m2 phosphorus exports increased however when tdip fert1 was larger than 1 10 4 kg m2 phosphorus exports curve stabilized precipitation caused 17 6 of the variation in phosphorus exports thus implying that the influence of precipitation is smaller than that of c2 and tdip fert1 with precipitation increasing from 0 to 50 mm d phosphorus export significantly increased but plateaued after precipitation 50 mm d as the h s min increased phosphorus export slightly increased the relative contribution of h s min to change in phosphorus export was 9 2 4 discussion 4 1 major influential factors of discharge the dominant role of weather variables 63 7 on the variation of polder discharge proved that the precipitation and evaporation substantially affected temporal change in discharge precipitation facilitated the increase in discharge until a threshold value around 50 mm d fig 2 high precipitation contributed to high discharge whereas low precipitation was related to low discharge in china polders are mainly located in rainfall dominated hydrological areas yan et al 2019 precipitation directly determines the magnitudes and fluctuations of net runoff and is therefore the most influential variable for polder discharge yan et al 2016a zhao et al 2011 pan evaporation represents the capability of water to evaporate in air due to the combined results of temperature humidity rainfall solar radiation wind etc shan et al 2015 tyagi et al 2019 yu et al 2002 and clearly had a negative influence on the discharge due to water loss however discharge curve remained stable in case the pan evaporation exceeded the threshold value of 2 mm d this effect may be because the high pan evaporation such as above 2 mm d mostly occurred on sunny days with high temperature and no precipitation liu et al 2002 thus no rainfall runoff occurred on days with pan evaporation above 2 mm d leading to the negligible correlation between pan evaporation and discharge we also noted that although irrigation was another important water input entry it had little effect on the discharge variation this was because irrigation was generally implemented when the amount of water available would not meet the water requirement for rice growth in paddy fields and irrigation water was thus intercepted by field ridge to create favorable moisture condition xie and cui 2011 accordingly no discharge occurred water resources management including h q flood1 and h s min also exerted an important influence on the discharge q variation 36 0 h q flood1 revealed a strong positive effect on the discharge when it ranged from 55 mm to 58 mm in the phns model h q flood1 means the maximum submergence tolerant water level for paddy rice once the water level in a paddy field exceeds h q flood1 the farmer has to drain excess water out of the paddy field until the water level drops to h q max1 xie and cui 2011 yan et al 2016a as a result a large h q flood1 increased the drainage volume amounts to h q flood1 minus h q max1 into surface water thereby promoting the polder discharge peak similar to h q flood1 h smin was also positively correlated with discharge h s min refers to the surface water level for starting the culvert or pump drainage at the polder outlet during heavy rainfall events runoff water from various land uses is routed and temporarily stored in the pond then in case the water level in the pond exceeds h s min the culvert or pump is initiated to drain floodwater until the water level decreases to h s p u m p s t o p huang et al 2016b here h s p u m p s t o p was often lower than h s min to drain more water in order to leave sufficient flood storage in the pond as a result a high value of h smin means more floodwater amounts to h s min minus h s p u m p s t o p is discharged into the extraterritorial area and induces a higher peak value of discharge thereby increasing the discharge variation 4 2 major influential factors of soil erosion weather elements were also variables determining soil loss at the polder precipitation had no impact on the soil erosion until it reached 20 mm d fig 3 precipitation under 20 mm hardly caused the soil denudation due to the small rainfall erosivity soil erosion increased with precipitation above 20 mm d large precipitation means high rainfall intensity which increased the erosive energy of the rainfall and consequently flushed large amounts of soil particles into the water however the soil erosion curve did not continue to increase and instead remained stable when precipitation exceeded 50 mm d because intense precipitation above 50 mm d often occurred on consecutive rainy days most of the soil particles that are easily to be eroded had already been flushed away from farmland during the initial rainfall period therefore the amount of soil erosion didn t significantly increase even when precipitation continuously increased during the later rainfall period the agricultural practices c2 also had an important influence on the soil loss variation 17 3 soil loss generally increased with c2 until it reached around 0 34 overall larger c2 was associated with more soil erosion c2 is the vegetation cover and management factor defined as the ratio of sediment loss from cropland to the corresponding loss from clean tilled continuous fallow in relation to the vegetation coverage and crop residues that protect the dryland soil from erosion in the musle model this index is calculated as the ratio of sediment loss from cropland under specific conditions to the corresponding loss from clean tilled continuously fallow land williams and berndt 1977 thus c1 or c2 approaching 0 indicate dense vegetation cover and large amounts of crop residues were retained on the soil surface increased surface roughness decreases surface splash erosion from direct raindrop bullard et al 2018 and reduces runoff velocity to inhibit the transport of detached soil particles by contrast large values of c2 indicate sparse vegetation cover and limited crop residues which consequently increase soil erosion however when c2 exceeded the threshold value of 0 34 the curve began to stabilize owing to the specific cropping system in taihu basin a c2 above 0 34 only occurred in the wheat over wintering period or reviving period during this period the crop cover was low but precipitation significantly decreased simultaneously the soil erosion caused by rainfall runoff was largely reduced and did not significantly change even as c2 increased as a result c2 was not strongly correlated with soil erosion when it was above 0 34 the effect of c1 on the paddy field was larger than that of c2 on dryland which may be due to differences in the hydrological behaviors between paddy field and dryland paddy fields are often kept ponded for optimal rice growth wu et al 2019 ponding water alleviates the splash erosion of the raindrop and weakened the correlation between the vegetation cover factor c1 and soil erosion similar to that on discharge the impact of agricultural practices on soil loss was not comparable with that of weather elements 4 3 major influential factors of nitrogen export nitrogen export was controlled by agricultural management factor h s p u m p s t o p 48 2 and c1 24 2 were the most important factors influencing temporal changes in nitrogen export in general h s p u m p s t o p generated a positive effect on temporal nitrogen export h s p u m p s t o p was the water level for stopping pump drainage when the water level decreases to h s p u m p s t o p the pump stopped pumping water and nitrogen out of polder normally h s p u m p s t o p was lower than the h s p u m p s t a r t water level for starting pump drainage to provide water holding capacity for floodwater yan et al 2016a thus a large h s p u m p s t o p increases discharge amounts to h s p u m p s t o p minus h s p u m p s t a r t and its attached nitrogen export as c1 increased until 0 28 the vegetation cover of paddy field becomes sparse fig 4 consequently more bare soil was eroded and flushed away thereby increasing the amount of nitrogen adsorbed in the soil particles exported to the surrounding river values of c1 above 0 28 mostly happened in winter or spring i e the dry period when the nitrogen export stayed at low levels because polder discharge is low due to low precipitation this state minimizes nitrogen export out of the polder even when c1 increases weather elements including precipitation and pan evaporation contributed to 16 8 of the variation in nitrogen exports similar to the responses of discharge soil erosion and phosphorus and nitrogen exports to precipitation the precipitation fitted and pan evaporation fitted functions showed threshold values of 50 mm d and 2 mm d respectively 4 4 major influential factors of phosphorus export distinct from the discharge and soil loss which primarily depended on weather variables phosphorus export was governed by agricultural practices c2 and tdip fert1 c2 was the most important contributing factor 34 5 followed by tdip fert1 30 7 in general the larger c2 and tdip fert1 are closely related to more phosphorus export a large c2 represents poor vegetation cover and low availability of crop residues which facilitated soil erosion and increases the amount of phosphorus adsorbed onto soil particles scoured into freshwater similar to the response of soil erosion to c2 there was also a threshold value of 0 34 above which the phosphorus export curve didn t continue to increase fig 5 moreover particulate phosphorus was closely associated with the soil erosion which was more dependent on c2 than on c1 section 4 2 particulate phosphorus constituted more than 70 of total phosphorus consequently c2 exerted a stronger effect on phosphorus exports than c1 tdip fert1 is the amount of inorganic phosphorus inputted into paddy field by manual fertilization in fact inorganic fertilization usually provides the largest phosphorus input into agricultural polders yan et al 2017 therefore the amount of phosphorus export was highly sensitive to a large tdip fert1 because of an increase in phosphorus availability however the relative importance of precipitation decreased from first place in the discharge and soil erosion processes to third in the phosphorus export process h s min had a weak but positive correlation with phosphorus export 9 2 4 5 potential implication of the current study for agricultural water management 4 5 1 avoiding over application of phosphorus fertilizer and retaining crop residues the brt analysis results showed that the vegetation cover factor c largely determined the soil loss and its associated nitrogen and phosphorus exports good crop cover can efficiently prevent soil erosion zhou et al 2008 and reduce nutrient loss in the context of planting system remaining crop residue stems and stalks left after harvesting is a feasible option for promoting crop cover but most of the time the local farmers in developing countries remove crop residues in an oversimplified and crude manner i e burning to save labor feng et al 2019 oanh et al 2018 ravindra et al 2019 for example more than 80 of the crop residues in northeast china are directly burned hou et al 2019 open burning of crop residues not only causes loss of nutrient contained in the crop residue to freshwater and air pollution but also decreases the soil moisture as a result encouraging farmers to retain and utilize crop residue to prevent soil erosion reduce nutrient loss and air pollution has been listed in the chinese government s schedule ren et al 2019 phosphorus fertilizer contributed the second largest amount to phosphorus export most farmland in agricultural polders are applied excessive fertilizer by local farmer for high crop yield this practice decreases the fertilizer utilization rate to 10 25 which led to a large portion of applied fertilizer flushed into the surrounding freshwater and thus put great stress on downstream aquatic health accordingly gradually abandoning this injudicious fertilizer application and adopting advanced technique e g dripping fertilizer are necessary to reduce the environmental risk and attain the sustainable development 4 5 3 drafting and initiating emergency plans to protect the polders from disasters the brt analysis results revealed that when the daily precipitation increased from 0 to 50 mm d rapid increases in the discharge soil erosion 20 to 50 mm d nitrogen and phosphorus exports from the polder were more likely to occur the same rule also applied when c1 ranged from 0 39 to 0 40 and from 0 63 to 0 65 and h q flood1 varied between 55 mm and 58 mm these critical values were considered as early warning threshold levels for steep changes in discharge sediment and nitrogen and phosphorus loss of the polder they provide key parameters values when developing an early natural hazardous warning system which offer information on ongoing natural disasters and increase the time for preparatory works schanze et al 2007 they are of importance for carrying out risk analysis with complex models e g sprc model narayan et al 2011 foresight sayah mofazali and jahangiri 2018 and drafting risk management strategies that initiate a series of emergency procedures to prevent or reduce the adverse effects of polder flooding and eutrophication 4 6 advantages and disadvantages of the study this study has some advantages first to the best of our knowledge this study is the first study to integrate the strength of the brt model and polder hydrology models the brt model provides reliable estimation no matter whether the problem is collinearity and nonlinearity to our knowledge brt model has been mostly used in the ecology and biology segurado et al 2016 this was the one of the few times to couple the brt and hydrology model to address hydrological cycle problem erdal and karakurt 2013 nolan et al 2015 most chinese polders lack permanent hydrological stations for monitoring the detailed hydrological processes relative to natural catchments consequently long time series hydro climate data for most polders are scarce faced with this problem the calibrated polder hydrology model was used here to obtain a dataset with sufficient size through outputting the daily model results of hydrological variables although the study period was confined to two years the daily scale analysis was able to provide the accurate quantification of the effect of contributing factors second previous studies mostly focused on one or two segments of the hydrological cycle e g streamflow soil loss or nutriment transportation despite the numerous studies on the relationship between driving factors and hydrological processes here the four main components of hydrological cycle i e discharge soil erosion nitrogen and phosphorus exports were all considered to conduct comprehensive and comparative analyses these analyses provide us a deep understanding of the hydrological response to environmental change in the context of global change and references for adopting differential measures when the administrator emphasises different aspects of natural risks however some limitations still existed in this study for instance it did not analyze the interaction between driving factors it mainly presented the impact of environmental factors on temporal changes in the hydrological processes of a typical agricultural polder collecting more data from more polders across a large zone such as taihu basin and exploring the key factors that influence the spatial changes of hydrological processes in such a large basin will provide comprehensive insights into natural risk management 5 conclusions temporal changes in discharge and soil erosion were dominated by weather factors while those of nitrogen and phosphorus exports were mainly influenced by artificial factors precipitation had a significant facilitating effect on discharge soil erosion nitrogen and phosphorus exports but negligible effects on these processes when it exceeded 50 mm d in contrast discharge and nitrogen export decreased when pan evaporation increased from 0 to 2 mm d a c2 below 0 34 increased soil loss and phosphorus export and a c1 below 0 28 led to an elevated risk of nitrogen export when these factors fell out of the range their corresponding dependent hydrological variables hardly showed significant response the results of

24616,the objective in this paper is to determine analytically the maximally sustainable pro rata density dependent harvest rate of a hypothetical biological species on the spatial boundary of its habitat which is otherwise a protected zone i e no harvesting of the species is allowed in the interior of its habitat this is achieved by analysing an abstract mathematical model for the spatio temporal evolution of the species density over its habitat if it is subjected to a continuum of potential pro rata density dependent harvest rates on the spatial boundary the model takes the form of an initial boundary value problem involving a reaction diffusion equation in which the reaction term is a concave function of the population density and robin boundary conditions are prescribed a long time asymptotic analysis of the population density is undertaken by invoking classical results from the theory of eigenproblems in this way necessary and sufficient conditions on the pro rata density dependent harvest rate are established for the existence of a strictly positive equilibrium attractor of model solutions moreover important necessary properties of this equilibrium attractor are established to guarantee the existence of a density pro rata harvest rate which maximises the total harvest per unit time at equilibrium keywords optimal yield population dynamics reaction diffusion equation protection zone maximum sustainable yield 1 introduction as the global population increases so too does its demand for natural resources consequently the stock of many renewable natural resources such as marine fish and forest timbers have been in sharp decline since the early 1900s as a direct result of over harvesting jackson et al 2001 pauly et al 2002 perhaps the most famous example of a marine fish species being over exploited is that of the atlantic cod in fact the population densities of six of the seven cod fish stocks were so low in 1992 and 1993 that an indefinite ban was imposed on commercial exploitation of these fish stocks myers et al 1997 while the ban on commercial atlantic cod fishing was implemented in an effort to protect the species it had adverse socio economic effects and some 19000 fishermen and plant workers lost their jobs mason 2019 in recent years marine ecologists and fishery industrialists have debated the necessity of enforcing harvesting quotas or no harvesting protection zones to protect marine species in a bid to circumvent the collapse of another fishing industry and the associated negative socio economic impacts of such an event brown et al 2001 gubbay 1995 for example in the south pacific palau enforced fishing bans in the form of protection zones at several demarcated regions where several fish species are known to spawn golbuu and friedlander 2011 the effectiveness of this strategy is well documented golbuu and friedlander 2011 vianna et al 2012 investigations into the merits of these arguments are just one part of the essential problem in spatial ecology which is to study and understand the interrelationships between the distribution and quantity of organisms and their environment britton 2012 the mathematical treatment of these interactions has only relatively recently come to the fore okubo 2013 since the 1960s new demands have been placed on ecologists in this respect as the rise of public awareness of several previous environmental crises grew studies in ecology up to that point in time had been limited to the pursuit of understanding and explanation only during the last four decades have serious efforts been directed towards developing the theoretical foundations required for the sustainable management of natural habitats from a sound ecological basis levin et al 1989 the earliest ecological models treated increases in and fluctuations of populations over time in terms of temporal derivatives space and time are however by nature inseparable and only when population variations of organisms are considered in both space and time can the ecological system truly be understood levin et al 1989 okubo 2013 extensions of classical temporal models aimed at accommodating spatial variations by exploiting the notion of net population flux through an infinitesimal region of space rather than a spatially aggregated rate of change is however unattainable without knowledge of the underlying mechanism of movement of the species okubo 2013 in an inorganic world the spatial gradients of the flux of heat or matter caused by spatial inhomogeneity specify the local rate of change of the heat or matter by the process of diffusion while recognising that the mechanisms of movement of individual species members are vastly different from that of heat or matter the established concept of diffusion as a means of molecular spread is a well suited point of departure for modelling species member movement in space and gives rise to the so called reaction diffusion equation okubo 2013 in such an equation the reaction term expresses the temporal growth or decline of the species members while the diffusion term is employed as a mechanism to model the spatial movement of species members mathematical models describing the spatio temporal evolution of a biological species are often categorised according to two types abstract models and practical models neuhauser 2001 okubo 2013 abstract models are derived with a conscious effort directed towards keeping assumptions to a bare minimum resulting in an apparently simple mathematical model cantrell et al 2010 neuhauser 2001 as a result such a model permits an elegant mathematical treatment in which symbolic solutions are plausible and analytic studies are possible all aimed at developing a fundamental understanding of the behaviour of the underlying real world ecological species pielou 1969 a consequence of an abstract model however is that there exists a danger that the aforementioned analysis may become detached from reality the virtue of an abstract model nevertheless remains that it is often capable of providing a mechanism for gaining insight or expressing ideas okubo 2013 in contrast the emergence of the modern computer and the realisation that a simple model can never be realistic have led to the coming of age of so called practical models pielou 1969 these models are based on realistic assumptions and usually involve inelegant parametrisations of the interrelationships of large numbers of variables neuhauser 2001 okubo 2013 the advantage of a practical model is that it may be derived at a low level of abstraction accounting for the many interconnected and intertwined relationships in a very specific context of the natural world unfortunately practical models rarely lend themselves to analytical treatment and so computer simulations are usually required to allow for different scenarios playing out in a bid to capture long term spatio temporal behaviours in specific cases cantrell et al 2010 okubo 2013 ecologists appear to be evenly divided between the exploration of abstract models and that of practical models pielou 1969 the focus of this paper is squarely within the realm of abstract models more specifically our research is directed towards the derivation of an abstract model which may be employed to determine a theoretically sustainable pro rata harvest rate along the boundary of a protected spatial region in other words no harvesting takes place in the interior of this region for several reasons the model studied in this paper is a highly idealised abstraction of the growth and movement of real biological species perhaps the most idealised abstraction is that the movements of the species members modelled are limited to within a single spatial dimension only this is of course unrealistic since real biological species typically reside and migrate in two or three spatial dimensions it is nevertheless useful to adopt a cautious modelling approach according to which one starts out with a simple mathematical model as a point of departure which can be subjected successfully to an in depth analysis aimed at uncovering the long term behaviour of its solutions such an approach is preferable because the analysis of a simple model can typically be taken much further than that of a complex model and the model can always be made more realistic during later iterations of the modelling cycle once its simpler incarnations are well understood this approach has historically often been adopted cantrell and cosner 2004 fisher 1937 hale 2009 henry 1981 ludwig et al 1979 the paper opens with a brief literature review illustrating the gap in the current literature pertaining to harvesting in reaction diffusion models thereafter a description of the abstract model considered in this paper is provided the ensuing analysis of this model begins by establishing a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence and uniqueness of a positive equilibrium solution in terms of the pro rata harvest rate this is followed by establishing a number of anticipated but as yet unproven results pertaining to properties of the unique positive equilibrium solution in particular it is shown that the unique positive equilibrium solution is symmetric in space this result leads to an identification of the extremal points of the positive equilibrium solution at any point in time we also show that the population densities associated with these extremal points are monotonically decreasing functions of the pro rata harvest rate the analysis comes to a close with the establishment of a result guaranteeing the existence of a sustainable pro rata harvest rate that maximises the total harvest per unit time at equilibrium 2 related literature there have been a number of studies in which abstract reaction diffusion equations were employed to study the effects of harvesting on the prediction of persistence or extinction of a biological species cantrell and cosner 2004 cooke and witten 1986 cui et al 2017 emamizadeh et al 2018 goddard and shivaji 2014 neubert 2003 oruganti et al 2002 the objectives of these studies vary from finding maximally allowable harvest rates distributed within the interior of the species habitat to pinpointing the size of a protection zone within the habitat such that unrestricted harvesting may occur in the interior of the habitat outside of this protection zone there have also been studies aimed at finding a spatial harvesting distribution which maximises the total catch of the species over time oruganti et al 2002 for example studied the case where the population is harvested at a constant rate in the interior of a spatial habitat equipped with a lethal boundary they found that if the intrinsic birthrate is below a specific threshold value then the population necessarily becomes extinct for any harvest rate if however the intrinsic birthrate is above this threshold value the situation is more intricate they found if the harvest rate is less than some threshold value then persistence of the species can be guaranteed goddard and shivaji 2014 studied a model of the same form as that of oruganti et al 2002 although they included negative density dependent emigration at the spatial boundary by prescribing nonlinear boundary conditions they were able to prove the existence of at least two positive solutions provided that certain conditions on the harvest rate and emigration rate are satisfied in the case where the population is harvested at a rate proportional to the population density in the interior of the spatial habitat the model reduces to a form thoroughly studied by cantrell and cosner 2004 and is not particularly interesting there are however interesting optimal control results related to finding a spatial harvesting distribution that maximises the total yield the interested reader is referred to ding and lenhart 2009 emamizadeh et al 2018 kurata and shi 2008 and neubert 2003 in this respect cui et al 2017 considered the case where the population is harvested proportionally to a nonlinear function of the population density in the interior of a spatial habitat equipped with a reflective boundary the following research questions were considered for which kind of harvesting distribution function is there a maximal allowable catch such that the population becomes extinct for any harvesting rate above this threshold value secondly if a maximal allowable catch exists then which harvesting distribution function will render the maximum harvest rate the largest in an attempt to answer these questions the authors considered the establishment of a protection zone and studied the required characteristics of this zone they found that if the intrinsic growth rate of the population is larger than some threshold value determined by the size of the protection zone then there exists no maximum allowable harvest rate and the population always persists if however the intrinsic growth rate is less than this threshold value then there exists a maximally sustainable harvest rate such that for any harvest rate larger than this threshold value the population becomes extinct in a finite time moreover they demonstrated the existence of a harvesting strategy that maximises the total harvest of the population at equilibrium to the best of our knowledge no studies have focused on the effects of harvesting only along the spatial boundary of a protected habitat on the persistence or extinction of species members our objective is to fill this gap in the literature 3 model description the model studied in this paper is based on the well known logistic type reaction diffusion equation equipped with robin boundary conditions consider a single biological species exploiting natural resources for the purpose of survival in a bounded one dimensional homogeneous spatial domain d with boundaries ξ a and ξ b where ξ a ξ b let w ξ τ denote the population density of the species at position ξ d and at time τ 0 we assume that the spatio temporal evolution of this population is governed by the initial boundary value problem 1 d e w τ d 2 w ξ 2 g w ξ ξ a ξ b τ 0 2 b c d w ξ ξ ξ a α w ξ a τ d w ξ ξ ξ b α w ξ b τ τ 0 3 i c w ξ 0 w 0 ξ ξ ξ a ξ b where w 0 is a prescribed initial condition with a finite p norm in the limit as p as a function mapping elements from d to the non negative real numbers d denotes a positive constant diffusion rate and α is a non negative constant pro rata density migration rate of species members across the boundary of d the robin boundary conditions in 2 may be thought of as representing the situation where species members are removed exogenously or harvested at a rate proportional to their local density on the boundaries ξ a and ξ b of d the inclusion of these boundary conditions are motivated by an expectation that as the population becomes more abundant on the boundary of the protection zone where the population is harvested the population will be harvested more efficiently therefore it is assumed that the population is harvested at the boundaries of the protected habitat at a rate which is directly proportional to the local population density it is also assumed that there is no harvesting in the interior of d which is considered to be a protection zone the source term g w is assumed to be lipschitz continuous in w twice continuously differentiable with respect to w and to satisfy the concavity conditions 4 g 0 0 g k 0 and 2 g w 2 0 for all w 0 where k denotes the positive carrying capacity of the population in d which is assumed to be constant by the homogeneity of d after following a standard process of non dimensionalisation the model 1 3 becomes 5 d e u t 2 u x 2 g u x 0 1 t 0 6 b c u x x 0 κ u 0 t u x x 1 κ u 1 t t 0 7 i c u x 0 f x 0 x 0 1 in non dimensional form the non dimensionalisation transformation maps the spatial domain d to a new normalised domain ω 0 1 and implies that the boundary conditions in 6 may be interpreted as prescribing the outward pointing flux of the species as directly proportional to its density there with a constant of proportionality κ in essence the boundary conditions therefore state that species members leave the domain ω at a pro rata density rate of κ finally the concavity conditions in 4 may be restated as 8 g 0 0 g 1 0 and 2 g u 2 0 for all u 0 upon non dimensionalisation examples of widely adopted growth functions g u in applications satisfying these conditions are provided in table 1 the growth functions in the table are illustrated graphically in fig 1 for certain functional parameter values moreover it is assumed that the function g u can be expressed as g u u y u for some function y u where y u is a bounded twice continuously differentiable function of u 0 with y 1 0 and 9 d y d u 0 for all u 0 it is acknowledged that for several reasons other than the fact that the movements of the theoretical population are limited to a single spatial dimension the model derived above is a highly idealised abstraction of the growth and movement of real biological species the first limiting assumption is that the population density of the biological species under consideration can be modelled as a continuously differentiable function in both the space and time dimensions in contrast a real biological species typically consists of limited numbers of discrete entities in which case births and deaths may be noticeable as immediate discrete discontinuities in population numbers over time the assumption of continuity is however required in order to bring to bear on the model the considerable arsenal of analysis tools available within the mature realm of the differential calculus while this assumption may to an extent be justified if a large species population is considered real world model applicability is admittedly seriously hampered in the case of a biological species that occurs in small numbers within the habitat considered moreover the choice of the function g u x t which governs the intrinsic growth rate of the population is assumed to be zero only when the population density is zero but positive for small positive densities this assumption is highly idealised because although the population density u x t may be approaching zero in a specific region of the habitat at some time this may not be the case in other regions of the habitat at the same point in time in which case species members are still expected to be able to find mates for the purpose of reproduction if however the species density is indeed dwindling uniformly within its habitat species members may not be successful in finding mates while the population is still at a positive density while the latter phenomenon may be modelled by assuming that the intrinsic birth rate of the species becomes negative at low population densities a situation known as the allee effect allee 1931 the model is nevertheless simplified by assuming a birth rate that is concave as a function of population density because this renders the model amenable to analytic methods another unrealistic aspect of the birth rate function g u x t is that it is not an explicit function of time or space birth seasons and highly suitable breeding regions of the spatial habitat are therefore not accommodated in the model 4 preliminary results in studying models of the form 5 7 the widely adopted approach is to determine a sufficient criterion for the existence and uniqueness of a positive equilibrium solution that attracts all other solutions to 5 7 for which the initial condition f x in 7 is not identically zero in our context a maximally sustainable pro rata harvest rate κ κ may be established in terms of the principal eigenvalue of the corresponding eigenvalue problem which allows for the existence of a positive equilibrium attractor the following theorem provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a unique positive equilibrium solution to 5 7 in terms of the stability of the trivial solution u 0 this result is directly derived from propositions 3 1 3 3 of cantrell and cosner 2004 theorem 1 criteria for persistence and extinction suppose g u u y u and that the conditions in 8 9 hold if the principal eigenvalue σ σ 1 of 10 d 2 ϕ d x 2 y 0 ϕ σ ϕ x 0 1 11 d ϕ d x x 0 κ ϕ 0 d ϕ d x x 1 κ ϕ 1 is positive then 5 7 admits a unique positive equilibrium u and all solutions to 5 7 are eventually bounded from below by orbits of 5 7 which increase towards u as t if however the above eigenvalue is negative then 5 7 has no positive equilibria and any positive solution to 5 7 decays exponentially to zero as t uniformly for all x 0 1 therefore if the principal eigenvalue σ σ 1 to the eigenvalue problem 10 11 is positive then there exists a unique equilibrium u for each positive choice of κ note that if σ y 0 then it follows from 10 that ϕ is a linear function which is incompatible with the boundary conditions in 11 in view of the fact that κ 0 unless if ϕ 0 it may therefore be assumed that σ y 0 for any non zero real valued solution to 10 11 moreover the constant of proportionality κ in the boundary conditions is related to y 0 and the principal eigenvalue of 10 11 by the expression 12 κ y 0 σ tan y 0 σ 2 a result derived in appendix a the positive relationship in 12 is illustrated graphically in fig 2 parametrised by y 0 as may be seen in the figure there is a unique largest value of κ denoted by κ for which σ 0 the nature of the monotonic growth relationships between the parameters κ y 0 and σ 1 are captured in the following result corollary 1 the relationship between κ y 0 and σ 1 the principal eigenvalue σ σ 1 of 10 11 is a decreasing function of κ while κ is a decreasing function of y 0 a proof of corollary 1 is provided in appendix b biologically the parameter κ represents the proportion of the population that leaves the unit interval at x 0 and x 1 therefore it is to be expected that as the loss rate of the population across the boundary increases the spatially averaged growth rate given by the principal eigenvalue σ 1 would decrease this is indeed the case as guaranteed by corollary 1 similarly the parameter y 0 represents the maximum per capita growth rate and therefore should increase the spatially averaged growth rate σ 1 according to corollary 1 it follows from theorem 1 that the solution to 5 7 is attracted to the stable unique positive equilibrium solution u if f x 0 for all κ κ if however κ κ then the solution to 5 7 is attracted to the zero equilibrium by theorem 1 this result is summarised in the following theorem theorem 2 asymptotic behaviour of the solution to 5 7 if f x 0 then there exists a positive real number κ such that for any κ 0 κ the unique solution u x t to 5 7 is bounded from below by orbits which increase to the unique positive equilibrium solution u of 5 7 as t moreover for any κ κ u x t decays uniformly to zero as t practically theorem 2 implies that for any growth function g u satisfying 8 9 there exists some maximally allowable pro rata harvest rate which guarantees the persistence of species members in the unit interval 5 asymptotic solution analysis in section 4 it was shown that if κ κ then 5 7 admits a unique positive equilibrium solution u which is a global attractor for any positive choice of f x therefore the function u satisfies the two point boundary value problem 13 d e d 2 u d x 2 g u 0 x 0 1 14 b c d u d x x 0 κ u 0 d u d x x 1 κ u 1 for any κ 0 κ in this section we establish a number of important characteristics of u the first of these characteristics is that the unique positive equilibrium solution to 5 7 is a symmetric function on the unit interval theorem 3 spatial symmetry of the positive equilibrium solution let u x be the unique positive equilibrium solution to 5 7 then u x u 1 x for any x 0 1 a proof of the above result is provided in appendix c note that the result of theorem 3 does not require the growth function g u in 5 itself to be symmetric as was illustrated in fig 1 the spatial symmetry of the positive equilibrium solution yields insight into the spatial location of the global maximum of the positive equilibrium solution this location is established formally in the following result for which a proof is provided in appendix d corollary 2 extremal points of the positive equilibrium solution let u x be the unique positive equilibrium solution to 5 7 then u x attains global minima at x 0 and x 1 and a global maximum at x 1 2 for any κ 0 κ next it is shown that the maximum and minima of this equilibrium solution are decreasing functions of the pro rata harvest rate κ recall that the function u x satisfies the two point boundary value problem 13 14 multiplying 13 by d u d x on both sides yields 15 d 2 u d x 2 d u d x g u d u d x 0 which may be rewritten as 16 d d x 1 2 d u d x 2 g u 0 where 17 g u 0 u g s d s it therefore follows from 16 that 18 1 2 d u d x 2 g u α for some arbitrary constant α since d u d x 0 at the maximum of u x it follows that 19 1 2 d u d x 2 g u g u m where u m u 1 2 denotes the maximum value of u on 0 1 solving for d u d x in 19 yields 20 d u d x 2 g u m g u x 0 1 2 2 g u m g u x 1 2 1 in the case where x 0 1 2 21 d u d x 2 g u m g u and so separation of variables yields 22 where u 0 u 0 denotes the minimum value of u x on 0 1 the condition g u g u m restricts the range of u m and u 0 such that u 0 u m 0 1 with u 0 u m it is easily verified by means of a taylor expansion around the point u m that the integral in 22 converges for any u m 0 1 but diverges for u m 1 as elucidated in appendix e furthermore it follows from the first expression in 20 and from 14 that 23 d u d x x 0 2 g u m g u 0 κ u 0 so that 24 κ 2 g u m g u 0 u 0 the pair of eqs 22 and 24 in the three unknowns u 0 u m and κ is under determined and there is a unique pair of values u 0 and u m that corresponds to each valid choice of a value for κ in particular if κ 0 then u 0 u m which corresponds to the constant solution u x 1 by 13 14 furthermore theorem 2 guarantees the existence of a unique positive equilibrium solution u x to 13 14 only for κ κ and therefore u m 0 and u 0 0 as κ κ as a consequence 22 and 24 together represent a smooth curve l in three dimensional space parametrised by κ which begins at the point κ u 0 u m 0 1 1 and ends at the point κ u 0 u m κ 0 0 describing the unique relationship between κ the minimum value and the maximum value of the equilibrium solution at u 0 u 0 and u 1 2 u m respectively therefore a value may be chosen for κ upon which l may be employed to find the corresponding maximum and minimum values of the resulting equilibrium solution u to 13 14 it is next shown that u m and u 0 both decrease along the curve l as κ increases theorem 4 the curve l is monotonically decreasing let u x be the unique positive equilibrium solution to 5 7 then both u 0 u 0 κ and u m u m κ are decreasing functions of κ on the interval κ 0 κ a proof of theorem 4 is provided in appendix f and its result is demonstrated by numerical examples in fig 3 for the three reaction terms provided in table 1 in fig 3 the smooth curves l in the three dimensional space κ u 0 u m parametrised by κ are a consequence of 22 and 24 the following corollary follows as a direct result of theorem 4 and the uniqueness of solutions to 13 14 corollary 3 monotonicity of the positive equilibrium solution let u κ n x n n be an infinite sequence of unique positive equilibrium solutions to 5 7 with pro rata harvesting rates κ corresponding to the values in the sequence κ n n n respectively and satisfying the properties that κ n 1 κ n for all n n and that lim n κ n κ then u k n x u k n 1 x and lim n u κ n x 0 uniformly for all x 0 1 theorem 4 implies that both u m and u 0 decrease along the curve l as κ increases that is as the pro rata harvest rate increases the population densities at x 1 2 x 0 and x 1 all decrease therefore the total harvest yield per unit time at equilibrium along a single boundary of the spatial domain is given by κ u 0 and by the monotonicity of l there is a choice of κ denoted by κ o that maximises κ u 0 the value κ o is a solution to the classical optimisation problem 25 26 we close this section by establishing the well posedness of the optimisation problem 25 26 theorem 5 the existence of an optimal solution to 25 26 suppose that u x is the unique positive solution to 13 14 then there exists an optimal solution κ o 0 κ to 25 26 the proof of the result above is provided in appendix g theorem 5 implies that 25 26 represent a smooth curve l o in three dimensional space parametrised by κ that begins at the point z u 0 u m 0 0 0 and is initially increasing until it reaches the point z u 0 u m z o u 0 u m o where z o κ o u 0 and where u m o and u 0 denote the maximum and minimum values of u x corresponding to κ o respectively as κ increases beyond κ o the curve decreases until it reaches the point z u 0 u m 0 1 1 this is demonstrated by means of numerical examples in fig 4 for instances of the three reaction terms provided in table 1 6 discussion in this paper the sustainability of pro rata harvesting of a theoretical population on the boundary of a protected habitat was investigated our approach was to find a maximally sustainable pro rata harvest rate guaranteeing the persistence of the population modelled as an abstract initial boundary value problem involving a reaction diffusion equation and spatial emigration on the boundary of a protected habitat in the form of robin boundary conditions as a result of studying this abstract model which over simplifies the mechanisms governing the migration and reproduction of a biological population a number of insights where gained into the long term effectiveness of a protection zone in which harvesting is only allowed at the boundaries it was found that as the intrinsic birthrate of the population increases so too does the maximally sustainable positive pro rata harvest rate along the boundaries of the spatial domain this is an anticipated result because in reality it is expected that a population which reproduces sufficiently quickly can be harvested at a greater pro rata rate therefore it is important to consider a population s reproduction effectiveness when establishing a maximumly sustainable pro rata harvest rate on the boundary of a protected habitat two important characteristics of the population s equilibrium distribution were also established the first is that the equilibrium distribution is symmetric over the protected habitat this result provides insight into the spatial locations at which the population density attains its maximum and minimum values more specifically the maximum population density occurs at the centre of the habitat while the minimum population density occurs at the boundaries of the habitat where pro rata harvesting takes place this is a noteworthy insight for the purpose of formulating conservation strategies because if the habitat were to be altered in an attempt to increase the population s reproduction effectiveness it may be beneficial to enhance the reproduction capabilities of the population at the midpoint of the habitat where the population is at its maximum this region may then serve as a source for the protected habitat we finally also established a result guaranteeing the existence of a pro rata harvest rate that maximises the total harvest per unit time at equilibrium a numerical approach may be adopted in applications to find this optimal pro rata harvest rate for a specific case the existence of this optimal pro rata harvest rate is of interest because it implies that in this case less is more that is if the species were to be harvested at any pro rata sustainable harvest rate larger than the optimal harvest rate the total harvest in the long term will decrease as the population along the boundary of the protection zone decreases below an optimal boundary population density even though the total harvest may be larger in the short term moreover even if the population has up to the present been over exploited and a protection zone is henceforth enforced with harvesting at the boundaries of the protection zone at the optimal pro rata harvest rate the boundary population density will approach an optimal level in the long run at which a maximum total harvest per unit time will be obtainable in summary the results in this paper demonstrate that the establishment of a protection zone is not enough in itself to guarantee the sustainability of a species while the protection zone can indeed assume arbitrary dimensions it must be equipped with a restriction on the pro rata harvest rate at its boundaries in order to guarantee the long term substantiality of a species residing in the protection zone credit authorship contribution statement k d searle analysis and interpretation of the model drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content

24616,the objective in this paper is to determine analytically the maximally sustainable pro rata density dependent harvest rate of a hypothetical biological species on the spatial boundary of its habitat which is otherwise a protected zone i e no harvesting of the species is allowed in the interior of its habitat this is achieved by analysing an abstract mathematical model for the spatio temporal evolution of the species density over its habitat if it is subjected to a continuum of potential pro rata density dependent harvest rates on the spatial boundary the model takes the form of an initial boundary value problem involving a reaction diffusion equation in which the reaction term is a concave function of the population density and robin boundary conditions are prescribed a long time asymptotic analysis of the population density is undertaken by invoking classical results from the theory of eigenproblems in this way necessary and sufficient conditions on the pro rata density dependent harvest rate are established for the existence of a strictly positive equilibrium attractor of model solutions moreover important necessary properties of this equilibrium attractor are established to guarantee the existence of a density pro rata harvest rate which maximises the total harvest per unit time at equilibrium keywords optimal yield population dynamics reaction diffusion equation protection zone maximum sustainable yield 1 introduction as the global population increases so too does its demand for natural resources consequently the stock of many renewable natural resources such as marine fish and forest timbers have been in sharp decline since the early 1900s as a direct result of over harvesting jackson et al 2001 pauly et al 2002 perhaps the most famous example of a marine fish species being over exploited is that of the atlantic cod in fact the population densities of six of the seven cod fish stocks were so low in 1992 and 1993 that an indefinite ban was imposed on commercial exploitation of these fish stocks myers et al 1997 while the ban on commercial atlantic cod fishing was implemented in an effort to protect the species it had adverse socio economic effects and some 19000 fishermen and plant workers lost their jobs mason 2019 in recent years marine ecologists and fishery industrialists have debated the necessity of enforcing harvesting quotas or no harvesting protection zones to protect marine species in a bid to circumvent the collapse of another fishing industry and the associated negative socio economic impacts of such an event brown et al 2001 gubbay 1995 for example in the south pacific palau enforced fishing bans in the form of protection zones at several demarcated regions where several fish species are known to spawn golbuu and friedlander 2011 the effectiveness of this strategy is well documented golbuu and friedlander 2011 vianna et al 2012 investigations into the merits of these arguments are just one part of the essential problem in spatial ecology which is to study and understand the interrelationships between the distribution and quantity of organisms and their environment britton 2012 the mathematical treatment of these interactions has only relatively recently come to the fore okubo 2013 since the 1960s new demands have been placed on ecologists in this respect as the rise of public awareness of several previous environmental crises grew studies in ecology up to that point in time had been limited to the pursuit of understanding and explanation only during the last four decades have serious efforts been directed towards developing the theoretical foundations required for the sustainable management of natural habitats from a sound ecological basis levin et al 1989 the earliest ecological models treated increases in and fluctuations of populations over time in terms of temporal derivatives space and time are however by nature inseparable and only when population variations of organisms are considered in both space and time can the ecological system truly be understood levin et al 1989 okubo 2013 extensions of classical temporal models aimed at accommodating spatial variations by exploiting the notion of net population flux through an infinitesimal region of space rather than a spatially aggregated rate of change is however unattainable without knowledge of the underlying mechanism of movement of the species okubo 2013 in an inorganic world the spatial gradients of the flux of heat or matter caused by spatial inhomogeneity specify the local rate of change of the heat or matter by the process of diffusion while recognising that the mechanisms of movement of individual species members are vastly different from that of heat or matter the established concept of diffusion as a means of molecular spread is a well suited point of departure for modelling species member movement in space and gives rise to the so called reaction diffusion equation okubo 2013 in such an equation the reaction term expresses the temporal growth or decline of the species members while the diffusion term is employed as a mechanism to model the spatial movement of species members mathematical models describing the spatio temporal evolution of a biological species are often categorised according to two types abstract models and practical models neuhauser 2001 okubo 2013 abstract models are derived with a conscious effort directed towards keeping assumptions to a bare minimum resulting in an apparently simple mathematical model cantrell et al 2010 neuhauser 2001 as a result such a model permits an elegant mathematical treatment in which symbolic solutions are plausible and analytic studies are possible all aimed at developing a fundamental understanding of the behaviour of the underlying real world ecological species pielou 1969 a consequence of an abstract model however is that there exists a danger that the aforementioned analysis may become detached from reality the virtue of an abstract model nevertheless remains that it is often capable of providing a mechanism for gaining insight or expressing ideas okubo 2013 in contrast the emergence of the modern computer and the realisation that a simple model can never be realistic have led to the coming of age of so called practical models pielou 1969 these models are based on realistic assumptions and usually involve inelegant parametrisations of the interrelationships of large numbers of variables neuhauser 2001 okubo 2013 the advantage of a practical model is that it may be derived at a low level of abstraction accounting for the many interconnected and intertwined relationships in a very specific context of the natural world unfortunately practical models rarely lend themselves to analytical treatment and so computer simulations are usually required to allow for different scenarios playing out in a bid to capture long term spatio temporal behaviours in specific cases cantrell et al 2010 okubo 2013 ecologists appear to be evenly divided between the exploration of abstract models and that of practical models pielou 1969 the focus of this paper is squarely within the realm of abstract models more specifically our research is directed towards the derivation of an abstract model which may be employed to determine a theoretically sustainable pro rata harvest rate along the boundary of a protected spatial region in other words no harvesting takes place in the interior of this region for several reasons the model studied in this paper is a highly idealised abstraction of the growth and movement of real biological species perhaps the most idealised abstraction is that the movements of the species members modelled are limited to within a single spatial dimension only this is of course unrealistic since real biological species typically reside and migrate in two or three spatial dimensions it is nevertheless useful to adopt a cautious modelling approach according to which one starts out with a simple mathematical model as a point of departure which can be subjected successfully to an in depth analysis aimed at uncovering the long term behaviour of its solutions such an approach is preferable because the analysis of a simple model can typically be taken much further than that of a complex model and the model can always be made more realistic during later iterations of the modelling cycle once its simpler incarnations are well understood this approach has historically often been adopted cantrell and cosner 2004 fisher 1937 hale 2009 henry 1981 ludwig et al 1979 the paper opens with a brief literature review illustrating the gap in the current literature pertaining to harvesting in reaction diffusion models thereafter a description of the abstract model considered in this paper is provided the ensuing analysis of this model begins by establishing a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence and uniqueness of a positive equilibrium solution in terms of the pro rata harvest rate this is followed by establishing a number of anticipated but as yet unproven results pertaining to properties of the unique positive equilibrium solution in particular it is shown that the unique positive equilibrium solution is symmetric in space this result leads to an identification of the extremal points of the positive equilibrium solution at any point in time we also show that the population densities associated with these extremal points are monotonically decreasing functions of the pro rata harvest rate the analysis comes to a close with the establishment of a result guaranteeing the existence of a sustainable pro rata harvest rate that maximises the total harvest per unit time at equilibrium 2 related literature there have been a number of studies in which abstract reaction diffusion equations were employed to study the effects of harvesting on the prediction of persistence or extinction of a biological species cantrell and cosner 2004 cooke and witten 1986 cui et al 2017 emamizadeh et al 2018 goddard and shivaji 2014 neubert 2003 oruganti et al 2002 the objectives of these studies vary from finding maximally allowable harvest rates distributed within the interior of the species habitat to pinpointing the size of a protection zone within the habitat such that unrestricted harvesting may occur in the interior of the habitat outside of this protection zone there have also been studies aimed at finding a spatial harvesting distribution which maximises the total catch of the species over time oruganti et al 2002 for example studied the case where the population is harvested at a constant rate in the interior of a spatial habitat equipped with a lethal boundary they found that if the intrinsic birthrate is below a specific threshold value then the population necessarily becomes extinct for any harvest rate if however the intrinsic birthrate is above this threshold value the situation is more intricate they found if the harvest rate is less than some threshold value then persistence of the species can be guaranteed goddard and shivaji 2014 studied a model of the same form as that of oruganti et al 2002 although they included negative density dependent emigration at the spatial boundary by prescribing nonlinear boundary conditions they were able to prove the existence of at least two positive solutions provided that certain conditions on the harvest rate and emigration rate are satisfied in the case where the population is harvested at a rate proportional to the population density in the interior of the spatial habitat the model reduces to a form thoroughly studied by cantrell and cosner 2004 and is not particularly interesting there are however interesting optimal control results related to finding a spatial harvesting distribution that maximises the total yield the interested reader is referred to ding and lenhart 2009 emamizadeh et al 2018 kurata and shi 2008 and neubert 2003 in this respect cui et al 2017 considered the case where the population is harvested proportionally to a nonlinear function of the population density in the interior of a spatial habitat equipped with a reflective boundary the following research questions were considered for which kind of harvesting distribution function is there a maximal allowable catch such that the population becomes extinct for any harvesting rate above this threshold value secondly if a maximal allowable catch exists then which harvesting distribution function will render the maximum harvest rate the largest in an attempt to answer these questions the authors considered the establishment of a protection zone and studied the required characteristics of this zone they found that if the intrinsic growth rate of the population is larger than some threshold value determined by the size of the protection zone then there exists no maximum allowable harvest rate and the population always persists if however the intrinsic growth rate is less than this threshold value then there exists a maximally sustainable harvest rate such that for any harvest rate larger than this threshold value the population becomes extinct in a finite time moreover they demonstrated the existence of a harvesting strategy that maximises the total harvest of the population at equilibrium to the best of our knowledge no studies have focused on the effects of harvesting only along the spatial boundary of a protected habitat on the persistence or extinction of species members our objective is to fill this gap in the literature 3 model description the model studied in this paper is based on the well known logistic type reaction diffusion equation equipped with robin boundary conditions consider a single biological species exploiting natural resources for the purpose of survival in a bounded one dimensional homogeneous spatial domain d with boundaries ξ a and ξ b where ξ a ξ b let w ξ τ denote the population density of the species at position ξ d and at time τ 0 we assume that the spatio temporal evolution of this population is governed by the initial boundary value problem 1 d e w τ d 2 w ξ 2 g w ξ ξ a ξ b τ 0 2 b c d w ξ ξ ξ a α w ξ a τ d w ξ ξ ξ b α w ξ b τ τ 0 3 i c w ξ 0 w 0 ξ ξ ξ a ξ b where w 0 is a prescribed initial condition with a finite p norm in the limit as p as a function mapping elements from d to the non negative real numbers d denotes a positive constant diffusion rate and α is a non negative constant pro rata density migration rate of species members across the boundary of d the robin boundary conditions in 2 may be thought of as representing the situation where species members are removed exogenously or harvested at a rate proportional to their local density on the boundaries ξ a and ξ b of d the inclusion of these boundary conditions are motivated by an expectation that as the population becomes more abundant on the boundary of the protection zone where the population is harvested the population will be harvested more efficiently therefore it is assumed that the population is harvested at the boundaries of the protected habitat at a rate which is directly proportional to the local population density it is also assumed that there is no harvesting in the interior of d which is considered to be a protection zone the source term g w is assumed to be lipschitz continuous in w twice continuously differentiable with respect to w and to satisfy the concavity conditions 4 g 0 0 g k 0 and 2 g w 2 0 for all w 0 where k denotes the positive carrying capacity of the population in d which is assumed to be constant by the homogeneity of d after following a standard process of non dimensionalisation the model 1 3 becomes 5 d e u t 2 u x 2 g u x 0 1 t 0 6 b c u x x 0 κ u 0 t u x x 1 κ u 1 t t 0 7 i c u x 0 f x 0 x 0 1 in non dimensional form the non dimensionalisation transformation maps the spatial domain d to a new normalised domain ω 0 1 and implies that the boundary conditions in 6 may be interpreted as prescribing the outward pointing flux of the species as directly proportional to its density there with a constant of proportionality κ in essence the boundary conditions therefore state that species members leave the domain ω at a pro rata density rate of κ finally the concavity conditions in 4 may be restated as 8 g 0 0 g 1 0 and 2 g u 2 0 for all u 0 upon non dimensionalisation examples of widely adopted growth functions g u in applications satisfying these conditions are provided in table 1 the growth functions in the table are illustrated graphically in fig 1 for certain functional parameter values moreover it is assumed that the function g u can be expressed as g u u y u for some function y u where y u is a bounded twice continuously differentiable function of u 0 with y 1 0 and 9 d y d u 0 for all u 0 it is acknowledged that for several reasons other than the fact that the movements of the theoretical population are limited to a single spatial dimension the model derived above is a highly idealised abstraction of the growth and movement of real biological species the first limiting assumption is that the population density of the biological species under consideration can be modelled as a continuously differentiable function in both the space and time dimensions in contrast a real biological species typically consists of limited numbers of discrete entities in which case births and deaths may be noticeable as immediate discrete discontinuities in population numbers over time the assumption of continuity is however required in order to bring to bear on the model the considerable arsenal of analysis tools available within the mature realm of the differential calculus while this assumption may to an extent be justified if a large species population is considered real world model applicability is admittedly seriously hampered in the case of a biological species that occurs in small numbers within the habitat considered moreover the choice of the function g u x t which governs the intrinsic growth rate of the population is assumed to be zero only when the population density is zero but positive for small positive densities this assumption is highly idealised because although the population density u x t may be approaching zero in a specific region of the habitat at some time this may not be the case in other regions of the habitat at the same point in time in which case species members are still expected to be able to find mates for the purpose of reproduction if however the species density is indeed dwindling uniformly within its habitat species members may not be successful in finding mates while the population is still at a positive density while the latter phenomenon may be modelled by assuming that the intrinsic birth rate of the species becomes negative at low population densities a situation known as the allee effect allee 1931 the model is nevertheless simplified by assuming a birth rate that is concave as a function of population density because this renders the model amenable to analytic methods another unrealistic aspect of the birth rate function g u x t is that it is not an explicit function of time or space birth seasons and highly suitable breeding regions of the spatial habitat are therefore not accommodated in the model 4 preliminary results in studying models of the form 5 7 the widely adopted approach is to determine a sufficient criterion for the existence and uniqueness of a positive equilibrium solution that attracts all other solutions to 5 7 for which the initial condition f x in 7 is not identically zero in our context a maximally sustainable pro rata harvest rate κ κ may be established in terms of the principal eigenvalue of the corresponding eigenvalue problem which allows for the existence of a positive equilibrium attractor the following theorem provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a unique positive equilibrium solution to 5 7 in terms of the stability of the trivial solution u 0 this result is directly derived from propositions 3 1 3 3 of cantrell and cosner 2004 theorem 1 criteria for persistence and extinction suppose g u u y u and that the conditions in 8 9 hold if the principal eigenvalue σ σ 1 of 10 d 2 ϕ d x 2 y 0 ϕ σ ϕ x 0 1 11 d ϕ d x x 0 κ ϕ 0 d ϕ d x x 1 κ ϕ 1 is positive then 5 7 admits a unique positive equilibrium u and all solutions to 5 7 are eventually bounded from below by orbits of 5 7 which increase towards u as t if however the above eigenvalue is negative then 5 7 has no positive equilibria and any positive solution to 5 7 decays exponentially to zero as t uniformly for all x 0 1 therefore if the principal eigenvalue σ σ 1 to the eigenvalue problem 10 11 is positive then there exists a unique equilibrium u for each positive choice of κ note that if σ y 0 then it follows from 10 that ϕ is a linear function which is incompatible with the boundary conditions in 11 in view of the fact that κ 0 unless if ϕ 0 it may therefore be assumed that σ y 0 for any non zero real valued solution to 10 11 moreover the constant of proportionality κ in the boundary conditions is related to y 0 and the principal eigenvalue of 10 11 by the expression 12 κ y 0 σ tan y 0 σ 2 a result derived in appendix a the positive relationship in 12 is illustrated graphically in fig 2 parametrised by y 0 as may be seen in the figure there is a unique largest value of κ denoted by κ for which σ 0 the nature of the monotonic growth relationships between the parameters κ y 0 and σ 1 are captured in the following result corollary 1 the relationship between κ y 0 and σ 1 the principal eigenvalue σ σ 1 of 10 11 is a decreasing function of κ while κ is a decreasing function of y 0 a proof of corollary 1 is provided in appendix b biologically the parameter κ represents the proportion of the population that leaves the unit interval at x 0 and x 1 therefore it is to be expected that as the loss rate of the population across the boundary increases the spatially averaged growth rate given by the principal eigenvalue σ 1 would decrease this is indeed the case as guaranteed by corollary 1 similarly the parameter y 0 represents the maximum per capita growth rate and therefore should increase the spatially averaged growth rate σ 1 according to corollary 1 it follows from theorem 1 that the solution to 5 7 is attracted to the stable unique positive equilibrium solution u if f x 0 for all κ κ if however κ κ then the solution to 5 7 is attracted to the zero equilibrium by theorem 1 this result is summarised in the following theorem theorem 2 asymptotic behaviour of the solution to 5 7 if f x 0 then there exists a positive real number κ such that for any κ 0 κ the unique solution u x t to 5 7 is bounded from below by orbits which increase to the unique positive equilibrium solution u of 5 7 as t moreover for any κ κ u x t decays uniformly to zero as t practically theorem 2 implies that for any growth function g u satisfying 8 9 there exists some maximally allowable pro rata harvest rate which guarantees the persistence of species members in the unit interval 5 asymptotic solution analysis in section 4 it was shown that if κ κ then 5 7 admits a unique positive equilibrium solution u which is a global attractor for any positive choice of f x therefore the function u satisfies the two point boundary value problem 13 d e d 2 u d x 2 g u 0 x 0 1 14 b c d u d x x 0 κ u 0 d u d x x 1 κ u 1 for any κ 0 κ in this section we establish a number of important characteristics of u the first of these characteristics is that the unique positive equilibrium solution to 5 7 is a symmetric function on the unit interval theorem 3 spatial symmetry of the positive equilibrium solution let u x be the unique positive equilibrium solution to 5 7 then u x u 1 x for any x 0 1 a proof of the above result is provided in appendix c note that the result of theorem 3 does not require the growth function g u in 5 itself to be symmetric as was illustrated in fig 1 the spatial symmetry of the positive equilibrium solution yields insight into the spatial location of the global maximum of the positive equilibrium solution this location is established formally in the following result for which a proof is provided in appendix d corollary 2 extremal points of the positive equilibrium solution let u x be the unique positive equilibrium solution to 5 7 then u x attains global minima at x 0 and x 1 and a global maximum at x 1 2 for any κ 0 κ next it is shown that the maximum and minima of this equilibrium solution are decreasing functions of the pro rata harvest rate κ recall that the function u x satisfies the two point boundary value problem 13 14 multiplying 13 by d u d x on both sides yields 15 d 2 u d x 2 d u d x g u d u d x 0 which may be rewritten as 16 d d x 1 2 d u d x 2 g u 0 where 17 g u 0 u g s d s it therefore follows from 16 that 18 1 2 d u d x 2 g u α for some arbitrary constant α since d u d x 0 at the maximum of u x it follows that 19 1 2 d u d x 2 g u g u m where u m u 1 2 denotes the maximum value of u on 0 1 solving for d u d x in 19 yields 20 d u d x 2 g u m g u x 0 1 2 2 g u m g u x 1 2 1 in the case where x 0 1 2 21 d u d x 2 g u m g u and so separation of variables yields 22 where u 0 u 0 denotes the minimum value of u x on 0 1 the condition g u g u m restricts the range of u m and u 0 such that u 0 u m 0 1 with u 0 u m it is easily verified by means of a taylor expansion around the point u m that the integral in 22 converges for any u m 0 1 but diverges for u m 1 as elucidated in appendix e furthermore it follows from the first expression in 20 and from 14 that 23 d u d x x 0 2 g u m g u 0 κ u 0 so that 24 κ 2 g u m g u 0 u 0 the pair of eqs 22 and 24 in the three unknowns u 0 u m and κ is under determined and there is a unique pair of values u 0 and u m that corresponds to each valid choice of a value for κ in particular if κ 0 then u 0 u m which corresponds to the constant solution u x 1 by 13 14 furthermore theorem 2 guarantees the existence of a unique positive equilibrium solution u x to 13 14 only for κ κ and therefore u m 0 and u 0 0 as κ κ as a consequence 22 and 24 together represent a smooth curve l in three dimensional space parametrised by κ which begins at the point κ u 0 u m 0 1 1 and ends at the point κ u 0 u m κ 0 0 describing the unique relationship between κ the minimum value and the maximum value of the equilibrium solution at u 0 u 0 and u 1 2 u m respectively therefore a value may be chosen for κ upon which l may be employed to find the corresponding maximum and minimum values of the resulting equilibrium solution u to 13 14 it is next shown that u m and u 0 both decrease along the curve l as κ increases theorem 4 the curve l is monotonically decreasing let u x be the unique positive equilibrium solution to 5 7 then both u 0 u 0 κ and u m u m κ are decreasing functions of κ on the interval κ 0 κ a proof of theorem 4 is provided in appendix f and its result is demonstrated by numerical examples in fig 3 for the three reaction terms provided in table 1 in fig 3 the smooth curves l in the three dimensional space κ u 0 u m parametrised by κ are a consequence of 22 and 24 the following corollary follows as a direct result of theorem 4 and the uniqueness of solutions to 13 14 corollary 3 monotonicity of the positive equilibrium solution let u κ n x n n be an infinite sequence of unique positive equilibrium solutions to 5 7 with pro rata harvesting rates κ corresponding to the values in the sequence κ n n n respectively and satisfying the properties that κ n 1 κ n for all n n and that lim n κ n κ then u k n x u k n 1 x and lim n u κ n x 0 uniformly for all x 0 1 theorem 4 implies that both u m and u 0 decrease along the curve l as κ increases that is as the pro rata harvest rate increases the population densities at x 1 2 x 0 and x 1 all decrease therefore the total harvest yield per unit time at equilibrium along a single boundary of the spatial domain is given by κ u 0 and by the monotonicity of l there is a choice of κ denoted by κ o that maximises κ u 0 the value κ o is a solution to the classical optimisation problem 25 26 we close this section by establishing the well posedness of the optimisation problem 25 26 theorem 5 the existence of an optimal solution to 25 26 suppose that u x is the unique positive solution to 13 14 then there exists an optimal solution κ o 0 κ to 25 26 the proof of the result above is provided in appendix g theorem 5 implies that 25 26 represent a smooth curve l o in three dimensional space parametrised by κ that begins at the point z u 0 u m 0 0 0 and is initially increasing until it reaches the point z u 0 u m z o u 0 u m o where z o κ o u 0 and where u m o and u 0 denote the maximum and minimum values of u x corresponding to κ o respectively as κ increases beyond κ o the curve decreases until it reaches the point z u 0 u m 0 1 1 this is demonstrated by means of numerical examples in fig 4 for instances of the three reaction terms provided in table 1 6 discussion in this paper the sustainability of pro rata harvesting of a theoretical population on the boundary of a protected habitat was investigated our approach was to find a maximally sustainable pro rata harvest rate guaranteeing the persistence of the population modelled as an abstract initial boundary value problem involving a reaction diffusion equation and spatial emigration on the boundary of a protected habitat in the form of robin boundary conditions as a result of studying this abstract model which over simplifies the mechanisms governing the migration and reproduction of a biological population a number of insights where gained into the long term effectiveness of a protection zone in which harvesting is only allowed at the boundaries it was found that as the intrinsic birthrate of the population increases so too does the maximally sustainable positive pro rata harvest rate along the boundaries of the spatial domain this is an anticipated result because in reality it is expected that a population which reproduces sufficiently quickly can be harvested at a greater pro rata rate therefore it is important to consider a population s reproduction effectiveness when establishing a maximumly sustainable pro rata harvest rate on the boundary of a protected habitat two important characteristics of the population s equilibrium distribution were also established the first is that the equilibrium distribution is symmetric over the protected habitat this result provides insight into the spatial locations at which the population density attains its maximum and minimum values more specifically the maximum population density occurs at the centre of the habitat while the minimum population density occurs at the boundaries of the habitat where pro rata harvesting takes place this is a noteworthy insight for the purpose of formulating conservation strategies because if the habitat were to be altered in an attempt to increase the population s reproduction effectiveness it may be beneficial to enhance the reproduction capabilities of the population at the midpoint of the habitat where the population is at its maximum this region may then serve as a source for the protected habitat we finally also established a result guaranteeing the existence of a pro rata harvest rate that maximises the total harvest per unit time at equilibrium a numerical approach may be adopted in applications to find this optimal pro rata harvest rate for a specific case the existence of this optimal pro rata harvest rate is of interest because it implies that in this case less is more that is if the species were to be harvested at any pro rata sustainable harvest rate larger than the optimal harvest rate the total harvest in the long term will decrease as the population along the boundary of the protection zone decreases below an optimal boundary population density even though the total harvest may be larger in the short term moreover even if the population has up to the present been over exploited and a protection zone is henceforth enforced with harvesting at the boundaries of the protection zone at the optimal pro rata harvest rate the boundary population density will approach an optimal level in the long run at which a maximum total harvest per unit time will be obtainable in summary the results in this paper demonstrate that the establishment of a protection zone is not enough in itself to guarantee the sustainability of a species while the protection zone can indeed assume arbitrary dimensions it must be equipped with a restriction on the pro rata harvest rate at its boundaries in order to guarantee the long term substantiality of a species residing in the protection zone credit authorship contribution statement k d searle analysis and interpretation of the model drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content

24617,accurate predictions for sea lice abundance can have a great impact on effective management of the parasite sea lice data are often from multiple production cycles coming from different aquaculture sites and exhibit strong process and observation variations presenting challenges in developing effective prediction tools reliable predictions of sea lice abundance on aquaculture sites can save money and efforts in organizing effective control measures a quantitative evaluation of different methods for estimating sea lice infestation pressure on aquaculture sites was presented in a preparatory paper elghafghuf et al 2020 in the current work we used the favored method for infestation pressure and predicted future sea lice abundances on different parasitic life stages at the site level using a multivariate state space model fitted to data from aquaculture sites located near grand manan island in the bay of fundy new brunswick canada we employed a rolling prediction procedure that did not require the prediction model to be refitted to the data at each time of prediction and compared our results with those from a similar approach involving re estimation of the model at each prediction the accuracies of predictions were assessed based on hold out samples of data whereby the predictions were computed without prior knowledge of these observations the results showed that the non updated model procedure gave short term six weeks predictions with reasonable accuracy albeit lower prediction errors could be obtained with the updated model approach the performance of the non updated model prediction as well as its practical and computational advantages suggests it to be well suited for user friendly implementation linked to underlying database additionally the research quantified the contributions of predictive covariates such as infestation pressures to the sea lice predictions keywords state space models sea lice prediction prediction accuracy sea lice infestation 1 introduction predicting future sea lice abundance on aquaculture site farms is crucial for planning decisions in effective management of the parasite aldrin et al 2017 elghafghuf et al 2018 st hilaire et al 2018 accurate predictions have the potential to increase the productivity of aquaculture sites by improving sea lice management improving salmon health and welfare and minimizing the economic and environmental costs ashley 2007 overton et al 2019 sea lice time series often exhibit strong process and observation variations presenting challenges in developing effective prediction tools effective models of parasite abundance and improvement of the quality of predictions remain outstanding research challenges furthermore predictive procedures that are easy to implement and do not require intensive computing time e g procedures that are based on non updated prediction models are of great interest if they can be applied to the reality of aquaculture production settings this research is part of ongoing project aims to build predictive tools for sea lice abundance on aquaculture sites in the bay of fundy new brunswick canada and to help estimate parasite transmission rates within and among aquaculture sites in previous work elghafghuf et al 2020 the performance of different approaches for quantifying sea lice infestation pressure on salmon farms was compared based on a simple version of multivariate state space model with the purpose of choosing the most appropriate method here we build on the previous work and use the infestation pressure variables from the favored estimation method of elghafghuf et al 2020 for predicting sea lice abundance the specific objectives of this research were firstly to build a predictive state space model for sea lice abundance on aquaculture sites the model should include important predictive covariates such as infestation pressures water temperature and chemotherapeutants and simultaneously accounts for different parasitic life stages secondly to compute short term predictions of future sea lice abundance at the site level with the purpose of informing decisions by producers to improve pest prevention and health management for farmed salmon 2 materials and methods 2 1 multivariate time series analysis we used a multivariate autoregressive state space marss model hinrichsen and holmes 2009 holmes et al 2012 to estimate key parameters for sea lice populations on aquaculture sites near grand manan island new brunswick canada sea lice populations were reported in this data set for three categories 1 chalimus 2 pre adult male female and adult male pa and 3 adult female af life stages further description of data study location model formulae and model construction can be found in the online supplemental materials and in elghafghuf et al 2020 2 2 marss model configurations in elghafghuf et al 2020 we used constrained forms for model parameters other than the sea lice infestation pressure parameters i e only sea lice infestation pressure effects were allowed to be different among production cycles while other model parameters were assumed to be common for all cycles a common parameter means the effect was estimated as one parameter across time series and different parameters mean each time series had its own parameters here we investigated different parameter configurations by carrying out two marss model analyses one analysis where parameters in the models were assumed to be either common or different across sites but always common among cycles within the same site ms1 ms25 in table s1 supplementary information in the second analysis all model parameters were allowed to be either common or different over production cycles mc1 mc25 in table s1 supplementary information except the parameter r that was allowed to vary only among sites whenever it was assumed to be different this was because a model with r varying by cycle was impractical and very time consuming the covariates bath feed chemotherapeutants internal external infestation pressures and in situ water temperature were included in all models in each of the two analyses we fitted three sets of models a b and c in addition to the complete constrained model all parameters are common across time series model set a included all marss models with one different parameter across either sites or production cycles 9 models in each analysis in set b we started with the marss model that had the best fit in set a based on aicc values aicc is a sample size corrected akaike information criterion and allowed for the second parameter to be varying among sites and production cycles so set b had 8 models in the analysis separated by site and the same in the one separated by cycle we used the same procedure in set c and allowed for a third parameter to vary in the models either by site or production cycle resulted in 7 models in each analysis we stopped at models with three varying parameters because allowing for a forth parameter to be different across cycles greatly increased the number of parameters in the model leading to larger models thus complicated the analysis and required excessive computing time with very little gain in the model fit finally the marss model with the smallest aicc value over the three model sets and across the two analyses was selected to be the final model to our data the model residuals and autocorrelations were checked to ensure no trends or serial autocorrelations 2 3 predicting sea lice abundance the study period from time 1 to time t was divided in two time intervals fig 1 the first interval contained all observations from time 1 to time a t i e from 2010w20 to 2015w25 having 21 full production cycles and 11 right truncated cycles and acted as training data the second time interval included the rest of observations in the 11 right truncated cycles from time a 1 to the end of each production cycle i e 2015w26 onwards we refer to the corresponding set of data in the second time interval as test data the test data were used as hold out samples meaning the predictions were produced without prior knowledge of these values four different scenarios for sea lice predictions were used to illustrate the predictive ability of the state space model used in the study in all scenarios a marss model with a parameter configuration similar to the one that best fit to the entire data was applied to the training data using the model estimates out of sample predictions on the test data were produced for weeks a because our interest was in the future true sea lice populations rather than the observed abundance we predicted sea lice abundance only at the population level i e predictions were computed for x t 2 3 1 prediction scenarios i and ii in scenarios i and ii we predicted the pa and af abundances x a h h 1 6 using the formula 1 x a h b x a h 1 u c c a h where x a h are the predicted states at week a h h represents the time points in the prediction horizon b u and c are the estimated model parameters in the two scenarios a prediction horizon of six weeks was used the only difference between scenarios i and ii was that the infestation pressure variables were part of the model and prediction in scenario ii but not in scenario i when h 3 in prediction scenario ii the infestation pressure variables were computed based on previous predicted af abundances as described in elghafghuf et al 2020 other predictive covariates remained as in the data and they were included in the prediction for both scenarios 2 3 2 prediction scenario iii in this scenario we generated prediction distributions and allowed for prediction uncertainty a six week rolling prediction was employed and 1000 predictions were computed in each time step of the prediction horizon predictions were produced from marss models like the one used in scenario ii fitted to the training data set once the first 1000 sets of six week predictions from week a 1 to week a 6 were produced based on a model fitted to data from week 1 to week a one additional observation the first observation of the test set was added to the training data set the prediction model updated i e it was re estimated based on data from week 1 to week a 1 and new 1000 sets of six week predictions were computed this procedure was repeated for each time origin from a to a 5 i e until each observation a i where i 0 5 was embodied into the corresponding training set fig 2 the prediction model in this scenario was updated at every observation added to the training data set for time origin a scenario iii predictions were computed using 2 x a h b x a h 1 u c c a h w a h where the error w a h was normally distributed with zero means and estimated variance covariance matrix q and h 1 6 2 3 3 prediction scenario iv the goal of this prediction scenario was to develop a prediction procedure for sea lice abundance that could be easy to implement take into account new data without requiring to refit the model to the data at each time of prediction using kalman filter states the state space model was able to accommodate these issues based on a model fitted to data until time t 1 the predicted lice abundance at time t was adjusted by an observed abundance at t without refitting the model to the data and based on the adjusted lice abundance at t prediction for t 1 was computed the prediction distribution in this scenario was generated based on the same marss model as in scenario iii using a rolling prediction approach the first 1000 sets of six week predictions for pa and af abundances based on time origin a i e x a h h 1 6 were computed as follows conditional on data d until week a x a h d a is gaussian with mean m a h b m a h 1 u c c a h and variance ϕ a h b ϕ a h 1 b q where m a and ϕ a are respectively the mean and variance of the estimated kalman filter state at time a extracted from the prediction model i e x a h d a m v n m a h ϕ a h before the next set of six week predictions computed the predicted sea lice abundance state at a 1 was adjusted by y a 1 when became available in real situations without refitting the model to the data the adjusted estimated state for a 1 can be written as 3 x a 1 u p m a 1 u p m a 1 k a 1 y a 1 m a 1 where k a 1 ϕ a 1 ϕ a 1 r 1 subsequently the second 1000 sets of six week predictions for weeks a 2 to a 7 based on time origin a 1 were computed using m a 1 x a 1 u p as x a h 1 d a 1 m v n m a h 1 ϕ a h 1 where m a h 1 b m a h u c c a h 1 and ϕ a h 1 b ϕ a h b q this six step rolling prediction procedure was repeated for all time origins in the interval a a 5 fig 2 note that in the case of no lice counts missing values were interpolated by previous observations in the calculation of eq 3 instead of refitting the model to the data to update estimation in each forward time step when new data became available as in scenario iii we adjusted the predicted state at each time new data reported in real situation without refitting the model to the data in other words in scenario iii all model estimates were updated at each week new data reported while in scenario iv only the predicted lice abundance state was updated without rerunning the model at each time new data became available 2 3 4 prediction accuracy we used the absolute error the absolute difference between the observed and predicted data and the mean absolute error mae to evaluate the accuracy of predictions in scenarios i and ii mae was calculated as the average of the absolute error over sites while such absolute differences were averaged across simulations and time points in the prediction horizon for scenarios iii and iv we also used the quantile scoring biau and patra 2011 makridakis et al 2020 as a second method for evaluating the accuracy of prediction distributions quantile forecast in scenarios iii and iv let α α 0 01 0 99 be the target quantile q α t the quantile prediction and y t the observed lice abundance at week t in the prediction horizon based on the pinball loss function the quantile score can be computed as 4 l q α t y t y t q α t α if y t q α t q α t y t 1 α if q α t y t in quantile predictions we want the true value y t to be less than the prediction in α 100 of the time for instance our prediction for the 0 25 quantile should be such that y t is less than y t 25 of the time to compare the respective accuracy of two quantile models e g prediction scenario iii vs iv the score computed from the pinball loss in 4 was averaged for each model over all quantiles and all time points the quantile model that had the smallest average score was the most accurate finally we computed one step ahead predictions for the rest of the production cycles i e from time a 1 to the end of the production cycle using the scenario iv approach in order to compare results with those reported in aldrin et al 2017 as described in aldrin et al 2017 the mean absolute percentage error mape for the fitted values interval from time 1 to a and predictions from time a 1 to the end of the cycle were computed after back transforming the data 3 results the reader should refer to fig 1 and table 2 in elghafghuf et al 2020 for information on the distributions of pa and af abundances and predictive covariates 3 1 model comparisons all marss models fitted to the data set are listed along with their log likelihood and aicc values in table s1 supplementary information when one parameter in the model was different models in set a had poorer aicc than ms1 the completely constrained model with exception of models that had different q and r and different c b in the analysis that was separated by cycle also separating the analysis by cycle in set a did not show substantial improvements in the model fit compared with those separated by site except for mc2 different q and mc6 different c b this indicates that the heterogeneity in q and c b was larger among cycles than sites it is worth mentioning that whenever r was different it varied by site we tried to vary r by production cycle but the model encountered convergence problems in model set b two different parameters q and one other parameter the cycle separated models had much smaller aicc values compared with the site separated models the smallest aicc value in set b was for the model with different q and r mc11 in the cycle separated analysis in set c three different parameters q r and one other parameter the same patterns as in set b were observed i e the cycle separated models had lower aicc values when compared with the corresponding models in the site separated analyses the model with different q r and c e mc24 was associated with the smallest aicc value among all models in set c finally the model with cycle varied q and site varied r mc11 had the lowest aicc value across all analyses therefore it was selected to be the final model for the grand manan sea lice data table s2 supplementary information displays parameter estimates from mc11 3 2 parasite abundance prediction 3 2 1 scenarios i and ii predictions with and without infestation pressures the absolute error and mean absolute error of prediction scenarios i and ii are summarized in table 1 for the pa time series most of the weeks in the prediction horizon showed that predictions from scenario ii with infestation pressures had smaller absolute errors compared with predictions from scenario i no infestation pressures when the absolute error was averaged across time series i e mae maes were smaller for scenario ii predictions than those from scenario i this indicates that including the infestation pressures in the model and the computation of predictions improved the accuracy of prediction similar error patterns as in the pa predictions were observed for af predictions although the infestation pressure effects were measured only on the pa time series the small differences in the af prediction errors between scenarios i and ii were presumably because the pa and af time series were linked through the autoregressive process lastly the maes were almost always smaller for af than pa predictions in the two scenarios 3 2 2 scenario iii predictions based on updated model the mean absolute errors of scenario iii predictions are displayed in table 2 the prediction error increased with time steps and varied among sites and life stages for example site 6 had the lowest mae for pa in time step one whereas site 19 was associated with the highest mae in the same time step for af the smallest and largest magnitudes of mae for one step ahead prediction were observed in sites 20 and 8 respectively furthermore the prediction variability varied between life stages and among sites and increased as the time in the prediction horizon got further into the future evaluating the whole prediction distribution for each site using the quantile scoring showed an average quantile score that was variable among sites and differed between the pa and af predictions scenario iii table 3 also the prediction accuracy decreased with increasing the time steps in the prediction horizon for one step ahead prediction the average of pinball loss quantile score of prediction distribution varied from 0 069 to 0 521 for pa and between 0 071 0 225 for af individually site 1 had step one pa prediction distributions with the smallest average of pinball loss quantile score and site 19 showed the largest score values for the same lice category the smallest and largest average pinball loss quantile scores of one step ahead af predictions were for sites 7 and 8 respectively 3 2 3 scenario iv predictions based on non updated model predictions from scenario iv had error patterns similar to scenario iii predictions however prediction errors were larger than those from scenario iii scenario iv table 2 as in scenario iii sites 6 and 19 were associated with the lowest and highest mae for the pa predictions respectively while the lowest mae for af predations was for site 20 and the highest for site 8 the spread of prediction distribution varied by site and life stages and such a spread increased with time steps in the prediction horizon and with time origins in the same time step the average pinball loss quantile score differed among sites and between pa and af and increased with time steps scenario iv table 3 for example the average of pinball loss quantile score for one step ahead pa predictions ranged between 0 093 and 0 458 with the smallest average score for site 6 and largest for site 19 the one step ahead af predictions had an average score varied across sites from 0 103 to 0 264 and sites 20 and 8 were associated with the smallest and largest average score values respectively 3 2 4 comparison of prediction scenarios iii and iv predictions from the updated model scenario scenario iii had maes lower than those from the non updated model scenario scenario iv in the first time steps of the prediction horizon and as time progresses these prediction errors approached each other for both pa and af lice abundances the small maes in the beginning of the prediction horizon for the updated model scenario compared with the non updated model scenario came at a cost of refitting the model to the training data at each time origin in the test set to update parameters when the absolute error was averaged across simulations for each week in the prediction horizon the prediction error of the non updated model scenario slightly increased as predictions got farther away from the estimation period table 4 this was not the case for the updated model scenario as each set of the six week predictions was directly linked to the estimation period i e the number of weeks from the estimation period is always 0 unlike the updated model scenario the step one non updated model prediction for 0 weeks from the estimation period included the estimation error of states therefore its mae was slightly larger than the corresponding mae of the updated model prediction table 4 note that the column means in table 4 are the mae values reported in table 2 for the corresponding sites and life stage the same patterns were observed when the prediction distribution was evaluated using the pinball loss quantile scoring the means of pinball loss quantile scores were generally smaller for predictions of the updated model scenario than those from the non updated model scenario for one step ahead predictions from the updated and non updated model scenarios showed different behaviors over the six time point test set and such a difference was more pronounced for the pa lice abundance than for the af abundance fig 3 this may be because the observation error variance was part of the prediction computation in the non updated model scenario while it was not in the updated model scenario table 4 lastly the prediction distributions of the non updated model scenario had increasing with time spread within the same time step and such a spread was larger compared with the updated model scenario fig 3 despite the smaller prediction errors of the updated model scenario compared with the non updated model scenario especially in the beginning of the prediction horizon the prediction approach used in the non updated model scenario was more practical and easier to implement compared with the updated model approach that required excessive computing time due to refitting the model multiple times finally the mean absolute percentage error of scenario iv one step ahead predictions for the period from 2015w26 onwards from a 1 to the end of production cycle was computed for pa and af to be 38 6 and 22 1 respectively for the estimation period mapes of the fitted values were estimated at 27 7 for pa and 21 5 for af these mape values were smaller than those reported in aldrin et al 2017 for both the estimation and prediction periods fig 4 shows the model fits estimation period and predicted trajectories prediction period along with the actual data for the pa and af lice abundances 3 3 estimated effects 3 3 1 predictive covariates bath treatments showed a similar reduction in both the pa and af abundances the estimates on the exponential scale were 0 512 and 0 533 for pa and af respectively these values correspond to post treatment reduction of 48 8 and 46 7 for pa and af abundances ln scale respectively feed treatments on the other hand did not show a strong reduction of sea lice abundance as bath treatments the non negligible effects of feed treatments c f were observed only on the af abundance and estimated on exponential scale at 0 932 this indicates that the reduction of af abundance over four week post feed treatments was 6 8 water temperature had a positive impact on pa and af abundances but its effect was larger on the pa abundance than on the af abundance these effects were estimated at 0 171 for pa and 0 073 for af indicating averages of 17 1 and 7 3 incline on ln scale per each additional temperature unit for pa and af respectively the external infestation pressure elevated the pa lice abundance whereas the internal pressure had a negligible effect the estimated effect for the ln external infestation pressure c e was 0 087 which means there was an increase on average of 8 7 in the ln pa abundance per week across production cycles 3 3 2 transition and scaling parameters the effect of pa abundance on itself b p a elements in b and the scaling parameter u were estimated at 0 908 and 0 081 respectively these values are corresponding to a process mean of μ 0 880 for ln pa abundance in absence of treatments and when water temperature and infestation pressures at the average values similarly the estimated values for the effect of af abundance on itself b a f elements in b effect of pa on af abundance b p a a f elements in b and u were 0 880 0 126 and 0 051 respectively which are corresponding to μ of 1 349 for ln af abundance when no treatments and water temperature is at the mean for instance if the ln pa and af abundances at time t 1 were the same and equal to 1 with average water temperature and no treatments then the ln af abundance at time t is estimated as b a f x a f t 1 b p a a f x p a t 1 u a f 0 880 0 126 0 051 1 057 i e there was an increase of 5 7 in ln af abundance for one step transition 3 3 3 process and observation errors the process error variance was larger for pa than af in most of the production cycles the estimates varied between 0 087 0 693 and 0 064 1 025 for pa and af respectively with corresponding covariance between pa and af abundances ranged across cycles between 0 066 and 0 365 the observation error variances for pa and af on the other hand were estimated as different parameters across sites cycles within the same site were pooled the estimated values ranged between 0 003 0 246 and 0 031 0 267 for pa and af respectively and the covariance between pa and af abundances varied from 0 053 to 0 096 finally the process error variance was almost always larger than the observation error variance although the former was estimated as different parameters at the cycle level 4 discussion in the present paper we simultaneously modeled pa and af abundances using a multivariate state space modeling approach with the purpose of building a predictive tool for the parasite abundance on aquaculture sites accurately predicting the parasite abundance can help in establishing a protocol for effective management strategies including the efficient use of chemotherapeutants reducing the amount necessary to manage the parasite and thus minimizing the effects on the environment in addition to the advantage of sequentially modeling the pa and af abundances in time state space models account for multiple sources of variation e g latent and observation errors better understanding of how to partition variation should lead to some improvements in prediction accuracy our model accounted for the variation in the state and observation processes and accommodated many features of sea lice data however it did not account for larval lice stages nor did it take into account the variation in parameters which may be needed to improve prediction accuracy and lower prediction variability petris et al 2009 short term predictions of pa and af lice abundances on site farms were produced from the marss model using different scenarios in all scenarios predictions were at the population level and for six weeks afterward however a rolling prediction technique was used only in scenarios iii and iv i e predictions were updated at every single origin 4 1 the contribution of infestation pressure in predicting sea lice abundance including infestation pressure variables in the model and therefore in the computations of pa prediction gave predictions with smaller errors relative to predictions from the model that did not include infestation pressures although the differences in maes were not large this may be due to the negligible estimated effects of internal infestation pressure in the training data and the small number of production cycles in the test data set that perhaps lowered the sea lice output from the neighboring sites chalimus stages result from environmental exposure to copepodids attachment stage whereas pa may originate from either environmental transfer of this stage or more commonly from the development of attached chalimus stages into mobile pa stages therefore any infestation pressure estimates for pa would include the delayed impact of that pressure derived from earlier chalimus stages more information about the effects of internal and external infestation pressures on aquaculture sites in the grand manan region can be found in elghafghuf et al 2020 the af predictions showed some differences in maes compared with the scenario of no infestation pressures although the effects of internal and external infestation pressures were estimated only for the pa time series these differences were because the model allowed for the af abundance to be affected by previous pa abundance and such an effect was carried over to the predictions i e the estimated effect of pa on af was measured by the off diagonal elements of b matrix furthermore the pa predictions were affected through the infestation pressures by the af predictions after the first three weeks in the prediction horizon because the infestation pressures were represented by the af abundance three weeks back elghafghuf et al 2020 in fact what we predicted was affected by the predictions themselves but at lagged time predictions from such linked time series are unlikely to be as accurate as predictions from unrelated time series however partitioning variation and allowing for time variation in parameters should lead to improvements in prediction accuracy and reduce prediction uncertainty dietze 2018 4 2 predictions from updated model scenario iii the updated model prediction scenario that employed a rolling forecasting technique based on a multivariate state space model yielded prediction with reasonable errors both the pinball loss quantile scoring and mae indicated similar error patterns however sites that had the lowest mae did not match the ones that had the smallest average of the pinball loss quantile score the predictions showed decreasing accuracy as time progressed and such an accuracy varied among sites and between pa and af lice categories as expected the prediction uncertainty became bigger and bigger as the prediction horizon got further into the future similar findings were reported in elghafghuf et al 2018 although the prediction scenario and evaluation were somewhat different with the exception of time step one where pa and af predictions depended on the model estimations of pa and af abundances the predicted af abundance at week t 1 depended on the predicted abundance of pa at week t for all subsequent time steps the same case applied to pa predictions but beyond week three in the prediction horizon in this situation the accuracy of predictions at one time step affects the accuracy at the subsequent time steps biologically the parasite life stages affect each other at different times and such effects must be considered to account for the parasite life cycle st hilaire et al 2018 elghafghuf et al 2018 4 3 predictions from non updated model scenario iv the prediction approach used in the non updated model scenario produced predictions with acceptable accuracy similar to the findings in scenario iii the prediction errors were variable among sites and lice categories with increasing error patterns over the prediction horizon the uncertainty around predictions propagated across time steps of the prediction horizon and over time origins of the test set within the same time step the increasing with time spread of predictions within the same time step was not surprising as it can clearly be seen in the prediction equation for updating the state variance where the process error variance q was added at each time step furthermore the adjustment of prediction at a certain time depended on the prediction error at that time and the magnitude of observation error variance r in the training data where the smaller the r the closer the adjusted lice abundance was to the observed abundance and therefore a more accurate prediction for the next time step also there were no patterns that can clearly favor one site on anther with respect to the prediction adjustment when the sea lice abundance is not reported one can extrapolate the data or skip the adjustment step in our case because missing abundances occurred over short sequences we imputed missing values in the test data set by the observed lice abundances in the previous week finally the mapes for the fitted values over the training period and one step ahead predictions for the rest of production cycles i e the truncated parts of the cycles were both smaller than those reported in aldrin et al 2017 4 4 updated model versus non updated model scenarios predictions from the two scenarios had reasonable errors however prediction errors from the updated model scenario were smaller than those from the non updated model scenario especially in the beginning of the prediction horizon and the two prediction errors started to approach each other later in the prediction horizon these results were expected since the model estimates were updated at each time origin in the test data set before a new set of predictions was computed also the estimation error of the states was part of the prediction computation in the non updated model scenario but it was not for the updated model procedure in fact the updated model scenario was used in the study for the purpose of comparing prediction performance with the non updated model scenario the excessive computing time due to refitting the model to the data at each time point made the updated model scenario impractical and difficult to implement therefore it was not of interest in contrast the non updated model approach required the model to be fitted to the data once and predictions computed based on that fit by adjusting predictions using new observed abundances the new subsequent predictions were computed based on these adjusted predictions this was one of the fundamental features of state space models that can lead to rapid predictions and improve prediction accuracy finally this adjusted prediction technique was practical and straightforward to use which was advantageous over the updated model approach 4 5 effects of predictive covariates in addition to sea lice infestation pressures water temperature and bath and feed treatments were included in the model and prediction computations we found that exposure to these covariates contributed significantly to predict lice abundance on fish at site levels however our model showed negligible effects for the internal infestation pressure and feed treatment on pa abundance which may be attributable to the nature of the region and the limited scope of the data set elghafghuf et al 2020 in sea lice prediction predictive variables themselves may need to be predicted for example the infestation pressure variables and water temperature the infestation pressures were available up to three weeks ahead and after that their values were computed from the af predictions for water temperature the available records during the test period were used for the purpose of evaluating predictions however in many situations reliable predictions of surface water temperature at the industry wide level may be available for one week ahead in all cases accurate predictions depend on the accuracy of predictor values and the continuity of the relationships between the predictions and the predictive covariates into the prediction period 4 6 effects of other model parameters the development of pa and af abundances from one step to the next was described by the scaling parameter u and the transition matrix b and such a process was carried to predictions in addition to the intra specific effects of pa and af the transition from pa to af was accounted for using a one week lag in other words af predictions at a certain week depended on both the pa and af predictions of previous week the state space model results showed higher process mean μ for af abundance than for pa abundance and the two abundances were slowly reverted to their process means in sea lice such a mean reversion process may be thought of as when the parasite abundance appears to reach some sort of equilibrium state due to management as a matter of fact sea lice populations are anticipated to grow unless management intervention takes place similar findings were reported in elghafghuf et al 2018 although they modeled juvenile and mobile adult stages of caligus rogercresseyi the process error variance was estimated as different parameters across production cycles while the observation error variance was assumed common within site if site had multiple cycles and estimated in a way that each site had its own variance we attempted to separate the analysis by production cycle and estimate the observation error variance for each cycle but the model encountered convergence problems the process error variance was used in generating prediction distributions of updated model and non updated model scenarios whereas the observation error variance was only part in the computation of non updated model predictions the smaller the magnitude of observation error variance the closer the adjusted predicted state was to the corresponding observation in the non updated model scenario lastly most of the variation in the data was at the latent process level which may be because sea lice populations were exposed to different managerial and environmental conditions 4 7 practical implications and future work this research explored the potential of utilizing a multivariate state space model for predicting future pa and af lice abundances at the site level predicting future sea lice infestation levels is important for the salmon farming industry to effectively plan management strategies against the parasite data regarding many changing variables including spatial temporal changes in environmental influences are becoming more available and more precise and thus enabling the use of ecological models such as the state space model to gradual and incremental improvement in sea lice prediction predictions of sea lice infestations are useful for evaluating the efficiency of different control measures and exploring various management scenarios the study evaluated different prediction scenarios for sea lice abundance and assessed the accuracy of short term predictions from these scenarios which are essential to identify suitable prediction procedures that are feasible to implement using the current industry driven fish itrends database and workflow the required information to use the suggested non updated model prediction procedure is the parameter estimates related to sea lice abundance in the population i e the current estimated state process error variance observation error variance transition parameter intrinsic rate of increase available from historical data three weeks worth of sea lice abundance and treatment events to inform the procedure with the current sea lice infestation level and to account for the infestation pressures and treatment events and an accurate forecast for water temperatures no matter where we are in the production cycle the procedure will adjust itself once new data become available future research should expand this work include chalimus stages and estimate model parameters based on data from all aquaculture sites in the bay of fundy the model should allow for temporal changes in the parameters to capture the variability of effects over time which can lead to improving prediction accuracy and reducing uncertainty finally the developed model could be used in simulation studies that allow investigation of sea lice control

24617,accurate predictions for sea lice abundance can have a great impact on effective management of the parasite sea lice data are often from multiple production cycles coming from different aquaculture sites and exhibit strong process and observation variations presenting challenges in developing effective prediction tools reliable predictions of sea lice abundance on aquaculture sites can save money and efforts in organizing effective control measures a quantitative evaluation of different methods for estimating sea lice infestation pressure on aquaculture sites was presented in a preparatory paper elghafghuf et al 2020 in the current work we used the favored method for infestation pressure and predicted future sea lice abundances on different parasitic life stages at the site level using a multivariate state space model fitted to data from aquaculture sites located near grand manan island in the bay of fundy new brunswick canada we employed a rolling prediction procedure that did not require the prediction model to be refitted to the data at each time of prediction and compared our results with those from a similar approach involving re estimation of the model at each prediction the accuracies of predictions were assessed based on hold out samples of data whereby the predictions were computed without prior knowledge of these observations the results showed that the non updated model procedure gave short term six weeks predictions with reasonable accuracy albeit lower prediction errors could be obtained with the updated model approach the performance of the non updated model prediction as well as its practical and computational advantages suggests it to be well suited for user friendly implementation linked to underlying database additionally the research quantified the contributions of predictive covariates such as infestation pressures to the sea lice predictions keywords state space models sea lice prediction prediction accuracy sea lice infestation 1 introduction predicting future sea lice abundance on aquaculture site farms is crucial for planning decisions in effective management of the parasite aldrin et al 2017 elghafghuf et al 2018 st hilaire et al 2018 accurate predictions have the potential to increase the productivity of aquaculture sites by improving sea lice management improving salmon health and welfare and minimizing the economic and environmental costs ashley 2007 overton et al 2019 sea lice time series often exhibit strong process and observation variations presenting challenges in developing effective prediction tools effective models of parasite abundance and improvement of the quality of predictions remain outstanding research challenges furthermore predictive procedures that are easy to implement and do not require intensive computing time e g procedures that are based on non updated prediction models are of great interest if they can be applied to the reality of aquaculture production settings this research is part of ongoing project aims to build predictive tools for sea lice abundance on aquaculture sites in the bay of fundy new brunswick canada and to help estimate parasite transmission rates within and among aquaculture sites in previous work elghafghuf et al 2020 the performance of different approaches for quantifying sea lice infestation pressure on salmon farms was compared based on a simple version of multivariate state space model with the purpose of choosing the most appropriate method here we build on the previous work and use the infestation pressure variables from the favored estimation method of elghafghuf et al 2020 for predicting sea lice abundance the specific objectives of this research were firstly to build a predictive state space model for sea lice abundance on aquaculture sites the model should include important predictive covariates such as infestation pressures water temperature and chemotherapeutants and simultaneously accounts for different parasitic life stages secondly to compute short term predictions of future sea lice abundance at the site level with the purpose of informing decisions by producers to improve pest prevention and health management for farmed salmon 2 materials and methods 2 1 multivariate time series analysis we used a multivariate autoregressive state space marss model hinrichsen and holmes 2009 holmes et al 2012 to estimate key parameters for sea lice populations on aquaculture sites near grand manan island new brunswick canada sea lice populations were reported in this data set for three categories 1 chalimus 2 pre adult male female and adult male pa and 3 adult female af life stages further description of data study location model formulae and model construction can be found in the online supplemental materials and in elghafghuf et al 2020 2 2 marss model configurations in elghafghuf et al 2020 we used constrained forms for model parameters other than the sea lice infestation pressure parameters i e only sea lice infestation pressure effects were allowed to be different among production cycles while other model parameters were assumed to be common for all cycles a common parameter means the effect was estimated as one parameter across time series and different parameters mean each time series had its own parameters here we investigated different parameter configurations by carrying out two marss model analyses one analysis where parameters in the models were assumed to be either common or different across sites but always common among cycles within the same site ms1 ms25 in table s1 supplementary information in the second analysis all model parameters were allowed to be either common or different over production cycles mc1 mc25 in table s1 supplementary information except the parameter r that was allowed to vary only among sites whenever it was assumed to be different this was because a model with r varying by cycle was impractical and very time consuming the covariates bath feed chemotherapeutants internal external infestation pressures and in situ water temperature were included in all models in each of the two analyses we fitted three sets of models a b and c in addition to the complete constrained model all parameters are common across time series model set a included all marss models with one different parameter across either sites or production cycles 9 models in each analysis in set b we started with the marss model that had the best fit in set a based on aicc values aicc is a sample size corrected akaike information criterion and allowed for the second parameter to be varying among sites and production cycles so set b had 8 models in the analysis separated by site and the same in the one separated by cycle we used the same procedure in set c and allowed for a third parameter to vary in the models either by site or production cycle resulted in 7 models in each analysis we stopped at models with three varying parameters because allowing for a forth parameter to be different across cycles greatly increased the number of parameters in the model leading to larger models thus complicated the analysis and required excessive computing time with very little gain in the model fit finally the marss model with the smallest aicc value over the three model sets and across the two analyses was selected to be the final model to our data the model residuals and autocorrelations were checked to ensure no trends or serial autocorrelations 2 3 predicting sea lice abundance the study period from time 1 to time t was divided in two time intervals fig 1 the first interval contained all observations from time 1 to time a t i e from 2010w20 to 2015w25 having 21 full production cycles and 11 right truncated cycles and acted as training data the second time interval included the rest of observations in the 11 right truncated cycles from time a 1 to the end of each production cycle i e 2015w26 onwards we refer to the corresponding set of data in the second time interval as test data the test data were used as hold out samples meaning the predictions were produced without prior knowledge of these values four different scenarios for sea lice predictions were used to illustrate the predictive ability of the state space model used in the study in all scenarios a marss model with a parameter configuration similar to the one that best fit to the entire data was applied to the training data using the model estimates out of sample predictions on the test data were produced for weeks a because our interest was in the future true sea lice populations rather than the observed abundance we predicted sea lice abundance only at the population level i e predictions were computed for x t 2 3 1 prediction scenarios i and ii in scenarios i and ii we predicted the pa and af abundances x a h h 1 6 using the formula 1 x a h b x a h 1 u c c a h where x a h are the predicted states at week a h h represents the time points in the prediction horizon b u and c are the estimated model parameters in the two scenarios a prediction horizon of six weeks was used the only difference between scenarios i and ii was that the infestation pressure variables were part of the model and prediction in scenario ii but not in scenario i when h 3 in prediction scenario ii the infestation pressure variables were computed based on previous predicted af abundances as described in elghafghuf et al 2020 other predictive covariates remained as in the data and they were included in the prediction for both scenarios 2 3 2 prediction scenario iii in this scenario we generated prediction distributions and allowed for prediction uncertainty a six week rolling prediction was employed and 1000 predictions were computed in each time step of the prediction horizon predictions were produced from marss models like the one used in scenario ii fitted to the training data set once the first 1000 sets of six week predictions from week a 1 to week a 6 were produced based on a model fitted to data from week 1 to week a one additional observation the first observation of the test set was added to the training data set the prediction model updated i e it was re estimated based on data from week 1 to week a 1 and new 1000 sets of six week predictions were computed this procedure was repeated for each time origin from a to a 5 i e until each observation a i where i 0 5 was embodied into the corresponding training set fig 2 the prediction model in this scenario was updated at every observation added to the training data set for time origin a scenario iii predictions were computed using 2 x a h b x a h 1 u c c a h w a h where the error w a h was normally distributed with zero means and estimated variance covariance matrix q and h 1 6 2 3 3 prediction scenario iv the goal of this prediction scenario was to develop a prediction procedure for sea lice abundance that could be easy to implement take into account new data without requiring to refit the model to the data at each time of prediction using kalman filter states the state space model was able to accommodate these issues based on a model fitted to data until time t 1 the predicted lice abundance at time t was adjusted by an observed abundance at t without refitting the model to the data and based on the adjusted lice abundance at t prediction for t 1 was computed the prediction distribution in this scenario was generated based on the same marss model as in scenario iii using a rolling prediction approach the first 1000 sets of six week predictions for pa and af abundances based on time origin a i e x a h h 1 6 were computed as follows conditional on data d until week a x a h d a is gaussian with mean m a h b m a h 1 u c c a h and variance ϕ a h b ϕ a h 1 b q where m a and ϕ a are respectively the mean and variance of the estimated kalman filter state at time a extracted from the prediction model i e x a h d a m v n m a h ϕ a h before the next set of six week predictions computed the predicted sea lice abundance state at a 1 was adjusted by y a 1 when became available in real situations without refitting the model to the data the adjusted estimated state for a 1 can be written as 3 x a 1 u p m a 1 u p m a 1 k a 1 y a 1 m a 1 where k a 1 ϕ a 1 ϕ a 1 r 1 subsequently the second 1000 sets of six week predictions for weeks a 2 to a 7 based on time origin a 1 were computed using m a 1 x a 1 u p as x a h 1 d a 1 m v n m a h 1 ϕ a h 1 where m a h 1 b m a h u c c a h 1 and ϕ a h 1 b ϕ a h b q this six step rolling prediction procedure was repeated for all time origins in the interval a a 5 fig 2 note that in the case of no lice counts missing values were interpolated by previous observations in the calculation of eq 3 instead of refitting the model to the data to update estimation in each forward time step when new data became available as in scenario iii we adjusted the predicted state at each time new data reported in real situation without refitting the model to the data in other words in scenario iii all model estimates were updated at each week new data reported while in scenario iv only the predicted lice abundance state was updated without rerunning the model at each time new data became available 2 3 4 prediction accuracy we used the absolute error the absolute difference between the observed and predicted data and the mean absolute error mae to evaluate the accuracy of predictions in scenarios i and ii mae was calculated as the average of the absolute error over sites while such absolute differences were averaged across simulations and time points in the prediction horizon for scenarios iii and iv we also used the quantile scoring biau and patra 2011 makridakis et al 2020 as a second method for evaluating the accuracy of prediction distributions quantile forecast in scenarios iii and iv let α α 0 01 0 99 be the target quantile q α t the quantile prediction and y t the observed lice abundance at week t in the prediction horizon based on the pinball loss function the quantile score can be computed as 4 l q α t y t y t q α t α if y t q α t q α t y t 1 α if q α t y t in quantile predictions we want the true value y t to be less than the prediction in α 100 of the time for instance our prediction for the 0 25 quantile should be such that y t is less than y t 25 of the time to compare the respective accuracy of two quantile models e g prediction scenario iii vs iv the score computed from the pinball loss in 4 was averaged for each model over all quantiles and all time points the quantile model that had the smallest average score was the most accurate finally we computed one step ahead predictions for the rest of the production cycles i e from time a 1 to the end of the production cycle using the scenario iv approach in order to compare results with those reported in aldrin et al 2017 as described in aldrin et al 2017 the mean absolute percentage error mape for the fitted values interval from time 1 to a and predictions from time a 1 to the end of the cycle were computed after back transforming the data 3 results the reader should refer to fig 1 and table 2 in elghafghuf et al 2020 for information on the distributions of pa and af abundances and predictive covariates 3 1 model comparisons all marss models fitted to the data set are listed along with their log likelihood and aicc values in table s1 supplementary information when one parameter in the model was different models in set a had poorer aicc than ms1 the completely constrained model with exception of models that had different q and r and different c b in the analysis that was separated by cycle also separating the analysis by cycle in set a did not show substantial improvements in the model fit compared with those separated by site except for mc2 different q and mc6 different c b this indicates that the heterogeneity in q and c b was larger among cycles than sites it is worth mentioning that whenever r was different it varied by site we tried to vary r by production cycle but the model encountered convergence problems in model set b two different parameters q and one other parameter the cycle separated models had much smaller aicc values compared with the site separated models the smallest aicc value in set b was for the model with different q and r mc11 in the cycle separated analysis in set c three different parameters q r and one other parameter the same patterns as in set b were observed i e the cycle separated models had lower aicc values when compared with the corresponding models in the site separated analyses the model with different q r and c e mc24 was associated with the smallest aicc value among all models in set c finally the model with cycle varied q and site varied r mc11 had the lowest aicc value across all analyses therefore it was selected to be the final model for the grand manan sea lice data table s2 supplementary information displays parameter estimates from mc11 3 2 parasite abundance prediction 3 2 1 scenarios i and ii predictions with and without infestation pressures the absolute error and mean absolute error of prediction scenarios i and ii are summarized in table 1 for the pa time series most of the weeks in the prediction horizon showed that predictions from scenario ii with infestation pressures had smaller absolute errors compared with predictions from scenario i no infestation pressures when the absolute error was averaged across time series i e mae maes were smaller for scenario ii predictions than those from scenario i this indicates that including the infestation pressures in the model and the computation of predictions improved the accuracy of prediction similar error patterns as in the pa predictions were observed for af predictions although the infestation pressure effects were measured only on the pa time series the small differences in the af prediction errors between scenarios i and ii were presumably because the pa and af time series were linked through the autoregressive process lastly the maes were almost always smaller for af than pa predictions in the two scenarios 3 2 2 scenario iii predictions based on updated model the mean absolute errors of scenario iii predictions are displayed in table 2 the prediction error increased with time steps and varied among sites and life stages for example site 6 had the lowest mae for pa in time step one whereas site 19 was associated with the highest mae in the same time step for af the smallest and largest magnitudes of mae for one step ahead prediction were observed in sites 20 and 8 respectively furthermore the prediction variability varied between life stages and among sites and increased as the time in the prediction horizon got further into the future evaluating the whole prediction distribution for each site using the quantile scoring showed an average quantile score that was variable among sites and differed between the pa and af predictions scenario iii table 3 also the prediction accuracy decreased with increasing the time steps in the prediction horizon for one step ahead prediction the average of pinball loss quantile score of prediction distribution varied from 0 069 to 0 521 for pa and between 0 071 0 225 for af individually site 1 had step one pa prediction distributions with the smallest average of pinball loss quantile score and site 19 showed the largest score values for the same lice category the smallest and largest average pinball loss quantile scores of one step ahead af predictions were for sites 7 and 8 respectively 3 2 3 scenario iv predictions based on non updated model predictions from scenario iv had error patterns similar to scenario iii predictions however prediction errors were larger than those from scenario iii scenario iv table 2 as in scenario iii sites 6 and 19 were associated with the lowest and highest mae for the pa predictions respectively while the lowest mae for af predations was for site 20 and the highest for site 8 the spread of prediction distribution varied by site and life stages and such a spread increased with time steps in the prediction horizon and with time origins in the same time step the average pinball loss quantile score differed among sites and between pa and af and increased with time steps scenario iv table 3 for example the average of pinball loss quantile score for one step ahead pa predictions ranged between 0 093 and 0 458 with the smallest average score for site 6 and largest for site 19 the one step ahead af predictions had an average score varied across sites from 0 103 to 0 264 and sites 20 and 8 were associated with the smallest and largest average score values respectively 3 2 4 comparison of prediction scenarios iii and iv predictions from the updated model scenario scenario iii had maes lower than those from the non updated model scenario scenario iv in the first time steps of the prediction horizon and as time progresses these prediction errors approached each other for both pa and af lice abundances the small maes in the beginning of the prediction horizon for the updated model scenario compared with the non updated model scenario came at a cost of refitting the model to the training data at each time origin in the test set to update parameters when the absolute error was averaged across simulations for each week in the prediction horizon the prediction error of the non updated model scenario slightly increased as predictions got farther away from the estimation period table 4 this was not the case for the updated model scenario as each set of the six week predictions was directly linked to the estimation period i e the number of weeks from the estimation period is always 0 unlike the updated model scenario the step one non updated model prediction for 0 weeks from the estimation period included the estimation error of states therefore its mae was slightly larger than the corresponding mae of the updated model prediction table 4 note that the column means in table 4 are the mae values reported in table 2 for the corresponding sites and life stage the same patterns were observed when the prediction distribution was evaluated using the pinball loss quantile scoring the means of pinball loss quantile scores were generally smaller for predictions of the updated model scenario than those from the non updated model scenario for one step ahead predictions from the updated and non updated model scenarios showed different behaviors over the six time point test set and such a difference was more pronounced for the pa lice abundance than for the af abundance fig 3 this may be because the observation error variance was part of the prediction computation in the non updated model scenario while it was not in the updated model scenario table 4 lastly the prediction distributions of the non updated model scenario had increasing with time spread within the same time step and such a spread was larger compared with the updated model scenario fig 3 despite the smaller prediction errors of the updated model scenario compared with the non updated model scenario especially in the beginning of the prediction horizon the prediction approach used in the non updated model scenario was more practical and easier to implement compared with the updated model approach that required excessive computing time due to refitting the model multiple times finally the mean absolute percentage error of scenario iv one step ahead predictions for the period from 2015w26 onwards from a 1 to the end of production cycle was computed for pa and af to be 38 6 and 22 1 respectively for the estimation period mapes of the fitted values were estimated at 27 7 for pa and 21 5 for af these mape values were smaller than those reported in aldrin et al 2017 for both the estimation and prediction periods fig 4 shows the model fits estimation period and predicted trajectories prediction period along with the actual data for the pa and af lice abundances 3 3 estimated effects 3 3 1 predictive covariates bath treatments showed a similar reduction in both the pa and af abundances the estimates on the exponential scale were 0 512 and 0 533 for pa and af respectively these values correspond to post treatment reduction of 48 8 and 46 7 for pa and af abundances ln scale respectively feed treatments on the other hand did not show a strong reduction of sea lice abundance as bath treatments the non negligible effects of feed treatments c f were observed only on the af abundance and estimated on exponential scale at 0 932 this indicates that the reduction of af abundance over four week post feed treatments was 6 8 water temperature had a positive impact on pa and af abundances but its effect was larger on the pa abundance than on the af abundance these effects were estimated at 0 171 for pa and 0 073 for af indicating averages of 17 1 and 7 3 incline on ln scale per each additional temperature unit for pa and af respectively the external infestation pressure elevated the pa lice abundance whereas the internal pressure had a negligible effect the estimated effect for the ln external infestation pressure c e was 0 087 which means there was an increase on average of 8 7 in the ln pa abundance per week across production cycles 3 3 2 transition and scaling parameters the effect of pa abundance on itself b p a elements in b and the scaling parameter u were estimated at 0 908 and 0 081 respectively these values are corresponding to a process mean of μ 0 880 for ln pa abundance in absence of treatments and when water temperature and infestation pressures at the average values similarly the estimated values for the effect of af abundance on itself b a f elements in b effect of pa on af abundance b p a a f elements in b and u were 0 880 0 126 and 0 051 respectively which are corresponding to μ of 1 349 for ln af abundance when no treatments and water temperature is at the mean for instance if the ln pa and af abundances at time t 1 were the same and equal to 1 with average water temperature and no treatments then the ln af abundance at time t is estimated as b a f x a f t 1 b p a a f x p a t 1 u a f 0 880 0 126 0 051 1 057 i e there was an increase of 5 7 in ln af abundance for one step transition 3 3 3 process and observation errors the process error variance was larger for pa than af in most of the production cycles the estimates varied between 0 087 0 693 and 0 064 1 025 for pa and af respectively with corresponding covariance between pa and af abundances ranged across cycles between 0 066 and 0 365 the observation error variances for pa and af on the other hand were estimated as different parameters across sites cycles within the same site were pooled the estimated values ranged between 0 003 0 246 and 0 031 0 267 for pa and af respectively and the covariance between pa and af abundances varied from 0 053 to 0 096 finally the process error variance was almost always larger than the observation error variance although the former was estimated as different parameters at the cycle level 4 discussion in the present paper we simultaneously modeled pa and af abundances using a multivariate state space modeling approach with the purpose of building a predictive tool for the parasite abundance on aquaculture sites accurately predicting the parasite abundance can help in establishing a protocol for effective management strategies including the efficient use of chemotherapeutants reducing the amount necessary to manage the parasite and thus minimizing the effects on the environment in addition to the advantage of sequentially modeling the pa and af abundances in time state space models account for multiple sources of variation e g latent and observation errors better understanding of how to partition variation should lead to some improvements in prediction accuracy our model accounted for the variation in the state and observation processes and accommodated many features of sea lice data however it did not account for larval lice stages nor did it take into account the variation in parameters which may be needed to improve prediction accuracy and lower prediction variability petris et al 2009 short term predictions of pa and af lice abundances on site farms were produced from the marss model using different scenarios in all scenarios predictions were at the population level and for six weeks afterward however a rolling prediction technique was used only in scenarios iii and iv i e predictions were updated at every single origin 4 1 the contribution of infestation pressure in predicting sea lice abundance including infestation pressure variables in the model and therefore in the computations of pa prediction gave predictions with smaller errors relative to predictions from the model that did not include infestation pressures although the differences in maes were not large this may be due to the negligible estimated effects of internal infestation pressure in the training data and the small number of production cycles in the test data set that perhaps lowered the sea lice output from the neighboring sites chalimus stages result from environmental exposure to copepodids attachment stage whereas pa may originate from either environmental transfer of this stage or more commonly from the development of attached chalimus stages into mobile pa stages therefore any infestation pressure estimates for pa would include the delayed impact of that pressure derived from earlier chalimus stages more information about the effects of internal and external infestation pressures on aquaculture sites in the grand manan region can be found in elghafghuf et al 2020 the af predictions showed some differences in maes compared with the scenario of no infestation pressures although the effects of internal and external infestation pressures were estimated only for the pa time series these differences were because the model allowed for the af abundance to be affected by previous pa abundance and such an effect was carried over to the predictions i e the estimated effect of pa on af was measured by the off diagonal elements of b matrix furthermore the pa predictions were affected through the infestation pressures by the af predictions after the first three weeks in the prediction horizon because the infestation pressures were represented by the af abundance three weeks back elghafghuf et al 2020 in fact what we predicted was affected by the predictions themselves but at lagged time predictions from such linked time series are unlikely to be as accurate as predictions from unrelated time series however partitioning variation and allowing for time variation in parameters should lead to improvements in prediction accuracy and reduce prediction uncertainty dietze 2018 4 2 predictions from updated model scenario iii the updated model prediction scenario that employed a rolling forecasting technique based on a multivariate state space model yielded prediction with reasonable errors both the pinball loss quantile scoring and mae indicated similar error patterns however sites that had the lowest mae did not match the ones that had the smallest average of the pinball loss quantile score the predictions showed decreasing accuracy as time progressed and such an accuracy varied among sites and between pa and af lice categories as expected the prediction uncertainty became bigger and bigger as the prediction horizon got further into the future similar findings were reported in elghafghuf et al 2018 although the prediction scenario and evaluation were somewhat different with the exception of time step one where pa and af predictions depended on the model estimations of pa and af abundances the predicted af abundance at week t 1 depended on the predicted abundance of pa at week t for all subsequent time steps the same case applied to pa predictions but beyond week three in the prediction horizon in this situation the accuracy of predictions at one time step affects the accuracy at the subsequent time steps biologically the parasite life stages affect each other at different times and such effects must be considered to account for the parasite life cycle st hilaire et al 2018 elghafghuf et al 2018 4 3 predictions from non updated model scenario iv the prediction approach used in the non updated model scenario produced predictions with acceptable accuracy similar to the findings in scenario iii the prediction errors were variable among sites and lice categories with increasing error patterns over the prediction horizon the uncertainty around predictions propagated across time steps of the prediction horizon and over time origins of the test set within the same time step the increasing with time spread of predictions within the same time step was not surprising as it can clearly be seen in the prediction equation for updating the state variance where the process error variance q was added at each time step furthermore the adjustment of prediction at a certain time depended on the prediction error at that time and the magnitude of observation error variance r in the training data where the smaller the r the closer the adjusted lice abundance was to the observed abundance and therefore a more accurate prediction for the next time step also there were no patterns that can clearly favor one site on anther with respect to the prediction adjustment when the sea lice abundance is not reported one can extrapolate the data or skip the adjustment step in our case because missing abundances occurred over short sequences we imputed missing values in the test data set by the observed lice abundances in the previous week finally the mapes for the fitted values over the training period and one step ahead predictions for the rest of production cycles i e the truncated parts of the cycles were both smaller than those reported in aldrin et al 2017 4 4 updated model versus non updated model scenarios predictions from the two scenarios had reasonable errors however prediction errors from the updated model scenario were smaller than those from the non updated model scenario especially in the beginning of the prediction horizon and the two prediction errors started to approach each other later in the prediction horizon these results were expected since the model estimates were updated at each time origin in the test data set before a new set of predictions was computed also the estimation error of the states was part of the prediction computation in the non updated model scenario but it was not for the updated model procedure in fact the updated model scenario was used in the study for the purpose of comparing prediction performance with the non updated model scenario the excessive computing time due to refitting the model to the data at each time point made the updated model scenario impractical and difficult to implement therefore it was not of interest in contrast the non updated model approach required the model to be fitted to the data once and predictions computed based on that fit by adjusting predictions using new observed abundances the new subsequent predictions were computed based on these adjusted predictions this was one of the fundamental features of state space models that can lead to rapid predictions and improve prediction accuracy finally this adjusted prediction technique was practical and straightforward to use which was advantageous over the updated model approach 4 5 effects of predictive covariates in addition to sea lice infestation pressures water temperature and bath and feed treatments were included in the model and prediction computations we found that exposure to these covariates contributed significantly to predict lice abundance on fish at site levels however our model showed negligible effects for the internal infestation pressure and feed treatment on pa abundance which may be attributable to the nature of the region and the limited scope of the data set elghafghuf et al 2020 in sea lice prediction predictive variables themselves may need to be predicted for example the infestation pressure variables and water temperature the infestation pressures were available up to three weeks ahead and after that their values were computed from the af predictions for water temperature the available records during the test period were used for the purpose of evaluating predictions however in many situations reliable predictions of surface water temperature at the industry wide level may be available for one week ahead in all cases accurate predictions depend on the accuracy of predictor values and the continuity of the relationships between the predictions and the predictive covariates into the prediction period 4 6 effects of other model parameters the development of pa and af abundances from one step to the next was described by the scaling parameter u and the transition matrix b and such a process was carried to predictions in addition to the intra specific effects of pa and af the transition from pa to af was accounted for using a one week lag in other words af predictions at a certain week depended on both the pa and af predictions of previous week the state space model results showed higher process mean μ for af abundance than for pa abundance and the two abundances were slowly reverted to their process means in sea lice such a mean reversion process may be thought of as when the parasite abundance appears to reach some sort of equilibrium state due to management as a matter of fact sea lice populations are anticipated to grow unless management intervention takes place similar findings were reported in elghafghuf et al 2018 although they modeled juvenile and mobile adult stages of caligus rogercresseyi the process error variance was estimated as different parameters across production cycles while the observation error variance was assumed common within site if site had multiple cycles and estimated in a way that each site had its own variance we attempted to separate the analysis by production cycle and estimate the observation error variance for each cycle but the model encountered convergence problems the process error variance was used in generating prediction distributions of updated model and non updated model scenarios whereas the observation error variance was only part in the computation of non updated model predictions the smaller the magnitude of observation error variance the closer the adjusted predicted state was to the corresponding observation in the non updated model scenario lastly most of the variation in the data was at the latent process level which may be because sea lice populations were exposed to different managerial and environmental conditions 4 7 practical implications and future work this research explored the potential of utilizing a multivariate state space model for predicting future pa and af lice abundances at the site level predicting future sea lice infestation levels is important for the salmon farming industry to effectively plan management strategies against the parasite data regarding many changing variables including spatial temporal changes in environmental influences are becoming more available and more precise and thus enabling the use of ecological models such as the state space model to gradual and incremental improvement in sea lice prediction predictions of sea lice infestations are useful for evaluating the efficiency of different control measures and exploring various management scenarios the study evaluated different prediction scenarios for sea lice abundance and assessed the accuracy of short term predictions from these scenarios which are essential to identify suitable prediction procedures that are feasible to implement using the current industry driven fish itrends database and workflow the required information to use the suggested non updated model prediction procedure is the parameter estimates related to sea lice abundance in the population i e the current estimated state process error variance observation error variance transition parameter intrinsic rate of increase available from historical data three weeks worth of sea lice abundance and treatment events to inform the procedure with the current sea lice infestation level and to account for the infestation pressures and treatment events and an accurate forecast for water temperatures no matter where we are in the production cycle the procedure will adjust itself once new data become available future research should expand this work include chalimus stages and estimate model parameters based on data from all aquaculture sites in the bay of fundy the model should allow for temporal changes in the parameters to capture the variability of effects over time which can lead to improving prediction accuracy and reducing uncertainty finally the developed model could be used in simulation studies that allow investigation of sea lice control

24618,mutualistic bee plant interaction networks are a vital part of terrestrial ecosystems they frequently arise through co evolutionary processes which match the traits of both partners facilitating their interaction insights in these interaction mechanisms are vital to be able to manage changing ecosystems this entails the need for models to predict species interaction networks in general and pollination networks in particular we show how kernel based pairwise learning can predict bee plant interactions based on the traits and the phylogeny of the plant and bee species the traits and the phylogeny of the plant and bee species proved to be highly predictive although the traits were slightly more informative compared to the phylogeny the best results were obtained by combining both the traits and the phylogeny in the model notably the model performance varied greatly depending on whether the goal was to pinpoint missing interactions in the network or to predict interactions for new bee species new plant species or both this issue highlights the importance of proper stratification when fitting biological network prediction models our model however showed the capacity to generalize beyond the original dataset provided by florabeilles the model was validated by predicting potentially interacting plant species for the invasive bee species megachile sculpturalis four out of the five plant species identified by the model could be validated based on literature our results indicate that pairwise learning has potential as a general method for supervised species interaction prediction caution should be taken to validate such models correctly graphical abstract keywords pollination bee plant interaction pairwise learning cross validation megachile sculpturalis availability the data analysis was performed in the r programming language r core team 2019 using the xnet https github com centerforstatistics ugent xnet package developed by the authors the pollination dataset and code are available on dryad 1 introduction insect pollination forms an indispensable pillar in the maintenance of ecosystems supporting the seed set of 85 of all flowering plants ollerton et al 2011 furthermore as 76 of the leading crops are insect pollinated insect pollination provides a direct benefit to humans klein et al 2007 among all pollinating insects bees are considered one of the most important groups of pollinators biesmeijer et al 2006 powney et al 2019 providing valuable ecosystem services matias et al 2017 bees and the plant species they pollinate form complex mutualistic interaction networks bascompte and jordano 2013 such networks are appropriate tools to reason about community ecosystems in general poisot et al 2016 however temporal turnover and changing species distributions such as extinction or migration due to natural or anthropogenic causes also changes the interactions burkle et al 2013 schwarz et al 2020 caradonna et al 2021 field trials studied the impact of artificially removing flowers urban mead 2017 or bees brosi et al 2017 from natural ecosystems resulting in a rewiring of the interaction network similarly lopezaraiza mikel et al 2007 studied the impact of alien plant species on a pollination network which led to higher flower visitation rates yet ultimately a decrease in general pollination efficiency due to the impact of alien pollen wild plant and animal communities were also found to be negatively impacted by honeybee spillover from flowering crops magrach et al 2017 russo and shea 2017 showed that chemical fertilization of flower patches increased flower attractiveness and resulted in an increased connectance of the pollination network leading to a significant increase in both species richness and abundance of pollinators these examples illustrate the need for predictive models for anticipating the impact of new species on ecosystems correctly observed pollination interaction networks often arise from co evolutionary processes where both partners are adapted to facilitate the interactions as well as neutral processes mainly dependent on species abundances vázquez et al 2009 holt and bonsall 2017 the species pool of an ecosystem determines the co occurrence probabilities but whether or not an ecological interaction can actually occur depends on the complementary of morphological or physiological traits of the species bartomeus et al 2016 for example olesen et al 2011 could observe forbidden links in pollination networks due to mismatches in phenology and species size morales castilla et al 2015 proposed combining information on forbidden links with probabilistic trait based linkage rules to infer species interaction networks however most research on these linkage rules has been performed on food webs making the rules for mutualistic networks such as pollination less well understood valdovinos 2019 an established hypothesis in ecology states that species interaction networks are low dimensional i e they can be captured using only a few properties or traits of the composing species eklöf et al 2013 since traits arise through evolutionary processes it comes as no surprise that species interaction motifs have been found to correlate with phylogenetic signals as well rezende et al 2007 krasnov et al 2012 aizen et al 2016 baguette et al 2020 novel statistical methods make it possible to quantify the cophylogenetic signals in species interaction networks balbuena et al 2013 hadfield et al 2014 and recent studies of pollination networks consider both traits and phylogeny when modeling species interactions e g joffard et al 2019 a species phylogeny is often easier to obtain than its traits which makes it an attractive proxy some studies e g best et al 2013 mazel et al 2018 however showed that measuring diversity based on phylogeny is less indicative of ecological function than a trait based diversity our work shows that both traits and phylogeny can be used to accurately predict bee plant interactions provided that the model can be trained with an example network machine learning methods have been successfully applied for species interaction network prediction from traits using various methods see e g gravel et al 2013 bartomeus et al 2016 desjardins proulx et al 2017 recently pichler et al 2019 showed for both simulated and real world data that nonlinear machine learning methods outperform generalized linear models in predicting species interaction networks based on trait matching here we approach this problem by using kernel based pairwise learning methods these types of methods have a rich history of use in computational biology for example for protein protein yamanishi et al 2004 vert et al 2007 vert 2008 protein ligand gönen 2012 pahikkala et al 2015 or protein nucleic acid interaction predictions pelossof et al 2015 more specifically we apply two step kernel ridge regression pahikkala et al 2014 stock et al 2018 a simple but powerful method to predict interactions this model takes a description of a bee species and a plant species as input based on traits phylogeny or both and returns a score that indicates whether an interaction is likely or not importantly this method is both agnostic and universal it can learn any arbitrary relation between species descriptors given sufficient data stock et al 2018 no prior knowledge is assumed on the ecological processes the remainder of this work is subdivided as follows the materials section section 2 discusses the florabeilles dataset section 2 1 the traits of the pollinators and of the plants section 2 2 and the construction of the phylogenetic tree of both section 2 3 in section 2 4 we present four auxiliary datasets which we analyze in lesser detail than the florabeilles dataset these networks with traits serve to highlight the scope and limitations of the suggested methodology the methods section section 3 presents the two step kernel ridge regression method and how it is used section 3 1 provides a small self contained overview of the kernel ridge regression method section 3 2 discusses the different cross validation settings used to validate the model and section 3 3 explains how we can assess which information is relevant for which predictions the results are presented in section 4 the model is thoroughly evaluated and explored using cross validation null models and other diagnostic analyses besides we also perform an external validation for the exotic bee megachile sculpturalis and discuss the performance on the auxiliary datasets section 5 provides a general discussion of the results putting them in a broader perspective the final conclusions are presented in section 6 2 materials 2 1 the florabeilles pollination network the pollination dataset used to construct train and test the model is provided by florabeilles 2 2 http www florabeiles org a project of inra unité abeilles et environnement avignon france within this project a profound literature study of reported plant pollinator interactions in france was compiled into a large plant pollinator dataset this literature based dataset of plant pollinator interactions in france contains 452 plant species and 305 bee species mainly belonging to the megachilidae family all pollinator species within the dataset are bees furthermore all interactions included in the dataset occurred on the mainland of france the data is represented as a binary incidence matrix y where the rows represent the bee species and the columns the different plant species in this study we worked with a subset of the original dataset containing all the original network species for which traits and phylogeny could be collected this subset contains 96 different bee species 188 different plant species and a total of 246 observed interactions all analyses below are performed on this subset for a detailed analysis of the distribution of the original network s interactions we refer to our earlier work stock et al 2020b because the network data for this study is a subset of a more extensive network several bee and plant species do not have observed interactions we have chosen not to omit these species because the known absence of interactions is itself a source of information our model can exploit it shows that for instance plant species with certain traits are not observed to be pollinated by bee species with certain other traits the performance on the reduced network containing only species with at least one interaction is given in the supplementary materials this performance is worse though still substantially better than random 2 2 species traits species traits denote the characteristics of a species however there can be individual variations in a species traits such as height mass coloration etc for all the bee and plant species we compiled several species specific traits all categorical traits were encoded using a set of binary dummy variables 2 2 1 bee traits several traits were collected for each bee species the information on the traits was based on the veldgids bijen voor nederland en vlaanderen and de nederlandse bijen lewington and falk 2017 peeters et al 2012 for each species we collected five traits the first trait was voltinism which indicates the number of generations a species can have during one year this was either univoltine or bivoltine with one or two generations per year respectively secondly we determined the flying period of each species the months during which a bee species is active are represented by a binary vector indicating whether the pollinator is flying in that month 1 or not 0 next we cataloged the nesting location or nesting preference of each bee species as a categorical variable the nesting type variables were ground cavities above ground walls mice nests hollow stems dead wood below ground steep ground snail shells against walls and under rocks only the first three were used since too few bee species were representative of the other types lastly we cataloged the size of the bee species a measurement from head to the end of the abdomen i e the total body length of the bee both minimum size and maximum size were recorded in millimeter table 1 provides an overview of all used pollinator traits and illustrates a specific example 2 2 2 plant traits the traits of the plant species used in our study were taken from veldgids nederlandse flora eggeltje and tande lid 2015 and geïllustreerde flora van nederland heimans et al 1994 for each species we collected thirteen traits the first trait was growth habit consisting of five categories herb graminoid subshrub shrub and tree secondly we collected for each plant species three measures for height i e the minimum maximum and mean height in cm we scored the blooming period as a binary vector each element in the vector indicates whether the plant is flowering in that month 1 or not 0 the lifespan of the plant species was a categorical trait containing five categories annual biannual perennial annual biannual and biannual perennial we only used whether the plant species is annual or not plants were also grouped by whether they are dicot or monocot the phyllotaxis of the plant was categorized as opposite distichous opposite decussated alternate whorled rosette or basal see fig 1 the position of the ovary was put into three categories superior inferior and partially inferior further traits were related to the flowers of the plants firstly flower color was binary encoded for seven values white pink red yellow green blue and purple most plant species display only one flower color however some plant species may exhibit multiple flower colors the symmetry of the flower was either asymmetrical bilaterally symmetrical or versatile symmetrical for each plant the number of styles and the number of stamens per flower were also collected table 2 provides an overview of all used plant traits illustrated on a specific example 2 3 species phylogenies for the bee species the coi gene encoding the cytochrome c oxidase i was used as a phylogenetic marker hebert et al 2003 for each plant species we retrieved the highly used dna barcode sequence of the matk gene encoding for megakaryocyte associated tyrosine kinase hollingsworth et al 2009 for both bee species and plant species all sequences were retrieved from the barcode of life data system ratnasingham and hebert 2007 two separate fasta files one containing all sequences retrieved for the bee species and one containing all plant species sequences were aligned with muscle edgar 2004 we constructed the phylogenetic trees using the neighbor joining method in mega 7 kumar et al 2016 for each of the constructed phylogenetic trees i e one for all bee species and one for all plant species a newick file was generated containing the branch lengths the newick files were further processed using the phylo module in the biopython package cock et al 2009 to obtain a distance or dissimilarity matrix for the bee species and the plant species in total the dataset contained 53 distinct families and 139 unique genera for the plant species and six distinct families and 22 unique genera for the bee species an overview of all species including the phylogenetic trees can be found in the supplementary information 2 4 auxiliary networks to demonstrate that the suggested framework works well with different types of pollination networks we collected various additional networks with species traits from literature these networks vary in size and the quality and quantity of species traits that are available from olito and fox 2015 we take an alpine network containing 125 pollinator species and 41 plant species for each pollinator species the proboscis length is known as an ordinal variable minute short medium long likewise the flower depth is also available for each plant species as an ordinal variable disk small medium large from joffard et al 2019 we borrow a pollination network containing 1278 interactions between 726 pollinator species and 243 orchid species no traits were available for the pollinators but for the plant species we use the pollination strategy categorical food deception nectar production sexual deception shelter mimicry and habitat categorical urban lands marshes bogs seeps soaks and springs sand dunes in addition to a phylogenetic tree we use a large pollination network from boreux and klein 2019 also used by pichler et al 2019 this network contains 256 pollinator species and 80 plant species annotated with a variety of traits we possess the guild sociality feeding behavior as categorical variables and the tongue and body length as continuous variables for the pollinator species for the plant species we know the type arboreous or herbaceous the flowering season the flower diameter the shape of the corolla open campanulate or tubular flower color whether it produces nectar and the bloom system e g pollinated by insects wind or birds from sazatornil et al 2016 we used five networks of various sizes related to the pollination of plants by hawkmoths for each pollinator species we have the proboscis length and for each plant species we have the effective flower length both as continuous variables table 6 in section 4 6 describes these auxiliary networks together with their respective model performances 3 methods 3 1 two step kernel ridge regression the bee plant interactions are predicted using a kernel based 3 3 not to be confused with kernel density estimation supervised network prediction method such methods have shown great success in bioinformatics especially for predicting the properties of bio molecules a kernel function k is a symmetric and positive semi definite function with two arguments valid kernel functions imply an implicit feature representation in some hilbert space using the kernel trick i e k x x ϕ x ϕ x here ϕ is a feature map to a potentially high dimensional hilbert space and denotes the dot product this trick is typically exploited to extend linear learning methods such as pca support vector machines ridge regression and fisher discriminant analysis to learn arbitrarily complex nonlinear functions schölkopf and smola 2002 despite the past success of kernel methods in bioinformatics schölkopf et al 2004 they have not yet been fully embraced by the ecological research community 4 4 the support vector machine as a general purpose classifier is a notable exception in this work we use two step kernel ridge regression tskrr to predict the bee plant interactions pahikkala et al 2014 stock et al 2018 romera paredes and torr 2015 tskrr can generalize to new bee species as well as new plant species a related simplified method has already been used with great success to predict missing interactions in various species interaction networks stock et al 2017 importantly for this work the tskrr method admits closed form formulas for performing cross validation for the different prediction settings stock et al 2020a as discussed in more detail in section 3 2 fig 2a schematically represents this method the method boils down to applying kernel ridge regression twice once to generalize to new bee species and once to generalize to new plant species the species level regression models use a description based on a kernel function to represent the individual species we will denote with k and g the kernel functions quantifying the similarity between the bee and plant species respectively these capture trait similarity phylogenetic distance or both the tskrr prediction function has the following general bilinear form 1 f b p i 1 m j 1 n w i j k b b i g p p j where w i j is a set of weights found by fitting the tskrr model to an example network as is typically the case for kernel methods this prediction function is a weighted sum over the observed data these weights can be found very simply by computing 2 w k λ k i 1 y g λ g i 1 with y the incidence matrix containing the observed bee plant interactions and two gram matrices k k b i b j and g g p i p j containing all pairwise kernel values between the bee and plant species here λ k and λ g are two hyperparameters that determine the model complexity larger values regularize the respective kernel ridge regression models more preventing overfitting as described in sections 2 2 and 2 3 the species are represented by traits and phylogeny the traits can be summarized in a p dimensional numerical vector x i for the i th species all traits are standardized such that they all have an average value of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 we use the standard laplacian kernel e g for the bee species k traits b i b j exp x i x j p the laplacian kernel is popular and can be shown to be universal 5 5 in initial experiments with a linear kernel we observed a substantially worse performance this was a strong indication that a nonlinear model is best suited to predict the pollination interactions it can be used to approximate any function using a prediction function of the form 1 a kernel function representing the phylogeny is obtained by k phylo b i b j 1 d b i b j with d the phylogenetic distance between two species this method always yields kernel values between 0 and 1 the trait and phylogenetic information are combined by taking the average of the respective kernels we added the value 0 1 to the elements and additionally 0 1 to all gram matrices diagonal this is equivalent to providing an intercept to eq 1 and ensures that the tskrr has the same capabilities as the linear filtering method described earlier for such purposes stock et al 2018 2020b 2017 3 2 performance evaluation an essential issue in pairwise learning is performing a proper model selection and evaluation several researchers have noted that when predicting for two new objects in casu bee and plant species it can make a substantial difference whether one or two of the objects have been encountered during training or not pahikkala et al 2015 park and marcotte 2012 schrynemackers et al 2013 for predicting bee plant interactions we can distinguish four distinct prediction settings interactions predicting for bee and plant species that were included in the training data this is usually done to detect false negatives missing interactions in the network bees predicting interaction values between new bee species and known plant species plants predicting interaction values between new plant species and known bee species both predicting interaction values between two species that have not been seen during training to properly account for the different prediction settings we use specialized stratified cross validation schemes as described in stock et al 2020a the bee and plant species are each randomly subdivided into four disjoint subsets each combination of a subset of bee species and a subset of plant species corresponds to one of the sixteen blocks of the interaction matrix these sixteen blocks are used as a basis for the four cross validation schemes for the setting interactions we remove all interactions in one block by setting the interaction values to zero the reduced network is used to fit a tskrr model and predictions are made for the removed block this protocol is followed for every block i e every combination of the species subsets for the setting bees only a subset of the bees is withheld in every fold predictions are made for these bee species with all plant species this means that here the cross validation is only partitioned on the bee species the setting plants is treated analogously finally for the setting both we consider again the sixteen blocks as for the setting interactions here we also remove all interactions containing one of the species from the block used for testing in each of the sixteen folds these cross validation schemes are depicted in fig 3a all cross validation schemes are nested while dividing the network in train and test set during the cross validation we use the corresponding leave one out cross validation to find the optimal hyperparameters λ k and λ g this means we determine the optimal regularization in every step of the cross validation using only the data assigned for training and not for testing to this end we used the analytical shortcuts described in stock et al 2020a we used roc curves and the area under the roc curve auc metric pooled over the whole cross validated prediction matrix to evaluate the models both are used to assess how good the model is at distinguishing a positive interaction from a negative interaction roc curves and auc are popular tools for evaluating supervised network prediction methods schrynemackers et al 2013 3 3 feature importance to better understand how the model makes predictions we compute feature importances based on permutations similarly to how this is done for the machine learning method called random forests breiman 2001 to assess the importance of a kernel function we randomly permute the rows and columns of the gram matrix see fig 3b destroying all linkage between the species and the interaction values and note the decrease in performance measured in auc using leave one out cross validation compared to the undisturbed model note that the figure illustrates the equivalent process of randomly reordering the rows of the matrix containing the traits this is done either for the bee kernel plant kernel or both and all cross validation settings we report averages over 100 repetitions to provide stable results to prospect which traits are essential we also perform the same experiments where only a single trait is permuted the decrease in auc is an indicative metric to assess the relative importance of these traits 3 4 fitting and validation on the auxiliary networks for the auxiliary networks described in section 2 4 we used a simplified training and validation protocol all categorical variables were dummy encoded while continuous variables were standardized to have a mean of zero and unit variance for the traits associated with the networks of olito and fox 2015 and joffard et al 2019 i e two datasets with only categorical variables for the traits we used a linear kernel we constructed a standard radial basis kernel for the traits of boreux and klein 2019 and sazatornil et al 2016 the bandwidth parameter of these kernels was chosen using the median heuristic i e taking the median of all squared euclidean distances in trait values in a similar vein for the phylogenetic tree of olito and fox 2015 we used g exp d σ with d the phylogenetic distance matrix of the plants and σ median d i j i j 1 m a bandwidth again set using the median heuristic we again added 0 1 to the elements and an additional 0 1 to the diagonal elements to all gram matrices as no traits were available for the pollinators of the joffard et al 2019 network we used a gram matrix with 0 1 on the off diagonal and 0 2 on the diagonal in stock et al 2018 we showed that using this kind of smoother kernel in a pairwise model yields a similar method as the linear filtering method presented in stock et al 2017 all models were fitted with default values of λ k λ g 1 we used the leave one out shortcuts of stock et al 2020a for each of the four settings described in section 3 2 for the settings interactions and both we computed the auc over the complete predicted incidence matrix for the settings pollinator 6 6 we use the term pollinator since not all pollinators are bees in the auxiliary networks and plants we computed the auc for all the interactions of the species that were held out subsequently we averaged the auc over all these species 4 results 4 1 performances of the model the auc values for the different cross validation settings are presented in table 3 as expected the setting interactions is the easiest to learn while the setting both is always the hardest furthermore a higher performance is recorded for generalizing to new bee species compared to new plant species the tskrr model seems to be able to perform well for the three easiest settings with auc values of more than 0 7 for new plant species and more than 0 85 for detecting missing interactions in the given pollination network given that our network is expected to be only partially complete and that we can biologically only expect a relatively weak link between the traits or phylogeny and the flower preference these results are quite promising using either traits or phylogeny the setting both has a performance that is only marginally better than the baseline auc of 0 5 obtained by a random model combining the descriptors results in a slightly improved auc of 0 635 this is still worse than any other cross validation setting but it shows that the tskrr model can extract meaningful information from the gram matrices even for the challenging task of predicting interactions between unobserved species when looking at which information is more useful we can remark that for this dataset i e florabeilles the traits seem to be slightly more relevant than the phylogeny as models based on traits generally perform better the traits and the phylogeny seem to be complementary to some extent with the exception of the setting bees we always obtain an improvement by combining both sources of information this effect is observed most clearly in the setting both which can only exploit traits and phylogeny and not the inherent structure of the incidence matrix in the corresponding roc curve shown in fig 4 we note that the curves for the better performing settings interactions and bees have a clear elbow the curve s onset is notably steep indicating that a large fraction of the interactions can be detected with few false negatives this is much less pronounced for the setting plants and especially for the setting both for the latter the model systematically performs better than random but there is no well defined set of top scoring interactions with high accuracy 4 2 tuning surfaces the plots in fig 5 show the performance for different values of the regularization parameters λ k and λ g there is one plot for every leave one out cross validation setting fig 5 is generated using the kernels combining traits and phylogeny similar plots for the different kernels are available in the supplementary materials although these curves show a vastly different behavior for different validation settings the best model for all settings is approximately the same this corresponds to the model with the hyperparameters λ k λ g 1 0 1 hinting the need for more regularization for the bee than for the plant kernels since we have about twice as many plant species as bee species in the network it is not surprising that less regularization is needed for the former in the setting plants the optimal regularization parameters are close to 0 1 1 resulting in more regularization for the plant species and more freedom for the bee species interestingly for the setting interactions both hyperparameters should optimally have about the same value and must not be too large this would hinder the model s capacity to learn from the network for the setting both the only restriction is that neither hyperparameters should be too large for the settings bees and plants the trends are opposite to generalize to new bee species it is mainly the tuning of the plant species kernel which is important and vice versa this seems to indicate that to predict for new bee species mainly the information about the known plant species is exploited by the model 4 3 importance of traits and phylogeny the results of the various permutation experiments as described in section 3 2 are given in table 4 the general trend is as anticipated permuting both kernel matrices always has a more significant impact than permuting only one of the matrices similarly permuting the kernel matrix using both traits and phylogeny usually results in a more significant auc drop than when only one source of information is used this is because the performance of the kernel combining traits and phylogeny was always higher than using the individual sources table 3 when comparing the different cross validation settings we note different effects depending on what is permuted for the setting interactions it seems that the kernels describing plant species hold much more relevant information for the tskrr model since destroying the information of the plant species has a much larger effect than that of the bee species the same trend though less pronounced is observed in the setting both in general more information can thus be extracted from the plant species a partial explanation here is that there are more plant species in the network than bee species the cross validation settings for bee and plant species show more distinct trends to predict for new bee species it seems that permuting the bee kernel has almost no impact generalizing to new bees is solely done by exploiting the plants information further demonstrating the higher importance of plants for the model the setting plants shows an opposite but less pronounced trend here the bees information is more important for the model performance but permuting the information of the plants still has a demonstrable impact suggesting that generalizing to new plants is done using both sources of information we assessed the importance of the individual traits for predicting interactions in the four cross validation settings the importance scores for the ten variables with the highest drop in performance are plotted in fig 6 the blooming period and the flying period seem to be important traits for predicting interactions so are the height of the plant species and the sizes of the bee species nesting location also seems consistently to be an important trait for the bee species likely because this is a proxy for the phylogeny consistent with the observations made for table 4 plant traits are most important to predict for new pollinator species and the other way around to predict for new plant species voltinism flying period bee size and nesting location seem to be specific traits with predictive power individually each trait only has a minor contribution to the performance for predicting for new bee species in general the model seems to favor simple traits such as flying times blooming period and species sizes flower color never seems to be especially important for making predictions nor are more specific plants anatomical traits 4 4 validation using ecological null models we validate the performance of our model by recomputing the performance against three ecological null models bees randomly shuffling interactions for each pollinator i e shuffling every row of the incidence matrix independently plants randomly shuffling interactions for each plant i e shuffling every column of the incidence matrix independently curveball randomly shuffling the incidence matrix such that the row and column sum for every species remains unchanged according to the curveball algorithm strona et al 2014 we reshuffle the incidence matrix y according to each of these three null models tskrr uses either the traits kernel the phylogeny kernel or the combined kernel we compute the performance for the four prediction settings this process is repeated 100 times we provide averages for every cross validation setting kernel type and null model the results are presented in table 5 consistent with the results of the permutation experiments presented in section 4 3 shuffling the interaction matrix leads to a substantial drop in performance firstly we can observe that the better the performance was for this setting and kernel as listed in table 3 the larger the performance reduction is secondly shuffling the bees information has a substantially larger impact than shuffling that of the plants demonstrating that the former is more important for the model predictions see table 5 setting interactions and both lastly the curveball null model destroys the association between the species descriptors and leaves the marginals of the interaction matrix intact as the drop in performance is lower than for the other null models it seems that the model can still perform predictions better than random for the setting interactions this is not surprising as it then corresponds to using the linear filtering method stock et al 2017 using only the marginals the reduced auc is roughly the same as reported on this network using the said method stock et al 2020b interestingly the auc does not drop to 0 5 for the setting both where the species are new during prediction this indicates that tskrr and by extension other machine learning methods can still exploit the non uniformity of the interaction matrix in such cases we note that even under the curveball null model both the kernel matrices and the interaction matrix exhibit structures that a machine learning model can exploit 4 5 validation on the invasion of megachile sculpturalis as an external validation we use the tskrr model to predict the plant interactions for megachile sculpturalis a bee species that was not present in the original pollination network m sculpturalis is an invasive species in france its native range is in east asia hinojosa díaz et al 2005 at the beginning of the 1990s the bee species was introduced in north carolina usa mangum and brooks 1997 after its introduction it spread rapidly across the usa and reached canada in 2002 paiero and buck 2003 in 2008 m sculpturalis was first reported in the south of france le féon et al 2018 and similarly as for the invasion of the usa the geographical range is expanding as it was later reported in italy switzerland germany austria and spain le féon et al 2018 aguado et al 2018 this species provides the ideal case for our model as the knowledge on the potential impact of this species on the bee plant network in france and europe in general is still limited le féon et al 2018 reported a list of flower species visited by m sculpturalis yet this information is based upon a limited number of observations they reported flower visits on twenty different plant species of which fourteen were native to france as m sculpturalis is a polylectic bee species it is suspected to interact with several plant species and genera the use of a predictive model such as ours provides the opportunity to investigate the potential consequences of an invasive bee species as it may disturb the bee plant network we fit the tskrr model using the traits data on the complete network the hyperparameters are chosen using leave one out cross validation for the setting bees fig 7 shows the distribution of the prediction scores eq 1 for m sculpturalis this distribution is bimodal we apply a cut off of 0 1 on the scores plant species with a higher score are assumed to be likely pollination partners of m sculpturalis the identified plant species in order of decreasing score are centaurea jacea medicago sativa trifolium pretense trifolium repens and lotus corniculatus four out of the five plant species identified by the model have been verified in the field the interaction of m sculpturalis with centaurea sp has been reported by le féon et al 2018 pollen analysis of a pollen provision for the larvae in germany revealed the presence of medicago sativa westrich 2016 trifolium sp were also identified via pollen analysis of two samples in france andrieu ponel et al 2018 this amounts to a false positive rate of 20 and according to the roc curve of fig 4 we can expect a true positive rate of roughly 70 this means that we expect to have discovered about 70 of the plant species in the dataset that can interact with m sculpturalis it should be clear that using a scoring model is always accompanied by a trade off lowering the threshold would likely have led to more interacting plant species being detected at the cost of more errors our model could predict five plant species with which m sculpturalis would interact and four of these predictions have been verified in the field this indicates that at least four out of the five predictions are biologically correct 4 6 performances on the auxiliary networks the performance results of the tskrr for the auxiliary networks are presented in table 6 these results are roughly in line with the results obtained for the florabeilles network however we note that the size and density of the network in addition to trait quality have substantial effects on the model performance for the network from olito and fox 2015 we see that it is possible to predict missing interactions for new pollinator species and plant species using only a single trait for both predicting for new pairs of species is much harder however the network of joffard et al 2019 is unusual in the sense that we only possess information on the plant species and not on the pollinator species here the phylogenetic distances seem to be more predictive compared to the habitat and pollination strategy traits to the extent that adding the latter does not seem to improve performance interestingly it is easier to predict for new pollinators than filling in missing interactions when all species are known this likely arises from how the auc is computed in setting pollinator the auc is computed column wise and averaged over all pollinators instead of computed over the whole incidence matrix as is the case for the settings interaction and both the network of boreux and klein 2019 is closest to the florabeilles network in terms of size and richness of the traits correspondingly it has a similar performance as presented in table 3 the different datasets of sazatornil et al 2016 show that the performance can vary depending on the size and density where larger is in general better for such small datasets extrapolating to the setting both seems to be hard or impossible however a comparison with the results on the olito and fox 2015 network suggests that a continuous trait is more informative than a categorical one 5 discussion the differences in our model s performance under various settings can be used to investigate ecological hypotheses a critical aspect of pairwise learning is that the models might generalize better or worse for certain prediction settings for example a model might reach a satisfying performance to find missing interactions in a pollination network but could generalize poorly to new bee species such issues are well documented in molecular network prediction see e g park and marcotte 2012 schrynemackers et al 2013 pahikkala et al 2015 however they are not common knowledge in ecological network modeling despite the otherwise general awareness of using blocking and stratification in ecological modeling roberts et al 2017 using a pollination network from france as a case study we demonstrate the effect of different cross validation schemes on the performance in ecological network prediction the size and density of the training network and the quality of the species traits descriptors unsurprisingly greatly influence the performance it is interesting to note that tskrr can still give meaningful predictions when no traits are available something we noted earlier when presenting the linear filtering method stock et al 2017 in contrast to the results on the florabeilles network the performances on the auxiliary networks in table 6 are obtained without hyperparameter optimization hence the performances can be seen as lower bounds on what one could attain after a more thorough tuning we analyzed the florabeilles pollination network in the fashion of interpretable machine learning molnar 2019 this means that initially we build a model intending to have a good predictive performance in the next step we try to extract the ecologically relevant information from this model using a thorough performance evaluation we can look into the black box probing how well the model generalizes whether traits or phylogeny are more useful and assess which species traits are most relevant this way we bridge a more conventional statistical methodology with a general machine learning approach insights from such data driven models can help to validate or lead to new ecological theories desjardins proulx et al 2019 we are by far not the first to us bilinear models structured as in eq 1 ruben gabriel 1998 presented a model with an identical structure such models gained some fashionableness in ecology for example brown et al 2014 dray et al 2014 miller et al 2019 used such models to solve the so called four corner problem successfully for associating species traits to environmental gradients to explain species presence and absence the three tables used in the four corner solution a table describing the presence absence or abundances of the species in the plots the species traits and the environmental variables correspond to our three matrices in fig 2 these researchers also noted that these models strength comes from combining information about all the species and environments similarly to how we combine all the bee and plant species in a single global model one can contrast this approach to the local models in network prediction where one builds a model for every vertex i e species at least in theory these models are less powerful than the global methods because the model does not share learned knowledge between species bilinear extensions of generalized linear models have also been used to analyze species interaction networks for example hadfield et al 2014 used a bilinear model to study cophylogenetic relationships in host parasite networks whereas it is also suggested for studying pollination networks bascompte and jordano 2013 the main difference between these approaches and our proposed tskrr method is that we analyze the networks from a machine learning point of view instead of a classical statistical point of view hence there are two aspects in which our model differs from generalized bilinear models firstly we make use of regularization to improve the generalization of our method fig 5 shows that this has a positive impact on the performance compared to an unregularized version corresponding to λ b λ p 0 secondly we use kernels to extend the model to learn any nonlinear association improving the method s generality note that nonlinearity can also be achieved in various other ways for example by encoding high order terms in the generalized bilinear model given our emphasis on prediction we have focused extensively on validating the performance on new data the specific way of fitting eq 1 using eq 2 allows for extremely fast cross validation making it possible to perform the validations of sections 4 3 and 4 4 efficiently in this work we predicted whether a biological interaction between two species could happen given that they are both present to this end we used an interaction network containing literature validated bee plant interactions this dataset purposely ignores species density based and location specific variations in these interactions it is well known that such effects greatly influence sampled pollination networks poisot et al 2015 holt and bonsall 2017 magrach et al 2017 for example neutral effects purely determined by the abundance of the species can already elucidate structural patterns in the network canard et al 2012 modeling interaction strengths requires also taken species abundances into accounts which we explore in other work stock et al 2021 predicting species interactions taking into account the distribution of the species and site related features in addition to the traits or phylogeny of the species will likely require substantially more complex models and therefore more data to learn from this route is challenging though exciting for future research 6 conclusion we explored a supervised network prediction method to predict pollination interactions based on species traits and general phylogeny though the trait information was slightly more informative the best results were consistently obtained by combining both information sources we highlighted important differences between predicting missing links in a network or predictions for new bee species plant species or both this is a caution for future researchers as we have shown that pairwise models tend to use the structure of the network in addition to the species traits and phylogeny only a correct stratification during cross validation will yield the relevant ecological insights our model could predict five plant species with which megachile sculpturalis would interact four of which could be verified in the literature we conclude that tskrr model is a suitable method to predict pollination interactions working well on various networks and allows us to investigate the performance for the different ecological prediction settings thoroughly credit authorship

24618,mutualistic bee plant interaction networks are a vital part of terrestrial ecosystems they frequently arise through co evolutionary processes which match the traits of both partners facilitating their interaction insights in these interaction mechanisms are vital to be able to manage changing ecosystems this entails the need for models to predict species interaction networks in general and pollination networks in particular we show how kernel based pairwise learning can predict bee plant interactions based on the traits and the phylogeny of the plant and bee species the traits and the phylogeny of the plant and bee species proved to be highly predictive although the traits were slightly more informative compared to the phylogeny the best results were obtained by combining both the traits and the phylogeny in the model notably the model performance varied greatly depending on whether the goal was to pinpoint missing interactions in the network or to predict interactions for new bee species new plant species or both this issue highlights the importance of proper stratification when fitting biological network prediction models our model however showed the capacity to generalize beyond the original dataset provided by florabeilles the model was validated by predicting potentially interacting plant species for the invasive bee species megachile sculpturalis four out of the five plant species identified by the model could be validated based on literature our results indicate that pairwise learning has potential as a general method for supervised species interaction prediction caution should be taken to validate such models correctly graphical abstract keywords pollination bee plant interaction pairwise learning cross validation megachile sculpturalis availability the data analysis was performed in the r programming language r core team 2019 using the xnet https github com centerforstatistics ugent xnet package developed by the authors the pollination dataset and code are available on dryad 1 introduction insect pollination forms an indispensable pillar in the maintenance of ecosystems supporting the seed set of 85 of all flowering plants ollerton et al 2011 furthermore as 76 of the leading crops are insect pollinated insect pollination provides a direct benefit to humans klein et al 2007 among all pollinating insects bees are considered one of the most important groups of pollinators biesmeijer et al 2006 powney et al 2019 providing valuable ecosystem services matias et al 2017 bees and the plant species they pollinate form complex mutualistic interaction networks bascompte and jordano 2013 such networks are appropriate tools to reason about community ecosystems in general poisot et al 2016 however temporal turnover and changing species distributions such as extinction or migration due to natural or anthropogenic causes also changes the interactions burkle et al 2013 schwarz et al 2020 caradonna et al 2021 field trials studied the impact of artificially removing flowers urban mead 2017 or bees brosi et al 2017 from natural ecosystems resulting in a rewiring of the interaction network similarly lopezaraiza mikel et al 2007 studied the impact of alien plant species on a pollination network which led to higher flower visitation rates yet ultimately a decrease in general pollination efficiency due to the impact of alien pollen wild plant and animal communities were also found to be negatively impacted by honeybee spillover from flowering crops magrach et al 2017 russo and shea 2017 showed that chemical fertilization of flower patches increased flower attractiveness and resulted in an increased connectance of the pollination network leading to a significant increase in both species richness and abundance of pollinators these examples illustrate the need for predictive models for anticipating the impact of new species on ecosystems correctly observed pollination interaction networks often arise from co evolutionary processes where both partners are adapted to facilitate the interactions as well as neutral processes mainly dependent on species abundances vázquez et al 2009 holt and bonsall 2017 the species pool of an ecosystem determines the co occurrence probabilities but whether or not an ecological interaction can actually occur depends on the complementary of morphological or physiological traits of the species bartomeus et al 2016 for example olesen et al 2011 could observe forbidden links in pollination networks due to mismatches in phenology and species size morales castilla et al 2015 proposed combining information on forbidden links with probabilistic trait based linkage rules to infer species interaction networks however most research on these linkage rules has been performed on food webs making the rules for mutualistic networks such as pollination less well understood valdovinos 2019 an established hypothesis in ecology states that species interaction networks are low dimensional i e they can be captured using only a few properties or traits of the composing species eklöf et al 2013 since traits arise through evolutionary processes it comes as no surprise that species interaction motifs have been found to correlate with phylogenetic signals as well rezende et al 2007 krasnov et al 2012 aizen et al 2016 baguette et al 2020 novel statistical methods make it possible to quantify the cophylogenetic signals in species interaction networks balbuena et al 2013 hadfield et al 2014 and recent studies of pollination networks consider both traits and phylogeny when modeling species interactions e g joffard et al 2019 a species phylogeny is often easier to obtain than its traits which makes it an attractive proxy some studies e g best et al 2013 mazel et al 2018 however showed that measuring diversity based on phylogeny is less indicative of ecological function than a trait based diversity our work shows that both traits and phylogeny can be used to accurately predict bee plant interactions provided that the model can be trained with an example network machine learning methods have been successfully applied for species interaction network prediction from traits using various methods see e g gravel et al 2013 bartomeus et al 2016 desjardins proulx et al 2017 recently pichler et al 2019 showed for both simulated and real world data that nonlinear machine learning methods outperform generalized linear models in predicting species interaction networks based on trait matching here we approach this problem by using kernel based pairwise learning methods these types of methods have a rich history of use in computational biology for example for protein protein yamanishi et al 2004 vert et al 2007 vert 2008 protein ligand gönen 2012 pahikkala et al 2015 or protein nucleic acid interaction predictions pelossof et al 2015 more specifically we apply two step kernel ridge regression pahikkala et al 2014 stock et al 2018 a simple but powerful method to predict interactions this model takes a description of a bee species and a plant species as input based on traits phylogeny or both and returns a score that indicates whether an interaction is likely or not importantly this method is both agnostic and universal it can learn any arbitrary relation between species descriptors given sufficient data stock et al 2018 no prior knowledge is assumed on the ecological processes the remainder of this work is subdivided as follows the materials section section 2 discusses the florabeilles dataset section 2 1 the traits of the pollinators and of the plants section 2 2 and the construction of the phylogenetic tree of both section 2 3 in section 2 4 we present four auxiliary datasets which we analyze in lesser detail than the florabeilles dataset these networks with traits serve to highlight the scope and limitations of the suggested methodology the methods section section 3 presents the two step kernel ridge regression method and how it is used section 3 1 provides a small self contained overview of the kernel ridge regression method section 3 2 discusses the different cross validation settings used to validate the model and section 3 3 explains how we can assess which information is relevant for which predictions the results are presented in section 4 the model is thoroughly evaluated and explored using cross validation null models and other diagnostic analyses besides we also perform an external validation for the exotic bee megachile sculpturalis and discuss the performance on the auxiliary datasets section 5 provides a general discussion of the results putting them in a broader perspective the final conclusions are presented in section 6 2 materials 2 1 the florabeilles pollination network the pollination dataset used to construct train and test the model is provided by florabeilles 2 2 http www florabeiles org a project of inra unité abeilles et environnement avignon france within this project a profound literature study of reported plant pollinator interactions in france was compiled into a large plant pollinator dataset this literature based dataset of plant pollinator interactions in france contains 452 plant species and 305 bee species mainly belonging to the megachilidae family all pollinator species within the dataset are bees furthermore all interactions included in the dataset occurred on the mainland of france the data is represented as a binary incidence matrix y where the rows represent the bee species and the columns the different plant species in this study we worked with a subset of the original dataset containing all the original network species for which traits and phylogeny could be collected this subset contains 96 different bee species 188 different plant species and a total of 246 observed interactions all analyses below are performed on this subset for a detailed analysis of the distribution of the original network s interactions we refer to our earlier work stock et al 2020b because the network data for this study is a subset of a more extensive network several bee and plant species do not have observed interactions we have chosen not to omit these species because the known absence of interactions is itself a source of information our model can exploit it shows that for instance plant species with certain traits are not observed to be pollinated by bee species with certain other traits the performance on the reduced network containing only species with at least one interaction is given in the supplementary materials this performance is worse though still substantially better than random 2 2 species traits species traits denote the characteristics of a species however there can be individual variations in a species traits such as height mass coloration etc for all the bee and plant species we compiled several species specific traits all categorical traits were encoded using a set of binary dummy variables 2 2 1 bee traits several traits were collected for each bee species the information on the traits was based on the veldgids bijen voor nederland en vlaanderen and de nederlandse bijen lewington and falk 2017 peeters et al 2012 for each species we collected five traits the first trait was voltinism which indicates the number of generations a species can have during one year this was either univoltine or bivoltine with one or two generations per year respectively secondly we determined the flying period of each species the months during which a bee species is active are represented by a binary vector indicating whether the pollinator is flying in that month 1 or not 0 next we cataloged the nesting location or nesting preference of each bee species as a categorical variable the nesting type variables were ground cavities above ground walls mice nests hollow stems dead wood below ground steep ground snail shells against walls and under rocks only the first three were used since too few bee species were representative of the other types lastly we cataloged the size of the bee species a measurement from head to the end of the abdomen i e the total body length of the bee both minimum size and maximum size were recorded in millimeter table 1 provides an overview of all used pollinator traits and illustrates a specific example 2 2 2 plant traits the traits of the plant species used in our study were taken from veldgids nederlandse flora eggeltje and tande lid 2015 and geïllustreerde flora van nederland heimans et al 1994 for each species we collected thirteen traits the first trait was growth habit consisting of five categories herb graminoid subshrub shrub and tree secondly we collected for each plant species three measures for height i e the minimum maximum and mean height in cm we scored the blooming period as a binary vector each element in the vector indicates whether the plant is flowering in that month 1 or not 0 the lifespan of the plant species was a categorical trait containing five categories annual biannual perennial annual biannual and biannual perennial we only used whether the plant species is annual or not plants were also grouped by whether they are dicot or monocot the phyllotaxis of the plant was categorized as opposite distichous opposite decussated alternate whorled rosette or basal see fig 1 the position of the ovary was put into three categories superior inferior and partially inferior further traits were related to the flowers of the plants firstly flower color was binary encoded for seven values white pink red yellow green blue and purple most plant species display only one flower color however some plant species may exhibit multiple flower colors the symmetry of the flower was either asymmetrical bilaterally symmetrical or versatile symmetrical for each plant the number of styles and the number of stamens per flower were also collected table 2 provides an overview of all used plant traits illustrated on a specific example 2 3 species phylogenies for the bee species the coi gene encoding the cytochrome c oxidase i was used as a phylogenetic marker hebert et al 2003 for each plant species we retrieved the highly used dna barcode sequence of the matk gene encoding for megakaryocyte associated tyrosine kinase hollingsworth et al 2009 for both bee species and plant species all sequences were retrieved from the barcode of life data system ratnasingham and hebert 2007 two separate fasta files one containing all sequences retrieved for the bee species and one containing all plant species sequences were aligned with muscle edgar 2004 we constructed the phylogenetic trees using the neighbor joining method in mega 7 kumar et al 2016 for each of the constructed phylogenetic trees i e one for all bee species and one for all plant species a newick file was generated containing the branch lengths the newick files were further processed using the phylo module in the biopython package cock et al 2009 to obtain a distance or dissimilarity matrix for the bee species and the plant species in total the dataset contained 53 distinct families and 139 unique genera for the plant species and six distinct families and 22 unique genera for the bee species an overview of all species including the phylogenetic trees can be found in the supplementary information 2 4 auxiliary networks to demonstrate that the suggested framework works well with different types of pollination networks we collected various additional networks with species traits from literature these networks vary in size and the quality and quantity of species traits that are available from olito and fox 2015 we take an alpine network containing 125 pollinator species and 41 plant species for each pollinator species the proboscis length is known as an ordinal variable minute short medium long likewise the flower depth is also available for each plant species as an ordinal variable disk small medium large from joffard et al 2019 we borrow a pollination network containing 1278 interactions between 726 pollinator species and 243 orchid species no traits were available for the pollinators but for the plant species we use the pollination strategy categorical food deception nectar production sexual deception shelter mimicry and habitat categorical urban lands marshes bogs seeps soaks and springs sand dunes in addition to a phylogenetic tree we use a large pollination network from boreux and klein 2019 also used by pichler et al 2019 this network contains 256 pollinator species and 80 plant species annotated with a variety of traits we possess the guild sociality feeding behavior as categorical variables and the tongue and body length as continuous variables for the pollinator species for the plant species we know the type arboreous or herbaceous the flowering season the flower diameter the shape of the corolla open campanulate or tubular flower color whether it produces nectar and the bloom system e g pollinated by insects wind or birds from sazatornil et al 2016 we used five networks of various sizes related to the pollination of plants by hawkmoths for each pollinator species we have the proboscis length and for each plant species we have the effective flower length both as continuous variables table 6 in section 4 6 describes these auxiliary networks together with their respective model performances 3 methods 3 1 two step kernel ridge regression the bee plant interactions are predicted using a kernel based 3 3 not to be confused with kernel density estimation supervised network prediction method such methods have shown great success in bioinformatics especially for predicting the properties of bio molecules a kernel function k is a symmetric and positive semi definite function with two arguments valid kernel functions imply an implicit feature representation in some hilbert space using the kernel trick i e k x x ϕ x ϕ x here ϕ is a feature map to a potentially high dimensional hilbert space and denotes the dot product this trick is typically exploited to extend linear learning methods such as pca support vector machines ridge regression and fisher discriminant analysis to learn arbitrarily complex nonlinear functions schölkopf and smola 2002 despite the past success of kernel methods in bioinformatics schölkopf et al 2004 they have not yet been fully embraced by the ecological research community 4 4 the support vector machine as a general purpose classifier is a notable exception in this work we use two step kernel ridge regression tskrr to predict the bee plant interactions pahikkala et al 2014 stock et al 2018 romera paredes and torr 2015 tskrr can generalize to new bee species as well as new plant species a related simplified method has already been used with great success to predict missing interactions in various species interaction networks stock et al 2017 importantly for this work the tskrr method admits closed form formulas for performing cross validation for the different prediction settings stock et al 2020a as discussed in more detail in section 3 2 fig 2a schematically represents this method the method boils down to applying kernel ridge regression twice once to generalize to new bee species and once to generalize to new plant species the species level regression models use a description based on a kernel function to represent the individual species we will denote with k and g the kernel functions quantifying the similarity between the bee and plant species respectively these capture trait similarity phylogenetic distance or both the tskrr prediction function has the following general bilinear form 1 f b p i 1 m j 1 n w i j k b b i g p p j where w i j is a set of weights found by fitting the tskrr model to an example network as is typically the case for kernel methods this prediction function is a weighted sum over the observed data these weights can be found very simply by computing 2 w k λ k i 1 y g λ g i 1 with y the incidence matrix containing the observed bee plant interactions and two gram matrices k k b i b j and g g p i p j containing all pairwise kernel values between the bee and plant species here λ k and λ g are two hyperparameters that determine the model complexity larger values regularize the respective kernel ridge regression models more preventing overfitting as described in sections 2 2 and 2 3 the species are represented by traits and phylogeny the traits can be summarized in a p dimensional numerical vector x i for the i th species all traits are standardized such that they all have an average value of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 we use the standard laplacian kernel e g for the bee species k traits b i b j exp x i x j p the laplacian kernel is popular and can be shown to be universal 5 5 in initial experiments with a linear kernel we observed a substantially worse performance this was a strong indication that a nonlinear model is best suited to predict the pollination interactions it can be used to approximate any function using a prediction function of the form 1 a kernel function representing the phylogeny is obtained by k phylo b i b j 1 d b i b j with d the phylogenetic distance between two species this method always yields kernel values between 0 and 1 the trait and phylogenetic information are combined by taking the average of the respective kernels we added the value 0 1 to the elements and additionally 0 1 to all gram matrices diagonal this is equivalent to providing an intercept to eq 1 and ensures that the tskrr has the same capabilities as the linear filtering method described earlier for such purposes stock et al 2018 2020b 2017 3 2 performance evaluation an essential issue in pairwise learning is performing a proper model selection and evaluation several researchers have noted that when predicting for two new objects in casu bee and plant species it can make a substantial difference whether one or two of the objects have been encountered during training or not pahikkala et al 2015 park and marcotte 2012 schrynemackers et al 2013 for predicting bee plant interactions we can distinguish four distinct prediction settings interactions predicting for bee and plant species that were included in the training data this is usually done to detect false negatives missing interactions in the network bees predicting interaction values between new bee species and known plant species plants predicting interaction values between new plant species and known bee species both predicting interaction values between two species that have not been seen during training to properly account for the different prediction settings we use specialized stratified cross validation schemes as described in stock et al 2020a the bee and plant species are each randomly subdivided into four disjoint subsets each combination of a subset of bee species and a subset of plant species corresponds to one of the sixteen blocks of the interaction matrix these sixteen blocks are used as a basis for the four cross validation schemes for the setting interactions we remove all interactions in one block by setting the interaction values to zero the reduced network is used to fit a tskrr model and predictions are made for the removed block this protocol is followed for every block i e every combination of the species subsets for the setting bees only a subset of the bees is withheld in every fold predictions are made for these bee species with all plant species this means that here the cross validation is only partitioned on the bee species the setting plants is treated analogously finally for the setting both we consider again the sixteen blocks as for the setting interactions here we also remove all interactions containing one of the species from the block used for testing in each of the sixteen folds these cross validation schemes are depicted in fig 3a all cross validation schemes are nested while dividing the network in train and test set during the cross validation we use the corresponding leave one out cross validation to find the optimal hyperparameters λ k and λ g this means we determine the optimal regularization in every step of the cross validation using only the data assigned for training and not for testing to this end we used the analytical shortcuts described in stock et al 2020a we used roc curves and the area under the roc curve auc metric pooled over the whole cross validated prediction matrix to evaluate the models both are used to assess how good the model is at distinguishing a positive interaction from a negative interaction roc curves and auc are popular tools for evaluating supervised network prediction methods schrynemackers et al 2013 3 3 feature importance to better understand how the model makes predictions we compute feature importances based on permutations similarly to how this is done for the machine learning method called random forests breiman 2001 to assess the importance of a kernel function we randomly permute the rows and columns of the gram matrix see fig 3b destroying all linkage between the species and the interaction values and note the decrease in performance measured in auc using leave one out cross validation compared to the undisturbed model note that the figure illustrates the equivalent process of randomly reordering the rows of the matrix containing the traits this is done either for the bee kernel plant kernel or both and all cross validation settings we report averages over 100 repetitions to provide stable results to prospect which traits are essential we also perform the same experiments where only a single trait is permuted the decrease in auc is an indicative metric to assess the relative importance of these traits 3 4 fitting and validation on the auxiliary networks for the auxiliary networks described in section 2 4 we used a simplified training and validation protocol all categorical variables were dummy encoded while continuous variables were standardized to have a mean of zero and unit variance for the traits associated with the networks of olito and fox 2015 and joffard et al 2019 i e two datasets with only categorical variables for the traits we used a linear kernel we constructed a standard radial basis kernel for the traits of boreux and klein 2019 and sazatornil et al 2016 the bandwidth parameter of these kernels was chosen using the median heuristic i e taking the median of all squared euclidean distances in trait values in a similar vein for the phylogenetic tree of olito and fox 2015 we used g exp d σ with d the phylogenetic distance matrix of the plants and σ median d i j i j 1 m a bandwidth again set using the median heuristic we again added 0 1 to the elements and an additional 0 1 to the diagonal elements to all gram matrices as no traits were available for the pollinators of the joffard et al 2019 network we used a gram matrix with 0 1 on the off diagonal and 0 2 on the diagonal in stock et al 2018 we showed that using this kind of smoother kernel in a pairwise model yields a similar method as the linear filtering method presented in stock et al 2017 all models were fitted with default values of λ k λ g 1 we used the leave one out shortcuts of stock et al 2020a for each of the four settings described in section 3 2 for the settings interactions and both we computed the auc over the complete predicted incidence matrix for the settings pollinator 6 6 we use the term pollinator since not all pollinators are bees in the auxiliary networks and plants we computed the auc for all the interactions of the species that were held out subsequently we averaged the auc over all these species 4 results 4 1 performances of the model the auc values for the different cross validation settings are presented in table 3 as expected the setting interactions is the easiest to learn while the setting both is always the hardest furthermore a higher performance is recorded for generalizing to new bee species compared to new plant species the tskrr model seems to be able to perform well for the three easiest settings with auc values of more than 0 7 for new plant species and more than 0 85 for detecting missing interactions in the given pollination network given that our network is expected to be only partially complete and that we can biologically only expect a relatively weak link between the traits or phylogeny and the flower preference these results are quite promising using either traits or phylogeny the setting both has a performance that is only marginally better than the baseline auc of 0 5 obtained by a random model combining the descriptors results in a slightly improved auc of 0 635 this is still worse than any other cross validation setting but it shows that the tskrr model can extract meaningful information from the gram matrices even for the challenging task of predicting interactions between unobserved species when looking at which information is more useful we can remark that for this dataset i e florabeilles the traits seem to be slightly more relevant than the phylogeny as models based on traits generally perform better the traits and the phylogeny seem to be complementary to some extent with the exception of the setting bees we always obtain an improvement by combining both sources of information this effect is observed most clearly in the setting both which can only exploit traits and phylogeny and not the inherent structure of the incidence matrix in the corresponding roc curve shown in fig 4 we note that the curves for the better performing settings interactions and bees have a clear elbow the curve s onset is notably steep indicating that a large fraction of the interactions can be detected with few false negatives this is much less pronounced for the setting plants and especially for the setting both for the latter the model systematically performs better than random but there is no well defined set of top scoring interactions with high accuracy 4 2 tuning surfaces the plots in fig 5 show the performance for different values of the regularization parameters λ k and λ g there is one plot for every leave one out cross validation setting fig 5 is generated using the kernels combining traits and phylogeny similar plots for the different kernels are available in the supplementary materials although these curves show a vastly different behavior for different validation settings the best model for all settings is approximately the same this corresponds to the model with the hyperparameters λ k λ g 1 0 1 hinting the need for more regularization for the bee than for the plant kernels since we have about twice as many plant species as bee species in the network it is not surprising that less regularization is needed for the former in the setting plants the optimal regularization parameters are close to 0 1 1 resulting in more regularization for the plant species and more freedom for the bee species interestingly for the setting interactions both hyperparameters should optimally have about the same value and must not be too large this would hinder the model s capacity to learn from the network for the setting both the only restriction is that neither hyperparameters should be too large for the settings bees and plants the trends are opposite to generalize to new bee species it is mainly the tuning of the plant species kernel which is important and vice versa this seems to indicate that to predict for new bee species mainly the information about the known plant species is exploited by the model 4 3 importance of traits and phylogeny the results of the various permutation experiments as described in section 3 2 are given in table 4 the general trend is as anticipated permuting both kernel matrices always has a more significant impact than permuting only one of the matrices similarly permuting the kernel matrix using both traits and phylogeny usually results in a more significant auc drop than when only one source of information is used this is because the performance of the kernel combining traits and phylogeny was always higher than using the individual sources table 3 when comparing the different cross validation settings we note different effects depending on what is permuted for the setting interactions it seems that the kernels describing plant species hold much more relevant information for the tskrr model since destroying the information of the plant species has a much larger effect than that of the bee species the same trend though less pronounced is observed in the setting both in general more information can thus be extracted from the plant species a partial explanation here is that there are more plant species in the network than bee species the cross validation settings for bee and plant species show more distinct trends to predict for new bee species it seems that permuting the bee kernel has almost no impact generalizing to new bees is solely done by exploiting the plants information further demonstrating the higher importance of plants for the model the setting plants shows an opposite but less pronounced trend here the bees information is more important for the model performance but permuting the information of the plants still has a demonstrable impact suggesting that generalizing to new plants is done using both sources of information we assessed the importance of the individual traits for predicting interactions in the four cross validation settings the importance scores for the ten variables with the highest drop in performance are plotted in fig 6 the blooming period and the flying period seem to be important traits for predicting interactions so are the height of the plant species and the sizes of the bee species nesting location also seems consistently to be an important trait for the bee species likely because this is a proxy for the phylogeny consistent with the observations made for table 4 plant traits are most important to predict for new pollinator species and the other way around to predict for new plant species voltinism flying period bee size and nesting location seem to be specific traits with predictive power individually each trait only has a minor contribution to the performance for predicting for new bee species in general the model seems to favor simple traits such as flying times blooming period and species sizes flower color never seems to be especially important for making predictions nor are more specific plants anatomical traits 4 4 validation using ecological null models we validate the performance of our model by recomputing the performance against three ecological null models bees randomly shuffling interactions for each pollinator i e shuffling every row of the incidence matrix independently plants randomly shuffling interactions for each plant i e shuffling every column of the incidence matrix independently curveball randomly shuffling the incidence matrix such that the row and column sum for every species remains unchanged according to the curveball algorithm strona et al 2014 we reshuffle the incidence matrix y according to each of these three null models tskrr uses either the traits kernel the phylogeny kernel or the combined kernel we compute the performance for the four prediction settings this process is repeated 100 times we provide averages for every cross validation setting kernel type and null model the results are presented in table 5 consistent with the results of the permutation experiments presented in section 4 3 shuffling the interaction matrix leads to a substantial drop in performance firstly we can observe that the better the performance was for this setting and kernel as listed in table 3 the larger the performance reduction is secondly shuffling the bees information has a substantially larger impact than shuffling that of the plants demonstrating that the former is more important for the model predictions see table 5 setting interactions and both lastly the curveball null model destroys the association between the species descriptors and leaves the marginals of the interaction matrix intact as the drop in performance is lower than for the other null models it seems that the model can still perform predictions better than random for the setting interactions this is not surprising as it then corresponds to using the linear filtering method stock et al 2017 using only the marginals the reduced auc is roughly the same as reported on this network using the said method stock et al 2020b interestingly the auc does not drop to 0 5 for the setting both where the species are new during prediction this indicates that tskrr and by extension other machine learning methods can still exploit the non uniformity of the interaction matrix in such cases we note that even under the curveball null model both the kernel matrices and the interaction matrix exhibit structures that a machine learning model can exploit 4 5 validation on the invasion of megachile sculpturalis as an external validation we use the tskrr model to predict the plant interactions for megachile sculpturalis a bee species that was not present in the original pollination network m sculpturalis is an invasive species in france its native range is in east asia hinojosa díaz et al 2005 at the beginning of the 1990s the bee species was introduced in north carolina usa mangum and brooks 1997 after its introduction it spread rapidly across the usa and reached canada in 2002 paiero and buck 2003 in 2008 m sculpturalis was first reported in the south of france le féon et al 2018 and similarly as for the invasion of the usa the geographical range is expanding as it was later reported in italy switzerland germany austria and spain le féon et al 2018 aguado et al 2018 this species provides the ideal case for our model as the knowledge on the potential impact of this species on the bee plant network in france and europe in general is still limited le féon et al 2018 reported a list of flower species visited by m sculpturalis yet this information is based upon a limited number of observations they reported flower visits on twenty different plant species of which fourteen were native to france as m sculpturalis is a polylectic bee species it is suspected to interact with several plant species and genera the use of a predictive model such as ours provides the opportunity to investigate the potential consequences of an invasive bee species as it may disturb the bee plant network we fit the tskrr model using the traits data on the complete network the hyperparameters are chosen using leave one out cross validation for the setting bees fig 7 shows the distribution of the prediction scores eq 1 for m sculpturalis this distribution is bimodal we apply a cut off of 0 1 on the scores plant species with a higher score are assumed to be likely pollination partners of m sculpturalis the identified plant species in order of decreasing score are centaurea jacea medicago sativa trifolium pretense trifolium repens and lotus corniculatus four out of the five plant species identified by the model have been verified in the field the interaction of m sculpturalis with centaurea sp has been reported by le féon et al 2018 pollen analysis of a pollen provision for the larvae in germany revealed the presence of medicago sativa westrich 2016 trifolium sp were also identified via pollen analysis of two samples in france andrieu ponel et al 2018 this amounts to a false positive rate of 20 and according to the roc curve of fig 4 we can expect a true positive rate of roughly 70 this means that we expect to have discovered about 70 of the plant species in the dataset that can interact with m sculpturalis it should be clear that using a scoring model is always accompanied by a trade off lowering the threshold would likely have led to more interacting plant species being detected at the cost of more errors our model could predict five plant species with which m sculpturalis would interact and four of these predictions have been verified in the field this indicates that at least four out of the five predictions are biologically correct 4 6 performances on the auxiliary networks the performance results of the tskrr for the auxiliary networks are presented in table 6 these results are roughly in line with the results obtained for the florabeilles network however we note that the size and density of the network in addition to trait quality have substantial effects on the model performance for the network from olito and fox 2015 we see that it is possible to predict missing interactions for new pollinator species and plant species using only a single trait for both predicting for new pairs of species is much harder however the network of joffard et al 2019 is unusual in the sense that we only possess information on the plant species and not on the pollinator species here the phylogenetic distances seem to be more predictive compared to the habitat and pollination strategy traits to the extent that adding the latter does not seem to improve performance interestingly it is easier to predict for new pollinators than filling in missing interactions when all species are known this likely arises from how the auc is computed in setting pollinator the auc is computed column wise and averaged over all pollinators instead of computed over the whole incidence matrix as is the case for the settings interaction and both the network of boreux and klein 2019 is closest to the florabeilles network in terms of size and richness of the traits correspondingly it has a similar performance as presented in table 3 the different datasets of sazatornil et al 2016 show that the performance can vary depending on the size and density where larger is in general better for such small datasets extrapolating to the setting both seems to be hard or impossible however a comparison with the results on the olito and fox 2015 network suggests that a continuous trait is more informative than a categorical one 5 discussion the differences in our model s performance under various settings can be used to investigate ecological hypotheses a critical aspect of pairwise learning is that the models might generalize better or worse for certain prediction settings for example a model might reach a satisfying performance to find missing interactions in a pollination network but could generalize poorly to new bee species such issues are well documented in molecular network prediction see e g park and marcotte 2012 schrynemackers et al 2013 pahikkala et al 2015 however they are not common knowledge in ecological network modeling despite the otherwise general awareness of using blocking and stratification in ecological modeling roberts et al 2017 using a pollination network from france as a case study we demonstrate the effect of different cross validation schemes on the performance in ecological network prediction the size and density of the training network and the quality of the species traits descriptors unsurprisingly greatly influence the performance it is interesting to note that tskrr can still give meaningful predictions when no traits are available something we noted earlier when presenting the linear filtering method stock et al 2017 in contrast to the results on the florabeilles network the performances on the auxiliary networks in table 6 are obtained without hyperparameter optimization hence the performances can be seen as lower bounds on what one could attain after a more thorough tuning we analyzed the florabeilles pollination network in the fashion of interpretable machine learning molnar 2019 this means that initially we build a model intending to have a good predictive performance in the next step we try to extract the ecologically relevant information from this model using a thorough performance evaluation we can look into the black box probing how well the model generalizes whether traits or phylogeny are more useful and assess which species traits are most relevant this way we bridge a more conventional statistical methodology with a general machine learning approach insights from such data driven models can help to validate or lead to new ecological theories desjardins proulx et al 2019 we are by far not the first to us bilinear models structured as in eq 1 ruben gabriel 1998 presented a model with an identical structure such models gained some fashionableness in ecology for example brown et al 2014 dray et al 2014 miller et al 2019 used such models to solve the so called four corner problem successfully for associating species traits to environmental gradients to explain species presence and absence the three tables used in the four corner solution a table describing the presence absence or abundances of the species in the plots the species traits and the environmental variables correspond to our three matrices in fig 2 these researchers also noted that these models strength comes from combining information about all the species and environments similarly to how we combine all the bee and plant species in a single global model one can contrast this approach to the local models in network prediction where one builds a model for every vertex i e species at least in theory these models are less powerful than the global methods because the model does not share learned knowledge between species bilinear extensions of generalized linear models have also been used to analyze species interaction networks for example hadfield et al 2014 used a bilinear model to study cophylogenetic relationships in host parasite networks whereas it is also suggested for studying pollination networks bascompte and jordano 2013 the main difference between these approaches and our proposed tskrr method is that we analyze the networks from a machine learning point of view instead of a classical statistical point of view hence there are two aspects in which our model differs from generalized bilinear models firstly we make use of regularization to improve the generalization of our method fig 5 shows that this has a positive impact on the performance compared to an unregularized version corresponding to λ b λ p 0 secondly we use kernels to extend the model to learn any nonlinear association improving the method s generality note that nonlinearity can also be achieved in various other ways for example by encoding high order terms in the generalized bilinear model given our emphasis on prediction we have focused extensively on validating the performance on new data the specific way of fitting eq 1 using eq 2 allows for extremely fast cross validation making it possible to perform the validations of sections 4 3 and 4 4 efficiently in this work we predicted whether a biological interaction between two species could happen given that they are both present to this end we used an interaction network containing literature validated bee plant interactions this dataset purposely ignores species density based and location specific variations in these interactions it is well known that such effects greatly influence sampled pollination networks poisot et al 2015 holt and bonsall 2017 magrach et al 2017 for example neutral effects purely determined by the abundance of the species can already elucidate structural patterns in the network canard et al 2012 modeling interaction strengths requires also taken species abundances into accounts which we explore in other work stock et al 2021 predicting species interactions taking into account the distribution of the species and site related features in addition to the traits or phylogeny of the species will likely require substantially more complex models and therefore more data to learn from this route is challenging though exciting for future research 6 conclusion we explored a supervised network prediction method to predict pollination interactions based on species traits and general phylogeny though the trait information was slightly more informative the best results were consistently obtained by combining both information sources we highlighted important differences between predicting missing links in a network or predictions for new bee species plant species or both this is a caution for future researchers as we have shown that pairwise models tend to use the structure of the network in addition to the species traits and phylogeny only a correct stratification during cross validation will yield the relevant ecological insights our model could predict five plant species with which megachile sculpturalis would interact four of which could be verified in the literature we conclude that tskrr model is a suitable method to predict pollination interactions working well on various networks and allows us to investigate the performance for the different ecological prediction settings thoroughly credit authorship

24619,agro ecosystems have large potentials for supporting human well being and local development also by providing large amounts of organic matter for bioenergy generation the use of agricultural residues was proposed as a possible solution to support energy transition while avoiding conflicts for the use of agricultural land destined to food production the present work uses an ecosystem services es approach to map and estimate the potential availability of agricultural residues potential es supply in the emilia romagna region italy where high productive croplands are present the map was overlapped with the bioenergy plants currently present in the region es demand that could be sustained by residues considering a buffer area of 10 km radius for a sustainable supply chain and under the assumption of using only the 25 of total residues additionally suitable areas for bioenergy development were mapped by means of a hotspot analysis the results showed that the emilia romagna region has a large availability of agricultural residues to be potentially used for bioenergy generation the 82 4 of the total installed power of biogas plants and the whole installed power of those using woody biomasses may be supported by using agricultural residues when considering buffer areas for sustainable supply chains agricultural residues could meet the 95 and 50 of total demand from biogas and solid biomasses plants respectively however competition for agricultural residues among bioenergy plants could arise because of the overlap of their buffer zones moreover hotspot analysis revealed large suitable areas for the development of environmental and cost effective biogas plants contrasting es supply and demand may unveil unexplored forms of sustainable development in agro ecosystems thus contributing to a more rational use of agricultural production which supports renewable energies without competing for the agricultural land keywords agro ecosystem services ecosystem services mapping biogas woody biomasses renewable energies 1 introduction mainstreaming ecosystem services es in environmental policies requires their quantification and mapping maes et al 2012 moreover the joint consideration of both es supply and demand may be strategic particularly in the case of human dominated environments such as agro ecosystems where the effects of human interventions on the delivery of ecological functions are more important garbach et al 2014 agro ecosystems support human well being and local economies by delivering a number of provisioning services including food and bioenergy provision power 2010 however trade offs between these two es are usually observed as bioenergy provision is often based on dedicated energy crops which compete with food fodder provision for the use of agricultural land gissi et al 2018 lautenbach et al 2012 mirzabaev et al 2015 the dependence on non renewable fossil fuels as well as environmental concerns related to air pollution and greenhouse gas ghg effects have been promoting bioenergy as part of global warming and climate change mitigation strategies in developed and developing countries alike bilgili et al 2017 according to the kyoto protocol the key factor to both reduce ghg emissions and improve the living standards of developing countries is to produce cost effective energy as well as use bioenergy mardani et al 2019 thus since the early 2000s a significant increase of production of bioenergy particularly biofuels for the transportation sector has occurred worldwide in order to attend the growing global demand and replace some part of the energy portfolio currently occupied by fossil based energies and fuels junginger et al 2019 such a dramatic expansion was driven by the idea that bioenergy and biofuels would be one of the most promising alternative to achieve the world energy requirement by avoiding an extra economic burden and any significant environmental impact kang et al 2019 for example from 2000 to 2019 both united states production of ethanol from fermenting corn and european union biodiesel production from vegetal oils have increased by a factor of ten reaching in 2020 about 16 billion gallons per year us dept of energy 2020 and about 4 billion of gallons per year respectively ebb 2020 in the face of such a rapid growth some have started expressing concerns over the aggressive expansion of bioenergy production pointing to many potential negative consequences robledo abad et al 2017 there is still a lack of agreement on the degree to which biofuels both provide positive ecosystem services e g fuel climate regulation and compromise other ecosystem services e g biodiversity food fischer et al 2009 perhaps the most controversial are precisely the first generation biofuels i e bioethanol and biodiesel from dedicated crops because several studies have confirmed their negative impact on the environment kaletnik et al 2019 biodiversity núñez regueiro et al 2019 climate frank et al 2016 and food prices chakravorty et al 2017 land and resource constraints create economic pressure among the various anthropogenic uses of biomass the so called food energy environment trilemma wang et al 2017 these drawbacks can be appeased to some degree by utilizing residual biomass as raw material for bioenergy and biofuels production alavijeh and yaghmaei 2016 sources of residual biomass include agricultural residues i e stalks stover chaff pruning forestry residue i e treetops branches slash and agro industry waste i e pomace sludge utilization of biomass residues allows for the same land and production practices to produce the main product reducing both the resource inputs and the demand of land associated with producing dedicated crops moreover it is perfectly consistent with the circular economy policies of the eu greggio et al 2018 that have the main objective to limit the production of waste by recycling and reusing raw materials and recovering biomasses for their utilization according to the pyramid of value mcdowall et al 2017 in this context the anaerobic digestion process for biogas production has gained a growing interest as one of the most promising technology for residues and waste management and producing renewable energy ma and liu 2019 alternatively biogas systems can be supported by a large variety of feedstock with no commercial value such as urban and industrial organic waste sewage manure and animal waste as well as agricultural by products a typical onsite consumption of biogas regards its conversion to electrical and thermal energy or after an upgrading process that removes carbon dioxide to biomethane for transportation sector chinnici et al 2018 the sustainability is supported also by the use of digestate to both reduce or replace chemical fertilizers required for cultivation and limit soil consumption soil erosion and desertification schröder et al 2019 today italy is the third larger biogas producer in the world after china and germany with about 1600 biogas plants now operating especially in the northern regions where biogas is still mainly produced by using dedicated crops integrated with agro industry waste and animal manure tamburini et al 2020a recently growing attention has been paid to the use of agricultural residues and their potential capacity to produce bioenergy also in co digestion with other organic materials valenti et al 2018 nevertheless the development of successful residue based supply chains is currently hindered by different issues such as technical financial and institutional and regulatory barriers kapoor et al 2020 as well as the lack of shared spatial planning methods in fact although several studies demonstrated that relevant potentials could be available worldwide mendu et al 2012 scarlat et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 the use of agricultural residues for bioenergy generation is limited to few local cases e g m m gaglio et al 2019 negi et al 2020 currently most agricultural residues are left in the field after harvesting or used for animal feed at farm level underutilized for energy production they undoubtedly have an essential role to sustain and improve organic carbon stock of soil plant growth and other environmental services but can represent an important resource also for biogas production cherubin et al 2018 therefore the trade off and environmental synergism associated with crop residue management and bioenergy production has to be carefully considered enhancing ecosystem services via bioenergy from agricultural residues can be achieved only by location specific design of bioenergy systems not only in terms of conversion efficiency or energy production potential but also considering the distance between where the residues are produced and the plant where they are processed in order to save the potential environmental benefits and avoid the risk of increasing ghg emissions related to transportation tamburini et al 2020b in light of the consideration presented above using the emilia romagna region as a case model this study aims to apply an es approach based on the modeling of es potential supply and existing demand to put in the fore the possible use of agricultural residues to generate bioenergy while protecting other es by doing so the study provides a geospatial analysis of agricultural residues availability and related potential energy yield for biogas and woody biomasses and match it with the bioenergy plants currently present in the region considering some environmental restrictions moreover a hot spot analysis is performed to identify areas with higher potential for the development of bioenergy supply chain the proposed approach aims to contribute to the current context of energy transition in eu by providing a spatially explicit method to overcome the current barriers that prevent the sustainable production of bioenergy in agro ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the emilia romagna e r region extends for 2245 300 ha in north eastern italy fig 1 agricultural land covers about the 68 of the total regional area and includes zones with high agricultural yields in the plain part followed by forest and seminatural areas 25 artificial surfaces 5 water bodies 1 and wetlands 1 agricultural land is principally covered by annual crops mainly cereals maize and wheat and in lesser extent by perennial crops the e r region was selected as ideal case study due to the proliferation of bioenergy plants under the national incentive policy for renewable energies in the last years mainly supplied by dedicated energy crops this led to conflicts for the use of agricultural land in fact more than 60 of the biogas currently produced in the region isnow based on dedicated crops corresponding to about 31 500 ha of land diverted from food feed production to bioenergy tamburini et al 2020a according to the national energy regulation which bestow a high autonomy level to the regions the e r recently adopted the regional energy plan to 2030 where the renewable energy targets were settled because of the abundance of highly productive croplands the plan forecast an increase of installed electric power for biogas from the actual 234 to 298 320 mw and from 99 mw to 129 140 mw for solid biomasses according conservative or best case scenarios respectively however such targets are expected to further exacerbate conflicts for agricultural land and or the use of their final products the exploitation of agricultural residues was proposed as possible alternative feedstock to solve or at least alleviate the detrimental effects due to the land use change in the e r region tamburini et al 2020b currently given the high productivity cropland rates and the widespread presence of agricultural land in the region a large amount of residues from both annual and perennial crops are potentially available 2 2 es supply bioenergy potential from agricultural residues in er region the supply of the es of bioenergy provision was calculated by means of production functions the potential availability of agricultural residues for bioenergy generation was mapped on the basis of the regional agricultural map produced by the regional environmental agency arpae arpae 2020 which represents the spatial distribution of agricultural plots and their crop types in emilia romagna region the latter classifies agricultural crops in macro groups table 1 through the analysis of multitemporal series of satellite images during the period of november 2019 june 2020 according to the technologies present in the emilia romagna region two main residues based supply chains were identified i biogas derived from crop

retaining a proper residues fraction in field the amount of agricultural residues produced by the agro ecosystems of e r region could cover the demand of the majority of existing plants thus demonstrating that a supply chain based on available residues could lead to a sustainable generation of bioenergy while not harming food provision and maintain regulating services the case of emilia romagna region provides an ideal example of an intensive agricultural landscape where the number of bioenergy plants increased rapidly in the last decade raising the conflict for the use of agricultural land currently the electric energy requirement at regional level is about 23 000 mwh with a component of slightly more than 10 supplied by biomass cattafi et al 2011 the opportunity to exploit the residual biomass from agriculture could represent a significant percentage of the overall regional demand and of great importance in the context of circular economy and biomass valorisation as already demonstrated by tamburini et al 2020a the current diversion of agricultural lands to bioenergy has been already reached about 3 of the entire regional utilized agricultural areas uaa considered as a realistic threshold of sustainability and the opportunity to rely on residual biomass appears to be a promising alternative in particular the analysis highlighted that the region has a high potential for bioenergy generation from agricultural residues corroborating and extending the findings of previous studies carried out in the region and nearby areas the large and mostly unused residual biomasses potential in e r region was also described by greggio et al 2019 who also included those deriving from agro industrial and food businesses tamburini et al 2020a demonstrated that agricultural residues perform better in terms of ghg savings of other feedstock types that require a change in land use thus allowing the respect of the red ghg emission thresholds the potential negative impacts of removing residues from agricultural fields may be significantly mitigated with proper management strategies e g returning nutrients to the soil by spreading digestate with benefits also in terms of odor perception while supporting circular economy tamburini et al 2020b gaglio et al 2019 applied a lca approach in a case located in e r region to show that the use of residual woody biomasses as energy source can mitigate environmental impacts in the food industry however none of the abovementioned works studied the spatial distribution of residues on the territory which is necessary for an effective energy planning in fact spatial mismatches between biomass supply and demand may force plant managers to recruit residues beyond a sustainable radius or switch to bioenergy dedicated crops contrarily bioenergy potential from residues was mapped by gissi et al 2016 in the nearby province of rovigo confirming its important potential but raising the issue of its scattered distribution on the territory this area was also mapped by longato et al 2019 to identify marginal land to be cropped with non food woody crops and to predict their possible impacts on ecosystem services such solution may be complementary to residues based supply chains providing additional feedstock to support bioenergy development despite the fact that some constraints are necessary to improve environmental and economic performances the majority of bioenergy plants may benefit from a residues amount available at short range and sufficient to supply their installed electric power this means that allocating crop yields for bioenergy generation in the region is not only impactful but also mostly avoidable nonetheless a widespread overlap among plant buffer areas was observed raising the concern of possible competition among bioenergy plants for the use of agricultural residues this is an important factor that may hinder the feasibility of residues based supply chain at large scale and calls for management solutions at local scale in this regard some studies applied location allocation models to tackle resource competition for biomasses for example bojesen et al 2014 proposed a production constrained spatial interaction model combined with a scenario analysis to determine optimal location of future biogas production höhn et al 2014 combined a network analysis with kernel density maps while chukwuma 2019 integrated set cover location model and facility location allocation modeling to optimize location of biogas plants this work also presented a hot spots analysis for biogas and woody biomasses feedstocks in particular a large area in the north eastern part of the region was identified as hotspot and therefore resulted remarkably suitable for biogas plants this zone is particularly productive and includes the reclaimed land that once formed the ancient river po delta gaglio et al 2017 gaglio et al 2019 and are nowadays included in the river po delta park in this sense the park may play an important role in promoting renewable energies with high environmental performances in protected areas where agricultural activities are present fostering circular economy and supporting local sustainable development in rural areas conversely hotspots for woody biomasses are limited however as showed in table 4 their potential exceeds the current installed power although the scattered distribution of woody crops and the large plant sizes can make pruning collection challenging as larger contributor to the regional potential pruning from vineyards should be regarded with attention and included in effective supply chains as already suggested by other studies picchi et al 2013 scarlat and dallemand 2011 spinelli et al 2012 the estimate of sustainable biogas potential is constrained by the assumptions of gathering only the 25 of total available residues and recruit vegetal matter within a 10 km radius such low fraction of residues was considered despite a default collection rate of 40 50 can be found in literature monforti et al 2015 this conservative approach was adopted in consideration of both to maintain soil functionality and use part of the straw yield for other purposes e g livestock feeding therefore potential biogas generation from residues in e r region could be even higher when following more optimistic approaches the quantification of the proper amount of residues to be left on agricultural fields as well as of the part used for different aims is needed to guarantee soil services and manage bioenergy issues finally some limitations related to the followed approach should be considered different values e g fruit grain residues ratios humidity content and agricultural yields were extracted from available databases at provincial level omitting possible variations at finer scale average values for energy conversion were used for all the study area without considering differences of technical characteristics among plants moreover it has to be specified that the analysis involved only those plants that can be surely supplied with vegetal matter based on the available information excluding the others while these limitations can be acceptable at regional scale local scale evaluations should encompass more precise data 5 conclusions this work provides a geospatial method for the development of successful residues based supply chain in agricultural environment modeling spatial distribution of es supply and demand can significantly contribute to solve the food energy dilemma in agro ecosystems an important issue in the context of sustainable development of rural areas agro ecosystems have large potential from field residues that should be firmly supported by renewable energy policies and local governances also to overcome the unsustainable consequences of growing dedicated energy crops in arable land given their uneven occurrence on the territory mapping spatial distribution of residues is fundamental to plan effective supply chains when bioenergy plants are not properly located their supply may lead to competition among plants for residues availability or force plant managers to recruit vegetal matter beyond a short radius thus reducing environmental benefits and increasing gathering costs energy planners and environmental managers should strictly consider local solutions to ensure the proper supply of agricultural resides to bioenergy plants considering at the same time other residue uses including the need to retain vegetal material on field to ensure the soil functionality and services fundings this work was partially supported by the eu project number pgi04939 delta lady floating cultures in river deltas

24619,agro ecosystems have large potentials for supporting human well being and local development also by providing large amounts of organic matter for bioenergy generation the use of agricultural residues was proposed as a possible solution to support energy transition while avoiding conflicts for the use of agricultural land destined to food production the present work uses an ecosystem services es approach to map and estimate the potential availability of agricultural residues potential es supply in the emilia romagna region italy where high productive croplands are present the map was overlapped with the bioenergy plants currently present in the region es demand that could be sustained by residues considering a buffer area of 10 km radius for a sustainable supply chain and under the assumption of using only the 25 of total residues additionally suitable areas for bioenergy development were mapped by means of a hotspot analysis the results showed that the emilia romagna region has a large availability of agricultural residues to be potentially used for bioenergy generation the 82 4 of the total installed power of biogas plants and the whole installed power of those using woody biomasses may be supported by using agricultural residues when considering buffer areas for sustainable supply chains agricultural residues could meet the 95 and 50 of total demand from biogas and solid biomasses plants respectively however competition for agricultural residues among bioenergy plants could arise because of the overlap of their buffer zones moreover hotspot analysis revealed large suitable areas for the development of environmental and cost effective biogas plants contrasting es supply and demand may unveil unexplored forms of sustainable development in agro ecosystems thus contributing to a more rational use of agricultural production which supports renewable energies without competing for the agricultural land keywords agro ecosystem services ecosystem services mapping biogas woody biomasses renewable energies 1 introduction mainstreaming ecosystem services es in environmental policies requires their quantification and mapping maes et al 2012 moreover the joint consideration of both es supply and demand may be strategic particularly in the case of human dominated environments such as agro ecosystems where the effects of human interventions on the delivery of ecological functions are more important garbach et al 2014 agro ecosystems support human well being and local economies by delivering a number of provisioning services including food and bioenergy provision power 2010 however trade offs between these two es are usually observed as bioenergy provision is often based on dedicated energy crops which compete with food fodder provision for the use of agricultural land gissi et al 2018 lautenbach et al 2012 mirzabaev et al 2015 the dependence on non renewable fossil fuels as well as environmental concerns related to air pollution and greenhouse gas ghg effects have been promoting bioenergy as part of global warming and climate change mitigation strategies in developed and developing countries alike bilgili et al 2017 according to the kyoto protocol the key factor to both reduce ghg emissions and improve the living standards of developing countries is to produce cost effective energy as well as use bioenergy mardani et al 2019 thus since the early 2000s a significant increase of production of bioenergy particularly biofuels for the transportation sector has occurred worldwide in order to attend the growing global demand and replace some part of the energy portfolio currently occupied by fossil based energies and fuels junginger et al 2019 such a dramatic expansion was driven by the idea that bioenergy and biofuels would be one of the most promising alternative to achieve the world energy requirement by avoiding an extra economic burden and any significant environmental impact kang et al 2019 for example from 2000 to 2019 both united states production of ethanol from fermenting corn and european union biodiesel production from vegetal oils have increased by a factor of ten reaching in 2020 about 16 billion gallons per year us dept of energy 2020 and about 4 billion of gallons per year respectively ebb 2020 in the face of such a rapid growth some have started expressing concerns over the aggressive expansion of bioenergy production pointing to many potential negative consequences robledo abad et al 2017 there is still a lack of agreement on the degree to which biofuels both provide positive ecosystem services e g fuel climate regulation and compromise other ecosystem services e g biodiversity food fischer et al 2009 perhaps the most controversial are precisely the first generation biofuels i e bioethanol and biodiesel from dedicated crops because several studies have confirmed their negative impact on the environment kaletnik et al 2019 biodiversity núñez regueiro et al 2019 climate frank et al 2016 and food prices chakravorty et al 2017 land and resource constraints create economic pressure among the various anthropogenic uses of biomass the so called food energy environment trilemma wang et al 2017 these drawbacks can be appeased to some degree by utilizing residual biomass as raw material for bioenergy and biofuels production alavijeh and yaghmaei 2016 sources of residual biomass include agricultural residues i e stalks stover chaff pruning forestry residue i e treetops branches slash and agro industry waste i e pomace sludge utilization of biomass residues allows for the same land and production practices to produce the main product reducing both the resource inputs and the demand of land associated with producing dedicated crops moreover it is perfectly consistent with the circular economy policies of the eu greggio et al 2018 that have the main objective to limit the production of waste by recycling and reusing raw materials and recovering biomasses for their utilization according to the pyramid of value mcdowall et al 2017 in this context the anaerobic digestion process for biogas production has gained a growing interest as one of the most promising technology for residues and waste management and producing renewable energy ma and liu 2019 alternatively biogas systems can be supported by a large variety of feedstock with no commercial value such as urban and industrial organic waste sewage manure and animal waste as well as agricultural by products a typical onsite consumption of biogas regards its conversion to electrical and thermal energy or after an upgrading process that removes carbon dioxide to biomethane for transportation sector chinnici et al 2018 the sustainability is supported also by the use of digestate to both reduce or replace chemical fertilizers required for cultivation and limit soil consumption soil erosion and desertification schröder et al 2019 today italy is the third larger biogas producer in the world after china and germany with about 1600 biogas plants now operating especially in the northern regions where biogas is still mainly produced by using dedicated crops integrated with agro industry waste and animal manure tamburini et al 2020a recently growing attention has been paid to the use of agricultural residues and their potential capacity to produce bioenergy also in co digestion with other organic materials valenti et al 2018 nevertheless the development of successful residue based supply chains is currently hindered by different issues such as technical financial and institutional and regulatory barriers kapoor et al 2020 as well as the lack of shared spatial planning methods in fact although several studies demonstrated that relevant potentials could be available worldwide mendu et al 2012 scarlat et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 the use of agricultural residues for bioenergy generation is limited to few local cases e g m m gaglio et al 2019 negi et al 2020 currently most agricultural residues are left in the field after harvesting or used for animal feed at farm level underutilized for energy production they undoubtedly have an essential role to sustain and improve organic carbon stock of soil plant growth and other environmental services but can represent an important resource also for biogas production cherubin et al 2018 therefore the trade off and environmental synergism associated with crop residue management and bioenergy production has to be carefully considered enhancing ecosystem services via bioenergy from agricultural residues can be achieved only by location specific design of bioenergy systems not only in terms of conversion efficiency or energy production potential but also considering the distance between where the residues are produced and the plant where they are processed in order to save the potential environmental benefits and avoid the risk of increasing ghg emissions related to transportation tamburini et al 2020b in light of the consideration presented above using the emilia romagna region as a case model this study aims to apply an es approach based on the modeling of es potential supply and existing demand to put in the fore the possible use of agricultural residues to generate bioenergy while protecting other es by doing so the study provides a geospatial analysis of agricultural residues availability and related potential energy yield for biogas and woody biomasses and match it with the bioenergy plants currently present in the region considering some environmental restrictions moreover a hot spot analysis is performed to identify areas with higher potential for the development of bioenergy supply chain the proposed approach aims to contribute to the current context of energy transition in eu by providing a spatially explicit method to overcome the current barriers that prevent the sustainable production of bioenergy in agro ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the emilia romagna e r region extends for 2245 300 ha in north eastern italy fig 1 agricultural land covers about the 68 of the total regional area and includes zones with high agricultural yields in the plain part followed by forest and seminatural areas 25 artificial surfaces 5 water bodies 1 and wetlands 1 agricultural land is principally covered by annual crops mainly cereals maize and wheat and in lesser extent by perennial crops the e r region was selected as ideal case study due to the proliferation of bioenergy plants under the national incentive policy for renewable energies in the last years mainly supplied by dedicated energy crops this led to conflicts for the use of agricultural land in fact more than 60 of the biogas currently produced in the region isnow based on dedicated crops corresponding to about 31 500 ha of land diverted from food feed production to bioenergy tamburini et al 2020a according to the national energy regulation which bestow a high autonomy level to the regions the e r recently adopted the regional energy plan to 2030 where the renewable energy targets were settled because of the abundance of highly productive croplands the plan forecast an increase of installed electric power for biogas from the actual 234 to 298 320 mw and from 99 mw to 129 140 mw for solid biomasses according conservative or best case scenarios respectively however such targets are expected to further exacerbate conflicts for agricultural land and or the use of their final products the exploitation of agricultural residues was proposed as possible alternative feedstock to solve or at least alleviate the detrimental effects due to the land use change in the e r region tamburini et al 2020b currently given the high productivity cropland rates and the widespread presence of agricultural land in the region a large amount of residues from both annual and perennial crops are potentially available 2 2 es supply bioenergy potential from agricultural residues in er region the supply of the es of bioenergy provision was calculated by means of production functions the potential availability of agricultural residues for bioenergy generation was mapped on the basis of the regional agricultural map produced by the regional environmental agency arpae arpae 2020 which represents the spatial distribution of agricultural plots and their crop types in emilia romagna region the latter classifies agricultural crops in macro groups table 1 through the analysis of multitemporal series of satellite images during the period of november 2019 june 2020 according to the technologies present in the emilia romagna region two main residues based supply chains were identified i biogas derived from crop

agricultural land currently the electric energy requirement at regional level is about 23 000 mwh with a component of slightly more than 10 supplied by biomass cattafi et al 2011 the opportunity to exploit the residual biomass from agriculture could represent a significant percentage of the overall regional demand and of great importance in the context of circular economy and biomass valorisation as already demonstrated by tamburini et al 2020a the current diversion of agricultural lands to bioenergy has been already reached about 3 of the entire regional utilized agricultural areas uaa considered as a realistic threshold of sustainability and the opportunity to rely on residual biomass appears to be a promising alternative in particular the analysis highlighted that the region has a high potential for bioenergy generation from agricultural residues corroborating and extending the findings of previous studies carried out in the region and nearby areas the large and mostly unused residual biomasses potential in e r region was also described by greggio et al 2019 who also included those deriving from agro industrial and food businesses tamburini et al 2020a demonstrated that agricultural residues perform better in terms of ghg savings of other feedstock types that require a change in land use thus allowing the respect of the red ghg emission thresholds the potential negative impacts of removing residues from agricultural fields may be significantly mitigated with proper management strategies e g returning nutrients to the soil by spreading digestate with benefits also in terms of odor perception while supporting circular economy tamburini et al 2020b gaglio et al 2019 applied a lca approach in a case located in e r region to show that the use of residual woody biomasses as energy source can mitigate environmental impacts in the food industry however none of the abovementioned works studied the spatial distribution of residues on the territory which is necessary for an effective energy planning in fact spatial mismatches between biomass supply and demand may force plant managers to recruit residues beyond a sustainable radius or switch to bioenergy dedicated crops contrarily bioenergy potential from residues was mapped by gissi et al 2016 in the nearby province of rovigo confirming its important potential but raising the issue of its scattered distribution on the territory this area was also mapped by longato et al 2019 to identify marginal land to be cropped with non food woody crops and to predict their possible impacts on ecosystem services such solution may be complementary to residues based supply chains providing additional feedstock to support bioenergy development despite the fact that some constraints are necessary to improve environmental and economic performances the majority of bioenergy plants may benefit from a residues amount available at short range and sufficient to supply their installed electric power this means that allocating crop yields for bioenergy generation in the region is not only impactful but also mostly avoidable nonetheless a widespread overlap among plant buffer areas was observed raising the concern of possible competition among bioenergy plants for the use of agricultural residues this is an important factor that may hinder the feasibility of residues based supply chain at large scale and calls for management solutions at local scale in this regard some studies applied location allocation models to tackle resource competition for biomasses for example bojesen et al 2014 proposed a production constrained spatial interaction model combined with a scenario analysis to determine optimal location of future biogas production höhn et al 2014 combined a network analysis with kernel density maps while chukwuma 2019 integrated set cover location model and facility location allocation modeling to optimize location of biogas plants this work also presented a hot spots analysis for biogas and woody biomasses feedstocks in particular a large area in the north eastern part of the region was identified as hotspot and therefore resulted remarkably suitable for biogas plants this zone is particularly productive and includes the reclaimed land that once formed the ancient river po delta gaglio et al 2017 gaglio et al 2019 and are nowadays included in the river po delta park in this sense the park may play an important role in promoting renewable energies with high environmental performances in protected areas where agricultural activities are present fostering circular economy and supporting local sustainable development in rural areas conversely hotspots for woody biomasses are limited however as showed in table 4 their potential exceeds the current installed power although the scattered distribution of woody crops and the large plant sizes can make pruning collection challenging as larger contributor to the regional potential pruning from vineyards should be regarded with attention and included in effective supply chains as already suggested by other studies picchi et al 2013 scarlat and dallemand 2011 spinelli et al 2012 the estimate of sustainable biogas potential is constrained by the assumptions of gathering only the 25 of total available residues and recruit vegetal matter within a 10 km radius such low fraction of residues was considered despite a default collection rate of 40 50 can be found in literature monforti et al 2015 this conservative approach was adopted in consideration of both to maintain soil functionality and use part of the straw yield for other purposes e g livestock feeding therefore potential biogas generation from residues in e r region could be even higher when following more optimistic approaches the quantification of the proper amount of residues to be left on agricultural fields as well as of the part used for different aims is needed to guarantee soil services and manage bioenergy issues finally some limitations related to the followed approach should be considered different values e g fruit grain residues ratios humidity content and agricultural yields were extracted from available databases at provincial level omitting possible variations at finer scale average values for energy conversion were used for all the study area without considering differences of technical characteristics among plants moreover it has to be specified that the analysis involved only those plants that can be surely supplied with vegetal matter based on the available information excluding the others while these limitations can be acceptable at regional scale local scale evaluations should encompass more precise data 5 conclusions this work provides a geospatial method for the development of successful residues based supply chain in agricultural environment modeling spatial distribution of es supply and demand can significantly contribute to solve the food energy dilemma in agro ecosystems an important issue in the context of sustainable development of rural areas agro ecosystems have large potential from field residues that should be firmly supported by renewable energy policies and local governances also to overcome the unsustainable consequences of growing dedicated energy crops in arable land given their uneven occurrence on the territory mapping spatial distribution of residues is fundamental to plan effective supply chains when bioenergy plants are not properly located their supply may lead to competition among plants for residues availability or force plant managers to recruit vegetal matter beyond a short radius thus reducing environmental benefits and increasing gathering costs energy planners and environmental managers should strictly consider local solutions to ensure the proper supply of agricultural resides to bioenergy plants considering at the same time other residue uses including the need to retain vegetal material on field to ensure the soil functionality and services fundings this work was partially supported by the eu project number pgi04939 delta lady floating cultures in river deltas
