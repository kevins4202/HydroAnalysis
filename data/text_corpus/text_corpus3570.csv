17850,foliar litter is an important terrestrial source of dissolved organic matter dom and disinfection byproducts dbps in the source water supply climate changes could alter precipitation patterns and hydroperiods in woody wetlands resulting in a hydrologic shift along the low elevation gradient and change the productions of doc and dbp precursors and their exports to source water here we conducted an 80 week field decomposition study using fresh fallen leaves along an elevation gradient representing well drained relatively moist and inundated environments in congaree national park south carolina the dissolved organic carbon doc yield and formation potential fp of trihalomethanes thms a dominant category of studied dbps were 48 9 79 7 mg doc g litter and 2 23 6 57 mg g litter in the freshly fallen leaf litter respectively the level of leachable dom and its dbp fp decreased with time and during the first 16 weeks of decomposition the decomposing litter served as an important source of leachable dom and dbp precursors week 28 was a turning point for dom optical properties with fewer tyrosine tryptophan soluble microbial byproduct like compounds and more aromatic humified and fulvic humic acid like compounds litterfall primarily occurred from september to january while less precipitation occurred from october to january indicating that large amounts of doc and dbp precursors could be leached from litterfall in february in the first 16 weeks of field exposure study we observed higher residual mass and lower water extractable doc and dtn in more inundated environments demonstrating that the shifts of dom composition and dbp precursors if climate reduces rainfall in the southeastern us graphical abstract image 1 keywords congaree national park litter decomposition elevation gradient leachable dissolved organic matter disinfection byproducts climate change 1 introduction more than half of the water supply in the contiguous us is derived from forested land brown et al 2008 murphy et al 2015 due to the high water quality and less expensive treatments needed in water treatment facilities cunha et al 2016 elias et al 2013 murphy et al 2015 however carcinogenic disinfection byproducts dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetonitriles hans can be formed in water treatment facilities through the reactions of dissolved organic matter dom in source water with chemical disinfectants richardson and kimura 2016 richardson et al 2007 dbp formation depends on the quantity and quality of dom hua et al 2015 tsai et al 2017 which are partially determined by dom sources nguyen et al 2013 reckhow et al 2004 zeng et al 2016 terrestrial dom movement from the forest floor to watersheds is widely considered an important source of dbp precursors beggs and summers 2011 mikkelson et al 2013 mitra et al 2000 especially during and after storm events inamdar et al 2011 majidzadeh et al 2017 yang et al 2015 litter decomposition on the forest floor is an important terrestrial source of dom and dbp precursors in forested watersheds due to the leaching of water soluble compounds from both fresh and decomposing plant residues chow et al 2009 cuss and gueguen 2013 del giudice and lindo 2017 qualls 2005 in a previous study chow et al 2009 found that litter and duff materials were significant sources of doc 29 126 mg g c and 6 5 37 mg g c respectively thms up to 4600 μg g c and hans up to 137 μg g c therefore a greater understanding of the role of litter decomposition as a source of dom and dbp precursors is fundamental for ensuring drinking water safety forest litter decomposition is an important biogeochemical process in global carbon and nitrogen cycling it contains three main processes of 1 biodegradation by decomposers 2 leaching of soluble compounds and 3 fragmenting litter into small sizes kutsch et al 2010 litter decomposition is driven by decomposing microorganisms liu et al 2016b including bacteria fungi micro invertebrates and macro invertebrates blosser 2018 meyer et al 2011 among them macro invertebrates invertebrates 2 mm in size affect litter chemistry and the composition and activity of the decomposer community and plays an important role in litter decomposition meyer et al 2011 riutta et al 2012 litter decomposes faster when placed at its home site due to the abundance of specified decomposers termed home field advantage hfa ayres et al 2009 chomel et al 2015 moreover the litter decomposition rate is affected by litter quality e g c n and lignin n and environmental conditions e g temperature and moisture keiluweit et al 2015 manzoni et al 2008 wang et al 2012 initial litter quality is a primary factor that influences litter decomposition bonanomi et al 2013 mckee et al 2016 perez suarez et al 2012 and litter with high initial quality e g lower c n and lignin n is more easily decomposed cotrufo et al 2013 the decomposition rates of wheat and maize straws increased linearly with the increase in temperature wang et al 2012 rainfall reduction under climate change was reported to inhibit the decomposition at the relatively dry sites almagro et al 2015 nevertheless its influence on the litter decomposition was rarely investigated in woody wetlands where soil water availability is not a dominant factor limiting the litter decomposition rate in addition to litter decomposition rates previous studies focused mainly on dom quality and biodegradability mastny et al 2018 found that the leaves of vascular plants eriophorum vaginatum and vaccinium myrtillus released higher amounts of easily degradable organic acids sugars and amino acids than their roots or sphagnum fallax however the chlorine activity of leached dom was randomly evaluated especially during the different stages of litter decomposition jian et al 2016 reported that the dom reactivity in forming thms was 27 8 55 7 μg mg doc and 25 4 74 9 μg mg doc during one year field decomposition of slash pine pinus elliottii and schima superba s superba leaves respectively moreover previous studies have primarily used a single plant species for litter decomposition while the natural state of leaf litter is mixed in most forests otsing et al 2018 the litter decomposition results from studies using a single species could be biased from what occurs in forest ecosystems because of the additive or nonadditive effects from litter mixing liu et al 2016a litterbags are commonly used for field litter decomposition studies their mesh sizes should be large enough for permitting the access of decomposers but small enough for reducing the physical loss of litters bell et al 2018 hence we conducted an 80 week field experiment at three decomposition sites along a water level gradient in woody wetlands by enclosing locally collected mixed species litter in litterbags the objectives of our study include 1 studying the changes in dom quantity and optical properties with decomposition time 2 examining the role of leached dom as dbp precursors at different decomposition times 3 linking dom chlorine reactivity to its optical properties and 4 estimating the yields of dom and dbp precursors from litterfall in woody wetlands 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiments congaree watershed sc has 42 955 ha of woody wetlands accounting for 24 1 of its total area table s1 we conducted an 80 week field incubation study in woody wetlands of the congaree national park sc blosser 2018 ricker et al 2016 which began in february 2011 after high monthly leaf litterfall ozalp et al 2007 fig 1 the field incubation was conducted at three decomposition sites moving from the river edge to the backswamp subsequently referred as the levee h terrace m and swamp l with a decrease in average relative elevation of 0 07 0 03 1 02 0 15 and 1 62 0 11 m respectively ricker et al 2016 the natural community on the levee h was dominated by a canopy of sugarberry celtis laevigata sweetgum liquidambar styraciflua box elder acer negundo and american elm ulmus americana with pawpaw asimina triloba and chinese privet ligustrum sinense common in the understory the swamp l site canopy was almost exclusively composed of baldcypress taxodium distichum with water elm planera aquatica and cottonwood populous sp as the common species in the sparse understory the transitional terrace m site contained both levee h and swamp l community species with the addition of green ash fraxinus pennsylvanica sycamore platanus occidentalis red maple acer rubrum overcup oak quercus lyrata and laurel oak quercus laurifolia as the major canopy components with american holly ilex opaca and deciduous holly ilex decidua contributing to the understory allen et al 2005 the seasonal temperatures at the sites were 10 9 c in winter december to february 19 8 c in spring march to may 28 2 c in summer june to august and 18 5 c in fall september to november fig s1 fresh leaf litter was collected from each of the three sites between mid october and mid december 2010 using suspended hammocks and then dried at room temperature litterbags for each site were filled with approximately 20 g of air dried leaves specific to the site the litterbags were made of nylon 30 45 cm in size with a mesh opening of 6 mm at the top and 2 mm at the bottom a total of 39 litterbags were placed flat at each site and their corners were secured to the ground to prevent movement blosser 2018 we randomly collected three litterbags from each site at 0 2 4 6 8 12 16 22 28 38 48 64 and 80 weeks table s2 the collected litterbags were oven dried at 70 c for 48 h and litter mass was calculated by multiplying the oven dried weight with a correction factor of air oven dried weight which was initially determined from six bags from each site in addition litterfall was collected from february 2011 to december 2012 at twenty plots 20 m 25 m including five plots at the levee h ten plots at the terrace m and five plots at the swamp l to examine the dynamics and amounts of leaf litterfall liu et al 2017b each plot had five 0 25 m2 litter boxes 2 2 chemical analysis a mixture of 0 15 g oven dried litter with 15 ml milli q water was shaken for 2 h centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 2 min and then filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter millipore express the filtrate or water extract was kept at 4 c in the dark for less than 48 h before further analyses the water extracts were measured by a shimadzu toc tn analyzer for doc and dissolved total nitrogen dtn levels a shimadzu uv 1800 for uv absorbance and a shimadzu spectrofluorometer rf5301 for fluorescence emission excitation matrix eem the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 l mg c m and the e2 e3 ratio were determined by dividing the uv absorbance at 254 nm by doc and the uv absorbance at 365 nm peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 respectively the humification index hix was obtained by dividing the peak area under emission wavelengths em 435 480 nm by the peak area under em 300 345 nm at excitation wavelength ex 254 nm ohno 2002 the fluorescence index fi is the ratio of fluorescence intensity at em 470 nm 520 nm at ex 370 nm and was used to differentiate the dom origins i e terrestrial 1 2 or microbial origins 1 8 cory and mcknight 2005 the fluorescence regional integration based on simpson s rule operationally divided eem into five regions of i tyrosine like proteins ii tryptophan like proteins iii fulvic acid like organics iv soluble microbial byproducts and v humic acid like organics the fluorescence response in region i pi n was obtained by dividing the area normalized volume in region i by that in all five regions chen et al 2003 zhou et al 2013 a disinfection formation potential fp test wang et al 2015 was used to evaluate the chlorine reactivity of water extracts water extracts were diluted to a doc concentration of 3 mg l buffered to ph 8 0 h3bo3 naoh and chlorinated with freshly prepared naocl h3bo3 ph 8 0 at 25 c in the dark for 24 h without headspace the chlorine dose was calculated as cl2 3 doc 7 6 nh4 10 krasner et al 2004 the resulting solution was quenched by 10 na2so3 extracted by mtbe and quantified by gc ecd agilent 7890 for four thms including trichloro chcl3 tcm dichlorobromo chbrcl2 dcbm dibromochloro chbr2cl dbcm and tribromo chbr3 tbm methanes four hans including trichloro c2cl3n

trichloro c3h3cl3o tcp propanones and chloral hydrate c2h3cl3o2 chd the minimum reporting levels mrls for all dbps were approximately 0 1 0 3 μg l to determine dom reactivity in forming dbps we calculated the specific dbp fp sdbp fp μg dbp mg doc as dividing the dbp concentration μg dbp l by the doc concentration mg l the dbp fps in the decomposing litter μg dbp g litter were calculated by multiplying sdbp fp μg dbp mg doc by the doc content in the litter mg doc g litter 2 3 data analysis rstudio desktop version 1 2 1335 boston ma usa was used in this study for statistical analyses and data visualization decomposition rates and half lives were calculated using eq 2 and eq 3 respectively li and ye 2014 ranjbar and jalali 2012 a paired t test or wilson test when the difference was not normally distributed was employed to test the difference in the remaining mass percentages between each two of three different decomposition sites principal component analysis was employed to describe the linkages between dom optical properties and its chlorine activities among samples the correlation coefficients and p values were calculated in the correlation matrix eq 1 p r t w t w 0 100 eq 2 k ln p r t t eq 3 t 1 2 ln 2 k where t is decomposition week week w t is litter mass at t g w 0 is original litter mass g pr t is the percentage of remaining litter mass at t k is decomposition rate week 1 and t 1 2 is decomposition time required for decomposing half of original litter mass week 3 results and discussion 3 1 mass losses and dom quantity after the 80 week incubation only 0 68 3 13 of the original mass remained fig 2 a indicating that almost all the litter mass had been completely decomposed during the incubation the remaining mass at the swamp l was significantly higher p 0 05 than that at both terrace m and levee h while there was no difference in the remaining mass between the terrace m and levee h fig 2a the decomposition rate was 0 038 week 1 at the swamp l 0 044 week 1 at the terrace m and 0 053 week 1 at the levee h and the corresponding decomposition half lives were 18 2 15 6 and 13 2 weeks table s3 the decomposition at swamp l where the elevation was relatively low was possibly hindered by anaerobic conditions due to more prolonged inundation blosser 2018 studies almagro et al 2015 castanha et al 2018 presented that the reduction in soil moisture responding to climate change slowed litter decomposition in water limited ecosystems our result suggests that drier soil conditions at the swamp l under rainfall reductions induced by climate change could increase the litter decomposition rates mass loss was relatively higher between the 12th and 38th weeks possibly due to higher ambient temperature during this period fig s2a previous studies also showed that increased temperature under climate change favored litter decomposition gregorich et al 2017 liu et al 2017a zhang et al 2017 leachable doc and dtn yields decreased with time and these decrease rates depended on the decomposition stage specifically the doc yield from the remaining litter presented a sharp decrease from 48 9 to 80 0 mg doc g litter at week 0 february to 12 4 19 0 mg doc g litter at week 16 may decreasing slightly to 9 27 10 1 mg doc g litter at week 80 august fig 2b monthly and annual litterfall at the congaree national park floodplain sites were 186 2360 and 7960 kg dry mass ha respectively fig 1 and table s4 a rough estimate of leachable doc in fresh fallen litter from woody wetlands at congaree national park was 12 0 153 kg ha month and 515 kg ha year this annual doc yield was higher than 347 128 and 304 80 8 kg ha year from pine and oak throughfall in sc respectively as reported in our previous study chen et al 2019 the doc and dtn yields from the collected litter samples during weeks 0 16 were relatively low at the swamp l compared to those in the other two sites this result may due to the increased mass loss of leachable dom under the prolonged inundation at the swamp l the decrease in doc yields with decomposition time was a response to the decline in the water solubility of organic compounds in the remaining litter compounds with low water solubility or high octanol water constants are generally less readily biodegradable tanikawa et al 2018 also observed that the decrease of doc in leaf leachates with the incubation weeks was more rapid in the early stage the dtn yield from the remaining litter showed a reduction from 1 27 to 1 81 mg dtn g litter at week 0 to 0 92 1 17 mg dtn g litter at week 80 fig 2c this decrease was a net outcome of litter decomposition by decomposers n2 fixation and n transportation from soil to litter cusack et al 2009 our study suggests that leachable dom is a relatively more abundant fraction in the fresh and decomposing litter in the early stage compared to decomposing litter in the later stage additionally we found that doc mg doc g litter and dtn mg dtn g litter were not related to the litter c and n content table s5 possibly due to the great changes in the water solubility or distribution constant e g the octanol water constant of litter organic matter lom 3 2 dom optical properties the dom c n molar ratio sharply decreased from 42 2 64 9 at week 0 to 16 0 19 3 at week 12 april and then slightly reduced to 10 1 11 7 at week 80 fig 3 a suva254 widely considered a good indicator of aromatic carbon content ates et al 2007 karanfil et al 2002 weishaar et al 2003 changed slightly p 0 05 from 1 11 1 55 l mg c m at week 0 to 0 96 1 60 l mg c m at week 80 with a range of 0 92 2 08 l mg c m during decomposition fig 3b similarly e2 e3 changed insignificantly p 0 05 from 3 58 5 36 at week 0 to 3 79 4 79 at week 80 with a range of 2 86 5 36 during decomposition fig 3c we observed relatively high e2 e3 values at the swamp l compared to those at the other two sites this result indicates that the leachable dom at the swamp l comprised of compounds with a relatively lower molecular weight mw the tendency of e2 e3 with decomposition time was similar among three sites indicating that the e2 e3 values during decomposition primarily depends on initial litter quality the initial litter quality was determined by tree species community at each site modified by the microclimatic conditions kovacs et al 2017 the lack of significant changes in dom aromaticity indicated by suva254 and mw indicated by e2 e3 was in contrast to the traditional view of increasing aromaticity and molecular weight during decomposition klotzbucher et al 2013 more aromatic and higher molecular compounds are usually found in aged leaf leachates than in the leachates of fresh leaves jian et al 2016 although suva254 in field litter decomposition generally decreased by photodegradation and increased by biodegradation chow et al 2013 jian et al 2016 photodegradation was limited at the study sites which are under dense forest canopies the lack of significant changes in suva254 and e2 e3 suggests that the dom aromaticity and size did not significantly change with decomposition time during the decomposition of local mixed species litter the hix value increased from 0 34 0 60 at week 0 to 1 67 2 07 at week 28 august and then decreased to 0 52 0 98 at week 80 fig 3d in general a high hix is related to a high degree of humification fellman et al 2010 lavonen et al 2015 ohno 2002 reported hix values of 1 33 0 03 in non or less humified dom from plant residues 5 18 0 22 in soil water soluble dom and 15 9 5 9 in soil fulvic acid the hix values indicate that leachable dom at week 0 was non or less humified from plant materials and intensive humification activities occurred during the first 28 weeks fi decreased and then increased from 1 58 1 98 at week 0 to 1 40 1 67 at week 80 fig 3e indicating that the microbial originated compounds dominated in dom at the beginning and end of decomposition it is interesting that a turning point occurred at week 28 for all five components from the eem indicating the different decomposition processes for the fluorescent compounds between weeks 0 28 and weeks 28 80 we observed decreasing and then increasing tendencies for tyrosine like proteins region i fig 3f tryptophan like proteins region ii fig 3g and soluble microbial byproducts region iv fig 3i while fulvic region iii fig 3h and humic acid like region v fig 3j organics presented increasing and then decreasing tendencies generally from week 0 to week 80 we found an increase in fulvic acid like organics region iii from 10 0 13 5 to 15 3 20 2 and a decrease in tryptophan like proteins region ii from 17 9 20 4 to 12 8 13 8 and soluble microbial byproducts region iv from 27 5 31 5 to 20 9 21 9 the fulvic and humic acid like regions iii and v organics are hypothesized to be relatively refractory to biodegradation guo et al 2014 jia et al 2013 our study indicates increasing resistance with decomposition time for leachable dom at weeks 0 28 kiikkila et al 2013 mastny et al 2018 these results are similar to those of previous studies for example jian et al 2016 observed higher protein content in fresh leaf leachates compared to aged leaf leachates they also reported an increase in humic substances and a decrease in protein like substances with incubation weeks zhang et al 2018 concluded that there was a release of readily biodegradable substances such as tyrosine like and then fulvic and humic acid like refractory organics to the water during myriophyllum verticillatum decomposition interestingly we observed that the relative percentages of fulvic and humic acid like regions iii and v organics decreased with decomposition time in the leachable dom at weeks 28 80 indicating these recalcitrant organics as a relatively dominant carbon source for microbial growth at the late decomposition stage 3 3 dom chlorine reactivity the formed dbps mg g litter were dominated by thms and presented a decreasing formation tendency with decomposition time thm fps and han fps decreased from 2 23 6 57 and 0 34 0 62 mg g litter at week 0 to 0 16 0 42 and 0 04 0 07 mg g litter at week 80 respectively fig 4 as expected the fps of all studied dbps had significant and strong correlations p 0 05 and r 0 50 table s5 with both doc mg doc g litter and dtn mg dtn g litter the category of thms was dominated by tcm chcl3 88 8 95 8 while the category of han was mainly composed of dban c2hbr2n 34 9 64 1 and dcan c2hcl2n 18 5 49 6 fig s3 the 11dcp c3h4cl2o in the category of htks was not detected in any of the samples in contrast to the formed dbps mg g litter dom reactivity in forming dbps μg mg doc did not show an increasing or decreasing tendency with decomposition time however we found obvious tendencies in the optical properties of the leachable dom after 80 weeks of decomposition the average dom chlorine reactivity μg mg doc decreased for thms 57 6 vs 35 7 and chd 10 9 vs 5 07 but changed slightly for hans 7 36 vs 7 03 and htks 1 34 vs 1 49 our previous study chen et al 2019 reported dom chlorine reactivities of 52 7 58 6 μg thms mg doc 0 64 0 82 μg hans mg doc 0 22 0 59 μg htks mg doc and 4 20 4 51 μg chd mg doc in pine and oak throughfall this result indicates that the chlorine reactivity of litterfall was generally higher than those of the pine and oak throughfall a rough estimate of thm fps in fresh fallen litter from woody wetlands at congaree national park was 0 72 9 21 kg ha month and 31 1 kg ha year this chlorine reactivity of litterfall in forming dbps was generally higher related to 18 3 kg ha year and 17 8 kg ha year from pine and oak throughfall respectively chen et al 2019 the leachable dom in the samples at week 0 from the levee h and terrace m sites had higher reactivity in forming chd and thms respectively compared to other samples the leachable dom chlorine reactivity in the fresh litter was related to the litter species this result suggests that litter from the levee h and terrace m site had relatively high dom reactivity in forming chd and thms respectively compared to litter from the other sites in addition we observed the relatively high sthm fps at the terrace m along with the decomposition shan fps were relatively high at the terrace m during weeks 0 48 and increased from levee h to terrace m and then swamp l during weeks 64 80 our study showed relatively high shan fps compared to other previously reported values such as 1 08 1 87 μg mg doc chow et al 2009 and 0 1 2 5 μg mg doc jian et al 2016 possibly due to the relatively high fraction of n containing dom shtk fps at the levee h increased from week 0 to week 28 and then decreased to week 80 whereas shtk fps were relatively low at the terrace m during weeks 8 28 dbp fps and sdbp fps presented here would not be the same as those downstream entering drinking water facilities due to the biogeochemical processes such as sunlight irradiation and microbial degradation during storage and transport chow et al 2008 2013 the changes from these biogeochemical alterations could be estimated through modeling du et al 2019 ligaray et al 2016 3 4 principal component analysis using principal component analysis on optical properties and sdbp fps in the leachable dom the first two components explained 47 9 and 17 5 of the total variance respectively fig 4 the variables of pi n pii n and piv n had high negative loadings 0 50 in the first principal component pc1 while high positive loadings 0 50 in pc1 were observed for suva254 hix piii n pv n and shan fps table s6 similarly loadings 0 50 in the second principal component pc2 were found for sthm fps shan fps and schd fp while e2 e3 had positive loading 0 50 in pc2 correlation analysis also indicated that the parameter of sthm fps was positively and strongly related to shan fps r 0 52 p 0 05 table s5 based on the loadings of optical properties and sdbp fps we interpreted the negative pc1 as tyrosine tryptophan soluble microbial byproduct like components the positive pc1 was explained as aromatic humified and fulvic humic acid like compounds with high reactivity in forming hans the negative pc2 reflected compounds with high reactivity in forming thms hans and chd while the positive pc2 was considered low molecular weight lmw compounds according to their scores the samples were roughly separated into four clusters of week 0 week 8 week 28 and other weeks weeks 16 and 48 80 with the increase in pc1 scores in the order of week 0 week 8 other weeks week 28 this finding suggests that the leachable dom at week 0 contained more tyrosine tryptophan soluble microbial byproduct like compounds while the leachable dom at week 28 was composed of more aromatic humified and fulvic humic acid like compounds based on the principal component analysis the linkage between dom chlorine reactivity and its optical properties was not clear which requires further researches using molecular level techniques for dom characterization 4 conclusions and environmental applications litter decomposition is an important source of dom in forested watersheds our study indicates that more than 90 of the original mixed species litter mass was lost after 80 weeks in the field the remaining mass at the swamp l with the lowest elevation was relatively higher than p 0 05 that at the terrace m and levee h possibly due to the decomposition being hindered by anaerobic conditions during prolonged inundation it suggests that reduced water availability under climate change could accelerate the litter decomposition in woody wetlands leachable doc mg doc g litter and dtn mg dtn g litter yields and dbp fps mg g litter in the remaining litter decreased significantly with decomposition time the result from this study suggests that litter on the forest floor during the first 16 weeks of decomposition could be an important source of leachable dom and dbp precursors specially we observed the relatively low doc and dtn yields from the litter samples collected at the swamp l during weeks 0 16 compared to the other two sites this result may be caused by the increased loss of leachable dom under the prolonged inundation at the swamp l it is interesting that week 28 was found as a turning point for the optical properties of the leachable dom at all three sites briefly the leachable dom contained fewer tyrosine tryptophan soluble microbial byproduct like compounds but more aromatic humified and fulvic humic acid like compounds at week 28 the decrease of the fulvic and humic acid like fractions in leachable dom after week 28 potentially indicates that microorganisms consumed the refractory organics primarily during the late decomposition stage sthm fps and schd fp in the fresh litter were relatively high from the levee h and terrace m site respectively indicating the influence of tree community species modified by the microclimatic conditions on dom chlorine reactivity litterfall primarily occurred from september to january with the maximum average value of 2360 773 kg dry mass ha in november at the same time we observed relatively low cumulative precipitation of 3 05 5 46 cm month in october november december and january compared to 12 0 36 9 cm month in other months thus we estimate that approximately 401 kg doc ha and 24 2 kg thms ha could be leached from litterfall in the mixed forest primarily in february due to the litterfall accumulated from october to february on the forest floor declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17850,foliar litter is an important terrestrial source of dissolved organic matter dom and disinfection byproducts dbps in the source water supply climate changes could alter precipitation patterns and hydroperiods in woody wetlands resulting in a hydrologic shift along the low elevation gradient and change the productions of doc and dbp precursors and their exports to source water here we conducted an 80 week field decomposition study using fresh fallen leaves along an elevation gradient representing well drained relatively moist and inundated environments in congaree national park south carolina the dissolved organic carbon doc yield and formation potential fp of trihalomethanes thms a dominant category of studied dbps were 48 9 79 7 mg doc g litter and 2 23 6 57 mg g litter in the freshly fallen leaf litter respectively the level of leachable dom and its dbp fp decreased with time and during the first 16 weeks of decomposition the decomposing litter served as an important source of leachable dom and dbp precursors week 28 was a turning point for dom optical properties with fewer tyrosine tryptophan soluble microbial byproduct like compounds and more aromatic humified and fulvic humic acid like compounds litterfall primarily occurred from september to january while less precipitation occurred from october to january indicating that large amounts of doc and dbp precursors could be leached from litterfall in february in the first 16 weeks of field exposure study we observed higher residual mass and lower water extractable doc and dtn in more inundated

partially determined by dom sources nguyen et al 2013 reckhow et al 2004 zeng et al 2016 terrestrial dom movement from the forest floor to watersheds is widely considered an important source of dbp precursors beggs and summers 2011 mikkelson et al 2013 mitra et al 2000 especially during and after storm events inamdar et al 2011 majidzadeh et al 2017 yang et al 2015 litter decomposition on the forest floor is an important terrestrial source of dom and dbp precursors in forested watersheds due to the leaching of water soluble compounds from both fresh and decomposing plant residues chow et al 2009 cuss and gueguen 2013 del giudice and lindo 2017 qualls 2005 in a previous study chow et al 2009 found that litter and duff materials were significant sources of doc 29 126 mg g c and 6 5 37 mg g c respectively thms up to 4600 μg g c and hans up to 137 μg g c therefore a greater understanding of the role of litter decomposition as a source of dom and dbp precursors is fundamental for ensuring drinking water safety forest litter decomposition is an important biogeochemical process in global carbon and nitrogen cycling it contains three main processes of 1 biodegradation by decomposers 2 leaching of soluble compounds and 3 fragmenting litter into small sizes kutsch et al 2010 litter decomposition is driven by decomposing microorganisms liu et al 2016b including bacteria fungi micro invertebrates and macro invertebrates blosser 2018 meyer et al 2011 among them macro invertebrates invertebrates 2 mm in size affect litter chemistry and the composition and activity of the decomposer community and plays an important role in litter decomposition meyer et al 2011 riutta et al 2012 litter decomposes faster when placed at its home site due to the abundance of specified decomposers termed home field advantage hfa ayres et al 2009 chomel et al 2015 moreover the litter decomposition rate is affected by litter quality e g c n and lignin n and environmental conditions e g temperature and moisture keiluweit et al 2015 manzoni et al 2008 wang et al 2012 initial litter quality is a primary factor that influences litter decomposition bonanomi et al 2013 mckee et al 2016 perez suarez et al 2012 and litter with high initial quality e g lower c n and lignin n is more easily decomposed cotrufo et al 2013 the decomposition rates of wheat and maize straws increased linearly with the increase in temperature wang et al 2012 rainfall reduction under climate change was reported to inhibit the decomposition at the relatively dry sites almagro et al 2015 nevertheless its influence on the litter decomposition was rarely investigated in woody wetlands where soil water availability is not a dominant factor limiting the litter decomposition rate in addition to litter decomposition rates previous studies focused mainly on dom quality and biodegradability mastny et al 2018 found that the leaves of vascular plants eriophorum vaginatum and vaccinium myrtillus released higher amounts of easily degradable organic acids sugars and amino acids than their roots or sphagnum fallax however the chlorine activity of leached dom was randomly evaluated especially during the different stages of litter decomposition jian et al 2016 reported that the dom reactivity in forming thms was 27 8 55 7 μg mg doc and 25 4 74 9 μg mg doc during one year field decomposition of slash pine pinus elliottii and schima superba s superba leaves respectively moreover previous studies have primarily used a single plant species for litter decomposition while the natural state of leaf litter is mixed in most forests otsing et al 2018 the litter decomposition results from studies using a single species could be biased from what occurs in forest ecosystems because of the additive or nonadditive effects from litter mixing liu et al 2016a litterbags are commonly used for field litter decomposition studies their mesh sizes should be large enough for permitting the access of decomposers but small enough for reducing the physical loss of litters bell et al 2018 hence we conducted an 80 week field experiment at three decomposition sites along a water level gradient in woody wetlands by enclosing locally collected mixed species litter in litterbags the objectives of our study include 1 studying the changes in dom quantity and optical properties with decomposition time 2 examining the role of leached dom as dbp precursors at different decomposition times 3 linking dom chlorine reactivity to its optical properties and 4 estimating the yields of dom and dbp precursors from litterfall in woody wetlands 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiments congaree watershed sc has 42 955 ha of woody wetlands accounting for 24 1 of its total area table s1 we conducted an 80 week field incubation study in woody wetlands of the congaree national park sc blosser 2018 ricker et al 2016 which began in february 2011 after high monthly leaf litterfall ozalp et al 2007 fig 1 the field incubation was conducted at three decomposition sites moving from the river edge to the backswamp subsequently referred as the levee h terrace m and swamp l with a decrease in average relative elevation of 0 07 0 03 1 02 0 15 and 1 62 0 11 m respectively ricker et al 2016 the natural community on the levee h was dominated by a canopy of sugarberry celtis laevigata sweetgum liquidambar styraciflua box elder acer negundo and american elm ulmus americana with pawpaw asimina triloba and chinese privet ligustrum sinense common in the understory the swamp l site canopy was almost exclusively composed of baldcypress taxodium distichum with water elm planera aquatica and cottonwood populous sp as the common species in the sparse understory the transitional terrace m site contained both levee h and swamp l community species with the addition of green ash fraxinus pennsylvanica sycamore platanus occidentalis red maple acer rubrum overcup oak quercus lyrata and laurel oak quercus laurifolia as the major canopy components with american holly ilex opaca and deciduous holly ilex decidua contributing to the understory allen et al 2005 the seasonal temperatures at the sites were 10 9 c in winter december to february 19 8 c in spring march to may 28 2 c in summer june to august and 18 5 c in fall september to november fig s1 fresh leaf litter was collected from each of the three sites between mid october and mid december 2010 using suspended hammocks and then dried at room temperature litterbags for each site were filled with approximately 20 g of air dried leaves specific to the site the litterbags were made of nylon 30 45 cm in size with a mesh opening of 6 mm at the top and 2 mm at the bottom a total of 39 litterbags were placed flat at each site and their corners were secured to the ground to prevent movement blosser 2018 we randomly collected three litterbags from each site at 0 2 4 6 8 12 16 22 28 38 48 64 and 80 weeks table s2 the collected litterbags were oven dried at 70 c for 48 h and litter mass was calculated by multiplying the oven dried weight with a correction factor of air oven dried weight which was initially determined from six bags from each site in addition litterfall was collected from february 2011 to december 2012 at twenty plots 20 m 25 m including five plots at the levee h ten plots at the terrace m and five plots at the swamp l to examine the dynamics and amounts of leaf litterfall liu et al 2017b each plot had five 0 25 m2 litter boxes 2 2 chemical analysis a mixture of 0 15 g oven dried litter with 15 ml milli q water was shaken for 2 h centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 2 min and then filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter millipore express the filtrate or water extract was kept at 4 c in the dark for less than 48 h before further analyses the water extracts were measured by a shimadzu toc tn analyzer for doc and dissolved total nitrogen dtn levels a shimadzu uv 1800 for uv absorbance and a shimadzu spectrofluorometer rf5301 for fluorescence emission excitation matrix eem the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 l mg c m and the e2 e3 ratio were determined by dividing the uv absorbance at 254 nm by doc and the uv absorbance at 365 nm peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 respectively the humification index hix was obtained by dividing the peak area under emission wavelengths em 435 480 nm by the peak area under em 300 345 nm at excitation wavelength ex 254 nm ohno 2002 the fluorescence index fi is the ratio of fluorescence intensity at em 470 nm 520 nm at ex 370 nm and was used to differentiate the dom origins i e terrestrial 1 2 or microbial origins 1 8 cory and mcknight 2005 the fluorescence regional integration based on simpson s rule operationally divided eem into five regions of i tyrosine like proteins ii tryptophan like proteins iii fulvic acid like organics iv soluble microbial byproducts and v humic acid like organics the fluorescence response in region i pi n was obtained by dividing the area normalized volume in region i by that in all five regions chen et al 2003 zhou et al 2013 a disinfection formation potential fp test wang et al 2015 was used to evaluate the chlorine reactivity of water extracts water extracts were diluted to a doc concentration of 3 mg l buffered to ph 8 0 h3bo3 naoh and chlorinated with freshly prepared naocl h3bo3 ph 8 0 at 25 c in the dark for 24 h without headspace the chlorine dose was calculated as cl2 3 doc 7 6 nh4 10 krasner et al 2004 the resulting solution was quenched by 10 na2so3 extracted by mtbe and quantified by gc ecd agilent 7890 for four thms including trichloro chcl3 tcm dichlorobromo chbrcl2 dcbm dibromochloro chbr2cl dbcm and tribromo chbr3 tbm methanes four hans including trichloro c2cl3n

calculated the specific dbp fp sdbp fp μg dbp mg doc as dividing the dbp concentration μg dbp l by the doc concentration mg l the dbp fps in the decomposing litter μg dbp g litter were calculated by multiplying sdbp fp μg dbp mg doc by the doc content in the litter mg doc g litter 2 3 data analysis rstudio desktop version 1 2 1335 boston ma usa was used in this study for statistical analyses and data visualization decomposition rates and half lives were calculated using eq 2 and eq 3 respectively li and ye 2014 ranjbar and jalali 2012 a paired t test or wilson test when the difference was not normally distributed was employed to test the difference in the remaining mass percentages between each two of three different decomposition sites principal component analysis was employed to describe the linkages between dom optical properties and its chlorine activities among samples the correlation coefficients and p values were calculated in the correlation matrix eq 1 p r t w t w 0 100 eq 2 k ln p r t t eq 3 t 1 2 ln 2 k where t is decomposition week week w t is litter mass at t g w 0 is original litter mass g pr t is the percentage of remaining litter mass at t k is decomposition rate week 1 and t 1 2 is decomposition time required for decomposing half of original litter mass week 3 results and discussion 3 1 mass losses and dom quantity after the 80 week incubation only 0 68 3 13 of the original mass remained fig 2 a indicating that almost all the litter mass had been completely decomposed during the incubation the remaining mass at the swamp l was significantly higher p 0 05 than that at both terrace m and levee h while there was no difference in the remaining mass between the terrace m and levee h fig 2a the decomposition rate was 0 038 week 1 at the swamp l 0 044 week 1 at the terrace m and 0 053 week 1 at the levee h and the corresponding decomposition half lives were 18 2 15 6 and 13 2 weeks table s3 the decomposition at swamp l where the elevation was relatively low was possibly hindered by anaerobic conditions due to more prolonged inundation blosser 2018 studies almagro et al 2015 castanha et al 2018 presented that the reduction in soil moisture responding to climate change slowed litter decomposition in water limited ecosystems our result suggests that drier soil conditions at the swamp l under rainfall reductions induced by climate change could increase the litter decomposition rates mass loss was relatively higher between the 12th and 38th weeks possibly due to higher ambient temperature during this period fig s2a previous studies also showed that increased temperature under climate change favored litter decomposition gregorich et al 2017 liu et al 2017a zhang et al 2017 leachable doc and dtn yields decreased with time and these decrease rates depended on the decomposition stage specifically the doc yield from the remaining litter presented a sharp decrease from 48 9 to 80 0 mg doc g litter at week 0 february to 12 4 19 0 mg doc g litter at week 16 may decreasing slightly to 9 27 10 1 mg doc g litter at week 80 august fig 2b monthly and annual litterfall at the congaree national park floodplain sites were 186 2360 and 7960 kg dry mass ha respectively fig 1 and table s4 a rough estimate of leachable doc in fresh fallen litter from woody wetlands at congaree national park was 12 0 153 kg ha month and 515 kg ha year this annual doc yield was higher than 347 128 and 304 80 8 kg ha year from pine and oak throughfall in sc respectively as reported in our previous study chen et al 2019 the doc and dtn yields from the collected litter samples during weeks 0 16 were relatively low at the swamp l compared to those in the other two sites this result may due to the increased mass loss of leachable dom under the prolonged inundation at the swamp l the decrease in doc yields with decomposition time was a response to the decline in the water solubility of organic compounds in the remaining litter compounds with low water solubility or high octanol water constants are generally less readily biodegradable tanikawa et al 2018 also observed that the decrease of doc in leaf leachates with the incubation weeks was more rapid in the early stage the dtn yield from the remaining litter showed a reduction from 1 27 to 1 81 mg dtn g litter at week 0 to 0 92 1 17 mg dtn g litter at week 80 fig 2c this decrease was a net outcome of litter decomposition by decomposers n2 fixation and n transportation from soil to litter cusack et al 2009 our study suggests that leachable dom is a relatively more abundant fraction in the fresh and decomposing litter in the early stage compared to decomposing litter in the later stage additionally we found that doc mg doc g litter and dtn mg dtn g litter were not related to the litter c and n content table s5 possibly due to the great changes in the water solubility or distribution constant e g the octanol water constant of litter organic matter lom 3 2 dom optical properties the dom c n molar ratio sharply decreased from 42 2 64 9 at week 0 to 16 0 19 3 at week 12 april and then slightly reduced to 10 1 11 7 at week 80 fig 3 a suva254 widely considered a good indicator of aromatic carbon content ates et al 2007 karanfil et al 2002 weishaar et al 2003 changed slightly p 0 05 from 1 11 1 55 l mg c m at week 0 to 0 96 1 60 l mg c m at week 80 with a range of 0 92 2 08 l mg c m during decomposition fig 3b similarly e2 e3 changed insignificantly p 0 05 from 3 58 5 36 at week 0 to 3 79 4 79 at week 80 with a range of 2 86 5 36 during decomposition fig 3c we observed relatively high e2 e3 values at the swamp l compared to those at the other two sites this result indicates that the leachable dom at the swamp l comprised of compounds with a relatively lower molecular weight mw the tendency of e2 e3 with decomposition time was similar among three sites indicating that the e2 e3 values during decomposition primarily depends on initial litter quality the initial litter quality was determined by tree species community at each site modified by the microclimatic conditions kovacs et al 2017 the lack of significant changes in dom aromaticity indicated by suva254 and mw indicated by e2 e3 was in contrast to the traditional view of increasing aromaticity and molecular weight during decomposition klotzbucher et al 2013 more aromatic and higher molecular compounds are usually found in aged leaf leachates than in the leachates of fresh leaves jian et al 2016 although suva254 in field litter decomposition generally decreased by photodegradation and increased by biodegradation chow et al 2013 jian et al 2016 photodegradation was limited at the study sites which are under dense forest canopies the lack of significant changes in suva254 and e2 e3 suggests that the dom aromaticity and size did not significantly change with decomposition time during the decomposition of local mixed species litter the hix value increased from 0 34 0 60 at week 0 to 1 67 2 07 at week 28 august and then decreased to 0 52 0 98 at week 80 fig 3d in general a high hix is related to a high degree of humification fellman et al 2010 lavonen et al 2015 ohno 2002 reported hix values of 1 33 0 03 in non or less humified dom from plant residues 5 18 0 22 in soil water soluble dom and 15 9 5 9 in soil fulvic acid the hix values indicate that leachable dom at week 0 was non or less humified from plant materials and intensive humification activities occurred during the first 28 weeks fi decreased and then increased from 1 58 1 98 at week 0 to 1 40 1 67 at week 80 fig 3e indicating that the microbial originated compounds dominated in dom at the beginning and end of decomposition it is interesting that a turning point occurred at week 28 for all five components from the eem indicating the different decomposition processes for the fluorescent compounds between weeks 0 28 and weeks 28 80 we observed decreasing and then increasing tendencies for tyrosine like proteins region i fig 3f tryptophan like proteins region ii fig 3g and soluble microbial byproducts region iv fig 3i while fulvic region iii fig 3h and humic acid like region v fig 3j organics presented increasing and then decreasing tendencies generally from week 0 to week 80 we found an increase in fulvic acid like organics region iii from 10 0 13 5 to 15 3 20 2 and a decrease in tryptophan like proteins region ii from 17 9 20 4 to 12 8 13 8 and soluble microbial byproducts region iv from 27 5 31 5 to 20 9 21 9 the fulvic and humic acid like regions iii and v organics are hypothesized to be relatively refractory to biodegradation guo et al 2014 jia et al 2013 our study indicates increasing resistance with decomposition time for leachable dom at weeks 0 28 kiikkila et al 2013 mastny et al 2018 these results are similar to those of previous studies for example jian et al 2016 observed higher protein content in fresh leaf leachates compared to aged leaf leachates they also reported an increase in humic substances and a decrease in protein like substances with incubation weeks zhang et al 2018 concluded that there was a release of readily biodegradable substances such as tyrosine like and then fulvic and humic acid like refractory organics to the water during myriophyllum verticillatum decomposition interestingly we observed that the relative percentages of fulvic and humic acid like regions iii and v organics decreased with decomposition time in the leachable dom at weeks 28 80 indicating these recalcitrant organics as a relatively dominant carbon source for microbial growth at the late decomposition stage 3 3 dom chlorine reactivity the formed dbps mg g litter were dominated by thms and presented a decreasing formation tendency with decomposition time thm fps and han fps decreased from 2 23 6 57 and 0 34 0 62 mg g litter at week 0 to 0 16 0 42 and 0 04 0 07 mg g litter at week 80 respectively fig 4 as expected the fps of all studied dbps had significant and strong correlations p 0 05 and r 0 50 table s5 with both doc mg doc g litter and dtn mg dtn g litter the category of thms was dominated by tcm chcl3 88 8 95 8 while the category of han was mainly composed of dban c2hbr2n 34 9 64 1 and dcan c2hcl2n 18 5 49 6 fig s3 the 11dcp c3h4cl2o in the category of htks was not detected in any of the samples in contrast to the formed dbps mg g litter dom reactivity in forming dbps μg mg doc did not show an increasing or decreasing tendency with decomposition time however we found obvious tendencies in the optical properties of the leachable dom after 80 weeks of decomposition the average dom chlorine reactivity μg mg doc decreased for thms 57 6 vs 35 7 and chd 10 9 vs 5 07 but changed slightly for hans 7 36 vs 7 03 and htks 1 34 vs 1 49 our previous study chen et al 2019 reported dom chlorine reactivities of 52 7 58 6 μg thms mg doc 0 64 0 82 μg hans mg doc 0 22 0 59 μg htks mg doc and 4 20 4 51 μg chd mg doc in pine and oak throughfall this result indicates that the chlorine reactivity of litterfall was generally higher than those of the pine and oak throughfall a rough estimate of thm fps in fresh fallen litter from woody wetlands at congaree national park was 0 72 9 21 kg ha month and 31 1 kg ha year this chlorine reactivity of litterfall in forming dbps was generally higher related to 18 3 kg ha year and 17 8 kg ha year from pine and oak throughfall respectively chen et al 2019 the leachable dom in the samples at week 0 from the levee h and terrace m sites had higher reactivity in forming chd and thms respectively compared to other samples the leachable dom chlorine reactivity in the fresh litter was related to the litter species this result suggests that litter from the levee h and terrace m site had relatively high dom reactivity in forming chd and thms respectively compared to litter from the other sites in addition we observed the relatively high sthm fps at the terrace m along with the decomposition shan fps were relatively high at the terrace m during weeks 0 48 and increased from levee h to terrace m and then swamp l during weeks 64 80 our study showed relatively high shan fps compared to other previously reported values such as 1 08 1 87 μg mg doc chow et al 2009 and 0 1 2 5 μg mg doc jian et al 2016 possibly due to the relatively high fraction of n containing dom shtk fps at the levee h increased from week 0 to week 28 and then decreased to week 80 whereas shtk fps were relatively low at the terrace m during weeks 8 28 dbp fps and sdbp fps presented here would not be the same as those downstream entering drinking water facilities due to the biogeochemical processes such as sunlight irradiation and microbial degradation during storage and transport chow et al 2008 2013 the changes from these biogeochemical alterations could be estimated through modeling du et al 2019 ligaray et al 2016 3 4 principal component analysis using principal component analysis on optical properties and sdbp fps in the leachable dom the first two components explained 47 9 and 17 5 of the total variance respectively fig 4 the variables of pi n pii n and piv n had high negative loadings 0 50 in the first principal component pc1 while high positive loadings 0 50 in pc1 were observed for suva254 hix piii n pv n and shan fps table s6 similarly loadings 0 50 in the second principal component pc2 were found for sthm fps shan fps and schd fp while e2 e3 had positive loading 0 50 in pc2 correlation analysis also indicated that the parameter of sthm fps was positively and strongly related to shan fps r 0 52 p 0 05 table s5 based on the loadings of optical properties and sdbp fps we interpreted the negative pc1 as tyrosine tryptophan soluble microbial byproduct like components the positive pc1 was explained as aromatic humified and fulvic humic acid like compounds with high reactivity in forming hans the negative pc2 reflected compounds with high reactivity in forming thms hans and chd while the positive pc2 was considered low molecular weight lmw compounds according to their scores the samples were roughly separated into four clusters of week 0 week 8 week 28 and other weeks weeks 16 and 48 80 with the increase in pc1 scores in the order of week 0 week 8 other weeks week 28 this finding suggests that the leachable dom at week 0 contained more tyrosine tryptophan soluble microbial byproduct like compounds while the leachable dom at week 28 was composed of more aromatic humified and fulvic humic acid like compounds based on the principal component analysis the linkage between dom chlorine reactivity and its optical properties was not clear which requires further researches using molecular level techniques for dom characterization 4 conclusions and environmental applications litter decomposition is an important source of dom in forested watersheds our study indicates that more than 90 of the original mixed species litter mass was lost after 80 weeks in the field the remaining mass at the swamp l with the lowest elevation was relatively higher than p 0 05 that at the terrace m and levee h possibly due to the decomposition being hindered by anaerobic conditions during prolonged inundation it suggests that reduced water availability under climate change could accelerate the litter decomposition in woody wetlands leachable doc mg doc g litter and dtn mg dtn g litter yields and dbp fps mg g litter in the remaining litter decreased significantly with decomposition time the result from this study suggests that litter on the forest floor during the first 16 weeks of decomposition could be an important source of leachable dom and dbp precursors specially we observed the relatively low doc and dtn yields from the litter samples collected at the swamp l during weeks 0 16 compared to the other two sites this result may be caused by the increased loss of leachable dom under the prolonged inundation at the swamp l it is interesting that week 28 was found as a turning point for the optical properties of the leachable dom at all three sites briefly the leachable dom contained fewer tyrosine tryptophan soluble microbial byproduct like compounds but more aromatic humified and fulvic humic acid like compounds at week 28 the decrease of the fulvic and humic acid like fractions in leachable dom after week 28 potentially indicates that microorganisms consumed the refractory organics primarily during the late decomposition stage sthm fps and schd fp in the fresh litter were relatively high from the levee h and terrace m site respectively indicating the influence of tree community species modified by the microclimatic conditions on dom chlorine reactivity litterfall primarily occurred from september to january with the maximum average value of 2360 773 kg dry mass ha in november at the same time we observed relatively low cumulative precipitation of 3 05 5 46 cm month in october november december and january compared to 12 0 36 9 cm month in other months thus we estimate that approximately 401 kg doc ha and 24 2 kg thms ha could be leached from litterfall in the mixed forest primarily in february due to the litterfall accumulated from october to february on the forest floor declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17851,aerobic granular sludge ags technology is an alternative to conventional activated sludge to reduce the process footprint and energy consumption strategies for the efficient management of its produced biomass that is grown in a granular morphology as well need further development anaerobic digestion ad is commonly applied in waste activated sludge was treatment and is a potential option also for produced ags treatment in earlier studies the biochemical methane potential of ags was found lower than that of was both grown in full scale municipal wastewater treatment systems in order to understand this difference this study aimed to investigate the anaerobic conversion of structural extracellular polymeric substances seps which is a type of gel forming biopolymer being responsible for the aggregation of sludge using was and ags as substrates a comparative ad batch experiment was performed for 44 days during which the seps fraction was extracted from both types of sludge the changes in the seps chemical composition was analysed by fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy and three dimensional excitation and emission matrix analysis in addition the mechanical strength of hydrogels of extracted polymers cross linked with ca2 ions was investigated by dynamic mechanical analysis results showed that the amount of seps was reduced by 26 in ags sepsags and by 41 in was sepswas respectively polysaccharides and to a lesser extent the proteins in the sepsags were more refractory compared to those in sepswas this resulted in a lower loss of the gel stiffness of sepsags than that of sepswas during the ad process moreover the release of seps from tightly bound eps to loosely bound eps were observed in both types of sludge but that in ags exhibited a lower transition rate the observed properties explain the distinct differences in anaerobic biodegradability the slower decomposition of the sludge structure as well as the better dewaterability of ags as compared to

types the ags that can be periodically withdrawn from the reactor mainly granules 70 particle size 0 5 mm and the aerobic granular sludge selection spill particle size 0 5 mm a more flocculent biomass that is wasted every process cycle presenting lower settling velocity than big granules pronk et al 2015 very recent research has shown that the selection spill was easily biodegradable in ad guo et al 2020 while the ags showed a biochemical methane potential bmp that was significantly lower than was bernat et al 2017 del rio et al 2011 del rio et al 2014 it was demonstrated that the high digestibility of the selection spill was due to the low settle ability of highly biodegradable cellulose like fibres however the reason for the lower digestibility of ags compared to was remained unclear guo et al 2020 observed that proteins and carbohydrates in ags were more difficult to degrade than those in was even though the amount of these two fractions was higher in ags since ags and was are mainly composed of cells exo enzymes and microbial metabolic products very likely this difference is related to the microbial organic polymeric matrix extracellular polymeric substances eps account for the majority of microbial related carbohydrates and protein fractions in both ags and was frolund et al 1996 liu and fang 2002 salama et al 2016 therefore analysing the biodegradability of the eps present in ags and was during ad will help to understand the differences in digestibility between the two sludge types based on the ability to form hydrogels eps can be divided into gel forming and non gel forming eps felz et al 2016 seviour et al 2009 the amount of gel forming eps or structural eps seps can be considerable i e 100 300 mg g vs sludge and unlike non gel forming eps seps contributes to the formation of a tertiary network structure within the sludge felz et al 2016 lin et al 2010 it is hypothesized that the different concentration organic composition and ionic gel forming properties of seps extracted from ags and activated sludge determine the sludge morphology differences of the two lin et al 2013 sam and dulekgurgen 2016 anaerobic sludge digestion starts with breaking down the sludge structure resulting in the deterioration of sludge properties ye et al 2014 this enlarges the surface area of the sludge making it more accessible for the hydrolytic enzymes and thus for conversion during ad considering the amount of seps in sludge and their importance to the sludge structure the fate of these biopolymers in ad is very likely of crucial importance for the observed differences in digestion performance of ags and was as a consequence in this study batch mesophilic anaerobic digestion tests were conducted for ags and was under the same experimental conditions seps from ags sepsags and was sepswas were extracted during the experiment and their conversion characteristics regarding overall biodegradability chemical gel forming properties and spatial distribution were investigated and compared results led to a schematic representation of the seps degradation mechanism 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum and substrates the inoculum for batch tests was taken from the sludge digester of the municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp harnaschpolder den hoorn the netherlands the was was collected from the low loaded enhanced biological phosphate removal ebpr activated sludge tank at the same wwtp ags was collected from a full scale nereda reactor treating municipal wastewater garmerwolde the netherlands the influent characteristics and operational parameters of these two plants were reported elsewhere guo et al 2020 the volatile solids vs concentrations of both types of sludge were manipulated by centrifugation 5 min at 3500 g to reach to same sludge concentrations 2 2 experimental setup the anaerobic digestion batch experiments were carried out at 35 1 c in 2 l flasks for 44 days in an incubator shaker at 120 rpm innova 44 eppendorf ag germany the total volume of the mixture of inoculum and substrate was 1 8 l with an inoculum substrate ratio of 2 calculated by the dry weight of sludge vs g that was dosed into the batch reactor phosphorus buffer solution macronutrients and trace elements were dosed according to the recipes of zhang et al 2014 for each type of sludge three flasks were connected to an automatic methane potential test system ampts ii bioprocess control sweden for real time online monitoring of the accumulated methane production while three other flasks were used for periodic collection of an 80 ml sample for further analysis prior to the start of the experiment n2 was purged into each reactor for 5 min to remove oxygen from the sludge and headspace 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 eps extraction the eps was extracted from the sludge with a mild temperature na2co3 extraction method developed by felz et al 2016 in brief a sludge sample of 3 g wet weight was added into a 0 5 w v na2co3 solution up to 50 ml and subsequently stirred at 400 rpm and 80 c for 35 min followed by centrifugation at 4000 g and 4 c for 20 min the organics in the supernatant comprised the total extractable eps in addition centrifugation and a mild harsh heat method li and yang 2007 was applied to extract the stratified eps slime loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps a sludge sample of 15 g wet sludge was centrifuged at 15 000 g for 15 min at 4 c the produced supernatant was recovered as slime the solid fraction after decanting the supernatant was re suspended into a pre heated 0 05 w v nacl solution restoring the original weight and reaching a final temperature of 50 c after centrifugation at 15 000 g for 10 min at 4 c the organic matter in the supernatant was recovered as lb eps the pellet was re suspended in a 0 05 w v nacl solution restoring the original weight the mixture was heated to 60 c in a water bath for 30 min while steering it at 400 rpm hereafter it was centrifuged at 15 000 g for 15 min at 4 c the collected supernatant was regarded as tb eps 2 3 2 seps extraction the seps was isolated according to felz et al 2016 the aforementioned extracted eps were dialyzed with a dialysis membrane 3 5k mwco snakeskin thermo fisher scientific usa for 24 h against 1000 ml miliq water the ph of the dialyzed extracts was slowly adjusted to 2 2 0 05 with 1 and 0 1 m hydrochloric acid after these extracts were centrifuged at 4000 g and 4 c for 20 min the supernatant was discarded and the gel like pellet was considered to be the seps a certain amount of seps pellet obtained from the total extractable eps total extractable seps and from the stratified eps stratified seps was used for the vs analysis to measure the content of the seps fraction in the sludge wt g 100 g sludge and the rest was freeze dried and stored for further analysis 2 3 3 physicochemical analyses vs total suspended solid tss and volatile suspended solid vss were analysed according to standard protocols apha 2005 to measure the polysaccharides and proteins content of total extractable seps the freeze dried seps from a sludge sample of 3 g wet weight was solubilized in 1 m naoh to 50 ml reaching final ph of 7 5 the polysaccharide concentration was determined by phenol sulfuric acid assay using glucose sigma usa as standard dubois et al 1956 while the protein concentration was measured using a modified lowry method with bovine serum albumin sigma usa as standard frolund et al 1995 although methods for quantification of polysaccharides and proteins in seps were not fully developed the aforementioned methods are rapid and widely accepted and function as a relatively good estimator felz et al 2019b the polysaccharide and protein content in seps were then calculated based on the following equation 1 content wt g 100 g sludge c photometric method v solution w sludge 100 where cphotometric method concentration of polysaccharides or proteins determined by photometric methods mg l vsolution volume of the solution 50 ml in this study wsludge amount of the sludge sample 3 g in the current study changes in dewaterability during ad of ags and was sludge inoculum mixture were detected by a capillary suction time cst apparatus 304m triton electronics england with cst papers manufactured by the same company a normalized cst ncst method was used to eliminate the influence of solid particles lu et al 2015 volatile fatty acids vfas were measured by gas chromatography gc equipped with a flame ionization detector fid agilent 7890a usa helium was used as carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 8 ml min the column agilent 19091f 112 was 25 m 320 μm 0 5 μm injection port and oven temperatures were 240 c and 80 c respectively the particle size distribution psd of ags before and after ad process was analysed by a sieving method pronk et al 2015 while that of was at day 0 and 44 was measured by a particle size analyser bluewave microtrac germany 2 3 4 ft ir spectroscopy the original and secondary derivative ft ir spectra of total extractable seps the freeze dried solid in potassium bromide kbr pellets were recorded in the 4000 500 cm 1 region by a ft ir spectrometer cary 630 agilent usa 2 3 5 3d eem spectroscopy the prepared solution for polysaccharide and protein measurements section 2 3 3 was also used to determine the 3d eem spectra of total extractable seps these spectra were measured by a fluorescence spectrometer aqualog uv nir 800 c horiba usa wavelength ranges for excitation and emission spectra were 280 550 nm and 240 400 nm respectively both excitation and emission bandwidths were adjusted to 2 nm and the eem signals were corrected by subtracting a blank demineralized water eem fluorescence spectra were divided into four regions based on the differences of excitation emission wavelengths of organic matters aromatic protein like fulvic acid like soluble microbial by product like and humic acid like regions table s1 in supplementary material sun et al 2016 the fluorescence regional integration fri technique was utilized to calculate the fluorescent intensities of each region in all eem spectra chen et al 2003 2 3 6 gel formation property to test total extractable seps s gel forming property 10 w v freeze dried seps miliq solution was extruded into a cylinder mould 1 cm3 and sealed on both sides with a dialysis membrane mwco of 3 5 kda snakeskin usa the mould was then submersed into 3 w v cacl2 solution for 24 h to produce a ca2 seps hydrogel the mechanical stiffness of the hydrogel was measured by dynamic mechanical analysis device dma7e perkin elmer usa under the pressing force rate of 25 mn min the young s modulus represented the mechanical strength of the hydrogel and was calculated by the slope of tensile stress and extensional strain obtaining from the test felz et al 2019a 2 3 7 statistical analysis linear regression analysis for seps degradation was performed using r r core team austria significant differences in biodegradability of seps ft ir spectrum and dewaterability between ags and was were based on student s t test by means of spss statistics 25 ibm usa the significance level of probability p value was 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch anaerobic digestion of ags and was the difference in biodegradability of the sampled was and ags was assessed the characteristics of the substrate and inoculum are summarized in table 1 the inoculum sludge was characterised by a specific methanogenic activity of 0 19 g ch4 cod g vs day with acetate as the substrate to assess the degradation of the two sludge types the accumulated methane production vs and total vfas were monitored during the anaerobic digestion the results are presented in table 2 the average accumulative methane production of ags and was were both in line with prior researches guo et al 2020 del rio et al 2014 palmeiro sanchez et al 2013 besides the average vs reduction of ags and was was both in the typical range of 25 45 for sludge digestion bolzonella et al 2005 mottet et al 2010 specifically the degraded vs was 0 69 0 01 wt for ags and was 0 77 0 02 wt for was which showed that was had a higher degradation extent in vs approximately 0 08 0 01 wt than ags vfas were detected during day 0 6 of the digestion peaking at day 3 values shown in table 2 the differences in accumulated methane production and the corresponded vs reduction of the two sludge types confirmed their dissimilarity in biodegradability table 2 to minimise the impact of surface area limitation of ags compared to was the biodegradability of crushed ags and was were compared revealing comparable differences in biodegradability extent guo et al 2020 it should be mentioned that the inoculum selected in this study was taken from a full scale anaerobic digester that treats both primary sludge and was however del rio et al 2014 have proved that after long term acclimation with ags as the sole substrate the main microbial populations present were still those commonly found in digesters treating waste municipal sewage sludge thus to our understanding also this type of inoculum should be highly active and effective for ags digestion within a period of 44 days 3 2 degradation kinetics of seps changes in the total extractable seps from ags sepsags and was sepswas undergoing anaerobic digestion are shown in fig 1 the initial average seps contents in ags and was sludge inoculum mixture were 0 53 0 01 and 0 49 0 01 wt respectively or 196 6 and 179 5 mg g vssludge mixture respectively these results are in accordance with previous studies where aerobic granules represented a higher seps concentration than activated sludge lin et al 2013 sam and dulekgurgen 2016 however the total removal efficiency of sepsags 26 from 0 53 0 01 to 0 39 0 01 wt was significantly lower p value 0 038 than that from sepswas 41 from 0 49 0 02 to 0 29 0 01 wt it could be calculated that the difference in degraded seps between ags and was sludge inoculum mixture was 0 06 0 01 wt comparing this value with the removed vs content 0 08 0 01 wt the result clearly reveals that the seps is the major organic matter that differentiates the biodegradability of ags and was sepsags degradation started with a low rate from day 0 3 followed by a rapid degradation phase from day 3 21 and a slow degradation after day 21 sepswas degradation occurred with a higher rate from the start of the experiment also followed by a slow degradation phase after 21 days the degradation rate during the rapid degradation phase of sepswas and sepsags were similar respectively 0 006 and 0 005 g seps 100g sludge d additionally during the slower degradation phase the seps degradation rates of was and ags differed again respectively 0 002 and 0 0003 g seps 100g sludge d 3 3 variation of chemical composition and gel forming stiffness of seps in order to explain the differences in degradation rate and extent of the seps in was and ags the chemical and gel forming properties of the total extractable seps fractions were analysed on day 1 3 and 44 of the ad experiment 3 3 1 chemical composition the composition and degradation of polysaccharides and proteins within the extracted seps are presented in fig 2 these two organic groups form the main constituents of seps 84 of sepsags and 82 of sepswas the removal efficiencies of the extracted polysaccharides and proteins in sepswas were 62 and 33 respectively which were both higher than that of sepsags 39 and 24 respectively during 44 days ad process specifically polysaccharides and proteins in sepswas presented remarkably faster biodegradation than that in sepsags in the first three days the results reveal that the extracted organic compounds in sepswas can be more easily biodegraded in anaerobic digestion as compared to that in sepsags and thus leads to a higher degradation extent of sepswas fig 1 3 3 2 ft ir analysis to further investigate the changes in chemical structure of the seps during ad ft ir analysis was carried out fig 3 the ft ir results at wavenumbers 3000 1000 cm 1 for all seps samples displayed almost identical spectra with typical functional groups belonging to polysaccharides and proteins fig 3a and table s2 in supplementary material badireddy et al 2010 guo et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 the biodegradation of polysaccharides and proteins of seps extracted from ags and was that was presented in figs 1 and 2 was thus unnoticeable in the ft ir spectra the presence of residual polysaccharide and protein fractions after ad as shown in fig 2 resulted in the same ft ir spectrum as before since ft ir only showed the presence of certain molecular structures and not its quantities the fingerprint or anomeric region at wavenumbers 950 700 cm 1 could exhibit a more detailed signal to identify the individual organic compounds of seps compared to other regions in ft ir lin et al 2010 therefore a second derivative spectrum of the extracted seps of ags and was of this region was made fig 3b the second derivative spectrum enhances the signal in order to be able to notice small shifts in the composition of the biomolecules during ad of both sludge types in general the change in position and number of the measured peaks of sepsags after the first 3 days of anaerobic digestion was not statistically significant p value 0 75 but a substantial difference p value 0 034 was observed after 44 days of anaerobic digestion however for sepswas the positions and number of peaks already changed during the first 3 days p value 0 047 this result is consistent with the data indicating that the overall degradation of polysaccharides and proteins in sepswas started before that in sepsags fig 2 particularly peaks at 960 770 737 and 715 cm 1 could be assigned to c c c c o c and o c o stretching vibrations of glycoconjugates containing glucuronic acids tajmir riahi 1984 for both types of seps the position of these peaks remained unchanged during the anaerobic digestion however at the end of the digestion period day 44 the 737 cm 1 peak of sepsags was just lower whereas the peak belonging to sepswas disappeared completely possibly indicating that the glycoconjugates in ags were less biodegradable than that in was several researchers found that uronic acids such as glucuronic acids are important monomers predominating in the glycoconjugates of gel forming eps seviour et al 2010 felz et al 2019b for example they can act as the building blocks in the formation of hyaluronic like acid a type of extracellular substance that is capable of attracting cations and forming hydrogels felz et al 2020 the characteristics of glucuronic acid containing glycoconjugates in seps in both sludge morphologies are not fully understood more research is required to understand the precise relation between the presence of glycoconjugates and anaerobic biodegradability of sludge additionally peaks at 860 and 842 cm 1 were observed in all seps samples they could be related to the glycoconjugates containing galactose and mannose das et al 2011 sardari et al 2017 recent studies reported the existence of galactose and mannose in the eps of ags which might contribute to the gel forming property of ags seviour et al 2010 and felz et al 2019b the substantial presence of these monomeric units in the eps from activated sludge suggested their importance in the aggregation of sludge flocs dignac et al 1998 interestingly in this study the glycoconjugate peaks for the sepswas shifted to low wave numbers after 3 days while that for the sepsags samples remained unchanged even on day 44 indicating that sepsags was slower degraded than sepswas which implies that the composition of glycoconjugates in sepsags and sepswas is different 3 3 3 3d eem assays 3d eem spectroscopy was applied for characterizing the extracted seps at the different days of anaerobic digestion from ags and was fig 4 compared to conventional photometric methods eem provides more information about the presence and concentration of fluorescent organics these organic matters such as protein like substances i e aromatic and tryptophan like substance are shown to contribute to the formation of the sludge structure via surface charge adjustment zhu et al 2015 the 3d eem plots of four different regions with their corresponding possible substances are given in table s1 in supplementary material region iii soluble microbial by products had the highest fluorescence intensity with its characteristic peak indicating the tryptophan protein like substances identified at the excitation emission wavelengths ex em of 275 285 325 340 nm region iv humic like substances revealed a signal with the characteristic humic like substances peak observed at the ex em of 345 355 425 440 nm the results illustrate that irrespective of sludge type tryptophan protein like as well as humic acid like substances were dominant among the organic matter with fluorescence characteristics in seps these results were very similar as fluorescence spectra that were determined by wang et al 2009 for bound eps extracted from activated sludge during digestion the characteristic peaks belonging to the protein like substance regions region i and region iii were reduced demonstrating degradation of protein like substances however the total calculated reduction ratio of the fluorescence intensity of the protein like substance regions at day 3 and day 44 compared to day 0 was 6 2 and 14 7 for sepsags and 8 6 and 18 5 for sepswas respectively this is in accordance with the results obtained by the photometric method fig 3 reasons for the lower protein degradation efficiency in sepsags can be two fold firstly the compact structure of ags results in a lower specific surface area relative to activated sludge zheng et al 2005 it is thus speculated that this may hinder the hydrolysis of structural extracellular proteins by protease secondly as mentioned before tryptophan protein like substances dominated among the protein like substances li et al 2014 reported that the tryptophan like group was resistant to anaerobic digestion in this study the initial fluorescence intensity of the tryptophan like substance region of sepsags was higher than that of sepswas the higher content of the tryptophan like substance in sepsags results in the lower overall degradation of proteins in sepsags which is supported by the lower reduction in fluorescence intensity of region iii for sepsags during ad process in contrast to protein like substance regions the reduction in fluorescence intensity of region iv humic like substances over time was not observed suggesting that these substances were refractory to anaerobic biodegradation which is in line with results reported by ghasimi et al 2016 3 3 4 gel forming strength seps is known to be capable of forming gels with multivalent cations in a broad range of temperature and ph the viscous and elastic characteristics displayed by this biopolymer gel when undergoing deformation are regarded as a parameter to indicate the mechanical property of seps lin et al 2013 ca2 is one of the most common cations in wastewater ca2 seps ionic hydrogel could play an important role in building up the gel matrix structure in both activated sludge and aerobic granules felz et al 2016 lin et al 2013 therefore to understand the influence of seps degradation on the gel stiffness hydrogels formed from sepsags and sepswas cross linked with ca2 were made fig 5 a and subjected to a gel stiffness test in fig 5b the decreased young s modulus is shown indicating the loss of gel forming property and increased susceptibility for destruction of the mechanical structure during the ad process the young s modulus of sepsags decreased by 14 6 from 4126 455 to 3522 338 pa in average while the young s modulus of sepswas showed a much higher reduction of 30 1 2773 78 to 1939 133 pa in average which indicates that the stiffness reduction during ad is much higher for sepswas than for sepsags it has been demonstrated that some functional groups of polysaccharides and proteins such as carboxyl hydroxyl and amino acid groups can be easily bridged with ca2 in the sludge matrix resulting in the gel forming ability of eps felz et al 2019b in the present study although strong peaks of these functional groups were found in all samples extracted during the ad process of seps fig 3 these key organic fractions in sepsags showed higher resistance to anaerobic degradation than that in sepswas which eventually leads to the stronger gel forming capacity in residual sepsags this finding implies that the granular structure of ags will likely sustain during digestion to prove this assumption the shifts in particle size distribution of both types of sludge after 44 days of ad were determined and are shown in fig 6 both ags and was experienced deterioration of their particle sizes the fraction particles larger than 100 μm decreased by 30 in was while it decreased only 23 in ags the fraction above 250 μm is defined as granules de kreuk et al 2007 although this fraction in ags reduced by 30 going from 54 to only 24 during ad the fraction of big particles especially larger than 2 mm remained present in ags after 44 days ad this observation is in line with the differences in gel forming properties of sepswas and sepsags as discussed above 3 4 structural changes of seps in eps matrix this study revealed that the structural morphology of ags and was changed during the ad process besides the deterioration of sludge dewatering properties due to these structural changes lu et al 2015 novak et al 2003 the gel forming eps matrix within the sludge also weakened resulting in degradation and shifts between the different eps binding strength therefore the content of seps in slime loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps before and after ad was determined for both types of sludge as shown in fig 7 initially the slime fraction of the seps was very low the sepstb eps sepslb eps ratio was highest in the ags while both sludge types were dominated by tb eps which was in line with previous studies claiming that tb eps plays an important role in maintaining the matrix structure of both aerobic granular sludge and activated sludge chen et al 2010 yuan et al 2014 even though the content of seps in tb eps remained high a shift in seps from tb eps to lb eps was observed during ad the sepslb eps fraction increased by 23 and 25 for ags and was respectively whereas the sepstb eps fraction decreased with 13 and 20 respectively fig 7 this transition is likely due to the loss of binding capacity between seps and cations as a result of enzymatic hydrolysis yu et al 2010 in contrast the slime fraction of seps remained very low indicating that the seps that shifted from the lb eps to the slime fraction during ad might have been converted to methane during this process the presence of lb eps and tb eps are reported to exhibit different sludge dewaterability chen et al 2010 yuan et al 2014 deterioration of dewaterability during ad is associated with a shift of polymers from tb eps to lb eps ye et al 2014 in the current study a substantial difference in cst was observed between ags and was at different moments during ad fig 8 which could be explained by the larger seps shifts in was than in ags during ad we used the normalized cst method as an indicative analysis for the sludge dewaterability although this method has been accepted by several researchers to characterise dewaterability it might not be the optimal method to study dewaterability of ags the cst of ags is usually very short 16 19 s basuvaraj et al 2015 lotito et al 2014 because the free water around the granules is loosely bound however the water that is captured within the granules is not released during a cst measurement and therefore cst might not represent the overall dewaterability of ags in the current study the ags and was were both mixed with digestate the latter determined the overall suction time which was much higher than that of sole ags and was the dewaterability of digestate is determined by the particle size distribution and the polymer fraction in the matrix therefore in this research it is reasonable to compare the dewaterability of ags and was sludge inoculum mixture by cst as a qualitative parameter 3 5 seps degradation mechanism and implications in the anaerobic degradation of both sludge types considering the observed changes in seps the following mechanism is proposed for seps degradation fig 9 before the ad process the seps was mainly aggregated in tb eps and exhibited a strong gel forming capacity with cations such as ca2 nevertheless ad negatively influences the gel forming strength of the ca2 seps hydrogel due to the degradation of key polysaccharides and proteins and related to this due to the transition of seps from tb eps to lb eps the lower degradation of sepsags compared to sepswas resulted in a higher residual seps fraction in the ags structure along the entire ad process leading to a lower overall biodegradability of ags compared to was vs removal in both types of sludge during anaerobic digestion was 25 30 and therefore relatively low considering that only 25 40 of seps can be biodegraded a possible strategy for enhancing the biodegradability of sludge especially ags could be the acceleration of the decomposition or degradation of the seps structure this could be done through destructive mechanical methods such as crushing or ultrasound treatment in combination with the addition of specific enzymes targeting the seps polymers it can be speculated that this pre treatment would liberate biodegradable compounds of the seps matrix leading to enhanced methane production besides the gel forming seps are useful biopolymers in industrial applications lin et al 2015 and recovery of seps from ags is studied at pilot scale kaumera royal haskoningdhv the netherlands the extraction process for seps can be regarded as an effective pre treatment method to entirely destroy the sludge matrix and remove the non easily biodegradable seps polymers from the sludge simultaneously the methane production after seps extraction and the application potential of seps extraction ad for ags treatment requires further investigation 4 conclusions seps isolated from ags and was followed similar degradation steps 1 degradation of polysaccharides and proteins 2 reduction of hydrogel stiffness 3 transition of seps from tb eps to lb eps to slime and 4 further conversion of the slime fraction to methane sepsags revealed a lower degradation rate and extent than sepswas in combination with a lower reduction in mechanical stiffness upon ad owing to the lower degradation efficiency of key organic fractions the perseverance of sepsags resulted in an undisrupted residual structure of ags after ad in conclusion it can be claimed that seps is a major constituent that resulted in the distinct digestibility between ags and was in ad declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

17851,aerobic granular sludge ags technology is an alternative to conventional activated sludge to reduce the process footprint and energy consumption strategies for the efficient management of its produced biomass that is grown in a granular morphology as well need further development anaerobic digestion ad is commonly applied in waste activated sludge was treatment and is a potential option also for produced ags treatment in earlier studies the biochemical methane potential of ags was found lower than that of was both grown in full scale municipal wastewater treatment systems in order to understand this difference this study aimed to investigate the anaerobic conversion of structural extracellular polymeric substances seps which is a type of gel forming biopolymer being responsible for the aggregation of sludge using was and ags as substrates a comparative ad batch experiment was performed for 44 days during which the seps fraction was extracted from both types of sludge the changes in the seps chemical composition was analysed by fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy and three dimensional excitation and emission matrix analysis in addition the mechanical strength of hydrogels of extracted polymers cross linked with ca2 ions was investigated by dynamic mechanical analysis results showed that the amount of seps was reduced by 26 in ags sepsags and by 41 in was sepswas respectively polysaccharides and to a lesser extent the proteins in the sepsags were more refractory compared to those in sepswas this resulted in a lower loss of the gel stiffness of sepsags than that of sepswas during the ad process moreover the release of seps from tightly bound eps to loosely bound eps were observed in both types of sludge but that in ags exhibited a lower transition rate the observed properties explain the distinct differences in anaerobic biodegradability the slower decomposition of the sludge structure as well as the better dewaterability of ags as compared to was after the ad process graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion full scale nereda municipal wastewater treatment system waste aerobic granular sludge structural extracellular

degradation of aerobic granules is needed to be able to design effective wags sludge processing reactors bernat et al 2017 palmeiro sanchez et al 2013 in full scale nereda systems the wags can be two types the ags that can be periodically withdrawn from the reactor mainly granules 70 particle size 0 5 mm and the aerobic granular sludge selection spill particle size 0 5 mm a more flocculent biomass that is wasted every process cycle presenting lower settling velocity than big granules pronk et al 2015 very recent research has shown that the selection spill was easily biodegradable in ad guo et al 2020 while the ags showed a biochemical methane potential bmp that was significantly lower than was bernat et al 2017 del rio et al 2011 del rio et al 2014 it was demonstrated that the high digestibility of the selection spill was due to the low settle ability of highly biodegradable cellulose like fibres however the reason for the lower digestibility of ags compared to was remained unclear guo et al 2020 observed that proteins and carbohydrates in ags were more difficult to degrade than those in was even though the amount of these two fractions was higher in ags since ags and was are mainly composed of cells exo enzymes and microbial metabolic products very likely this difference is related to the microbial organic polymeric matrix extracellular polymeric substances eps account for the majority of microbial related carbohydrates and protein fractions in both ags and was frolund et al 1996 liu and fang 2002 salama et al 2016 therefore analysing the biodegradability of the eps present in ags and was during ad will help to understand the differences in digestibility between the two sludge types based on the ability to form hydrogels eps can be divided into gel forming and non gel forming eps felz et al 2016 seviour et al 2009 the amount of gel forming eps or structural eps seps can be considerable i e 100 300 mg g vs sludge and unlike non gel forming eps seps contributes to the formation of a tertiary network structure within the sludge felz et al 2016 lin et al 2010 it is hypothesized that the different concentration organic composition and ionic gel forming properties of seps extracted from ags and activated sludge determine the sludge morphology differences of the two lin et al 2013 sam and dulekgurgen 2016 anaerobic sludge digestion starts with breaking down the sludge structure resulting in the deterioration of sludge properties ye et al 2014 this enlarges the surface area of the sludge making it more accessible for the hydrolytic enzymes and thus for conversion during ad considering the amount of seps in sludge and their importance to the sludge structure the fate of these biopolymers in ad is very likely of crucial importance for the observed differences in digestion performance of ags and was as a consequence in this study batch mesophilic anaerobic digestion tests were conducted for ags and was under the same experimental conditions seps from ags sepsags and was sepswas were extracted during the experiment and their conversion characteristics regarding overall biodegradability chemical gel forming properties and spatial distribution were investigated and compared results led to a schematic representation of the seps degradation mechanism 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum and substrates the inoculum for batch tests was taken from the sludge digester of the municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp harnaschpolder den hoorn the netherlands the was was collected from the low loaded enhanced biological phosphate removal ebpr activated sludge tank at the same wwtp ags was collected from a full scale nereda reactor treating municipal wastewater garmerwolde the netherlands the influent characteristics and operational parameters of these two plants were reported elsewhere guo et al 2020 the volatile solids vs concentrations of both types of sludge were manipulated by centrifugation 5 min at 3500 g to reach to same sludge concentrations 2 2 experimental setup the anaerobic digestion batch experiments were carried out at 35 1 c in 2 l flasks for 44 days in an incubator shaker at 120 rpm innova 44 eppendorf ag germany the total volume of the mixture of inoculum and substrate was 1 8 l with an inoculum substrate ratio of 2 calculated by the dry weight of sludge vs g that was dosed into the batch reactor phosphorus buffer solution macronutrients and trace elements were dosed according to the recipes of zhang et al 2014 for each type of sludge three flasks were connected to an automatic methane potential test system ampts ii bioprocess control sweden for real time online monitoring of the accumulated methane production while three other flasks were used for periodic collection of an 80 ml sample for further analysis prior to the start of the experiment n2 was purged into each reactor for 5 min to remove oxygen from the sludge and headspace 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 eps extraction the eps was extracted from the sludge with a mild temperature na2co3 extraction method developed by felz et al 2016 in brief a sludge sample of 3 g wet weight was added into a 0 5 w v na2co3 solution up to 50 ml and subsequently stirred at 400 rpm and 80 c for 35 min followed by centrifugation at 4000 g and 4 c for 20 min the organics in the supernatant comprised the total extractable eps in addition centrifugation and a mild harsh heat method li and yang 2007 was applied to extract the stratified eps slime loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps a sludge sample of 15 g wet sludge was centrifuged at 15 000 g for 15 min at 4 c the produced supernatant was recovered as slime the solid fraction after decanting the supernatant was re suspended into a pre heated 0 05 w v nacl solution restoring the original weight and reaching a final temperature of 50 c after centrifugation at 15 000 g for 10 min at 4 c the organic matter in the supernatant was recovered as lb eps the pellet was re suspended in a 0 05 w v nacl solution restoring the original weight the mixture was heated to 60 c in a water bath for 30 min while steering it at 400 rpm hereafter it was centrifuged at 15 000 g for 15 min at 4 c the collected supernatant was regarded as tb eps 2 3 2 seps extraction the seps was isolated according to felz et al 2016 the aforementioned extracted eps were dialyzed with a dialysis membrane 3 5k mwco snakeskin thermo fisher scientific usa for 24 h against 1000 ml miliq water the ph of the dialyzed extracts was slowly adjusted to 2 2 0 05 with 1 and 0 1 m hydrochloric acid after these extracts were centrifuged at 4000 g and 4 c for 20 min the supernatant was discarded and the gel like pellet was considered to be the seps a certain amount of seps pellet obtained from the total extractable eps total extractable seps and from the stratified eps stratified seps was used for the vs analysis to measure the content of the seps fraction in the sludge wt g 100 g sludge and the rest was freeze dried and stored for further analysis 2 3 3 physicochemical analyses vs total suspended solid tss and volatile suspended solid vss were analysed according to standard protocols apha 2005 to measure the polysaccharides and proteins content of total extractable seps the freeze dried seps from a sludge sample of 3 g wet weight was solubilized in 1 m naoh to 50 ml reaching final ph of 7 5 the polysaccharide concentration was determined by phenol sulfuric acid assay using glucose sigma usa as standard dubois et al 1956 while the protein concentration was measured using a modified lowry method with bovine serum albumin sigma usa as standard frolund et al 1995 although methods for quantification of polysaccharides and proteins in seps were not fully developed the aforementioned methods are rapid and widely accepted and function as a relatively good estimator felz et al 2019b the polysaccharide and protein content in seps were then calculated based on the following equation 1 content wt g 100 g sludge c photometric method v solution w sludge 100 where cphotometric method concentration of polysaccharides or proteins determined by photometric methods mg l vsolution volume of the solution 50 ml in this study wsludge amount of the sludge sample 3 g in the current study changes in dewaterability during ad of ags and was sludge inoculum mixture were detected by a capillary suction time cst apparatus 304m triton electronics england with cst papers manufactured by the same company a normalized cst ncst method was used to eliminate the influence of solid particles lu et al 2015 volatile fatty acids vfas were measured by gas chromatography gc equipped with a flame ionization detector fid agilent 7890a usa helium was used as carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 8 ml min the column agilent 19091f 112 was 25 m 320 μm 0 5 μm injection port and oven temperatures were 240 c and 80 c respectively the particle size distribution psd of ags before and after ad process was analysed by a sieving method pronk et al 2015 while that of was at day 0 and 44 was measured by a particle size analyser bluewave microtrac germany 2 3 4 ft ir spectroscopy the original and secondary derivative ft ir spectra of total extractable seps the freeze dried solid in potassium bromide kbr pellets were recorded in the 4000 500 cm 1 region by a ft ir spectrometer cary 630 agilent usa 2 3 5 3d eem spectroscopy the prepared solution for polysaccharide and protein measurements section 2 3 3 was also used to determine the 3d eem spectra of total extractable seps these spectra were measured by a fluorescence spectrometer aqualog uv nir 800 c horiba usa wavelength ranges for excitation and emission spectra were 280 550 nm and 240 400 nm respectively both excitation and emission bandwidths were adjusted to 2 nm and the eem signals were corrected by subtracting a blank demineralized water eem fluorescence spectra were divided into four regions based on the differences of excitation emission wavelengths of organic matters aromatic protein like fulvic acid like soluble microbial by product like and humic acid like regions table s1 in supplementary material sun et al 2016 the fluorescence regional integration fri technique was utilized to calculate the fluorescent intensities of each region in all eem spectra chen et al 2003 2 3 6 gel formation property to test total extractable seps s gel forming property 10 w v freeze dried seps miliq solution was extruded into a cylinder mould 1 cm3 and sealed on both sides with a dialysis membrane mwco of 3 5 kda snakeskin usa the mould was then submersed into 3 w v cacl2 solution for 24 h to produce a ca2 seps hydrogel the mechanical stiffness of the hydrogel was measured by dynamic mechanical analysis device dma7e perkin elmer usa under the pressing force rate of 25 mn min the young s modulus represented the mechanical strength of the hydrogel and was calculated by the slope of tensile stress and extensional strain obtaining from the test felz et al 2019a 2 3 7 statistical analysis linear regression analysis for seps degradation was performed using r r core team austria significant differences in biodegradability of seps ft ir spectrum and dewaterability between ags and was were based on student s t test by means of spss statistics 25 ibm usa the significance level of probability p value was 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch anaerobic digestion of ags and was the difference in biodegradability of the sampled was and ags was assessed the characteristics of the substrate and inoculum are summarized in table 1 the inoculum sludge was characterised by a specific methanogenic activity of 0 19 g ch4 cod g vs day with acetate as the substrate to assess the degradation of the two sludge types the accumulated methane production vs and total vfas were monitored during the anaerobic digestion the results are presented in table 2 the average accumulative methane production of ags and was were both in line with prior researches guo et al 2020 del rio et al 2014 palmeiro sanchez et al 2013 besides the average vs reduction of ags and was was both in the typical range of 25 45 for sludge digestion bolzonella et al 2005 mottet et al 2010 specifically the degraded vs was 0 69 0 01 wt for ags and was 0 77 0 02 wt for was which showed that was had a higher degradation extent in vs approximately 0 08 0 01 wt than ags vfas were detected during day 0 6 of the digestion peaking at day 3 values shown in table 2 the differences in accumulated methane production and the corresponded vs reduction of the two sludge types confirmed their dissimilarity in biodegradability table 2 to minimise the impact of surface area limitation of ags compared to was the biodegradability of crushed ags and was were compared revealing comparable differences in biodegradability extent guo et al 2020 it should be mentioned that the inoculum selected in this study was taken from a full scale anaerobic digester that treats both primary sludge and was however del rio et al 2014 have proved that after long term acclimation with ags as the sole substrate the main microbial populations present were still those commonly found in digesters treating waste municipal sewage sludge thus to our understanding also this type of inoculum should be highly active and effective for ags digestion within a period of 44 days 3 2 degradation kinetics of seps changes in the total extractable seps from ags sepsags and was sepswas undergoing anaerobic digestion are shown in fig 1 the initial average seps contents in ags and was sludge inoculum mixture were 0 53 0 01 and 0 49 0 01 wt respectively or 196 6 and 179 5 mg g vssludge mixture respectively these results are in accordance with previous studies where aerobic granules represented a higher seps concentration than activated sludge lin et al 2013 sam and dulekgurgen 2016 however the total removal efficiency of sepsags 26 from 0 53 0 01 to 0 39 0 01 wt was significantly lower p value 0 038 than that from sepswas 41 from 0 49 0 02 to 0 29 0 01 wt it could be calculated that the difference in degraded seps between ags and was sludge inoculum mixture was 0 06 0 01 wt comparing this value with the removed vs content 0 08 0 01 wt the result clearly reveals that the seps is the major organic matter that differentiates the biodegradability of ags and was sepsags degradation started with a low rate from day 0 3 followed by a rapid degradation phase from day 3 21 and a slow degradation after day 21 sepswas degradation occurred with a higher rate from the start of the experiment also followed by a slow degradation phase after 21 days the degradation rate during the rapid degradation phase of sepswas and sepsags were similar respectively 0 006 and 0 005 g seps 100g sludge d additionally during the slower degradation phase the seps degradation rates of was and ags differed again respectively 0 002 and 0 0003 g seps 100g sludge d 3 3 variation of chemical composition and gel forming stiffness of seps in order to explain the differences in degradation rate and extent of the seps in was and ags the chemical and gel forming properties of the total extractable seps fractions were analysed on day 1 3 and 44 of the ad experiment 3 3 1 chemical composition the composition and degradation of polysaccharides and proteins within the extracted seps are presented in fig 2 these two organic groups form the main constituents of seps 84 of sepsags and 82 of sepswas the removal efficiencies of the extracted polysaccharides and proteins in sepswas were 62 and 33 respectively which were both higher than that of sepsags 39 and 24 respectively during 44 days ad process specifically polysaccharides and proteins in sepswas presented remarkably faster biodegradation than that in sepsags in the first three days the results reveal that the extracted organic compounds in sepswas can be more easily biodegraded in anaerobic digestion as compared to that in sepsags and thus leads to a higher degradation extent of sepswas fig 1 3 3 2 ft ir analysis to further investigate the changes in chemical structure of the seps during ad ft ir analysis was carried out fig 3 the ft ir results at wavenumbers 3000 1000 cm 1 for all seps samples displayed almost identical spectra with typical functional groups belonging to polysaccharides and proteins fig 3a and table s2 in supplementary material badireddy et al 2010 guo et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 the biodegradation of polysaccharides and proteins of seps extracted from ags and was that was presented in figs 1 and 2 was thus unnoticeable in the ft ir spectra the presence of residual polysaccharide and protein fractions after ad as shown in fig 2 resulted in the same ft ir spectrum as before since ft ir only showed the presence of certain molecular structures and not its quantities the fingerprint or anomeric region at wavenumbers 950 700 cm 1 could exhibit a more detailed signal to identify the individual organic compounds of seps compared to other regions in ft ir lin et al 2010 therefore a second derivative spectrum of the extracted seps of ags and was of this region was made fig 3b the second derivative spectrum enhances the signal in order to be able to notice small shifts in the composition of the biomolecules during ad of both sludge types in general the change in position and number of the measured peaks of sepsags after the first 3 days of anaerobic digestion was not statistically significant p value 0 75 but a substantial difference p value 0 034 was observed after 44 days of anaerobic digestion however for sepswas the positions and number of peaks already changed during the first 3 days p value 0 047 this result is consistent with the data indicating that the overall degradation of polysaccharides and proteins in sepswas started before that in sepsags fig 2 particularly peaks at 960 770 737 and 715 cm 1 could be assigned to c c c c o c and o c o stretching vibrations of glycoconjugates containing glucuronic acids tajmir riahi 1984 for both types of seps the position of these peaks remained unchanged during the anaerobic digestion however at the end of the digestion period day 44 the 737 cm 1 peak of sepsags was just lower whereas the peak belonging to sepswas disappeared completely possibly indicating that the glycoconjugates in ags were less biodegradable than that in was several researchers found that uronic acids such as glucuronic acids are important monomers predominating in the glycoconjugates of gel forming eps seviour et al 2010 felz et al 2019b for example they can act as the building blocks in the formation of hyaluronic like acid a type of extracellular substance that is capable of attracting cations and forming hydrogels felz et al 2020 the characteristics of glucuronic acid containing glycoconjugates in seps in both sludge morphologies are not fully understood more research is required to understand the precise relation between the presence of glycoconjugates and anaerobic biodegradability of sludge additionally peaks at 860 and 842 cm 1 were observed in all seps samples they could be related to the glycoconjugates containing galactose and mannose das et al 2011 sardari et al 2017 recent studies reported the existence of galactose and mannose in the eps of ags which might contribute to the gel forming property of ags seviour et al 2010 and felz et al 2019b the substantial presence of these monomeric units in the eps from activated sludge suggested their importance in the aggregation of sludge flocs dignac et al 1998 interestingly in this study the glycoconjugate peaks for the sepswas shifted to low wave numbers after 3 days while that for the sepsags samples remained unchanged even on day 44 indicating that sepsags was slower degraded than sepswas which implies that the composition of glycoconjugates in sepsags and sepswas is different 3 3 3 3d eem assays 3d eem spectroscopy was applied for characterizing the extracted seps at the different days of anaerobic digestion from ags and was fig 4 compared to conventional photometric methods eem provides more information about the presence and concentration of fluorescent organics these organic matters such as protein like substances i e aromatic and tryptophan like substance are shown to contribute to the formation of the sludge structure via surface charge adjustment zhu et al 2015 the 3d eem plots of four different regions with their corresponding possible substances are given in table s1 in supplementary material region iii soluble microbial by products had the highest fluorescence intensity with its characteristic peak indicating the tryptophan protein like substances identified at the excitation emission wavelengths ex em of 275 285 325 340 nm region iv humic like substances revealed a signal with the characteristic humic like substances peak observed at the ex em of 345 355 425 440 nm the results illustrate that irrespective of sludge type tryptophan protein like as well as humic acid like substances were dominant among the organic matter with fluorescence characteristics in seps these results were very similar as fluorescence spectra that were determined by wang et al 2009 for bound eps extracted from activated sludge during digestion the characteristic peaks belonging to the protein like substance regions region i and region iii were reduced demonstrating degradation of protein like substances however the total calculated reduction ratio of the fluorescence intensity of the protein like substance regions at day 3 and day 44 compared to day 0 was 6 2 and 14 7 for sepsags and 8 6 and 18 5 for sepswas respectively this is in accordance with the results obtained by the photometric method fig 3 reasons for the lower protein degradation efficiency in sepsags can be two fold firstly the compact structure of ags results in a lower specific surface area relative to activated sludge zheng et al 2005 it is thus speculated that this may hinder the hydrolysis of structural extracellular proteins by protease secondly as mentioned before tryptophan protein like substances dominated among the protein like substances li et al 2014 reported that the tryptophan like group was resistant to anaerobic digestion in this study the initial fluorescence intensity of the tryptophan like substance region of sepsags was higher than that of sepswas the higher content of the tryptophan like substance in sepsags results in the lower overall degradation of proteins in sepsags which is supported by the lower reduction in fluorescence intensity of region iii for sepsags during ad process in contrast to protein like substance regions the reduction in fluorescence intensity of region iv humic like substances over time was not observed suggesting that these substances were refractory to anaerobic biodegradation which is in line with results reported by ghasimi et al 2016 3 3 4 gel forming strength seps is known to be capable of forming gels with multivalent cations in a broad range of temperature and ph the viscous and elastic characteristics displayed by this biopolymer gel when undergoing deformation are regarded as a parameter to indicate the mechanical property of seps lin et al 2013 ca2 is one of the most common cations in wastewater ca2 seps ionic hydrogel could play an important role in building up the gel matrix structure in both activated sludge and aerobic granules felz et al 2016 lin et al 2013 therefore to understand the influence of seps degradation on the gel stiffness hydrogels formed from sepsags and sepswas cross linked with ca2 were made fig 5 a and subjected to a gel stiffness test in fig 5b the decreased young s modulus is shown indicating the loss of gel forming property and increased susceptibility for destruction of the mechanical structure during the ad process the young s modulus of sepsags decreased by 14 6 from 4126 455 to 3522 338 pa in average while the young s modulus of sepswas showed a much higher reduction of 30 1 2773 78 to 1939 133 pa in average which indicates that the stiffness reduction during ad is much higher for sepswas than for sepsags it has been demonstrated that some functional groups of polysaccharides and proteins such as carboxyl hydroxyl and amino acid groups can be easily bridged with ca2 in the sludge matrix resulting in the gel forming ability of eps felz et al 2019b in the present study although strong peaks of these functional groups were found in all samples extracted during the ad process of seps fig 3 these key organic fractions in sepsags showed higher resistance to anaerobic degradation than that in sepswas which eventually leads to the stronger gel forming capacity in residual sepsags this finding implies that the granular structure of ags will likely sustain during digestion to prove this assumption the shifts in particle size distribution of both types of sludge after 44 days of ad were determined and are shown in fig 6 both ags and was experienced deterioration of their particle sizes the fraction particles larger than 100 μm decreased by 30 in was while it decreased only 23 in ags the fraction above 250 μm is defined as granules de kreuk et al 2007 although this fraction in ags reduced by 30 going from 54 to only 24 during ad the fraction of big particles especially larger than 2 mm remained present in ags after 44 days ad this observation is in line with the differences in gel forming properties of sepswas and sepsags as discussed above 3 4 structural changes of seps in eps matrix this study revealed that the structural morphology of ags and was changed during the ad process besides the deterioration of sludge dewatering properties due to these structural changes lu et al 2015 novak et al 2003 the gel forming eps matrix within the sludge also weakened resulting in degradation and shifts between the different eps binding strength therefore the content of seps in slime loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps before and after ad was determined for both types of sludge as shown in fig 7 initially the slime fraction of the seps was very low the sepstb eps sepslb eps ratio was highest in the ags while both sludge types were dominated by tb eps which was in line with previous studies claiming that tb eps plays an important role in maintaining the matrix structure of both aerobic granular sludge and activated sludge chen et al 2010 yuan et al 2014 even though the content of seps in tb eps remained high a shift in seps from tb eps to lb eps was observed during ad the sepslb eps fraction increased by 23 and 25 for ags and was respectively whereas the sepstb eps fraction decreased with 13 and 20 respectively fig 7 this transition is likely due to the loss of binding capacity between seps and cations as a result of enzymatic hydrolysis yu et al 2010 in contrast the slime fraction of seps remained very low indicating that the seps that shifted from the lb eps to the slime fraction during ad might have been converted to methane during this process the presence of lb eps and tb eps are reported to exhibit different sludge dewaterability chen et al 2010 yuan et al 2014 deterioration of dewaterability during ad is associated with a shift of polymers from tb eps to lb eps ye et al 2014 in the current study a substantial difference in cst was observed between ags and was at different moments during ad fig 8 which could be explained by the larger seps shifts in was than in ags during ad we used the normalized cst method as an indicative analysis for the sludge dewaterability although this method has been accepted by several researchers to characterise dewaterability it might not be the optimal method to study dewaterability of ags the cst of ags is usually very short 16 19 s basuvaraj et al 2015 lotito et al 2014 because the free water around the granules is loosely bound however the water that is captured within the granules is not released during a cst measurement and therefore cst might not represent the overall dewaterability of ags in the current study the ags and was were both mixed with digestate the latter determined the overall suction time which was much higher than that of sole ags and was the dewaterability of digestate is determined by the particle size distribution and the polymer fraction in the matrix therefore in this research it is reasonable to compare the dewaterability of ags and was sludge inoculum mixture by cst as a qualitative parameter 3 5 seps degradation mechanism and implications in the anaerobic degradation of both sludge types considering the observed changes in seps the following mechanism is proposed for seps degradation fig 9 before the ad process the seps was mainly aggregated in tb eps and exhibited a strong gel forming capacity with cations such as ca2 nevertheless ad negatively influences the gel forming strength of the ca2 seps hydrogel due to the degradation of key polysaccharides and proteins and related to this due to the transition of seps from tb eps to lb eps the lower degradation of sepsags compared to sepswas resulted in a higher residual seps fraction in the ags structure along the entire ad process leading to a lower overall biodegradability of ags compared to was vs removal in both types of sludge during anaerobic digestion was 25 30 and therefore relatively low considering that only 25 40 of seps can be biodegraded a possible strategy for enhancing the biodegradability of sludge especially ags could be the acceleration of the decomposition or degradation of the seps structure this could be done through destructive mechanical methods such as crushing or ultrasound treatment in combination with the addition of specific enzymes targeting the seps polymers it can be speculated that this pre treatment would liberate biodegradable compounds of the seps matrix leading to enhanced methane production besides the gel forming seps are useful biopolymers in industrial applications lin et al 2015 and recovery of seps from ags is studied at pilot scale kaumera royal haskoningdhv the netherlands the extraction process for seps can be regarded as an effective pre treatment method to entirely destroy the sludge matrix and remove the non easily biodegradable seps polymers from the sludge simultaneously the methane production after seps extraction and the application potential of seps extraction ad for ags treatment requires further investigation 4 conclusions seps isolated from ags and was followed similar degradation steps 1 degradation of polysaccharides and proteins 2 reduction of hydrogel stiffness 3 transition of seps from tb eps to lb eps to slime and 4 further conversion of the slime fraction to methane sepsags revealed a lower degradation rate and extent than sepswas in combination with a lower reduction in mechanical stiffness upon ad owing to the lower degradation efficiency of key organic fractions the perseverance of sepsags resulted in an undisrupted residual structure of ags after ad in conclusion it can be claimed that seps is a major constituent that resulted in the distinct digestibility

theoretical limits of quantification of the overall method resulted as 4 45 4 91 and 4 75 log10 gc l for n1 n2 and n3 respectively mgv and pedv rna were quantified by plotting the cts to external standard curves generated by serial end point dilution method using rna extracted from purified cell culture suspensions quantification were referred as pcru standard curve showed a linear dynamic

according to iso 15216 1 2017 iso 15216 1 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the concentration method the aluminum hydroxide adsorption precipitation method was tested by spiking influent and effluent samples with mgv and pedv on average mgv was recovered at ranges of 11 2 1 in influent and 6 2 1 0 in effluent water pedv was recovered at ranges of 11 3 5 in influent and 3 3 1 6 in effluent water notably not significant differences p 0 05 were detected between recovery rates in influent waters this finding implies that a non enveloped virus may be used as process control for coronavirus detection in influent waters upon method validation in contrast significant differences p 0 05 were reported between pedv and mgv recoveries in effluent waters these results are in line with the mgv recoveries reported for enteric viruses concentration in water samples by the same aluminum based method cuevas ferrando et al 2020 randazzo et al 2019 and higher than the 1 as the quality assurance parameter indicated for bottled water into iso 15216 1 2017 iso 15216 1 2017 similarly mgv was successfully used as recovery control for hepatitis e virus concentration from influent and effluent water samples 5 13 by applying a polyethylene glycol peg precipitation method miura et al 2016 a similar peg based protocol was recently used to recover sars cov 2 from wastewater although recovery control was not included in the study f wu et al 2020a moreover filtration through 10 kda centricon plus 70 centrifugal device successfully recovered sars cov 2 in wastewater with recovery efficiencies of f specific rna phages of 73 medema et al 2020 however concentration by electropositive membrane should be further evaluated given a sars cov recovery from wastewater of 1 wang et al 2005 rigorous limits of detection should be established by spiking sars cov 2 cell culture adapted strain or positive covid 19 fecal samples in influent and effluent wastewater samples to be concentrated following the aluminum hydroxide adsorption precipitation method nonetheless the need of a bsl3 laboratory facility to handle sars cov 2 represents the main limitation of this experiment 3 2 sars cov 2 titers in wastewater and effluent water a total of 42 influent and 18 secondary and 12 tertiary treated effluent water samples were collected from 12 march to 14 april 2020 and investigated for the occurrence of sars cov 2 rna samples were considered positive for ct below 40 as in medema et al 2020 and f wu et al 2020a and titrated by using the quantified plasmid control for each of the rt qpcr targets as expected biobanked samples collected in october 2019 before the first covid 19 case was documented tested negative for all the three rt qpcr assays thus excluding false positive reactions the 83 35 positive samples out of 42 influent samples and the 11 2 out of 18 secondary treated water samples were tested positive for at least one sars cov 2 rt qpcr target none of the tertiary effluent samples 0 out of 12 tested positive for any of the sars cov 2 rt qpcr target fig 2 a relevant number of influent water samples 12 showed ct ranging between 37 and 40 even though lower ct of 34 37 were observed 29 in influent samples a poor positive correlation among rt qpcr assays was detected being 0 5 0 3 and 0 6 the resulting coefficients between n1 and n2 n1 and n3 n2 and n3 respectively the total number of rt qpcr determinations was 84 for each target for n1 23 results showed ct below 37 out of 33 positive samples 70 for n2 18 out of 31 58 and for n3 28 out of 36 78 in all samples mgv recoveries were above 1 11 15 mgv recovery for each sample and ct values for each sars cov 2 target are reported in table s1 in supplementary material on average sars cov 2 rna titers of 5 1 0 3 5 5 0 2 and 5 5 0 3 log10 gc l were quantified in wastewater by using n1 n2 and n3 primer probe mixes respectively titers of 4 and 5 to more than 6 log10 gc l have been reported in massachusetts and france respectively f wu et al 2020a wurtzer et al 2020 a secondary effluent sample resulted positive for n2 and quantified as 5 4 log10 gc l an additional secondary effluent sample was positive for the three molecular targets and below the limit of quantification detection of sars cov 2 rna in influent water has been reported worldwide ahmed et al 2020 la rosa et al 2020 lodder and de roda husman 2020 medema et al 2020 wu et al 2020a and only one study tested treated wastewater that resulted positive paris wurtzer et al 2020 we observed discrepancies among rt qpcr n1 n2 and n3 assays for several water samples in agreement to a previous report medema et al 2020 this could be due to the different analytical sensitivity among the assays as well as the detection of possible false positive samples by rt qpcr n3 in low concentrated clinical samples jung et al 2020 vogels et al 2020 the latter possibility has been solved by excluding the n3 primers probe set from the us cdc 2019 ncov rt qpcr diagnostic panel in its last revision march 30 cdc a b n d in addition a partial inhibitory effect of the matrix is not to be completely excluded despite the controls included in the assays a more sensitive estimation of sars cov 2 loads in wastewater should be studied by digital rt qpcr drt qpcr drt qpcr could be used to quantify samples with low viral loads as reported for norovirus in wastewater monteiro and santos 2017 and sars cov 2 in clinical samples dong et al 2020 suo et al 2020 even though it may not be the best practical and economically sustainable option for environmental surveillance abachin et al 2018 even though the sars cov 2 rna detection in wastewater is functional for wbe purposes the risk for human health associated to the water cycle is still under debate as infectivity of viral particles in sewage and faeces remain to be confirmed as well as its potential fecal oral transmission a pre print report suggests that the risk of infection from wastewater and river is negligible given the failure in cell culturing sars cov 2 from water samples despite the high number of rna copies rimoldi et al 2020 in spite of the high concentration of viral rna in specimen and the evidence of gastrointestinal infection xiao et al 2020 infectious viruses from stools have been isolated in one study w wang et al 2020b while another attempt resulted without success wölfel et al 2020 the potential transmission of sars cov 2 via wastewater has not been proven cdc a b n d who 2020 and it seems unlikely given the poor stability of viable sars cov 2 in wastewater rimoldi et al 2020 j wang et al 2020a that resembles some previous studies made with representative coronaviruses gundy et al 2008 and enveloped surrogates casanova and weaver 2015 as well the elevated sensitivity of human pathogenic coronaviruses to environmental conditions chin et al 2020 darnell et al 2004 darnell and taylor 2006 and disinfectants chin et al 2020 j wang et al 2020a suggests a poor risk of transmission via wastewater even though formal risk analysis needs to be performed haas 2020 3 3 environmental surveillance epidemiological data on covid 19 in the murcia region have been retrieved from the publically available repository of the servicio de epidemiologia of the consejería de salud de la región de murcia available at http www murciasalud es principal php table 2 and plotted to the sars cov 2 rna mean loads as detected by three rt qpcr assays fig 3 in general rt qpcr amplification signals have been detected in wastewaters when cases were diagnosed within the municipality positive wastewater samples have been detected with at least two out of three rt qpcr assays in low prevalence municipalities as in murcia 96 cases 21 18 cases per 100 000 inhabitants cartagena 36 cases 16 76 and molina de segura 12 cases 16 69 of note positive wastewater samples were detected 12 16 days before covid 19 cases were declared in lorca cieza and totana municipalities a similar study conducted in paris france demonstrated the detection of viral genome before the exponential phase of the epidemic wurtzer et al 2020 however our results indicate that sars cov 2 can be detected weeks before the first confirmed case the early detection of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater could have alerted about the imminent danger giving a valuate time to the managers to coordinate and implement actions to slow the spread of the disease therefore our outcomes support that wbe could be used as an early warning tool to monitor the status of covid 19 infection within a community on the other hand we believe that this environmental surveillance could be used as an instrument to drive the right decisions to reduce the risk of lifting restrictions too early for instance a key question is how to reduce the risk of a second wave and or recurring local outbreaks massive population tests are the first choice but in their absence wastewater monitorization of sars cov 2 rna can give a reliable picture of the current situation our wastewater data do not quantitatively resemble the prevalence of covid 19 confirmed cases to this end a quantitative model that includes and corrects all the variables affecting these wastewater surveillance data would be useful for a better interpretation for instance not all covid 19 positive patients excrete sars cov 2 rna in faeces and when it occurs the titers and the duration of shedding vary among individuals and across time he et al 2020 pan et al 2020 wölfel et al 2020 xu et al 2020 on the other hand the real number of positive cases within the murcia region remains unknown because of the large number of mild or asymptomatic carriers that have not been included in epidemiological statistics these aspects together with environmental variables e g rainfall events temperature hydraulic retention time in sewers increase the uncertainties linked to the correlation between sars cov 2 rna detection in wastewater samples and the prevalence of covid 19 that could be explored by using complex models 4 conclusion overall wastewater surveillance and wbe may represent a complementary approach to estimate the presence and even the prevalence of covid 19 in communities this represents an effective tool that needs to be further explored in order to direct public health response especially in cases of

17852,severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 has caused more than 200 000 reported covid 19 cases in spain resulting in more than 20 800 deaths as of april 21 2020 faecal shedding of sars cov 2 rna from covid 19 patients has extensively been reported therefore we investigated the occurrence of sars cov 2 rna in six wastewater treatments plants wwtps serving the major municipalities within the region of murcia spain the area with the lowest covid 19 prevalence within iberian peninsula firstly an aluminum hydroxide adsorption precipitation concentration method was validated using a porcine coronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus pedv and mengovirus mgv the procedure resulted in average recoveries of 10 3 5 and 10 2 1 in influent water n 2 and 3 3 1 6 and 6 2 1 0 in effluent water n 2 samples for pedv and mgv respectively then the method was used to monitor the occurrence of sars cov 2 from march 12 to april 14 2020 in influent secondary and tertiary effluent water samples by using the real time rt pcr rt qpcr diagnostic panel validated by us cdc that targets three regions of the virus nucleocapsid n gene we estimated quantification of sars cov 2 rna titers in untreated wastewater samples of 5 4 0 2 log10 genomic copies l on average two secondary water samples resulted positive 2 out of 18 and all tertiary water samples tested as negative 0 out 12 this environmental surveillance data were compared to declared covid 19 cases at municipality level revealing that members of the community were shedding sars cov 2 rna in their stool even before the first cases were reported by local or national authorities in many of the cities where wastewaters have been sampled the detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater in early stages of the spread of covid 19 highlights the relevance of this strategy as an early indicator of the infection within a specific population at this point this environmental surveillance could be implemented by

curve built with 10 fold serial dilution of a quantified plasmid control idt calibration curves for n1 y 3 3774x 41 515 r2 0 95 n2 y 3 7752x 43 951 r2 0 989 and n3 y 3 6006x 43 142 r2 0 99 showed a linear dynamic range between 5 10 and 5 104 the limit of detection lod resulted as 50 gc per reaction with ct values of 37 05 0 77 38 12 0 24 and 37 29 1 48 for n1 n2 and n3 respectively the theoretical limits of quantification of the overall method resulted as 4 45 4 91 and 4 75 log10 gc l for n1 n2 and n3 respectively mgv and pedv rna were quantified by plotting the cts to external standard curves generated by serial end point dilution method using rna extracted from purified cell culture suspensions quantification were referred as pcru standard curve showed a linear dynamic

according to iso 15216 1 2017 iso 15216 1 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the concentration method the aluminum hydroxide adsorption precipitation method was tested by spiking influent and effluent samples with mgv and pedv on average mgv was recovered at ranges of 11 2 1 in influent and 6 2 1 0 in effluent water pedv was recovered at ranges of 11 3 5 in influent and 3 3 1 6 in effluent water notably not significant differences p 0 05 were detected between recovery rates in influent waters this finding implies that a non enveloped virus may be used as process control for coronavirus detection in influent waters upon method validation in contrast significant differences p 0 05 were reported between pedv and mgv recoveries in effluent waters these results are in line with the mgv recoveries reported for enteric viruses concentration in water samples by the same aluminum based method cuevas ferrando et al 2020 randazzo et al 2019 and higher than the 1 as the quality assurance parameter indicated for bottled water into iso 15216 1 2017 iso 15216 1 2017 similarly mgv was successfully used as recovery control for hepatitis e virus concentration from influent and effluent water samples 5 13 by applying a polyethylene glycol peg precipitation method miura et al 2016 a similar peg based protocol was recently used to recover sars cov 2 from wastewater although recovery control was not included in the study f wu et al 2020a moreover filtration through 10 kda centricon plus 70 centrifugal device successfully recovered sars cov 2 in wastewater with recovery efficiencies of f specific rna phages of 73 medema et al 2020 however concentration by electropositive membrane should be further evaluated given a sars cov recovery from wastewater of 1 wang et al 2005 rigorous limits of detection should be established by spiking sars cov 2 cell culture adapted strain or positive covid 19 fecal samples in influent and effluent wastewater samples to be concentrated following the aluminum hydroxide adsorption precipitation method nonetheless the need of a bsl3 laboratory facility to handle sars cov 2 represents the main limitation of this experiment 3 2 sars cov 2 titers in wastewater and effluent water a total of 42 influent and 18 secondary and 12 tertiary treated effluent water samples were collected from 12 march to 14 april 2020 and investigated for the occurrence of sars cov 2 rna samples were considered positive for ct below 40 as in medema et al 2020 and f wu et al 2020a and titrated by using the quantified plasmid control for each of the rt qpcr targets as expected biobanked samples collected in october 2019 before the first covid 19 case was documented tested negative for all the three rt qpcr assays thus excluding false positive reactions the 83 35 positive samples out of 42 influent samples and the 11 2 out of 18 secondary treated water samples were tested positive for at least one sars cov 2 rt qpcr target none of the tertiary effluent samples 0 out of 12 tested positive for any of the sars cov 2 rt qpcr target fig 2 a relevant number of influent water samples 12 showed ct ranging between 37 and 40 even though lower ct of 34 37 were observed 29 in influent samples a poor positive correlation among rt qpcr assays was detected being 0 5 0 3 and 0 6 the resulting coefficients between n1 and n2 n1 and n3 n2 and n3 respectively the total number of rt qpcr determinations was 84 for each target for n1 23 results showed ct below 37 out of 33 positive samples 70 for n2 18 out of 31 58 and for n3 28 out of 36 78 in all samples mgv recoveries were above 1 11 15 mgv recovery for each sample and ct values for each sars cov 2 target are reported in table s1 in supplementary material on average sars cov 2 rna titers of 5 1 0 3 5 5 0 2 and 5 5 0 3 log10 gc l were quantified in wastewater by using n1 n2 and n3 primer probe mixes respectively titers of 4 and 5 to more than 6 log10 gc l have been reported in massachusetts and france respectively f wu et al 2020a wurtzer et al 2020 a secondary effluent sample resulted positive for n2 and quantified as 5 4 log10 gc l an additional secondary effluent sample was positive for the three molecular targets and below the limit of quantification detection of sars cov 2 rna in influent water has been reported worldwide ahmed et al 2020 la rosa et al 2020 lodder and de roda husman 2020 medema et al 2020 wu et al 2020a and only one study tested treated wastewater that resulted positive paris wurtzer et al 2020 we observed discrepancies among rt qpcr n1 n2 and n3 assays for several water samples in agreement to a previous report medema et al 2020 this could be due to the different analytical sensitivity among the assays as well as the detection of possible false positive samples by rt qpcr n3 in low concentrated clinical samples jung et al 2020 vogels et al 2020 the latter possibility has been solved by excluding the n3 primers probe set from the us cdc 2019 ncov rt qpcr diagnostic panel in its last revision march 30 cdc a b n d in addition a partial inhibitory effect of the matrix is not to be completely excluded despite the controls included in the assays a more sensitive estimation of sars cov 2 loads in wastewater should be studied by digital rt qpcr drt qpcr drt qpcr could be used to quantify samples with low viral loads as reported for norovirus in wastewater monteiro and santos 2017 and sars cov 2 in clinical samples dong et al 2020 suo et al 2020 even though it may not be the best practical and economically sustainable option for environmental surveillance abachin et al 2018 even though the sars cov 2 rna detection in wastewater is functional for wbe purposes the risk for human health associated to the water cycle is still under debate as infectivity of viral particles in sewage and faeces remain to be confirmed as well as its potential fecal oral transmission a pre print report suggests that the risk of infection from wastewater and river is negligible given the failure in cell culturing sars cov 2 from water samples despite the high number of rna copies rimoldi et al 2020 in spite of the high concentration of viral rna in specimen and the evidence of gastrointestinal infection xiao et al 2020 infectious viruses from stools have been isolated in one study w wang et al 2020b while another attempt resulted without success wölfel et al 2020 the potential transmission of sars cov 2 via wastewater has not been proven cdc a b n d who 2020 and it seems unlikely given the poor stability of viable sars cov 2 in wastewater rimoldi et al 2020 j wang et al 2020a that resembles some previous studies made with representative coronaviruses gundy et al 2008 and enveloped surrogates casanova and weaver 2015 as well the elevated sensitivity of human pathogenic coronaviruses to environmental conditions chin et al 2020 darnell et al 2004 darnell and taylor 2006 and disinfectants chin et al 2020 j wang et al 2020a suggests a poor risk of transmission via wastewater even though formal risk analysis needs to be performed haas 2020 3 3 environmental surveillance epidemiological data on covid 19 in the murcia region have been retrieved from the publically available repository of the servicio de epidemiologia of the consejería de salud de la región de murcia available at http www murciasalud es principal php table 2 and plotted to the sars cov 2 rna mean loads as detected by three rt qpcr assays fig 3 in general rt qpcr amplification signals have been detected in wastewaters when cases were diagnosed within the municipality positive wastewater samples have been detected with at least two out of three rt qpcr assays in low prevalence municipalities as in murcia 96 cases 21 18 cases per 100 000 inhabitants cartagena 36 cases 16 76 and molina de segura 12 cases 16 69 of note positive wastewater samples were detected 12 16 days before covid 19 cases were declared in lorca cieza and totana municipalities a similar study conducted in paris france demonstrated the detection of viral genome before the exponential phase of the epidemic wurtzer et al 2020 however our results indicate that sars cov 2 can be detected weeks before the first confirmed case the early detection of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater could have alerted about the imminent danger giving a valuate time to the managers to coordinate and implement actions to slow the spread of the disease therefore our outcomes support that wbe could be used as an early warning tool to monitor the status of covid 19 infection within a community on the other hand we believe that this environmental surveillance could be used as an instrument to drive the right decisions to reduce the risk of lifting restrictions too early for instance a key question is how to reduce the risk of a second wave and or recurring local outbreaks massive population tests are the first choice but in their absence wastewater monitorization of sars cov 2 rna can give a reliable picture of the current situation our wastewater data do not quantitatively resemble the prevalence of covid 19 confirmed cases to this end a quantitative model that includes and corrects all the variables affecting these wastewater surveillance data would be useful for a better interpretation for instance not all covid 19 positive patients excrete sars cov 2 rna in faeces and when it occurs the titers and the duration of shedding vary among individuals and across time he et al 2020 pan et al 2020 wölfel et al 2020 xu et al 2020 on the other hand the real number of positive cases within the murcia region remains unknown because of the large number of mild or asymptomatic carriers that have not been included in epidemiological statistics these aspects together with environmental variables e g rainfall events temperature hydraulic retention time in sewers increase the uncertainties linked to the correlation between sars cov 2 rna detection in wastewater samples and the prevalence of covid 19 that could be explored by using complex models 4 conclusion overall wastewater surveillance and wbe may represent a complementary approach to estimate the presence and even the prevalence of covid 19 in communities this represents an effective tool that needs to be further explored in order to direct public health response especially in cases of

terms of inert components the ppb community was similar in the suspended and biofilm fractions while the biofilm had higher relative abundance of ppb representatives 57 vs 43 a consistent product composition is highly relevant for the manufacturer and ultimately determines the value as feed feed additive or supplement keywords purple phototrophic bacteria wastewater biofilm single cell protein 1 introduction single cell protein scp has been proposed as alternative to effectively upgrade and recycle organics and nutrients from wastewater substrates for scp production which can subsequently be used in restricted or unrestricted applications include food processing effluents such as dairy beverage brewery and possibly abattoir effluents pikaar et al 2018 ponsano et al 2003 phototrophic organisms such as microalgae or purple phototrophic bacteria ppb have been applied to produce biomass from these sources chitapornpan et al 2013 maizatul et al 2017 both ppb and microalgae are characterised by high carbon yields and high nutrient capture potentials with catabolic energy derived from artificial or natural light the vast majority of microalgal biomass today is grown in suspended cultures in open high rate algal ponds hrap the main advantages of hrap are reasonable areal productivities 6 8 realistic 42 idealistic g m 2 d 1 moheimani and borowitzka 2006 richardson et al 2014 and low capital costs per m2 40 m 2 young et al 2017 disadvantages especially when using wastewater as substrate include culture instabilities with periodic loss of the target organism flynn et al 2017 buchanan et al 2018 as well as biomass contamination with undesired wastewater components these include inert particles solids heavy metals xenobiotics and pathogens that tend to accumulate in the suspended biomass as such it is almost impossible to separate undesired wastewater components from the scp product other drawbacks include the large footprint of sedimentation requirements for drying and high operational costs with harvesting and drying often dominating overall cost richardson et al 2014 growing the biomass as an attached biofilm can effectively address many of these limitations as attached films on submerged surfaces gao et al 2015 biological aggregates granules tiron et al 2017 as well as immobilisation methods e g in alginate or carrageen vasilieva et al 2016 growing in a biofilm reduces unwanted wastewater constituents e g mineral solids as these tend to remain in the main wastewater or suspended biomass biofilm growth has the potential to substantially reduce the harvesting costs for example granular microalgal bacteria biomass has a 2000 times higher settling velocity compared to suspended biomass 0 54 10 2 vs 12 m h 1 tiron et al 2017 while biofilms and immobilised cells can be harvested up to 100 times more concentrated 100 g l 1 compared to 1 0 g l 1 which simultaneously reduces harvesting and dewatering costs ozkan et al 2012 pierobon et al 2017 in addition biofilms granules attached immobilised can provide refuge against predation matz 2007 the main disadvantage of biofilm reactors compared with suspended systems per m2 are capital costs enzing et al 2014 immobilisation and biofilm systems can decrease areal productivities 0 72 7 6 gdw m 2 d 1 fica and sims 2016 johnson and wen 2010b ozkan et al 2012 pierobon et al 2017 compared to suspended cultures due to photo inhibition shading and diffusion limitations including co2 from the atmosphere kesaano and sims 2014 despite this photo biofilm systems are a promising way to address many of the issues in harvesting valuable products from wastewater mixed culture purple phototrophic bacteria ppb is an emerging technology for resource recovery particularly for carbon rich wastewaters suspended mixed ppb cultures have been applied for poultry red meat pig dairy and sugar processing wastewater treatment hülsen et al 2018a ppb further have low light requirements 5 20

et al 2007 microalgae biofilm systems have received considerable attention in the literature schnurr and allen 2015 while purple phototrophic bacteria ppb have received very limited attention with one assessment in an internal overflow reactor prachanurak et al 2014 suspended ppb systems for primary treatment are more susceptible to source contamination than microalgae applied for polishing and microbial dilution by other bacteria due to the need for a hydrolytic acidogenic bacterial flanking community especially when pre treatments such as pre acidification and solid removal are omitted a biofilm based ppb system would a minimise source wastewater contamination since much of the contaminants remain in the mainline b limit flanking community due to hydrolysis and acidogenesis occurring in the suspended material and c enhance the ability to directly harvest the biofilm at a relatively high concentration through mechanical means this study aims to determine the applicability of a biofilm based ppb system for the treatment of pre settled red meat processing wastewater a closed photobioreactor with submerged infra red irradiated surfaces was used key questions were a what fraction of the total biomass is incorporated into the biofilm b what is the biofilm composition and is it suitable as a single cell protein product and c how does this compare to traditional protein

the wastewater contained substantial amounts of particulates e g 2 2 g l 1 of total solids ts with 70 of volatile solids vs the detailed composition including metals and a comparison with literature values are shown in table s1 we note that wastewater is discharged at around 38 c on site and some fats are liquid at this temperature these fats aggregate and form solids at 4 c which accumulate in a supernatant layer 2 2 inoculum the anaerobic reactor was inoculated with 10 v v of ppb from a domestic wastewater enrichment culture around 1 0 gvs l 1 as described elsewhere hülsen et al 2016a according to sequencing see below the inoculum consisted of 50 ppb which was dominated by rhodobacter sp 31 2 3 photobioreactor configuration and operation 2 3 1 biofilm photobioreactor configuration the biofilm photobioreactor bpbr for attached growth was comprised of a 3 0 l cylindrical t1 perspex main body diameter x height 150 250 mm with a flanged conical bottom a schematic drawing and a picture of the system are shown in fig 1 the reactor lid was flanged to the vessel and contained 17 sealed hollow perspex tubes diameter 15 13 mm od id length 250 mm which were submerged 180 mm in the reactor liquid resulting in an effective illuminated surface of 0 14 m2 and an illuminated surface to volume ratio of 46 7 m2 m 3 tubes were illuminated with two flexible dimmable ir led strips ip68

limits the applicable irradiance in the system the attached ppb biomass was harvested as follows wiping and collecting the attached biomass from the conical bottom of the bpbr were carried out in situ after stopping the mixing by using the internal rubber wiper alternatively the wiper was used to re suspend the attached biomass within the water column and the liquid phase was re analysed post harvesting to determine tcod tkn tp and ts vs by subtracting the pre harvesting concentration from the post harvesting concentrations following the continuous operation batch wise bpbr operation with 12 batches commenced the light intensity was lowered to an average distribution of 5 8 w m 2 fig s2 setting the reactor temperature at 33 c the batch phase was subdivided in four phases with 6 batches done at 3d srt and 6 batches at 2d srt batch 2d the operational details are shown in table 1 at the end of each batch tend the biomass was harvested manually by removing the tubes from the reactor and scraping three randomly selected tubes with a flexible plastic strip some residual biomass was not accounted for the average weight of collected biomass was recorded and extrapolated for the total number of illuminated tubes although the biomass sampling and processing was generally the same for each harvest slight differences might have resulted in more or less water loss which can affect the

attached biomass was measured to determine a bchl ppb ratio mgbchl gppb vs 1 the amount of suspended matter corresponding to ppb biomass gppb vs l 1 was estimated by using this ratio statistical analysis 1 way and 2 way anova was done with anovan command in matlab to compare the metal contents of the biomass the principal component analysis pca command was followed by anovan in matlab in general influent variability is expressed as standard deviation in brackets outputs and calculated parameters are expressed as 95 confidence interval based on a two tailed t test 3 results 3 1 biofilm photobioreactor process performance 3 1 1 continuous operation in the first 7 days of the continuous operation the color of the wastewater changed to reddish fig 2 a while ppb biomass confirmed via microbial analysis attached in purple mats around the perspex tubes fig 2b indicating effective ir selection on submerged illuminated surfaces following the start up and enrichment an average of 42 tcod and 70 34 and 39 of soluble cod nitrogen and phosphorous were removed over 28 days day 16 44 fig 3 a the volumetric cod conversion was 1 1 0 2 gtcod l 1 d 1 and 0 66 gscod l 1 d 1 with a sludge loading rate of 0 9 gcod gvs 1 while the mass balance based areal productivity over the same period was 12 4 5 6 gvs m 2 d 1 the actual harvested biomass was 50 lower 5 6 3 2 gvs m 2 d 1 this discrepancy which also affected the conversion rates was caused by scum formation in the headspace of the reactor due to the gas recycle fig 2c in addition the ppb biofilm resuspended in the bulk liquid after wiping and was not effectively recovered however as described in section 2 3 2 the tcod measurements before and after wiping allowed for the calculation of the attached biomass the time series data is provided in fig s3 3 1 2 batch operation due to the relatively poor operation in continuous mode the reactor operation was switched to batch mode during the first 3 batches phase bii a the gas recycle still resulted in a scum layer fig 2c tcod removal rates of up to 1 7 g l 1d 1 was a result of this scum build up rather than biomass growth and only 20 of the cod removed was recovered as biomass fig 3b after this the mixing was changed to liquid recirculation thus for batches 4 6 a 3 d batch cycle resulted in volumetric removals of 193 21 and 2 6 mg l 1d 1 for scod tn and tp resulting in 66 cod 43 n and 41 p removals at a vlr of 0 7 gtcod l 1 d 1 fig 3b areal productivities of 5 8 2 7 gvs m 2 d 1 based on cod mass balance were achieved with 70 of this being recovered via manual harvesting at 10 6 dry matter dm the average vfa reactor concentrations at tend of 20 mgcod l 1 indicated that hydrolysis was rate limiting which likely affected the bioavailability and consequently biomass yields biomass recovery manual harvest was underestimated due to the relative small amounts harvested per tube 45 mgvs and residual losses on the wiper gloves tubes and spatula in addition to the attached biomass the suspended ppb growth accounted for 3 4 2 3 gvs m 2 d 1 determined via the bchl vs ratio allowing a total areal productivity of 9 2 2 3 gvs m 2 d 1 for batches 7 12 bii c d the change of batch length from 3 d to 2 d increased the vlr to 1 7 gtcod l 1d 1 at 2 d srt a liquid recycle of 0 6 l min 1 batches 7 9 bii c resulted in a reduction of cod tn and tp removals but more than doubled the removal rates per unit reactor volume compared to previous batches scod was removed at 522 82 mg l 1 d 1 while tn and tp removal increased to 44 11 and 4 5 0 8 mg l 1d 1 apparent areal biofilm productivity increased to 11 5 gvs m 2 d 1 of which 6 6 0 5 gvs m 2 d 1 n 6 was harvested fig 3c in combination with 7 0 1 5 gvs m 2 d 1 of suspended growth the total areal productivity was 18 5 1 5 gvs m 2 d 1 more than 60 of the ppb biomass grew attached and was harvested at 13 1 dm compared to 10 2 at 3 d an increase of the recycle rates to 3 0 l min 1 for batches 10 12 bii d resulted in similar removals and removal rates compared to bii c the same applies to the areal productivities where the total apparent areal productivity was 17 0 gvs m 2 d 1 and 60 grew as attached biofilm this indicates little or no effect of the recycle rates on the performance or the biofilm however the biomass was harvested at 20 dm with peaks of up to 32 4 dm the latter was caused by a small delay minutes in harvesting which resulted in evaporation and water dripping off end of batch tend average vfa cod was 14 mg l 1 with limited variation 3 2 biomass characteristics of the attached and suspended fractions for the application of harvested biomass as scp in any type of feed e g to substitute fishmeal in aquaculture feeds the consistency of the biomass over time determines the usability of the product and its value for the manufacturer table 2 shows the average ppb biomass composition of the attached and suspended biomass fractions raw data of the biomass composition are attached as electronic sm the attached ppb biomass was harvested at dry matter concentrations between 12 and 16 and contained around 644 41 mgcrude protein cp gvs 1 batch and continuous with a total amino acid content of 590 122 mg gvs 1 n 7 table s2 based on the average areal biomass productivity of the last 6 batches bii c d fig 3c this cp content results in an attached production of 6 9 0 7 gcp m 2 d 1 or 322 33 gcp m 3 d 1 representing 60 of the scod fed the composition of the attached biomass over each harvest was not significantly different in terms of the tcod vs vs ts cp n p bchl and carotenoids p 0 05 the same applied to the principal components metal composition p 0 6 the organic fraction was over 96 vs of ts in the harvested biomass which was substantially higher compared to the wastewater itself 70 vs of ts in contrast the suspended biomass contained less protein and amino acids 570 and 277 5 114 mg gvs 1 and more inerts 62 vs ts as for the biofilm fraction the constituents in suspended fractions were not significantly different over time batch and continuous however attached and suspended fractions were significantly different from each other cp tn tp bchl and carotenoids all 0 005 the same applies to the metal contents p 0 05 most of the elements determined via icp oes where lower in the biofilm compared to the suspended fraction 12 98 8 lower while average aluminium and zinc were up 6 5 more concentrated in the biofilm note the confidence intervals for relevant metals such as al as co pb se and zn were large table s3 and the icp results are therefore only indicative however this indicates that minerals are preserved in suspension which is further underlined by the vs content in the suspended biomass which was comparable to the red meat processing wastewater 3 3 microbial community the main identified ppb genera included purple non sulfur bacteria pnsb such as rhodobacter sp and rhodopseudomonas sp as well as purple sulfur bacteria psb including thiobaca sp and allochromatium sp which have been previously reported in engineered wastewater treatment systems hülsen et al 2018b the microbial analysis of the attached and suspended biomass in the bpbr confirmed the dominance of ppb with up to 77 and 56 of relative abundances in the biofilm and the reactor liquid fig 4 the biofilm had generally higher relative abundances compared to the suspension at tend a pca analysis showed that the incolum at t0 and the suspension at tend had similar principal components e g b2 6 and 9 while the biofilm at tend shifted away from both fig s4 the pca plot also shows a general shift from rhodopseudomonas sp in the first 6 batches towards rhodobacter sp in the last 6 batches which indicates an effect of the shortened batch length from 3 to 2 d this coincided with a weak correlation of batch length and the realtive abundance of rhodopseudomonas sp at tend r 0 62 other than that there was no significant correlation of biofilm or suspended ppb rhodobacter rhodopseudomonas and non ppb relative abundances with conversion rates harvested biomass or batch conditions table s4 in addition to the relative high ppb abundance common anaerobes were present as flanking community including methanobrevibacter sp and methanobacterium sp the realtive abundance of methanobrevibacter sp decreased from an average 7 7 at t0 to 1 7 and 3 1 at tend in suspension and the biofilm while relative abundances of methanobacterium sp maintained below 0 13 which is in line with the low methane concentrations in the headspace 4 discussion 4 1 suspended vs attached biomass ppb as scp here we showed that a bpbr can generate ppb biomass with high protein content on a complex wastewater with substantial fraction of feed cod to recovered biofilm the advantages of the biofilm are high crude protein and amino acid contents harvestability and up concentration as well as product consistency the amino acid composition of the biofilm compares well with a mixed culture ppb profile grown on poultry processing wastewater is higher compared to chlorella sp but lower than fishmeal table s3 the biofilm also contained 20 mgbchl and 10 mg total carotenoids per gvs bchl carotenoids ratio of 2 1 which is higher compared to values reported in literature carlozzi and sacchi 2001 de lima et al 2011 both are potentially valuable immuno nutritional feed components morris et al 2009 and have the potential to increase the overall value beyond the basic protein value higher protein amino acid and pigment contents in the biofilm are in line with improved relative abundances of ppb relative to the suspension 43 ppb in suspended vs 57 in attached this is likely attributed to changing growth conditions e g reduced light supply in suspension due to shading after biofilm formation in fact it seems possible to stear the ppb community towards rhodobacter and or rhodopseudomonas indeed a shift in relative abundance towards rhodobacter sp has recently been attributed to a shorter srt 2 d in a photobioreactor alloul et al 2019 at the moment both genera are desired effective photoheterotrophs in a treatment system but in the future this might become relevant e g for fine chemical production in terms of undesired components such as metals the biofilm had generally lower average contents compared to the suspended fraction but accumulated zinc and aluminium biosorption of these components has been reported for rhodobacter sp and rhodopseudomonas sp magnin et al 2014 nguyen et al 2018 aluminium is not a particular issue from the perspective of toxicity but zinc may have positive or negative effects depending on the target application the biofilm compositions achieved here for relevant heavy metals as cr cu pb and zn were higher compared to commonly used aquafeed ingredients such as dried fish solubles choline maize pregel wholemeal flour wheat gluten fishmeal poultry meal and blood meal see table s3 for detailed comparison but may be manageable when formulated e g zn is added to some feeds ppb biomass might be applicable as bulk feed component in fish feed but it is unlikely to substitute 100 of the fishmeal in a commercial feed as several amino acids are less abundant e g methionine and lysine table s2 indeed this has been shown in barramundi feed trials where 100 substitution resulted in significantly less weight gain compared to the control while 66 and 33 showed no significant differences over 47 days delamare deboutteville et al 2019 several other factors have to be determined to assess the product safety e g toxin pathogen xenobiotic and nucleic acid contents before ppb or microbial biomass in general can be applied as protein rich feed component however the ability to produce a consistent protein rich product over time is a prerequisite this has been addressed in this work it is of course desirable to utilise clean streams to minimise product quality issues related to biological or chemical hazards and the here described concept can easily be transferred to these streams 4 2 significance for industrial applications of ppb as scp the bpbr removes moderate amounts of cod n and p while generating a consistent ppb dominated biofilm consistency is crucial for a value estimation as feed feed additive or supplement which has to be supported by feed trials the results show that the organic fraction of the harvested attached biomass is with 96 vs of ts almost independent from the wastewater composition 60 70 in the influent we argue this enables broad application of the ppb scp technology and advances this concept from niche markets to the agri industry in general this is supported by recent work including ppb applications at temperate 10 c hülsen et al 2016a and saline conditions hülsen et al 2019 qin et al 2017 and the treatment of a variety of agri industrial effluents including poultry sugar red meat and dairy processing hülsen et al 2018a as well as food processing chiemchaisri et al 2008 chitapornpan et al 2013 depending on the wastewater source the advantages for attached systems may be enhanced if containing very high solids e g from a piggery one can argue whether this wastewater would be the best choice as easier degradable food processing wastewaters are likely better suited in this context continuous and batch modes are feasible to grow ppb as attached biofilm batch mode was far more effective for harvesting the biofilm as in continuous mode the biofilm disintegrated and partly redissolved which limits the actual biomass recovery a way to rectify this and to produce a stable and compact biofilm might be obtained with adjusted mixing and shear there is however no literature about mixed culture ppb biofilm formation and the effects of shear while higher liquid recirculation and increased hydrodynamic shear are known to generate a more compact stable and denser biofilm liu and tay 2002 in this study a 5 fold increase of the recirculation rates had no effect on the performance and the biomass productivities bii c and d in this context the role of light should be studied which might potentially be more relevant than shear analysis of the data presented here indicated positive correlations of the vlr with tcod scod tn and tp removal rates and biofilm productivities r 0 8 and hence negative correlation of these with batch length table s5 the removal rates were further positively correlated with each other r 0 8 as well as with amount of harvested biomass r 0 8 however the low vfa levels at tend indicate that hydrolysis is limiting which is due to the particulate nature of the wastewater and means that prefermentation is a better option than in reactor hydrolysis which reduces vlr harvesting after draining via wiping seems feasible at reasonably high areal productivities in the bpbr attached 7 0 10 and suspended 7 4 gvs m 2d 1 well in line with data obtained in microalgal systems apel et al 2017 arbib et al 2017 eustance et al 2016 lee et al 2014 min et al 2014 slade and bauen 2013 tang and hu 2016 the attached productivities of ppb are on the higher end compared with those reported for algal biofilm systems of 1 28 2 6 gdw m 2 d 1 johnson and wen 2010a 5 5 gdw m 2 d 1 gross et al 2015 and 4 5 7 6 gdw m 2 d 1 fica and sims 2016 this also affects the crude protein production rates which are up to 6 9 0 7 g m 2 d 1 or 322 33 g m 3 d 1 enabling the recovery of 60 of the scod fed as protein a major advantage of biofilm technology is the high dry matter content 16 of the harvested attached biomass it might be feasible to dry the biomass on the surface which was indicated by the dry matter content of the last three batches peak of 32 4 dm bii d this is highly relevant for potential operational costs savings as harvesting in photosynthetic systems can make up 20 30 of the total production costs mainly due to the diluted biomass rawat et al 2011 it is perceivable that up concentration equipment such as dissolved air flotation centrifuges filters vacuum dep bed cross flow surface pressure etc or settling tanks can be omitted capital and operational savings when harvesting biofilm also considering the dm content of the product after these steps is rarely 15 pragya et al 2013 in addition flocculants are not required which adds to the savings while the attached ppb faction can effectively be harvested with an engineered system the suspended fraction will be used to re inoculate e g a parallel reactor but will ultimately leave the system with the effluent unless recovered however recovery will add all costs associated with microalgae harvesting barros et al 2015 singh and patidar 2018 nonetheless the effluent discharge of suspended ppb will decrease the overall cod tn and tp removals but might not be a problem when ppb technology is located upstream of an existing treatment train we showed this is possible and might be useful to minimise additional costs for an already capital intense closed photobioreactor compared to ponds and standard tanks in fact such a system could be used to retrofit existing plants in a type of flow through set up that would result in upstream scp production followed by 30 50 reduced cod tn and tp loads enabling either smaller plants or increased capacity e g production expansion for existing plants to increase the overall removal capacities pre and post treatments as usually employed for this type of wastewater might be applied an upstream preacidification step would likely increase the overall removals potentially shortening the batch length increasing productivities as the influent solids fats proteins would be transformed into immediately bioavailable vfas and nh4 n this could further be combined aerobic polishing remaining cod can be used for denitrification after nh4 n oxidation and ormembrane filtration which will retain all solid cod tn and tp and substantially lower the discharge concentrations this has been reported as viable option and might be considered in a ppb system hülsen et al 2016b however this will add capital and operational costs and seems only applicable if post treatment is not required 4 3 economics of recovery this study also utilised a reduced light input with 5 8 w m 2 being substantially lower compared to other studies 18 50 w m 2 alloul et al 2019 garcía et al 2019 hülsen et al 2016b hülsen et al 2018b however the volumetric productivity of 0 9 kg m 3 d 1 at 17 gvs m 2 d 1 resulted in an input of around 8 2 mw h tonne 1 29 5 gj tonne 1 which is actually higher compared to 22 gj tonne 1 produced at higher irradiances hülsen et al 2018b when considering the attached growth only 10 gvs m 2 d 1 the energy increases to 13 9 mw h or 50 gj tonne 1 assuming a reasonably low energy price of 0 1 kw h 1 the illumination alone would result in 1400 tonne 1 which we consider as prohibitive not to mention the capital costs of the lamps for scp production ppb have to be grown outside on natural light to eliminate the illumination costs however for fine chemicals such as carotenoids e g lycopene or specific polyhydroxyalkanotes pha artificial illumination might still be an option 4 3 1 further considerations this study represents a proof of concept of the attached growth of ppb in non sterlie environments photobioreactors have been designed for microalgae production vo et al 2019 and it is perceivable that the ppb technology can be transferred to these pbrs open or closed for attached growth flat plate or tubular systems are likely feasible e g growth on walls has been reported as a nuisance hülsen et al 2016b the cost considerations for a bpbr are likely similar to algal set ups however some aspect will be highly advantageous these include no product inhibition due to o2 no co2 requirement no or little ph changes primary instead of secondary or tertiary treatment more substrate dominant ppb cultures instead of diluted albazod less predation no aerobic protozoa no predators known yet lower required light input and consequences for shading the latter has the potential to reduce seasonal effects of productivities e g less light in winter month but requires the determination of daily production measurement averaged over at least a year this might also play an important role for photo inhibition but requires outdoors testing in addition the bpbr achieves reasonable attached areal productivities and high organic solid concentrations in the product and enables a consistent product composition these advantages will affect both the operational and capital costs of a potential ppb production system some of the disadvantages include the likely requirements of filtered sunlight i e the ir fraction which might or might not be required poor ir penetration at ppb biomass concentrations of 0 1 g l 1 50 of light will be absorbed in the top 3 4 cm of the lab reactor with 15 of light reaching the bottom of the chamber hülsen et al 2018b as well as the currently embryonic state of research and scale up and limited data about feed trials and safety 5 conclusions purple phototrophic bacteria can effectively be grown as attached biofilm while removing up to 66 of cod and 42 of tn and tp the realised volumetric conversion rate of around 1 0 gcod l 1 d 1 resulted in total areal productivities between 15 and 20 gvs m 2 d 1 with 57 growing as a biofilm and harvested at up to 16 dm the harvested biofilm is characterised by a consistent quality with very high organic content 96 much higher than the wastewater which allows for a decoupling of wastewater and biofilm characteristics artificial illumination energy was reduced but still adds considerable costs which have to be reduced to lower the ppb productions costs outdoor production offers a potential solution declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

composition is highly relevant for the manufacturer and ultimately determines the value as feed feed additive or supplement keywords purple phototrophic bacteria wastewater biofilm single cell protein

be used in restricted or unrestricted applications include food processing effluents such as dairy beverage brewery and possibly abattoir effluents pikaar et al 2018 ponsano et al 2003 phototrophic organisms such as microalgae or purple phototrophic bacteria ppb have been applied to produce biomass from these sources chitapornpan et al 2013 maizatul et al 2017 both ppb and microalgae are characterised by high carbon yields and high nutrient capture potentials with catabolic energy derived from artificial or natural light the vast majority of microalgal biomass today is grown in suspended cultures in open high rate algal ponds hrap the main advantages of hrap are reasonable areal productivities 6 8 realistic 42 idealistic g m 2 d 1 moheimani and borowitzka 2006 richardson et al 2014 and low capital costs per m2 40 m 2 young et al 2017 disadvantages especially when using wastewater as substrate include culture instabilities with periodic loss of the target organism flynn et al 2017 buchanan et al 2018 as well as biomass contamination with undesired wastewater components these include inert particles solids heavy metals xenobiotics and pathogens that tend to accumulate in the suspended biomass as such it is almost impossible to separate undesired wastewater components from the scp product other drawbacks include the large footprint of sedimentation requirements for drying and high operational costs with harvesting and drying often dominating overall cost richardson et al 2014 growing the biomass as an attached biofilm can effectively address many of these limitations as attached films on submerged surfaces gao et al 2015 biological aggregates granules tiron et al 2017 as well as immobilisation methods e g in alginate or carrageen vasilieva et al 2016 growing in a biofilm reduces unwanted wastewater constituents e g mineral solids as these tend to remain in the main wastewater or suspended biomass biofilm growth has the potential to substantially reduce the harvesting costs for example granular microalgal bacteria biomass has a 2000 times higher settling velocity compared to suspended biomass 0 54 10 2 vs 12 m h 1 tiron et al 2017 while biofilms and immobilised cells can be harvested up to 100 times more concentrated 100 g l 1 compared to 1 0 g l 1 which simultaneously reduces harvesting and dewatering costs ozkan et al 2012 pierobon et al 2017 in addition biofilms granules attached immobilised can provide refuge against predation matz 2007 the main disadvantage of biofilm reactors compared with suspended systems per m2 are capital costs enzing et al 2014 immobilisation and biofilm systems can decrease areal productivities 0 72 7 6 gdw m 2 d 1 fica and sims 2016 johnson and wen 2010b ozkan et al 2012 pierobon et al 2017 compared to suspended cultures due to photo inhibition shading and diffusion limitations including co2 from the atmosphere kesaano and sims 2014 despite this photo biofilm systems are a promising way

et al 2007 microalgae biofilm systems have received considerable attention in the literature schnurr and allen 2015 while purple phototrophic bacteria ppb have received very limited attention with one assessment in an internal overflow reactor prachanurak et al 2014 suspended ppb systems for primary treatment are more susceptible to source contamination than microalgae applied for polishing and microbial dilution by other bacteria due to the need for a hydrolytic acidogenic bacterial flanking community especially when pre treatments such as pre acidification and solid removal are omitted a biofilm based ppb system would a minimise source wastewater contamination since much of the contaminants remain in the mainline b limit flanking community due to hydrolysis and acidogenesis occurring in the suspended material and c enhance the ability to directly harvest the biofilm at a relatively high concentration through mechanical means this study aims to determine the applicability of a biofilm based ppb system for the treatment of pre settled red meat processing wastewater a closed photobioreactor with submerged infra red irradiated surfaces was used key questions were a what fraction of the total biomass is incorporated into the biofilm b what is the biofilm composition and is it suitable as a single cell protein product and c how does this compare to traditional protein

the wastewater contained substantial amounts of particulates e g 2 2 g l 1 of total solids ts with 70 of volatile solids vs the detailed composition including metals and a comparison with literature values are shown in table s1 we note that wastewater is discharged at around 38 c on site and some fats are liquid at this temperature these fats aggregate and form solids at 4 c which accumulate in a supernatant layer 2 2 inoculum the anaerobic reactor was inoculated with 10 v v of ppb from a domestic wastewater enrichment culture around 1 0 gvs l 1 as described elsewhere hülsen et al 2016a according to sequencing see below the inoculum consisted of 50 ppb which was dominated by rhodobacter sp 31 2 3 photobioreactor configuration and operation 2 3 1 biofilm photobioreactor configuration the biofilm photobioreactor bpbr for attached growth was comprised of a 3 0 l cylindrical t1 perspex main body diameter x height 150 250 mm with a flanged conical bottom a schematic drawing and a picture of the system are shown in fig 1 the reactor lid was flanged to the vessel and contained 17 sealed hollow perspex tubes diameter 15 13 mm od id length 250 mm which were submerged 180 mm in the reactor liquid resulting in an effective illuminated surface of 0 14 m2 and an illuminated surface to volume ratio of 46 7 m2 m 3 tubes were illuminated with two flexible dimmable ir led strips ip68 ir 850 nm led smd 3528 600 12 v dc demo photoelectric tech wuxi co ltd china placed against each other to irradiate the bpbr from inside out 5 8 16 0 w m 2 the led strips were controlled via a power supply tenma 72 2710 programmable dc power supply premier farnell uk the field distribution of the irradiance was determined by taking various measurements along the irradiated surface using a stellarnet blue wave spectroradiometer the reactor was further equipped with an internal rubber wiper system for biomass harvesting fig s1 the bpbr was mixed via the conical bottom with a compressor

reactor was operated at room temperature 22 c but with heating from the leds dependent on the light intensity applied detailed below the operational period was divided into a continuous phase continuous bi and two batch operation phases 3d and 2d batches at t 0 the reactor was inoculated with previously enriched ppb and operated in continuous mode with no biomass harvesting at 2 days hydraulic retention time hrt and a volumetric loading rate vlr of 2 6 gcod l 1d 1 mixing was achieved via a gas recycle at 6 0 l min 1 during start up first 16 d the light intensity was set to 16 w m

po4 p ts vs were measured in the liquid phase influent and effluent during this phase the led illumination led to a water temperature of 36 c while the ph was 7 2 this temperature increase naturally limits the applicable irradiance in the system the attached ppb biomass was harvested as follows wiping and collecting the attached biomass from the conical bottom of the bpbr were carried out in situ after stopping the mixing by using the internal rubber wiper alternatively the wiper was used to re suspend the attached biomass within the water column and the liquid phase was re analysed post harvesting to determine tcod tkn tp and ts vs by subtracting the pre harvesting concentration from the post harvesting concentrations following the continuous operation batch wise bpbr operation with 12 batches commenced the light intensity was lowered to an average distribution of 5 8 w m 2 fig s2 setting the reactor temperature at 33 c the batch phase was subdivided in four phases with 6 batches done at 3d srt and 6 batches at 2d srt batch 2d the operational details are shown in table 1 at the end of each batch tend the biomass was harvested manually by removing the tubes from the reactor and scraping three randomly selected tubes with a flexible plastic strip some residual biomass was not accounted for the average weight of collected biomass was recorded and extrapolated for the total

comparative data analysis and graph generation in excel considering major 1 contributing functional groups 2 7 data processing and statistical analysis cumulative mass balances for the continuous operation period were performed on tcod tn and tp to determine losses and recovery potentials linear interpolation was used where gaps existed in daily data interp1 command in matlab cumulative recovery was calculated from the sum of mass flows in sludge and effluent divided by mass flow in the influent recoveries per batch were similarly calculated the areal productivity gvs m 2 d 1 was determined a by weighing and characterising the actual harvested ppb biomass designated attached harvested and b by cod mass balances where the concentration difference of tcod at t0 and tend x reactor volume was assumed to be present as attached biofilm designated as attached mass balance the latter considers anaerobic losses through methane as biomass production but we note that ch4 concentrations were very low 0 8 the areal productivity of suspended ppb biomass bpbr was estimated based on the concentration of bchl a in the reactor liquid for this purpose the bchl content of the attached biomass was measured to determine a bchl ppb ratio mgbchl gppb vs 1 the amount of suspended matter corresponding to ppb biomass gppb vs l 1 was estimated by using this ratio statistical

photobioreactor process performance 3 1 1 continuous operation in the first 7 days of the continuous operation the color of the wastewater changed to reddish fig 2 a while ppb biomass confirmed via microbial analysis attached in purple mats around the perspex tubes fig 2b indicating effective ir selection on submerged illuminated surfaces following the start up and enrichment an average of 42 tcod and 70 34 and 39 of soluble cod nitrogen and phosphorous were removed over 28 days day 16 44 fig 3 a the volumetric cod conversion was 1 1 0 2 gtcod l 1 d 1 and 0 66 gscod l 1 d 1 with a sludge loading rate of 0 9 gcod gvs 1 while the mass balance based areal productivity over the same period was 12 4 5 6 gvs m 2 d 1 the actual harvested biomass was 50 lower 5 6 3 2 gvs m 2 d 1 this discrepancy which also affected the conversion rates was caused by scum formation in the headspace of the reactor due to the gas recycle fig 2c in addition the ppb biofilm resuspended in the bulk liquid after wiping and was not effectively recovered however as described in section 2 3 2 the tcod measurements before and after wiping allowed for the calculation of the attached biomass the time series data is provided in fig s3 3 1 2 batch operation due to the relatively poor operation in continuous mode the reactor operation was switched to batch mode during the first 3 batches phase bii a the gas recycle still resulted in a scum layer fig 2c tcod removal rates of up to 1 7 g l 1d 1 was a result of this scum build up rather than biomass growth and only 20 of the cod removed was recovered as biomass fig 3b after this the mixing was changed to liquid recirculation thus for batches 4 6 a 3 d batch cycle resulted in volumetric removals of 193 21 and 2 6 mg l 1d 1 for scod tn and tp resulting in 66 cod 43 n and 41 p removals at a vlr of 0 7 gtcod l 1 d 1 fig 3b areal productivities of 5 8 2 7 gvs m 2 d 1 based on cod mass balance were achieved with 70 of this being recovered via manual harvesting at 10 6 dry matter dm the average vfa reactor concentrations at tend of 20 mgcod l 1 indicated that hydrolysis was rate limiting which likely affected the bioavailability and consequently biomass yields biomass recovery manual harvest was underestimated due to the relative small amounts harvested per tube 45 mgvs and residual losses on the wiper gloves tubes and spatula in addition to the attached biomass the suspended ppb growth accounted for 3 4 2 3 gvs m 2 d 1 determined via the bchl vs ratio allowing a total areal productivity of 9 2 2 3 gvs m 2 d 1 for batches 7 12 bii c d the change of batch length from 3 d to 2 d increased the vlr to 1 7 gtcod l 1d 1 at 2 d srt a liquid recycle of 0 6 l min 1 batches 7 9 bii c resulted in a reduction of cod tn and tp removals but more than doubled the removal rates per unit reactor volume compared to previous batches scod was removed at 522 82 mg l 1 d 1 while tn and tp removal increased to 44 11 and 4 5 0 8 mg l 1d 1 apparent areal biofilm productivity increased to 11 5 gvs m 2 d 1 of which 6 6 0 5 gvs m 2 d 1 n 6 was harvested fig 3c in combination with 7 0 1 5 gvs m 2 d 1 of suspended growth the total areal productivity was 18 5 1 5 gvs m 2 d 1 more than 60 of the ppb biomass grew attached and was harvested at 13 1 dm compared to 10 2 at 3 d an increase of the recycle rates to 3 0 l min 1 for batches 10 12 bii d resulted in similar removals and removal rates compared to bii c the same applies to the areal productivities where the total apparent areal productivity was 17 0 gvs m 2 d 1 and 60 grew as attached biofilm this indicates little or no effect of the recycle rates on the performance or the biofilm however the biomass was harvested at 20 dm with peaks of up to 32 4 dm the latter was caused by a small delay minutes in harvesting which resulted in evaporation and water dripping off end of batch tend average vfa cod was 14 mg l 1 with limited variation 3 2 biomass characteristics of the attached and suspended fractions for the application of harvested biomass as scp in any type of feed e g to substitute fishmeal in aquaculture feeds the consistency of the biomass over time determines the usability of the product and its value for the manufacturer table 2 shows the average ppb biomass composition of the attached and suspended biomass fractions raw data of the biomass composition are attached as electronic sm the attached ppb biomass was harvested at dry matter concentrations between 12 and 16 and contained around 644 41 mgcrude protein cp gvs 1 batch and continuous with a total amino acid content of 590 122 mg gvs 1 n 7 table s2 based on the average areal biomass productivity of the last 6 batches bii c d fig 3c this cp content results in an attached production of 6 9 0 7 gcp m 2 d 1 or 322 33 gcp m 3 d 1 representing 60 of the scod fed the composition of the attached biomass over each harvest was not significantly different in terms of the tcod vs vs ts cp n p bchl and carotenoids p 0 05 the same applied to the principal components metal composition p 0 6 the organic fraction was over 96 vs of ts in the harvested biomass which was substantially higher compared to the wastewater itself 70 vs of ts in contrast the suspended biomass contained less protein and amino acids 570 and 277 5 114 mg gvs 1 and more inerts 62 vs ts as for the biofilm fraction the constituents in suspended fractions were not significantly different over time batch and continuous however attached and suspended fractions were significantly different from each other cp tn tp bchl and carotenoids all 0 005 the same applies to the metal contents p 0 05 most of the elements determined via icp oes where lower in the biofilm compared to the suspended fraction 12 98 8 lower while average aluminium and zinc were up 6 5 more concentrated in the biofilm note the confidence intervals for relevant metals such as al as co pb se and zn were large table s3 and the icp results are therefore only indicative however this indicates that minerals are preserved in suspension which is further underlined by the vs content in the suspended biomass which was comparable to the red meat processing wastewater 3 3 microbial community the main identified ppb genera included purple non sulfur bacteria pnsb such as rhodobacter sp and rhodopseudomonas sp as well as purple sulfur bacteria psb including thiobaca sp and allochromatium sp which have been previously reported in engineered wastewater treatment systems hülsen et al 2018b the microbial analysis of the attached and suspended biomass in the bpbr confirmed the dominance of ppb with up to 77 and 56 of relative abundances in the biofilm and the reactor liquid fig 4 the biofilm had generally higher relative abundances compared to the suspension at tend a pca analysis showed that the incolum at t0 and the suspension at tend had similar principal components e g b2 6 and 9 while the biofilm at tend shifted away from both fig s4 the pca plot also shows a general shift from rhodopseudomonas sp in the first 6 batches towards rhodobacter sp in the last 6 batches which indicates an effect of the shortened batch length from 3 to 2 d this coincided with a weak correlation of batch length and the realtive abundance of rhodopseudomonas sp at tend r 0 62 other than that there was no significant correlation of biofilm or suspended ppb rhodobacter rhodopseudomonas and non ppb relative abundances with conversion rates harvested biomass or batch conditions table s4 in addition to the relative high ppb abundance common anaerobes were present as flanking community including methanobrevibacter sp and methanobacterium sp the realtive abundance of methanobrevibacter sp decreased from an average 7 7 at t0 to 1 7 and 3 1 at tend in suspension and the biofilm while relative abundances of methanobacterium sp maintained below 0 13 which is in line with the low methane concentrations in the headspace 4 discussion 4 1 suspended vs attached biomass ppb as scp here we showed that a bpbr can generate ppb biomass with high protein content on a complex wastewater with substantial fraction of feed cod to recovered biofilm the advantages of the biofilm are high crude protein and amino acid contents harvestability and up concentration as well as product consistency the amino acid composition of the biofilm compares well with a mixed culture ppb profile grown on poultry processing wastewater is higher compared to chlorella sp but lower than fishmeal table s3 the biofilm also contained 20 mgbchl and 10 mg total carotenoids per gvs bchl carotenoids ratio of 2 1 which is higher compared to values reported in literature carlozzi and sacchi 2001 de lima et al 2011 both are potentially valuable immuno nutritional feed components morris et al 2009 and have the potential to increase the overall value beyond the basic protein value higher protein amino acid and pigment contents in the biofilm are in line with improved relative abundances of ppb relative to the suspension 43 ppb in suspended vs 57 in attached this is likely attributed to changing growth conditions e g reduced light supply in suspension due to shading after biofilm formation in fact it seems possible to stear the ppb community towards rhodobacter and or rhodopseudomonas indeed a shift in relative abundance towards rhodobacter sp has recently been attributed to a shorter srt 2 d in a photobioreactor alloul et al 2019 at the moment both genera are desired effective photoheterotrophs in a treatment system but in the future this might become relevant e g for fine chemical production in terms of undesired components such as metals the biofilm had generally lower average contents compared to the suspended fraction but accumulated zinc and aluminium biosorption of these components has been reported for rhodobacter sp and rhodopseudomonas sp magnin et al 2014 nguyen et al 2018 aluminium is not a particular issue from the perspective of toxicity but zinc may have positive or negative effects depending on the target application the biofilm compositions achieved here for relevant heavy metals as cr cu pb and zn were higher compared to commonly used aquafeed ingredients such as dried fish solubles choline maize pregel wholemeal flour wheat gluten fishmeal poultry meal and blood meal see table s3 for detailed comparison but may be manageable when formulated e g zn is added to some feeds ppb biomass might be applicable as bulk feed component in fish feed but it is unlikely to substitute 100 of the fishmeal in a commercial feed as several amino acids are less abundant e g methionine and lysine table s2 indeed this has been shown in barramundi feed trials where 100 substitution resulted in significantly less weight gain compared to the control while 66 and 33 showed no significant differences over 47 days delamare deboutteville et al 2019 several other factors have to be determined to assess the product safety e g toxin pathogen xenobiotic and nucleic acid contents before ppb or microbial biomass in general can be applied as protein rich feed component however the ability to produce a consistent protein rich product over time is a prerequisite this has been addressed in this work it is of course desirable to utilise clean streams to minimise product quality issues related to biological or chemical hazards and the here described concept can easily be transferred to these streams 4 2 significance for industrial applications of ppb as scp the bpbr removes moderate amounts of cod n and p while generating a consistent ppb dominated biofilm consistency is crucial for a value estimation as feed feed additive or supplement which has to be supported by feed trials the results show that the organic fraction of the harvested attached biomass is with 96 vs of ts almost independent from the wastewater composition 60 70 in the influent we argue this enables broad application of the ppb scp technology and advances this concept from niche markets to the agri industry in general this is supported by recent work including ppb applications at temperate 10 c hülsen et al 2016a and saline conditions hülsen et al 2019 qin et al 2017 and the treatment of a variety of agri industrial effluents including poultry sugar red meat and dairy processing hülsen et al 2018a as well as food processing chiemchaisri et al 2008 chitapornpan et al 2013 depending on the wastewater source the advantages for attached systems may be enhanced if containing very high solids e g from a piggery one can argue whether this wastewater would be the best choice as easier degradable food processing wastewaters are likely better suited in this context continuous and batch modes are feasible to grow ppb as attached biofilm batch mode was far more effective for harvesting the biofilm as in continuous mode the biofilm disintegrated and partly redissolved which limits the actual biomass recovery a way to rectify this and to produce a stable and compact biofilm might be obtained with adjusted mixing and shear there is however no literature about mixed culture ppb biofilm formation and the effects of shear while higher liquid recirculation and increased hydrodynamic shear are known to generate a more compact stable and denser biofilm liu and tay 2002 in this study a 5 fold increase of the recirculation rates had no effect on the performance and the biomass productivities bii c and d in this context the role of light should be studied which might potentially be more relevant than shear analysis of the data presented here indicated positive correlations of the vlr with tcod scod tn and tp removal rates and biofilm productivities r 0 8 and hence negative correlation of these with batch length table s5 the removal rates were further positively correlated with each other r 0 8 as well as with amount of harvested biomass r 0 8 however the low vfa levels at tend indicate that hydrolysis is limiting which is due to the particulate nature of the wastewater and means that prefermentation is a better option than in reactor hydrolysis which reduces vlr harvesting after draining via wiping seems feasible at reasonably high areal productivities in the bpbr attached 7 0 10 and suspended 7 4 gvs m 2d 1 well in line with data obtained in microalgal systems apel et al 2017 arbib et al 2017 eustance et al 2016 lee et al 2014 min et al 2014 slade and bauen 2013 tang and hu 2016 the attached productivities of ppb are on the higher end compared with those reported for algal biofilm systems of 1 28 2 6 gdw m 2 d 1 johnson and wen 2010a 5 5 gdw m 2 d 1 gross et al 2015 and 4 5 7 6 gdw m 2 d 1 fica and sims 2016 this also affects the crude protein production rates which are up to 6 9 0 7 g m 2 d 1 or 322 33 g m 3 d 1 enabling the recovery of 60 of the scod fed as protein a major advantage of biofilm technology is the high dry matter content 16 of the harvested attached biomass it might be feasible to dry the biomass on the surface which was indicated by the dry matter content of the last three batches peak of 32 4 dm bii d this is highly relevant for potential operational costs savings as harvesting in photosynthetic systems can make up 20 30 of the total production costs mainly due to the diluted biomass rawat et al 2011 it is perceivable that up concentration equipment such as dissolved air flotation centrifuges filters vacuum dep bed cross flow surface pressure etc or settling tanks can be omitted capital and operational savings when harvesting biofilm also considering the dm content of the product after these steps is rarely 15 pragya et al 2013 in addition flocculants are not required which adds to the savings while the attached ppb faction can effectively be harvested with an engineered system the suspended fraction will be used to re inoculate e g a parallel reactor but will ultimately leave the system with the effluent unless recovered however recovery will add all costs associated with microalgae harvesting barros et al 2015 singh and patidar 2018 nonetheless the effluent discharge of suspended ppb will decrease the overall cod tn and tp removals but might not be a problem when ppb technology is located upstream of an existing treatment train we showed this is possible and might be useful to minimise additional costs for an already capital intense closed photobioreactor compared to ponds and standard tanks in fact such a system could be used to retrofit existing plants in a type of flow through set up that would result in upstream scp production followed by 30 50 reduced cod tn and tp loads enabling either smaller plants or increased capacity e g production expansion for existing plants to increase the overall removal capacities pre and post treatments as usually employed for this type of wastewater might be applied an upstream preacidification step would likely increase the overall removals potentially shortening the batch length increasing productivities as the influent solids fats proteins would be transformed into immediately bioavailable vfas and nh4 n this could further be combined aerobic polishing remaining cod can be used for denitrification after nh4 n oxidation and ormembrane filtration which will retain all solid cod tn and tp and substantially lower the discharge concentrations this has been reported as viable option and might be considered in a ppb system hülsen et al 2016b however this will add capital and operational costs and seems only applicable if post treatment is not required 4 3 economics of recovery this study also utilised a reduced light input with 5 8 w m 2 being substantially lower compared to other studies 18 50 w m 2 alloul et al 2019 garcía et al 2019 hülsen et al 2016b hülsen et al 2018b however the volumetric productivity of 0 9 kg m 3 d 1 at 17 gvs m 2 d 1 resulted in an input of around 8 2 mw h tonne 1 29 5 gj tonne 1 which is actually higher compared to 22 gj tonne 1 produced at higher irradiances hülsen et al 2018b when considering the attached growth only 10 gvs m 2 d 1 the energy increases to 13 9 mw h or 50 gj tonne 1 assuming a reasonably low energy price of 0 1 kw h 1 the illumination alone would result in 1400 tonne 1 which we consider as prohibitive not to mention the capital costs of the lamps for scp production ppb have to be grown outside on natural light to eliminate the illumination costs however for fine chemicals such as carotenoids e g lycopene or specific polyhydroxyalkanotes pha artificial illumination might still be an option 4 3 1 further considerations this study represents a proof of concept of the attached growth of ppb in non sterlie environments photobioreactors have been designed for microalgae production vo et al 2019 and it is perceivable that the ppb technology can be transferred to these pbrs open or closed for attached growth flat plate or tubular systems are likely feasible e g growth on walls has been reported as a nuisance hülsen et al 2016b the cost considerations for a bpbr are likely similar to algal set ups however some aspect will be highly advantageous these include no product inhibition due to o2 no co2 requirement no or little ph changes primary instead of secondary or tertiary treatment more substrate dominant ppb cultures instead of diluted albazod less predation no aerobic protozoa no predators known yet lower required light input and consequences for shading the latter has the potential to reduce seasonal effects of productivities e g less light in winter month but requires the determination of daily production measurement averaged over at least a year this might also play an important role for photo inhibition but requires outdoors testing in addition the bpbr achieves reasonable attached areal productivities and high organic solid concentrations in the product and enables a consistent product composition these advantages will affect both the operational and capital costs of a potential ppb production system some of the disadvantages include the likely requirements of filtered sunlight i e the ir fraction which might or might not be required poor ir penetration at ppb biomass concentrations of 0 1 g l 1 50 of light will be absorbed in the top 3 4 cm of the lab reactor with 15 of light reaching the bottom of the chamber hülsen et al 2018b as well as the currently embryonic state of research and scale up and limited data about feed trials and safety 5 conclusions purple phototrophic bacteria can effectively be grown as attached biofilm while removing up to 66 of cod and 42 of tn and tp the realised volumetric conversion rate of around 1 0 gcod l 1 d 1 resulted in total areal productivities between 15 and 20 gvs m 2 d 1 with 57 growing as a biofilm and harvested at up to 16 dm the harvested biofilm is characterised by a consistent quality with very high organic content 96 much higher than the wastewater which allows for a decoupling of wastewater and biofilm characteristics artificial illumination energy was reduced but still adds considerable costs which have to be reduced to lower the ppb productions costs outdoor production offers a potential solution declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

17854,persulfate fe based catalytic oxidation is considered as one of the most attractive strategy for the growing concerns of water pollution however the undesirable feiii feii redox cycle restrict them from attending the sustainable activity during practical applications this study was intended to develop a new strategy to regulate the redox cycles of feiii feii by introducing the second redox center of mos4 2 in the interlayers of fe based layered double hydroxide femgal mos4 ldh based on the first order kinetic model the fabricated femgal mos4 catalyst was 10 100 fold more reactive than the bench marked peroxymonosulfate pms activators including femgal ldhs and other widely reported nano catalysts such as co3o4 fe3o4 α mno2 cuo fe3o4 and fe3o4 the enhanced catalytic activity of femgal mos4 ldh was related to the continuous regeneration of active sites feii moiv excellent pms utilization efficiency and generation of abundant free radicals moreover the femgal mos4 pms system shows an effective ph range from 3 0 to 7 0 and the degradation kinetics of parahydroxy benzoic acid phb were not effected in the presence of huge amount of background electrolytes and natural organic matters based on the in situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy epr chemical scavengers xps analysis and gas chromatography couple with mass spectrometer gc ms a degradation pathway based on dominant free radicals so4 and oh passing through the redox cycles of feiii feii and movi moiv was proposed for pms activation we believe that this strategy of regulating the redox center through mos4 2 not only provides a base to prepare new materials with stable catalytic activity but also broaden the scope of fe based material for real application of contaminated water graphical abstract image 1 keywords advanced oxidation process fe persulfate redox center sr aop wastewater 1 introduction in recent years sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes sr aops have received increasing research interests for the treatment of pollutants from wastewater as compared to traditional hydroxyl oh radical based system so4 radicals demonstrate nearly the same oxidative ability with much longer reaction time and selectivity toward electron rich organic pollutants oh et al 2016 peroxymonsulfate pms and persulfate ps are the commonly applied oxidants to generate sulfate so4 radicals using different fe based catalysts including zerovalent iron zvi fe2 fe2o3 fe3o4 and mn fe3o4 cheng et al 2017a b tan et al 2014 2018 ji et al 2013 huang et al 2017 in general the efficiency of these catalytic systems depends upon the feasibility of redox reactions eqs 1 and 2 to generate so4 radicals after the homolytic cleavage of persulfate bond o o li et al 2018 1 feii hso5 feiii so4 oh 2 feiii hso5 feii so5 h 3 feiii 3oh fe oh 3 during the generation of reactive oxygen species ros the regeneration of feii after reacting pms eq 2 is much slower than the production of feiii eq 1 which unfortunately results the accumulation of feiii ions and the ineffective activation of pms zou et al 2013 li et al 2016 additionally the accumulated ferric ions as iron hydroxide eq 3 would stop the feiii feii cycles and thus leads to activity loss during the reaction by considering these drawbacks many researchers dedicated themselves to optimize the feiii feii cycles for fenton and sr aops systems the optimizing efforts of feiii feii cycles can be broadly classified into four categories i introduce uv light vermilyea and voelker 2009 or electricity liu et al 2007 which unavoidably increased the cost and energy loss ii adopt the pattern of transition metals based heterogeneous catalysts wang et al 2016 that avoids the formation of feiii sludge and extends the effective ph range however low reactivity extensive mass production in the treated matrix and complex recovery procedure prevent them from field application for instance cobalt based heterogonous catalysts were although considered very efficient persulfate activators but the toxicity issues of co2 ions resulted from the catalyst leaching restrict them from practical application iii add specific chemicals as co catalysts to compensate the shortcoming in sr aops for example using low molecular weight additives as electron donators ma et al 2006 including cistin li et al 2016 hydroxylamine zou et al 2013 edta xia et al 2018 protocatechuic acid qin et al 2015 ws2 dong et al 2018 and mos2 sheng et al 2019 etc to accelerate the redox cycles of fe iii fe ii with this strategy although the reaction rates were accelerated however the issues of homogenous system such as the optimal activity only at low ph 3 0 4 0 still remained the biggest problem additionally the possibility of secondary pollution resulted from the additional co catalysts and constant replenishment of co catalysts also restrict these systems from practical applications iv adopt the patterns of doping electron rich elements s n c compositing activated carbon or graphene with metal oxides for example pyrite fes2 mackinawite fes magnetic pyrrhotite sulphur doped materials s activated carbon cuco2s4 and ldh coupled with graphene oxides etc zhou et al 2018 liang et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 xia et al 2017 guo et al 2018 xu et al 2018 shahzad et al 2019 although these catalytic systems effectively activate persulfate without co catalysts however the complex synthetic steps and issues of stability resulted from the air oxidation still exist therefore for both economic and environmental interests it is necessary to develop a stable and high performance heterogeneous catalyst without the addition of co catalyst to improve the redox cycle of fe iii fe ii and correspondingly increase the utilization efficiency of pms and the overall efficiency of sr aops in this study a new strategy to enhance the redox properties of fe ii fe iii was proposed by enriching mos4 2 moiety in the protective interlayer space of fe based layered double hydroxide femgal ldh this fabricated femgal mos4 catalyst was found extremely reactive i e the reactivity rate was 10 100 times higher than the bench marked pms activators including femgal ldh other widely reported nano catalysts and co catalytic systems this excellent catalytic activity was related to the enriched sulphides that promoted the reduction of feiii movi into feii moiv therefore increased the utilization efficiency of pms to generate abundant free radicals additionally other characteristics of femgal mos4 pms system such as 1 the degradation efficiency of phb

naoh or hno3 in a typical procedure 20 ml of target compounds with an initial concentration of 10 ppm was reacted in glass bottles containing 0 25 g l catalyst and 5 mm pms during the reaction 1 ml

performance liquid chromatography hplc fl 2200 coupled with c18 250 mm 4 6 mm 5 μm and uv detector was used for analysis a mixture of methanol and aqueous 0 01m ch3cooh 70 30 was used as mobile phase

then re used for next cyclic reaction to analyse the degradation products of phb the reaction solution was dried first using freeze drier the resulted residue was then dissolved in 10 ml ethyl acetate additionally the ethyl acetate extract was passed through a column packed sodium sulfate to remove the traces of water the eluent was then concentrated under ar stream to derivatize the degradation

ionization potential of 70 ev the dominant reactive species in femgal mos4 pms system were first confirmed by widely used chemical scavengers ethanol tba later the existence of oh and so4 radicals were then further validated by electron paramagnetic resonance epr emx 10 12 bruker germany spectroscopy using dmpo as spin trapping reagent the spectra of epr was obtained at room temperature using

uv visible spectrometer at 352 nm the zero point charge of femgal mos4 catalyst was measured by zeta potential method as reported previously shahzad et al 2019 the leached amount of fe and mo from the studied samples were quantified on icp perkinelmer optima 8300 the quantification of toc removal was performed with toc analyser analytikjena multi n c 3100 at the end of 60 min of reaction 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the synthesis of femgal ldhs with different regulating redox centers co3 2 no3 s5 2 and mos4 2 were confirmed by using xrd ftir and sem analysis for example the peak position in the xrd spectra and changes in the d spacing as related with the size of regulating redox centers fig 1 a confirmed the successful synthesis of mgal co3 femgal co3 femgal no3 femgal mos4 and femgal s5 ldhs catalysts jawad et al 2017 ali et al 2018 ma et al 2016 ftir spectra also support the above findings fig 1b for example the bands at 1364 and 782 cm 1 proved the presence of co3 2 in the interlayers of femgal co3 ldh nobuo et al 2005 the shifting of this band in femgal no3 ldh to 1384 cm 1 confirmed the complete exchange of co3 2 with no3 jawad et al 2017 similarly after exchanging mos4 2 or s5 2 the band of no3 completely disappeared furthermore scanning electron microscopic sem analysis were applied to confirmed structural changes during the exchange of interlayer s regulating centers fig 1c a d as illustrated the typical hexagonal symmetry was maintained for all crystallites femgal co3 femgal no3 femgal mos4 and femgal s5 throughout the exchange process based on the stoichiometric composition obtained from chn analysis table s1 and structural information obtained from xrd ftir and sem analysis all these prepared materials were schematically presented in fig 1d in order to investigate the impact of regulating centers on the oxidation state of elements x ray photoelectron spectroscopic xps measurements were applied for femgal no3 and femgal mos4 catalysts first the full scan spectrum fig s1 confirmed the presence of major elements fe mg al mo and s as evidenced by the corresponding peaks of mg 1s fe 2p o 2p mo 3d s 2p and al 2p noted that the lower binding energies b e of fe 2p peaks for femgal mos4 at 710 10 713 03 ev as compared to femgal no3 710 40 713 73 ev fig 2 a and b highlighted that mos4 2 keeps the fe species in lower oxidation state more clear evidence were observed after deconvoluted the 2p spectra of both catalyst as shown the deconvoluted fe 2p spectra although demonstrated the presence of fe2 and fe3 states in both catalysts qin et al 2014 however the contribution of fe2 state increased from 52 to 62 after exchanging the regulating center from no3 to mos4 2 this suggested the important role of mos4 2 to regulate the oxidation state of fe for mo 3d fig 2c the binding energies located at 232 4 and 235 6 with binding separation energy δe of 3 2 ev were accounted for mo 3d5 2 and mo 3d3 2 of mo6 qin et al 2014 sun et al 2018 spojakina et al 2005 in the case of femgal mos4 four peaks at 227 25 230 13 232 98 and 236 12 ev were observed after deconvoluted the mo 3d spectra two of these peaks located at 232 98 and 236 12 ev with δe of 3 14 ev were accounted for mo 3d5 2 and mo 3d3 2 of mo6 region in contrast the resolved peak situated at lower be 230 13 ev were accounted for mo 3d5 2 in 4 oxidation state ganesan et al 2015 these results thus suggested the presence of mo in both 6 71 and 4 29 oxidation states additionally the small peak at 227 25 ev was due to the binding energy of s 2p yang et al 2014 the high resolution spectrum of s 2p can be fitted into three kinds of s species fig 2d s 2p spectrum displayed four peaks at 161 90 162 81 s2 74 164 17 s0 18 and 168 18 ev so3h or so4 2 8 zhang et al 2014 these results also confirmed that s centers in femgal mos4 dominantly occurred in electron rich s2 state 3 2 influence of regulating center on the catalytic activity of femgal ldh first catalysts of the ldh backbone and different interlayer anions were applied for phb degradation during pms activation as shown fig 3 a and fig s2 pms alone or most of the catalysts i e mgal mos4 femgal co3 femgal no3 femgal moo4 and femgal s5 demonstrated very sluggish performance similarly the physical mixture of femgal moo4 and femgal s5 also offered very poor catalytic activity in contrast the catalytic activity of femgal mos4 dramatically increased to 100 additionally the small removal of phb 10 after using femgal mos4 as adsorbent fig s2 highlighted that the excellent activity of femgal mos4 was not related to the adsorption of phb homogeneous system of fe2 and pms has already been reported for contaminant degradation cheng et al 2017a b tan et al 2014 2018 ji et al 2013 huang et al 2017 therefore we also investigated the role of leached fe2 or mo6 ions fig 3a as shown the homogeneous fe2 and mo6 ions 5 25 fold higher than leached amount exhibited less than 10 phb removal and thus obviously confirmed the negligible role of leached fe2 or mo6 ions in the catalytic activity of femgal mos4 this enhanced catalytic activity of femgal mos4 thus highlighted the unique interactions of fe mo and s2 when occurred simultaneously at the hydroxide backbone by considering this good catalytic activity it was also important to evaluate femgal mos4 for the activation of other oxidants as illustrated in fig s3 femgal mos4 was highly effective in the activation of pms whereas complete removal of phb was achieved in less than 40 min in the case femgal mos4 ps system the activation process took 120 min during complete removal of phb in contrast the negligible removal of phb in femgal mos4 h2o2 system thus suggesting that femgal mos4 was not effective activator for h2o2 these results thus revealed that femgal mos4 can be used as an effective activator of pms we further compared the catalytic activity of femgal mos4 with the previously reported and well known catalysts of fe3o4 cuo fe3o4 mno2 cuo and co3o4 tan et al 2014 lei et al 2015 khan et al 2018 zhang et al 2104 anipsitakis et al 2005 among the various tested catalysts fig 3a fig s4 and table s2 femgal mos4 offered 100 removal with a degradation rate constant of 2 0 10 3 sec 1 on other side co3o4 cuo mno2 fe3o4 and cuo fe3o4 catalysts were less reactive as apparent from only 60 45 55 6 and 25 phb removal with much lower degradation rate constants 10 100 times as mentioned earlier significant efforts were made to accelerate the redox cycles of fe iii f ii zou et al 2013 ling et al 2017 qin et al 2015 li et al 2016 xia et al 2018 dong et al 2018 wang et al 2011 sheng et al 2019 therefore the catalytic activity of femgal mos4 pms system was also compared with the already reported co catalytic fenton s like system of fe3 mos2 sheng et al 2019 and fe3 ws2 dong et al 2018 as shown fig s5 the catalytic activity of femgal mos4 to degrade phb in pms system is much better than that of recently reported mos2 or ws2 acting as co catalysts to regulate the redox cycle of fe3 fe2 during pms activation these results thus highlighted that the strategy of enhancing the redox cycle of fe3 fe2 with mos4 2 as second redox center detail discussion on regulating the active sites is made in section 3 4 is an innovative strategy additionally to correlate the regulating redox centers strategy with real application the pms utilization efficiency was also investigated for fe based and some well known reported catalysts as shown fig 3b 8 of pms was decomposed in water without using catalyst the decomposition of pms increased to 30 when femgal co3 or femgal no3 were applied the decomposition of pms increased further to 40 when femgal s5 or femgal moo4 were used in contrast the decomposition of pms reached to 72 when femgal mos4 with mos4 2 as regulating redox center was applied furthermore the pms decomposition for femgal mos4 was also high than the well known co3o4 cuo fe3o4 or other reported catalysts these results thus suggested that the good catalytic activity of femgal mos4 was related to the strategy of regulating redox centers using mos4 2 offering more pms decomposition in order to correlate the decomposition of pms with catalytic activity pms utilization efficiency taken as the stoichiometric efficiency zhou et al 2020 using eq 4 was calculated as shown fig s6 the femgal mos4 catalyst offered the highest pms utilization efficiency 0 008 as compared to co3o4 0 006 cuo fe3o4 0 005 cuo 0 004 or other femgal based catalysts thus the enhanced catalytic activity of femgal mos4 was related to the excellent pms utilization efficiency which in turn generate more reactive species fig 3c as shown characteristic signals of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 for oh and so4 were although observed for all the studied catalysts however the peak intensities as indication of number of reactive species were significantly high for femgal mos4 pms system than femgal co3 pms or femgal no3 pms system these results thus highlighted that the strategy of controlling the redox centers of fe with second redox metals in the form of mos4 2 is useful for good catalytic activity enhanced pms utilization efficiency and generation of more reactive species 4 stiochiometric efficiency δ phb δ pms 3 3 factors influence the efficiency of femgal mos4 pms system in advanced oxidation process solution ph significantly influences the catalytic activity of heterogeneous catalysts here the influence of reaction ph on the catalytic activity of femgal mos4 was also investigated fig 3d fig s7 and table s3 as illustrated the activity of femgal mos4 remained almost smooth as demonstrated with a nearly constant degradation rates k 2 0 1 6 10 3 sec 1 at weak acidic to neutral phs 3 5 7 0 at higher ph 8 0 10 0 an obvious decrease in the catalytic activity of femgal mos4 was found k values 1 2 0 9 10 3 sec 1 various factors can be accounted for this lower activity of femgal mos4 firstly the solution ph effect the forms of pms molecules pka1 0 pka2 9 88 structure of target compounds and surface charges on the catalyst surface betterton and hoffmann 1988 in alkaline conditions pms occurred dominantly as so5 2 and phb pka 4 54 as para hydroxybenzoate anions on the other side the measured zero point of charge phzpc for femgal mos4 was 5 38 fig s8 suggesting that the catalyst surface would be highly negatively charged under basic conditions ph 8 0 10 0 consequently the electrostatic repulsion among the molecules of pms phb and catalyst particles would lower the catalytic activity of femgal mos4 moreover the increase of ionic strength tends to reduce the electrostatic interactions after lowering the zeta potential of colloidal particles in solution to study a direct evidence of electrostatic interactions the influence of increasing ionic strength was studied during the degradation of phb fig 4 a fig s9 and table s4 as shown the degradation rate of phb was significantly influenced by increasing the ionic strength from 0 to 50 mm of naclo4 these relationship confirmed that the catalytic activity of femgal mos4 strongly dependent on the electrostatic interactions of pms phb and catalyst particles in contrast the consistent performance of femgal mos4 at low ph 3 0 7 0 may be accounted for favourable electrostatic interactions apart from electrostatic interactions leaching of active components at low ph is also considered as one factor for enhanced activity duan et al 2018 however the contribution of leached fe ions in the case of femgal mos4 pms would not be that much important by considering the homogeneous ineffective activation of pms inorganic anions are the common electrolytes which occurred in large amounts in the water matrix and negatively influence the efficiency of advanced oxidation process in most cases for example both oh and so4 radicals likely to be scavenged rapidly by chlorides ions with a rate constants k so4 cl 3 2 0 2 108 m 1s 1 k oh cl 4 2 109 m 1s 1 feng et al 2017 lindsey and tarr 2000 westerhoff et al 1999 therefore the influence of inorganic anions was up great importance to evaluate the efficiency loss of femgal mos4 pms system as shown fig 4b fig s10 and table s5 the presence of cl no3 and so4 2 did not scavenged the activity of femgal mos4 pms system the degradation of phb remained almost 100 in the presence of 5 mm of these anions in the case of carbonate bicarbonate the degradation of phb was slightly scavenged 10 and the pseudo first order degradation rate constant decreased from 2 0 10 3 sec 1 to 0 7 10 3 sec 1 for carbonate and to 0 7 10 3 sec 1 for bicarbonate the scavenging effect in femgal mos4 pms system can be predicted by considering the reactivity of bicarbonate and carbonate toward hydroxyl and sulfate radicals kho hco3 8 6 106 kho co3 2 3 5 108 m 1s 1 k so4 hco3 2 8 106 k so4 co3 2 6 1 106 m 1s 1 huang et al 2018 in addition carbonate bicarbonate directly increase the reaction ph and as a result lower the oxidation potential of reactive species jaafarzadeh et al 2017 in the case of phosphate the degradation was maximum scavenged 85 and the pseudo first order degradation rate constant falls to 0 1 10 3 sec 1 apart from the quenching effect like carbonate bicarbonate phosphate anions have the ability to replace the surface hydroxyl group on the heterogeneous catalyst and thus decrease the chances of heterogeneous surface pms activation jaafarzadeh et al 2017 the blocking effect of heterogeneous sites for pms activation seems more dominated here by considering the significant scavenging of phosphate anions as compared to other tested anions to check the influence of natural organic matter nom the degradation experiments were also conducted in the presence of 0 100 ppm humic acid ha a typical organic matter found in natural and wastewater fig 4c fig s11 and table s6 outsiou et al 2017 as shown the degradation of phb was initially supressed and this effect was more pronounced by increasing ha amount 50 100 ppm however the degradation of phb still remained 100 after extending the reaction to 1 h furthermore the decrease in the degradation rate constant from 2 0 10 3 sec 1 to 1 0 10 3 sec 1 or to 0 9 10 3 sec 1 was related to the competition between ha and phb for free radicals at high concentration additionally ha at such high concentration 100 ppm ha might block some of the active sites on the catalyst surface and thus decrease the oxidation strength of catalyst to activate pms unlikely the other catalytic advanced oxidation systems the consistent performance over a wide ph and negligible influence of anions or humic acid thus suggested that femgal mos4 pms system with regulating redox center is an innovative strategy for real application of wastewater treatment the efficiency of femgal mos4 was also tested for the degradation of other targeted compounds fig s12 in the studied target compounds 100 removal with nearly the same first order degradation rate constant 2 0 1 5 10 3 sec 1 was found for phb 4 cp 2 4 tcp and ba in contrast 60 70 removal with degradation rate constants 4 8 2 3 10 4 sec 1 were obtained for phenol and nitrobenzene nb respectively this behavior appeared interesting because ba is considered a chemical scavenger for so4 and oh k2 ba so4 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 and k2 ba oh 4 2 109 m 1 s 1 whereas nb for oh radicals k2 nb oh 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2017 cheng et al 2017a b these results thus suggested that the pollutants having similar functional group weakly deactivating appeared with exactly similar degradation kinetics as compared to the strongly deactivating functional group these results also highlighted that the maximum electron density over the benzene ring as result of deactivating functional groups allowed favourable interactions between these compounds and catalyst particle furthermore the efficiency of femgal mos4 pms system was also evaluated by changing the reaction parameters fig s13 as shown in fig s13a the efficiency of the femgal mos4 pms system was significantly influenced by the catalyst dosage the observed degradation rate of phb kobs increased from 2 0 10 4 s 1 at 0 15 g l to 5 0 10 4 sec 1 by changing the fe mgal mos4 amount to 0 30 g l it is already understood that an increase of catalyst amount would bring more active sites to interact pms thereby promoting the degradation of phb due to the generation of numerous free radicals similarly phb degradation was also influenced by the amount of oxidant pms fig s13b the degradation rate of phb increased from 1 0 10 4 sec 1 to 5 5 10 4 sec 1 after increasing the pms amount from 1 to 5 mm the increase of phb degradation rate kobs was not linear with the increase of pms amount this relationship may be related to the radicals self scavenging effect at excess amount of oxidants outsiou et al 2017 the influence of initial phb concentration from 10 to 30 ppm was presented in fig s13c as expected the efficiency of femgal mos4 catalyst dropped quickly with the increase of initial phb concentration the apparent degradation rate constant for phb decreased from 2 0 10 3 sec 1 to 1 6 10 4 sec 1 after increasing the phb initial concentration from 10 ppm to 30 ppm this decrease in the apparent degradation rate constant might be related to the coverage of active sites resulted from the adsorption of excess amount of phb furthermore the limited dosage of pms might generate small amount of free radicals that could be consumed quickly by the target compounds phb at high concentration 3 4 regulation of redox centre of femgal mos4 during pms activation as mentioned earlier significant efforts were made to accelerate the redox cycles of fe iii f ii in fe based catalytic oxidation zou et al 2013 ling et al 2017 qin et al 2015 li et al 2016 xia et al 2018 dong et al 2018 wang et al 2011 for example the oxidation efficiency of fe2 pms or fe2 h2o2 systems were improved significantly after applying co catalysts such as hydroxylamine zou et al 2013 or ws2 dong et al 2018 note that femgal mos4 was more efficient than all other tested systems fig 3 and fig s5 this difference in the catalytic activity was related to the enhanced pms utilization and generation of more reactive species we speculated that the continuous reduction of fe3 mo6 to fe2 mo4 via electron transfer from the enriched mos4 2 might be the reason for this improved catalyst properties to test this hypothesis we first applied agno3 as scavenger of electron transport dong et al 2018 as shown fig s14 the degradation rate of phb as well pms decomposition rate impeded significantly after adding agno3 due to the soft nature both silver ions and thiols moieties of femgal mos4 react quickly stopping the electron flow from electron rich s2 s s0 species to fe3 mo6 and thus obstruct the degradation after slowdown the circulation of fe3 fe2 or mo6 mo4 redox cycles furthermore positive impact of additional fe3 ions on the catalytic activity of mgal mos4 pms femgal s5 pms and femgal mos4 pms system was noted fig 4d and fig s15 interestingly the positive influence of fe3 ions was more pronounce on femgal mos4 pms system as compared to mgal mos4 pms or femgal s5 pms this enhanced catalytic activity after the addition of fe3 ions might be related to the simultaneous reduction of fe3 via electron transfer after been adsorbed on the surface of catalysts to confirm this statement the concentration of extra added fe3 mo6 ions were also monitored in femgal mos4 pms system as shown fig s16 the concentration of fe3 and mo6 ions gradually decreased along with the reaction time because of the stronger adsorption ability of femgal mos4 towards these ions more than 65 decrease in the concentration of fe3 ions was noted in 1 h after adding 5 ppm fe3 ions fig s16a likewise the concentration of mo6 also gradually decreased when 2 10 ppm mo6 ions were used as an additive catalyst fig s16b these results thus highlighted that the oxidized metals ions fe3 mo6 produced during pms activation eq 2 were re adsorbed on the surface of femgal mos4 to regenerate surface bound active fe2 mo4 ions additionally this hypothesis was further supported by the fact that the increase of ionic strength would benefit the material to acquire additional negative charge allowing it to adsorb more fe3 mo6 ions from solution as shown in fig s17 the increase of ionic strength 50 mm naclo4 first inhibited the phb degradation this effect was related to the additional negative charge on the catalyst surface promoting electrostatic repulsion between pms and catalyst particles however the increase of phb degradation after fe3 ions being added to the above solution might be related to the adsorption of more fe3 ions due to additional negative charge offering additional active sites for activation of pms these results thus proved that the adsorption of fe3 mo6 ions from the reaction mixture and the regularly regenerated fe2 mo4 as active sites on the surface of femgal mos4 catalyst were the main factors for efficient pms activation a clear evidence where s2 s s0 were proved to play a critical role in controlling the efficient oxidation states fe2 mo4 of femgal mos4 catalyst was obtained after xps analysis as shown an increase of fe2 content from 62 fig 2b to 72 fig 5 a and decrease in mo6 content from 71 fig 2c to 57 fig 5b were found upon reacting femgal mos4 with pms likewise the peaks ratio assigned to s2 decreased from 74 26 and those of s0 and so4 2 increased dramatically from 18 to 8 to 60 and 14 respectively figs 2d and 5c 3 5 identification of reactive species in femgal mos4 pms system it is commonly accepted that hydroxyl radical can be selectively scavenged by ter butyl alcohol tba k oh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 li et al 2019 wang et al 2017 cheng et al 2017a b as compared to sulfate radicals kso4 4 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2017 cheng et al 2017a b similarly both so4 and oh radicals react very quickly with ethanol k so4 1 6 7 8 107 m 1 s 1 k oh 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 during the application of these selective scavengers fig 6 fig s18 significant inhibition effect on the degradation of phb was found for example the degradation rate for phb decreased from 2 0 10 3 s 1 to 3 3 10 5 s 1 or to 2 8 10 4 s 1 when excess amount of ethanol or tba was applied respectively these results thus suggested the presence of both so4 and oh radicals as the major reactive species responsible for the degradation phb to further confirmed the role of so4 and oh radicals epr analysis was applied fig 6c as shown a characteristic four line spectrum of dmpo oh and six line spectrum of dmpo so4 was observed in femgal mos4 pms system additionally the intensities of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 peaks deceases after adding phb which suggested the utilization of free radicals during oxidation of the target compound additionally the peak intensity for dmpo oh and dmpo so4 increased with time fig 6d suggesting the continuous production of so4 and oh radicals in femgal mos4 pms system these observation thus confirmed the existence of so4 and oh radicals as actual reactive species and these findings are in accordance of radical scavenging studies 3 6 proposed pms activation and degradation mechanism during the pms activation it is believed that pms first undergoes complexation at the surface of catalysts before generating free radicals the changes in the ionic strength can affect this complexation by inhibiting the electrostatic interactions between pms molecules and catalyst particles as shown fig 4a the increase of ionic strength significantly inhibited the phb degradation furthermore the addition of hpo4 anions fig 4b has almost stopped the phb degradation due the scavenging of surface hydroxyl group khan et al 2018 these results thus highlighted that the surface hydroxyl group of femgal mos4 catalyst play an important role in the complexation of pms additionally the higher electronegativity e n of sulphur 2 58 than fe or mo 1 8 might facilitate this complexation due to the induced positive charge on the femgal mos4 ldh layers atr ftir spectroscopy can easily measure this complexation of pms in the range of 1249 1060 cm 1 zhang et al 2014 the atr ftir analysis conducted for pms and femgal mos4 fig s19 demonstrated a red shift of about 6 cm 1 from pms spectra when femgal mos4 was introduced into pms solution these results clearly suggested the complexation of pms might be in the form of feii moiv oh oso3 at the surface of femgal mos4 catalyst in order to prove this complexation pms concentration was examined under different condition fig s20 as shown the decomposition of pms did not occurred in the presence of phb whereas pms was decomposed to significant extent in the presence of femgal mos4 catalyst indicating a typical free radical mechanism feng et al 2017 ahn et al 2016 moreover the increased pms decomposition after introducing phb was due the fact that organic pollutants utilize the generated free radical and thus enhance the pms decomposition these results are in accordance with the typical free radical system co2 pms organics and different from those of surface bound radical or free radical based oxidation systems wu et al 2020 feng et al 2017 ahn et al 2016 zhu et al 2019 from the above discussion it is thus proposed that pms first undergo complexation at the surface of femgal mos4 catalyst to produce feii moiv oh oso3 complex eq 5 then it is speculated that there might be two electron transfer inside the surface of feii moiv oh oso3 complex toward pms and thus producing surface bound feiii mov oh and so4 radicals eq 6 the hydroxyl group at the surface of femgal mos4 were proved to play an important role in the complexation of pms moreover the massive changes in the area ratio of o 1s for surface hydroxyl oh as demonstrated by xps analysis before and after the reaction fig s21 also highlighted the important role of surface hydroxyl group in the pms complexation khan et al 2018 5 feii moiv oh hso5 feii moiv oh oso3 oh 6 feii moiv oh oso3 feiii mov oh so4 as shown in fig 3a and fig s2 the removal of phb was negligible in the presence of homogeneous mo6 and fe3 or heterogeneous femgal moo4 this indicate the important role of s during catalytic activation of pms while using femgal mos4 as catalyst this important role of s might be related to keep femgal mos4 in the most efficient oxidation states fe2 mo4 as discussed in detail in section 3 4 clear evidence for the above statement came from the results of xps showing noticeable changes in the fe 2p mo 3d and s 2p spectra before and after pms activation figs 2 and 5 for example an increase of fe2 content from 62 fig 2b to 72 fig 5a was observed upon exposure femgal mos4 catalyst to pms similarly mo6 content was decreased from 71 fig 2c to 57 fig 5b likewise positive shift was also observed in the case of s 2p before and after pms activation figs 2d and 5c for example the peaks of s 2p at 161 90 162 81 164 17 and 168 18 ev were shifted to 162 24 163 57 164 57 and 168 85 ev the peaks ratio assigned to s2 decreased from 74 to 26 and those of s0 and so4 2 increased dramatically from 18 to 8 to 60 and 14 respectively noted that the reduction of feiii movi with pms is thermodynamically not feasible by considering the standard reduction of pms eo hso5 so42 1 81 ev fe feiii feii 0 76 and mo movi moiv 0 86 ev guo et al 2019 sun et al 2018 rimstidt and vaughan 2003 in contrast the standard reduction potential of sulphur eo s2 s1 0 34 ev ifthikar et al 2020 allows the thermodynamic feasible reduction process of feiii movi into feii moiv moiv and thus suggested that sulphur might play important contribution in the changes of oxidation states of fe and mo as seen in figs 2 and 5 it is therefore suggested that the oxidation of s2 into s s0 or so3 2 so4 2 were accompanied by electron transfer to regulate the active sites through reduction of least reactive feiii movi into more reactive feii mov moiv oxidations states of femgal mos4 catalyst in a series of reactions additionally this phenomena also suggested that the activation efficiency of femgal mos4 would decrease once all of the s2 s or s0 were consumed owing to the slowdown of feii mov moiv regeneration this hypothesis was supported by the decrease in phb degradation over five consecutive cyclic experiments fig 5d as shown the phb degradation gradually decreased from 100 to 77 in the fifth cycle based on this discussion a suitable mechanism was proposed the s2 species of mos4 2 anions was oxidized into s s0 or so3 2 so4 2 in a series of reaction eq 8 14 and the generated electron would be used to reduce feiii movi into surface bound feii moiv species to re start a fresh pms activation eqs 5 and 6 this cyclic process will continue until all of the s2 s s0 oxidized into so4 2 scheme 1 7 feiii movi hso5 feii moiv so5 h 8 fe mo s3 s2 feiii moiv fe mo s3 s feii movi 10 fe mo s3 s h2o fe mo s3 soh h 11 fe mo s3 soh h2o fe mo s3 so2 e h 12 fe mo s3 so2 h2o fe mo s3 so3 2e 2h 13 fe mo s3 so3 fe mo s3 fe so3 14 fe mo s3 so3 fe mo s2 s2o3 2 15 s2o3 2 2h s h2so3 16 so4 oh oh so4 2 furthermore we also detected the oxidative product of phb using gc ms as shown in table s7 and in fig s22 based on the identified products a schematic pathway was proposed fig 7 for the degradation products the identified products suggested that the oxidation of phb occurred through the decarboxylation or dehydration reactions small molecular acids i e 2 hydroxypropanoic acid 2 hydroxyacedic acid and fumaric acid were produced after breakdown of aromatic ring these small chain molecular acids were then finally converted to co2 and h2o as noted from 65 toc removal the hydroxyl radical induced intermediate product i e dihydroxybenzoic as proposed previously in majority of studies was not detected here rayaroth et al 2017 oh et al 2017 the absence of hyroxylated product suggested that the intermediate of dihydroxybenzoic might be mineralized quickly after reacting with other reactive species additionally the decarboxylation of phb and then to other intermediate products would be the dominant pathway by considering the selectivity of so4 toward phb fig s18 slow generation of oh radical 6 5 107 m 1s 1 and lower degradation of nb k oh nb 3 9 109 m 1s 1 kso4 nb 106 m 1s 1 in femgal mos4 pms system rayaroth et al 2017 oh et al 2017 4 conclusion heterogeneous fe based activation of pms for pollutants removal has attracted significant research interest owing to their environmental and cost benefits however the slow transformation of feiii feii redox cycle prevent it to develop a sustainable system for real application in this work we studied to improve the transformation of feiii feii redox cycle after introducing different regulating centers co3 2 no3 s5 2 moo4 2 and mos4 2 in the interlayers of femgal ldh the results revealed that femgal ldh with mos4 2 as regulating center was extremely efficient with degradation rate 10 100 times faster than fe based fe3o4 femgal co3 femgal no3 femgal s5 and femgal moo4 well known nano catalysts mno2 co3o4 and cuo fe3o4 or reported fenton s like co catalytic systems fe3 ws2 pms or fe3 mos2 pms additionally femgal mos4 pms system remained consistent over a ph range of 3 0 7 0 and the degradation kinetics were not inhibited by the excessive amount of inorganic anions and organic matter this excellent catalytic activity of femgal mos4 pms system was related to the regular regeneration of feii moiv active sites enhanced pms utilization efficiency and generation of abundant free radicals based on radicals scavengers and epr analysis oh and so4 radicals were accounted as the dominant reactive species in femgal mos4 pms system furthermore possible degradation pathway based on the identification of intermediate products from lcms analysis was also deduced for phb degradation additionally as proved by xps and other analytic techniques the electron rich s2 group coming from mos4 2 play an essential role to promote the reduction of non reactive feiii movi into active feii moiv sites through continuous electron transfer this property of femgal mos4 not only makes it more reactive but also provide environment friendly and cost effective technique as the residual pms will not needs to be treated by using some additional chemical reductants due to the increase pms utilization efficiency this work not only explains the positive aspects of regulating the redox center of fe with mos4 2 but also provides new window to prepare an efficient stable environment friendly and cost

17854,persulfate fe based catalytic oxidation is considered as one of the most attractive strategy for the growing concerns of water pollution however the undesirable feiii feii redox cycle restrict them from attending the sustainable activity during practical applications this study was intended to develop a new strategy to regulate the redox cycles of feiii feii by introducing the second redox center of mos4 2 in the interlayers of fe based layered double hydroxide femgal mos4 ldh based on the first order kinetic model the fabricated femgal mos4 catalyst was 10 100 fold more reactive than the bench marked peroxymonosulfate pms activators including femgal ldhs and other widely reported nano catalysts such as co3o4 fe3o4 α mno2 cuo fe3o4 and fe3o4 the enhanced catalytic activity of femgal mos4 ldh was related to the continuous regeneration of active sites feii moiv excellent pms utilization efficiency and generation of abundant free radicals moreover the femgal mos4 pms system shows an effective ph range from 3 0 to 7 0 and the degradation kinetics of parahydroxy benzoic acid phb were not effected in the presence of huge amount of background electrolytes and natural organic matters based on the in situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy epr chemical scavengers xps analysis and gas chromatography couple with mass spectrometer gc ms a degradation pathway based on dominant free radicals so4 and oh passing through the redox cycles of feiii feii and movi moiv was proposed for pms activation we believe that this strategy of regulating the redox center through mos4 2 not only provides a base to prepare new materials with stable catalytic activity but also broaden the scope of fe based material for real application of contaminated water graphical abstract image 1 keywords advanced oxidation process fe persulfate redox center sr aop wastewater 1 introduction in recent years sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes sr aops have received increasing research interests for the treatment of pollutants from wastewater as compared to traditional hydroxyl oh radical based system so4 radicals demonstrate nearly the same oxidative ability with much longer reaction time and selectivity toward electron rich organic pollutants oh et al 2016 peroxymonsulfate pms and persulfate ps are the commonly applied oxidants to generate sulfate so4 radicals using different fe based catalysts including zerovalent iron zvi fe2 fe2o3 fe3o4 and mn fe3o4 cheng et al 2017a b tan et al 2014 2018 ji et al 2013 huang et al 2017 in general the efficiency of these catalytic systems depends upon the feasibility of redox reactions eqs 1 and 2 to generate so4 radicals after the homolytic cleavage of persulfate bond o o li et al 2018 1 feii hso5 feiii so4 oh 2 feiii hso5 feii so5 h 3 feiii 3oh fe oh 3 during the generation of reactive oxygen species ros the regeneration of feii after reacting pms eq 2 is much slower than the production of feiii eq 1 which unfortunately results the accumulation of feiii ions and the ineffective activation of pms zou et al 2013 li et al 2016 additionally the accumulated ferric ions as iron hydroxide eq 3 would stop the feiii feii cycles and thus leads to activity loss during the reaction by considering these drawbacks many researchers dedicated themselves to optimize the feiii feii cycles for fenton and sr aops systems the optimizing efforts of feiii feii cycles can be broadly classified into four categories i introduce uv light vermilyea and voelker 2009 or electricity liu et al 2007 which unavoidably increased the cost and energy loss ii adopt the pattern of transition metals based heterogeneous catalysts wang et al 2016 that avoids the formation of feiii sludge and extends the effective ph range however low reactivity extensive mass production in the treated matrix and complex recovery procedure prevent them from field application for instance cobalt based heterogonous catalysts were although considered very efficient persulfate activators but the toxicity issues of co2 ions resulted from the catalyst leaching restrict them from practical application iii add specific chemicals as co catalysts to compensate the shortcoming in sr aops for example using low molecular weight additives as electron donators ma et al 2006 including cistin li et al 2016 hydroxylamine zou et al 2013 edta xia et al 2018 protocatechuic acid qin et al 2015 ws2 dong et al 2018 and mos2 sheng et al 2019 etc to accelerate the redox cycles of fe iii fe ii with this strategy although the reaction rates were accelerated however the issues of homogenous system such as the optimal activity only at low ph 3 0 4 0 still remained the biggest problem additionally the possibility of secondary pollution resulted from the additional co catalysts and constant replenishment of co catalysts also restrict these systems from practical applications iv adopt the patterns of doping electron rich elements s n c compositing activated carbon or graphene with metal oxides for example pyrite fes2 mackinawite fes magnetic pyrrhotite sulphur doped materials s activated carbon cuco2s4 and ldh coupled with graphene oxides etc zhou et al 2018 liang et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 xia et al 2017 guo et al 2018 xu et al 2018 shahzad et al 2019 although these catalytic systems effectively activate persulfate without co catalysts however the complex synthetic steps and issues of stability resulted from the air oxidation still exist therefore for both economic and environmental interests it is necessary to develop a stable and high performance heterogeneous catalyst without the addition of co catalyst to improve the redox cycle of fe iii fe ii and correspondingly increase the utilization efficiency of pms and the overall efficiency of sr aops in this study a new strategy to enhance the redox properties of fe ii fe iii was proposed by enriching mos4 2 moiety in the protective interlayer space of fe based layered double hydroxide femgal ldh this fabricated femgal mos4 catalyst was found extremely reactive i e the reactivity rate was 10 100 times higher than the bench marked pms activators including femgal ldh other widely reported nano catalysts and co catalytic systems this excellent catalytic activity was related to the enriched sulphides that promoted the reduction of feiii movi into feii moiv therefore increased the utilization efficiency of pms to generate abundant free radicals additionally other characteristics of femgal mos4 pms system such as 1 the degradation efficiency of phb and the stoichiometric efficiency of pms 2 the influence of water chemistry ph anions and organic matter 3 oxidative products identification and 4 degradation mechanism based on free radicals and

60 c and was named as femgal no3 ldh 2 2 3 preparation of femgal mos4 and femgal s5 both femgal mos4 and femgal s5 ldhs were prepared by exchanging the no3ˉ anions of femgal no3 with mos4 2ˉ or s5 2 anions coming from nh4 2mos4 or k2s5 salts respectively in this procedure 0 2 g of nh4 2mos4 or k2s5 were weighted together with 0 2 g of femgal no3 ldh in 10 ml degassed de ionized water the suspended mixture were allowed to shack for 24 h at room temperature the exchanged product femgal mos4 or femgal s5 were first washed well with de ionized water and then with acetone and finally dried under vacuum at 60 c for 10 h for comparison some control catalysts such as femgal moo4 and mgal mos4 were also prepared by simple ion exchange method as mentioned above in order to compare the pms

naoh or hno3 in a typical procedure 20 ml of target compounds with an initial concentration of 10 ppm was reacted in glass bottles containing 0 25 g l catalyst and 5 mm pms during the reaction 1 ml sample was withdrawn from the reaction bottles at preselected intervals filtered with 0 2 μm polytetrafluoroethylene syringe filters and immediately quenched with methanol prior to hplc analysis high performance liquid chromatography hplc fl 2200 coupled with c18 250 mm 4 6 mm 5 μm and uv detector was used for analysis a mixture of methanol and aqueous 0 01m ch3cooh 70 30 was used as mobile phase at a constant flow rate of 1 ml min the re using of femgal mos4 catalysts was examined in five catalytic cycles the recovered femgal mos4 catalyst was washed with deionized water dried at 60 c and then re used for next cyclic reaction to analyse the degradation products of phb the reaction solution was dried first using freeze drier the resulted residue was then dissolved in 10 ml ethyl acetate additionally the ethyl acetate extract was passed through a column packed sodium sulfate to remove the traces of water the eluent was then concentrated under ar stream to derivatize the degradation

and discussion 3 1 characterization the synthesis of femgal ldhs with different regulating redox centers co3 2 no3 s5 2 and mos4 2 were confirmed by using xrd ftir and sem analysis for example the peak position in the xrd spectra and changes in the d spacing as related with the size of regulating redox centers fig 1 a confirmed the successful synthesis of mgal co3 femgal co3 femgal no3 femgal mos4 and femgal s5 ldhs catalysts jawad et al 2017 ali et al 2018 ma et al 2016 ftir spectra also support the above findings fig 1b for example the bands at 1364 and 782 cm 1 proved the presence of co3 2 in the interlayers of femgal co3 ldh nobuo et al 2005 the shifting of this band in femgal no3 ldh to 1384 cm 1 confirmed the complete exchange of co3 2 with no3 jawad et al 2017 similarly after exchanging mos4 2 or s5 2 the band of no3 completely disappeared furthermore scanning electron microscopic sem analysis were applied to confirmed structural changes during the exchange of interlayer s regulating centers fig 1c a d as illustrated the typical hexagonal symmetry was maintained for all crystallites femgal co3 femgal no3 femgal mos4 and femgal s5 throughout the exchange process based on the stoichiometric composition obtained from chn analysis table s1 and structural information obtained from xrd ftir and sem analysis all these prepared materials were schematically presented in fig 1d in order to investigate the impact of regulating centers on the oxidation state of elements x ray photoelectron spectroscopic xps measurements were applied for femgal no3 and femgal mos4 catalysts first the full scan spectrum fig s1 confirmed the presence of major elements fe mg al mo and s as evidenced by the corresponding peaks of mg 1s fe 2p o 2p mo 3d s 2p and al 2p noted that the lower binding energies b e of fe 2p peaks for femgal mos4 at 710 10 713 03 ev as compared to femgal no3 710 40 713 73 ev fig 2 a and b highlighted that mos4 2 keeps the fe species in lower oxidation state more clear evidence were observed after deconvoluted the 2p spectra of both catalyst as shown the deconvoluted fe 2p spectra although demonstrated the presence of fe2 and fe3 states in both catalysts qin et al 2014 however the contribution of fe2 state increased from 52 to 62 after exchanging the regulating center from no3 to mos4 2 this suggested the important role of mos4 2 to regulate the oxidation state of fe for mo 3d fig 2c the binding energies located at 232 4 and 235 6 with binding separation energy δe of 3 2 ev were accounted for mo 3d5 2 and mo 3d3 2 of mo6 qin et al 2014 sun et al 2018 spojakina et al 2005 in the case of femgal mos4 four peaks at 227 25 230 13 232 98 and 236 12 ev were observed after deconvoluted the mo 3d spectra two of these peaks located at 232 98 and 236 12 ev with δe of 3 14 ev were accounted for mo 3d5 2 and mo 3d3 2 of mo6 region in contrast the resolved peak situated at lower be 230 13 ev were accounted for mo 3d5 2 in 4 oxidation state ganesan et al 2015 these results thus suggested the presence of mo in both 6 71 and 4 29 oxidation states additionally the small peak at 227 25 ev was due to the binding energy of s 2p yang et al 2014 the high resolution spectrum of s 2p can be fitted into three kinds of s species fig 2d s 2p spectrum displayed four peaks at 161 90 162 81 s2 74 164 17 s0 18 and 168 18 ev so3h or so4 2 8 zhang et al 2014 these results also confirmed that s centers in femgal mos4 dominantly occurred in electron rich s2 state 3 2 influence of regulating center on the catalytic activity of femgal ldh first catalysts of the ldh backbone and different interlayer anions were applied for phb degradation during pms activation as shown fig 3 a and fig s2 pms alone or most of the catalysts i e mgal mos4 femgal co3 femgal no3 femgal moo4 and femgal s5 demonstrated very sluggish performance similarly the physical mixture of femgal moo4 and femgal s5 also offered very poor catalytic activity in contrast the catalytic activity of femgal mos4 dramatically increased to 100 additionally the small removal of phb 10 after using femgal mos4 as adsorbent fig s2 highlighted that the excellent activity of femgal mos4 was not related to the adsorption of phb homogeneous system of fe2 and pms has already been reported for contaminant degradation cheng et al 2017a b tan et al 2014 2018 ji et al 2013 huang et al 2017 therefore we also investigated the role of leached fe2 or mo6 ions fig 3a as shown the homogeneous fe2 and mo6 ions 5 25 fold higher than leached amount exhibited less than 10 phb removal and thus obviously confirmed the negligible role of leached fe2 or mo6 ions in the catalytic activity of femgal mos4 this enhanced catalytic activity of femgal mos4 thus highlighted the unique interactions of fe mo and s2 when occurred simultaneously at the hydroxide backbone by considering this good catalytic activity it was also important to evaluate femgal mos4 for the activation of other oxidants as illustrated in fig s3 femgal mos4 was highly effective in the activation of pms whereas complete removal of phb was achieved in less than 40 min in the case femgal mos4 ps system the activation process took 120 min during complete removal of phb in contrast the negligible removal of phb in femgal mos4 h2o2 system thus suggesting that femgal mos4 was not effective activator for h2o2 these results thus revealed that femgal mos4 can be used as an effective activator of pms we further compared the catalytic activity of femgal mos4 with the previously reported and well known catalysts of fe3o4 cuo fe3o4 mno2 cuo and co3o4 tan et al 2014 lei et al 2015 khan et al 2018 zhang et al 2104 anipsitakis et al 2005 among the various tested catalysts fig 3a fig s4 and table s2 femgal mos4 offered 100 removal with a degradation rate constant of 2 0 10 3 sec 1 on other side co3o4 cuo mno2 fe3o4 and cuo fe3o4 catalysts were less reactive as apparent from only 60 45 55 6 and 25 phb removal with much lower degradation rate constants 10 100 times as mentioned earlier significant efforts were made to accelerate the redox cycles of fe iii f ii zou et al 2013 ling et al 2017 qin et al 2015 li et al 2016 xia et al 2018 dong et al 2018 wang et al 2011 sheng et al 2019 therefore the catalytic activity of femgal mos4 pms system was also compared with the already reported co catalytic fenton s like system of fe3 mos2 sheng et al 2019 and fe3 ws2 dong et al 2018 as shown fig s5 the catalytic activity of femgal mos4 to degrade phb in pms system is much better than that of recently reported mos2 or ws2 acting as co catalysts to regulate the redox cycle of fe3 fe2 during pms activation these results thus highlighted that the strategy of enhancing the redox cycle of fe3 fe2 with mos4 2 as second redox center detail discussion on regulating the active sites is made in section 3 4 is an innovative strategy additionally to correlate the regulating redox centers strategy with real application the pms utilization efficiency was also investigated for fe based and some well known reported catalysts as shown fig 3b 8 of pms was decomposed in water without using catalyst the decomposition of pms increased to 30 when femgal co3 or femgal no3 were applied the decomposition of pms increased further to 40 when femgal s5 or femgal moo4 were used in contrast the decomposition of pms reached to 72 when femgal mos4 with mos4 2 as regulating redox center was applied furthermore the pms decomposition for femgal mos4 was also high than the well known co3o4 cuo fe3o4 or other reported catalysts these results thus suggested that the good catalytic activity of femgal mos4 was related to the strategy of regulating redox centers using mos4 2 offering more pms decomposition in order to correlate the decomposition of pms with catalytic activity pms utilization efficiency taken as the stoichiometric efficiency zhou et al 2020 using eq 4 was calculated as shown fig s6 the femgal mos4 catalyst offered the highest pms utilization efficiency 0 008 as compared to co3o4 0 006 cuo fe3o4 0 005 cuo 0 004 or other femgal based catalysts thus the enhanced catalytic activity of femgal mos4 was related to the excellent pms utilization efficiency which in turn generate more reactive species fig 3c as shown characteristic signals of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 for oh and so4 were although observed for all the studied catalysts however the peak intensities as indication of number of reactive species were significantly high for femgal mos4 pms system than femgal co3 pms or femgal no3 pms system these results thus highlighted that the strategy of controlling the redox centers of fe with second redox metals in the form of mos4 2 is useful for good catalytic activity enhanced pms utilization efficiency and generation of more reactive species 4 stiochiometric efficiency δ phb δ pms 3 3 factors influence the efficiency of femgal mos4 pms system in advanced oxidation process solution ph significantly influences the catalytic activity of heterogeneous catalysts here the influence of reaction ph on the catalytic activity of femgal mos4 was also investigated fig 3d fig s7 and table s3 as illustrated the activity of femgal mos4 remained almost smooth as demonstrated with a nearly constant degradation rates k 2 0 1 6 10 3 sec 1 at weak acidic to neutral phs 3 5 7 0 at higher ph 8 0 10 0 an obvious decrease in the catalytic activity of femgal mos4 was found k values 1 2 0 9 10 3 sec 1 various factors can be accounted for this lower activity of femgal mos4 firstly the solution ph effect the forms of pms molecules pka1 0 pka2 9 88 structure of target compounds and surface charges on the catalyst surface betterton and hoffmann 1988 in alkaline conditions pms occurred dominantly as so5 2 and phb pka 4 54 as para hydroxybenzoate anions on the other side the measured zero point of charge phzpc for femgal mos4 was 5 38 fig s8 suggesting that the catalyst surface would be highly negatively charged under basic conditions ph 8 0 10 0 consequently the electrostatic repulsion among the molecules of pms phb and catalyst particles would lower the catalytic activity of femgal mos4 moreover the increase of ionic strength tends to reduce the electrostatic interactions after lowering the zeta potential of colloidal particles in solution to study a direct evidence of electrostatic interactions the influence of increasing ionic strength was studied during the degradation of phb fig 4 a fig s9 and table s4 as shown the degradation rate of phb was significantly influenced by increasing the ionic strength from 0 to 50 mm of naclo4 these relationship confirmed that the catalytic activity of femgal mos4 strongly dependent on the electrostatic interactions of pms phb and catalyst particles in contrast the consistent performance of femgal mos4 at low ph 3 0 7 0 may be accounted for favourable electrostatic interactions apart from electrostatic interactions leaching of active components at low ph is also considered as one factor for enhanced activity duan et al 2018 however the contribution of leached fe ions in the case of femgal mos4 pms would not be that much important by considering the homogeneous ineffective activation of pms inorganic anions are the common electrolytes which occurred in large amounts in the water matrix and negatively influence the efficiency of advanced oxidation process in most cases for example both oh and so4 radicals likely to be scavenged rapidly by chlorides ions with a rate constants k so4 cl 3 2 0 2 108 m 1s 1 k oh cl 4 2 109 m 1s 1 feng et al 2017 lindsey and tarr 2000 westerhoff et al 1999 therefore the influence of inorganic anions was up great importance to evaluate the efficiency loss of femgal mos4 pms system as shown fig 4b fig s10 and table s5 the presence of cl no3 and so4 2 did not scavenged the activity of femgal mos4 pms system the degradation of phb remained almost 100 in the presence of 5 mm of these anions in the case of carbonate bicarbonate the degradation of phb was slightly scavenged 10 and the pseudo first order degradation rate constant decreased from 2 0 10 3 sec 1 to 0 7 10 3 sec 1 for carbonate and to 0 7 10 3 sec 1 for bicarbonate the scavenging effect in femgal mos4 pms system can be predicted by considering the reactivity of bicarbonate and carbonate toward hydroxyl and sulfate radicals kho hco3 8 6 106 kho co3 2 3 5 108 m 1s 1 k so4 hco3 2 8 106 k so4 co3 2 6 1 106 m 1s 1 huang et al 2018 in addition carbonate bicarbonate directly increase the reaction ph and as a result lower the oxidation potential of reactive species jaafarzadeh et al 2017 in the case of phosphate the degradation was maximum scavenged 85 and the pseudo first order degradation rate constant falls to 0 1 10 3 sec 1 apart from the quenching effect like carbonate bicarbonate phosphate anions have the ability to replace the surface hydroxyl group on the heterogeneous catalyst and thus decrease the chances of heterogeneous surface pms activation jaafarzadeh et al 2017 the blocking effect of heterogeneous sites for pms activation seems more dominated here by considering the significant scavenging of phosphate anions as compared to other tested anions to check the influence of natural organic matter nom the degradation experiments were also conducted in the presence of 0 100 ppm humic acid ha a typical organic matter found in natural and wastewater fig 4c fig s11 and table s6 outsiou et al 2017 as shown the degradation of phb was initially supressed and this effect was more pronounced by increasing ha amount 50 100 ppm however the degradation of phb still remained 100 after extending the reaction to 1 h furthermore the decrease in the degradation rate constant from 2 0 10 3 sec 1 to 1 0 10 3 sec 1 or to 0 9 10 3 sec 1 was related to the competition between ha and phb for free radicals at high concentration additionally ha at such high concentration 100 ppm ha might block some of the active sites on the catalyst surface and thus decrease the oxidation strength of catalyst to activate pms unlikely the other catalytic advanced oxidation systems the consistent performance over a wide ph and negligible influence of anions or humic acid thus suggested that femgal mos4 pms system with regulating redox center is an innovative strategy for real application of wastewater treatment the efficiency of femgal mos4 was also tested for the degradation of other targeted compounds fig s12 in the studied target compounds 100 removal with nearly the same first order degradation rate constant 2 0 1 5 10 3 sec 1 was found for phb 4 cp 2 4 tcp and ba in contrast 60 70 removal with degradation rate constants 4 8 2 3 10 4 sec 1 were obtained for phenol and nitrobenzene nb respectively this behavior appeared interesting because ba is considered a chemical scavenger for so4 and oh k2 ba so4 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 and k2 ba oh 4 2 109 m 1 s 1 whereas nb for oh radicals k2 nb oh 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2017 cheng et al 2017a b these results thus suggested that the pollutants having similar functional group weakly deactivating appeared with exactly similar degradation kinetics as compared to the strongly deactivating functional group these results also highlighted that the maximum electron density over the benzene ring as result of deactivating functional groups allowed favourable interactions between these compounds and catalyst particle furthermore the efficiency of femgal mos4 pms system was also evaluated by changing the reaction parameters fig s13 as shown in fig s13a the efficiency of the femgal mos4 pms system was significantly influenced by the catalyst dosage the observed degradation rate of phb kobs increased from 2 0 10 4 s 1 at 0 15 g l to 5 0 10 4 sec 1 by changing the fe mgal mos4 amount to 0 30 g l it is already understood that an increase of catalyst amount would bring more active sites to interact pms thereby promoting the degradation of phb due to the generation of numerous free radicals similarly phb degradation was also influenced by the amount of oxidant pms fig s13b the degradation rate of phb increased from 1 0 10 4 sec 1 to 5 5 10 4 sec 1 after increasing the pms amount from 1 to 5 mm the increase of phb degradation rate kobs was not linear with the increase of pms amount this relationship may be related to the radicals self scavenging effect at excess amount of oxidants outsiou et al 2017 the influence of initial phb concentration from 10 to 30 ppm was presented in fig s13c as expected the efficiency of femgal mos4 catalyst dropped quickly with the increase of initial phb concentration the apparent degradation rate constant for phb decreased from 2 0 10 3 sec 1 to 1 6 10 4 sec 1 after increasing the phb initial concentration from 10 ppm to 30 ppm this decrease in the apparent degradation rate constant might be related to the coverage of active sites resulted from the adsorption of excess amount of phb furthermore the limited dosage of pms might generate small amount of free radicals that could be consumed quickly by the target compounds phb at high concentration 3 4 regulation of redox centre of femgal mos4 during pms activation as mentioned earlier significant efforts were made to accelerate the redox cycles of fe iii f ii in fe based catalytic oxidation zou et al 2013 ling et al 2017 qin et al 2015 li et al 2016 xia et al 2018 dong et al 2018 wang et al 2011 for example the oxidation efficiency of fe2 pms or fe2 h2o2 systems were improved significantly after applying co catalysts such as hydroxylamine zou et al 2013 or ws2 dong et al 2018 note that femgal mos4 was more efficient than all other tested systems fig 3 and fig s5 this difference in the catalytic activity was related to the enhanced pms utilization and generation of more reactive species we speculated that the continuous reduction of fe3 mo6 to fe2 mo4 via electron transfer from the enriched mos4 2 might be the reason for this improved catalyst properties to test this hypothesis we first applied agno3 as scavenger of electron transport dong et al 2018 as shown fig s14 the degradation rate of phb as well pms decomposition rate impeded significantly after adding agno3 due to the soft nature both silver ions and thiols moieties of femgal mos4 react quickly stopping the electron flow from electron rich s2 s s0 species to fe3 mo6 and thus obstruct the degradation after slowdown the circulation of fe3 fe2 or mo6 mo4 redox cycles furthermore positive impact of additional fe3 ions on the catalytic activity of mgal mos4 pms femgal s5 pms and femgal mos4 pms system was noted fig 4d and fig s15 interestingly the positive influence of fe3 ions was more pronounce on femgal mos4 pms system as compared to mgal mos4 pms or femgal s5 pms this enhanced catalytic activity after the addition of fe3 ions might be related to the simultaneous reduction of fe3 via electron transfer after been adsorbed on the surface of catalysts to confirm this statement the concentration of extra added fe3 mo6 ions were also monitored in femgal mos4 pms system as shown fig s16 the concentration of fe3 and mo6 ions gradually decreased along with the reaction time because of the stronger adsorption ability of femgal mos4 towards these ions more than 65 decrease in the concentration of fe3 ions was noted in 1 h after adding 5 ppm fe3 ions fig s16a likewise the concentration of mo6 also gradually decreased when 2 10 ppm mo6 ions were used as an additive catalyst fig s16b these results thus highlighted that the oxidized metals ions fe3 mo6 produced during pms activation eq 2 were re adsorbed on the surface of femgal mos4 to regenerate surface bound active fe2 mo4 ions additionally this hypothesis was further supported by the fact that the increase of ionic strength would benefit the material to acquire additional negative charge allowing it to adsorb more fe3 mo6 ions from solution as shown in fig s17 the increase of ionic strength 50 mm naclo4 first inhibited the phb degradation this effect was related to the additional negative charge on the catalyst surface promoting electrostatic repulsion between pms and catalyst particles however the increase of phb degradation after fe3 ions being added to the above solution might be related to the adsorption of more fe3 ions due to additional negative charge offering additional active sites for activation of pms these results thus proved that the adsorption of fe3 mo6 ions from the reaction mixture and the regularly regenerated fe2 mo4 as active sites on the surface of femgal mos4 catalyst were the main factors for efficient pms activation a clear evidence where s2 s s0 were proved to play a critical role in controlling the efficient oxidation states fe2 mo4 of femgal mos4 catalyst was obtained after xps analysis as shown an increase of fe2 content from 62 fig 2b to 72 fig 5 a and decrease in mo6 content from 71 fig 2c to 57 fig 5b were found upon reacting femgal mos4 with pms likewise the peaks ratio assigned to s2 decreased from 74 26 and those of s0 and so4 2 increased dramatically from 18 to 8 to 60 and 14 respectively figs 2d and 5c 3 5 identification of reactive species in femgal mos4 pms system it is commonly accepted that hydroxyl radical can be selectively scavenged by ter butyl alcohol tba k oh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 li et al 2019 wang et al 2017 cheng et al 2017a b as compared to sulfate radicals kso4 4 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2017 cheng et al 2017a b similarly both so4 and oh radicals react very quickly with ethanol k so4 1 6 7 8 107 m 1 s 1 k oh 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 during the application of these selective scavengers fig 6 fig s18 significant inhibition effect on the degradation of phb was found for example the degradation rate for phb decreased from 2 0 10 3 s 1 to 3 3 10 5 s 1 or to 2 8 10 4 s 1 when excess amount of ethanol or tba was applied respectively these results thus suggested the presence of both so4 and oh radicals as the major reactive species responsible for the degradation phb to further confirmed the role of so4 and oh radicals epr analysis was applied fig 6c as shown a characteristic four line spectrum of dmpo oh and six line spectrum of dmpo so4 was observed in femgal mos4 pms system additionally the intensities of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 peaks deceases after adding phb which suggested the utilization of free radicals during oxidation of the target compound additionally the peak intensity for dmpo oh and dmpo so4 increased with time fig 6d suggesting the continuous production of so4 and oh radicals in femgal mos4 pms system these observation thus confirmed the existence of so4 and oh radicals as actual reactive species and these findings are in accordance of radical scavenging studies 3 6 proposed pms activation and degradation mechanism during the pms activation it is believed that pms first undergoes complexation at the surface of catalysts before generating free radicals the changes in the ionic strength can affect this complexation by inhibiting the electrostatic interactions between pms molecules and catalyst particles as shown fig 4a the increase of ionic strength significantly inhibited the phb degradation furthermore the addition of hpo4 anions fig 4b has almost stopped the phb degradation due the scavenging of surface hydroxyl group khan et al 2018 these results thus highlighted that the surface hydroxyl group of femgal mos4 catalyst play an important role in the complexation of pms additionally the higher electronegativity e n of sulphur 2 58 than fe or mo 1 8 might facilitate this complexation due to the induced positive charge on the femgal mos4 ldh layers atr ftir spectroscopy can easily measure this complexation of pms in the range of 1249 1060 cm 1 zhang et al 2014 the atr ftir analysis conducted for pms and femgal mos4 fig s19 demonstrated a red shift of about 6 cm 1 from pms spectra when femgal mos4 was introduced into pms solution these results clearly suggested the complexation of pms might be in the form of feii moiv oh oso3 at the surface of femgal mos4 catalyst in order to prove this complexation pms concentration was examined under different condition fig s20 as shown the decomposition of pms did not occurred in the presence of phb whereas pms was decomposed to significant extent in the presence of femgal mos4 catalyst indicating a typical free radical mechanism feng et al 2017 ahn et al 2016 moreover the increased pms decomposition after introducing phb was due the fact that organic pollutants utilize the generated free radical and thus enhance the pms decomposition these results are in accordance with the typical free radical system co2 pms organics and different from those of surface bound radical or free radical based oxidation systems wu et al 2020 feng et al 2017 ahn et al 2016 zhu et al 2019 from the above discussion it is thus proposed that pms first undergo complexation at the surface of femgal mos4 catalyst to produce feii moiv oh oso3 complex eq 5 then it is speculated that there might be two electron transfer inside the surface of feii moiv oh oso3 complex toward pms and thus producing surface bound feiii mov oh and so4 radicals eq 6 the hydroxyl group at the surface of femgal mos4 were proved to play an important role in the complexation of pms moreover the massive changes in the area ratio of o 1s for surface hydroxyl oh as demonstrated by xps analysis before and after the reaction fig s21 also highlighted the important role of surface hydroxyl group in the pms complexation khan et al 2018 5 feii moiv oh hso5 feii moiv oh oso3 oh 6 feii moiv oh oso3 feiii mov oh so4 as shown in fig 3a and fig s2 the removal of phb was negligible in the presence of homogeneous mo6 and fe3 or heterogeneous femgal moo4 this indicate the important role of s during catalytic activation of pms while using femgal mos4 as catalyst this important role of s might be related to keep femgal mos4 in the most efficient oxidation states fe2 mo4 as discussed in detail in section 3 4 clear evidence for the above statement came from the results of xps showing noticeable changes in the fe 2p mo 3d and s 2p spectra before and after pms activation figs 2 and 5 for example an increase of fe2 content from 62 fig 2b to 72 fig 5a was observed upon exposure femgal mos4 catalyst to pms similarly mo6 content was decreased from 71 fig 2c to 57 fig 5b likewise positive shift was also observed in the case of s 2p before and after pms activation figs 2d and 5c for example the peaks of s 2p at 161 90 162 81 164 17 and 168 18 ev were shifted to 162 24 163 57 164 57 and 168 85 ev the peaks ratio assigned to s2 decreased from 74 to 26 and those of s0 and so4 2 increased dramatically from 18 to 8 to 60 and 14 respectively noted that the reduction of feiii movi with pms is thermodynamically not feasible by considering the standard reduction of pms eo hso5 so42 1 81 ev fe feiii feii 0 76 and mo movi moiv 0 86 ev guo et al 2019 sun et al 2018 rimstidt and vaughan 2003 in contrast the standard reduction potential of sulphur eo s2 s1 0 34 ev ifthikar et al 2020 allows the thermodynamic feasible reduction process of feiii movi into feii moiv moiv and thus suggested that sulphur might play important contribution in the changes of oxidation states of fe and mo as seen in figs 2 and 5 it is therefore suggested that the oxidation of s2 into s s0 or so3 2 so4 2 were accompanied by electron transfer to regulate the active sites through reduction of least reactive feiii movi into more reactive feii mov moiv oxidations states of femgal mos4 catalyst in a series of reactions additionally this phenomena also suggested that the activation efficiency of femgal mos4 would decrease once all of the s2 s or s0 were consumed owing to the slowdown of feii mov moiv regeneration this hypothesis was supported by the decrease in phb degradation over five consecutive cyclic experiments fig 5d as shown the phb degradation gradually decreased from 100 to 77 in the fifth cycle based on this discussion a suitable mechanism was proposed the s2 species of mos4 2 anions was oxidized into s s0 or so3 2 so4 2 in a series of reaction eq 8 14 and the generated electron would be used to reduce feiii movi into surface bound feii moiv species to re start a fresh pms activation eqs 5 and 6 this cyclic process will continue until all of the s2 s s0 oxidized into so4 2 scheme 1 7 feiii movi hso5 feii moiv so5 h 8 fe mo s3 s2 feiii moiv fe mo s3 s feii movi 10 fe mo s3 s h2o fe mo s3 soh h 11 fe mo s3 soh h2o fe mo s3 so2 e h 12 fe mo s3 so2 h2o fe mo s3 so3 2e 2h 13 fe mo s3 so3 fe mo s3 fe so3 14 fe mo s3 so3 fe mo s2 s2o3 2 15 s2o3 2 2h s h2so3 16 so4 oh oh so4 2 furthermore we also detected the oxidative product of phb using gc ms as shown in table s7 and in fig s22 based on the identified products a schematic pathway was proposed fig 7 for the degradation products the identified products suggested that the oxidation of phb occurred through the decarboxylation or dehydration reactions small molecular acids i e 2 hydroxypropanoic acid 2 hydroxyacedic acid and fumaric acid were produced after breakdown of aromatic ring these small chain molecular acids were then finally converted to co2 and h2o as noted from 65 toc removal the hydroxyl radical induced intermediate product i e dihydroxybenzoic as proposed previously in majority of studies was not detected here rayaroth et al 2017 oh et al 2017 the absence of hyroxylated product suggested that the intermediate of dihydroxybenzoic might be mineralized quickly after reacting with other reactive species additionally the decarboxylation of phb and then to other intermediate products would be the dominant pathway by considering the selectivity of so4 toward phb fig s18 slow generation of oh radical 6 5 107 m 1s 1 and lower degradation of nb k oh nb 3 9 109 m 1s 1 kso4 nb 106 m 1s 1 in femgal mos4 pms system rayaroth et al 2017 oh et al 2017 4 conclusion heterogeneous fe based activation of pms for pollutants removal has attracted significant research interest owing to their environmental and cost benefits however the slow transformation of feiii feii redox cycle prevent it to develop a sustainable system for real application in this work we studied to improve the transformation of feiii feii redox cycle after introducing different regulating centers co3 2 no3 s5 2 moo4 2 and mos4 2 in the interlayers of femgal ldh the results revealed that femgal ldh with mos4 2 as regulating center was extremely efficient with degradation rate 10 100 times faster than fe based fe3o4 femgal co3 femgal no3 femgal s5 and femgal moo4 well known nano catalysts mno2 co3o4 and cuo fe3o4 or reported fenton s like co catalytic systems fe3 ws2 pms or fe3 mos2 pms additionally femgal mos4 pms system remained consistent over a ph range of 3 0 7 0 and the degradation kinetics were not inhibited by the excessive amount of inorganic anions and organic matter this excellent catalytic activity of femgal mos4 pms system was related to the regular regeneration of feii moiv active sites enhanced pms utilization efficiency and generation of abundant free radicals based on radicals scavengers and epr analysis oh and so4 radicals were accounted as the dominant reactive species in femgal mos4 pms system furthermore possible degradation pathway based on the identification of intermediate products from lcms analysis was also deduced for phb degradation additionally as proved by xps and other analytic techniques the electron rich s2 group coming from mos4 2 play an essential role to promote the reduction of non reactive feiii movi into active feii moiv sites through continuous electron transfer this property of femgal mos4 not only makes it more reactive but also provide environment friendly and cost effective technique as the residual pms will not needs to be treated by using some additional chemical reductants due to the increase pms utilization efficiency this work not only explains the positive aspects of regulating the redox center of fe with mos4 2 but also provides new window to prepare an efficient stable environment friendly and cost
