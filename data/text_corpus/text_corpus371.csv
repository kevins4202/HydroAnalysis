crucial for protecting river water quality in drinking water source areas this study employed a geomorphology based nonpoint source pollution gbnp model to simulate hydrological processes together with nps pollutant transport and transformation processes from 1980 to 2019 in the upper xin an river basin an important drinking water headwater the simulations revealed the spatiotemporal characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus loads and their influences on river water quality the results showed that the long term average total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp loads were 3219 kg km 2 yr 1 and 293 kg km 2 yr 1 respectively the proportional coefficients for tn and tp entering the rivers from the watershed were 0 40 and 0 37 the tn and tp loads during the april to july flood season accounted for 65 0 and 63 2 of the annual total respectively annual tn load was significantly correlated with annual runoff depth soil erosion and tn input in the interannual variation while the interannual variation of tp load was significantly correlated with annual runoff depth and soil erosion the long term average tn and tp loads showed spatial patterns similar to those of land use and runoff depth respectively the daily tn concentrations showed a clockwise hysteresis relationship with discharge during flood events while the daily tp concentrations had a single positive correlation with discharge throughout a whole year without atmospheric n deposition the average tn load would decrease from 3122 kg km 2 yr 1 to 1266 kg km 2 yr 1 in 2000 2009 the tn load from atmospheric deposition accounted for 65 71 of the total load which implies that river water quality protection must include local basin eco environmental protection and air pollution control over broader areas this study showed that the distributed modelling of hydrological and biogeochemical processes is crucial to understand the spatiotemporal variability in nonpoint source nutrient loads over the watershed and is helpful to identifying key factors affecting river water quality keywords nitrogen and phosphorus loads distributed process based nonpoint source pollution modelling atmospheric deposition xin an river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the rapid economic development in china has placed enormous pressures on aquatic environments over the past decades and drinking water quality is threatened due to severe pollution wang et al 2019 hou et al 2022 compared with point source pollutants from factories and power plants nonpoint source nps pollutants are harder to identify and regulate thus npss have received increasing amounts of attention shen et al 2014 rao et al 2022 fertilizer use including n p2o5 and k2o in china increased from 1 3 billion kg yr to 5 4 billion kg yr in 1980 2019 according to the national bureau of statistics of china excessive cultivation and overfertilization have caused nitrogen n and phosphorus p releases leading to severe eutrophication in many water bodies zhang et al 2008 le et al 2010 chen et al 2018 although for decades policies and regulations have been implemented with the aim of reducing sediment and nutrient export from agricultural fields the surface water quality in many watersheds has not improved significantly hansen et al 2021 understanding the spatiotemporal characteristics of various types of pollution sources is needed for effective water quality management especially for the drinking water source areas previous studies have often considered rural human activities agricultural lands livestock and poultry breeding aquaculture and non agricultural lands as nps inputs he et al 2020 liu et al 2021 in addition atmospheric n and p deposition can be an important source of nps pollution across china many studies have shown that atmospheric deposition in china increased from 13 2 kg n ha yr to 21 0 kg n ha yr from the 1980s to the 2000s gao et al 2020 atmospheric n deposition in the three gorges reservoir area accounted for approximately 12 9 of the tn in the river from 2006 to 2015 chen et al 2022 tn and tp from atmospheric deposition in the three gorges reservoir area of hubei province accounted for 52 7 and 21 1 of tn and tp respectively in the river from 1995 to 2007 ma et al 2011 the amount of tn from atmospheric deposition flowing into river channels via surface slopes is estimated to be approximately 13 3 15 2 of the tn flux in typical forest dominated basins of china deng et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to consider the influence of atmospheric deposition on the control and management of water pollution zhang et al 2022 but the relative importance of atmospheric deposition on the water quality of other major drinking water source areas in china remains largely unknown managing the n and p loads in large watersheds is challenging due to the spatiotemporal variations in nutrient inputs from multiple sources shen et al 2014 wang et al 2020b distributed nps pollution models provide important tools to simulate n and p migration and transformation from hillslopes to riverine areas wang et al 2020a widely used physically distributed process based models that consider nps pollution include annagnps bingner theurer 2001 swmm gironás et al 2010 and swat arnold et al 1998 etc the annagnps model and swmm are targeted at agricultural and urban nps pollutants respectively the swat model considers nps pollutants at a basin scale however its hydrological process lacks physical mechanisms which may bring great uncertainty to the simulation of water quality rao et al 2022 tang et al 2011 developed a geomorphology based nonpoint source pollution gbnp model that discretizes a watershed into a hillslope river system and describes the dynamics of hydrology hydraulics sediment and pollutant transport processes the gbnp model simulates the above processes based on physical processes and can well depict the spatiotemporal dynamics of water quantity and water quality the gbnp model has been applied to the yangtze river basin wang et al 2020a chaobai river basin tang et al 2011 and xin an river basin wang et al 2015 and has been demonstrated to be effective for representing the spatiotemporal characteristics of nps pollutants the xin anjiang reservoir located at the outlet of the xin an river basin xrb is an important source of drinking water for the yangtze river delta region of china which provides drinking water for 20 million people despite its importance the water quality in the xrb does not consistently meet the high quality standards for drinking water the observed water quality data from the upstream entrance in 2010 2019 showed that the median and monthly average water tn concentrations in winter and spring were 1 0 mg l many studies have been carried out to investigate the characteristics of nps pollution upstream of the xin anjiang reservoir however most of them ignored inputs from atmospheric deposition zhai et al 2014 yan et al 2016 guo et al 2020 the long term changes in n and p loads the contribution of atmospheric deposition to pollution and the mechanisms of influence on water quality remain unclear in the study area herein multisource observations are combined with a process based gbnp model the objectives of this study are 1 to understand the spatiotemporal variations in n and p loads over the past 40 years in the xrb 2 to investigate the influences of pollution change on river water quality and 3 to clarify the contribution of atmospheric deposition to river water quality in the study area 2 materials 2 1 study area the xrb is located upstream of jiekou station and covers an area of 5760 km2 117 38 118 54 e and 29 29 30 14 n fig 1 the xrb features a subtropical temperate monsoon climate the annual mean temperature and annual precipitation of the xrb are approximately 16 c and 1700 mm respectively li et al 2017 zhai et al 2014 the flood season is from april to july and precipitation in this period accounts for 55 8 of the annual total wang et al 2014 the elevation of the xrb ranges from 113 m to 1729 m with higher elevations near the boundary and lower elevations in the central region the land use map of 2018 indicates that forests shrubs and tea gardens accounted for 77 0 of the entire basin the percentage of paddy field and upland area was 15 4 followed by grassland 4 5 urban and rural settlements 2 4 and water bodies 0 7 fig 1 table 1 from the spatial distribution of land use changes from 1980 to 2018 fig s1 three clear patterns of land use change were found involving changes from forests to shrubs and grassland in the higher mountainous areas from shrubs to forests and from paddy fields to urban and rural settlements the xrb has experienced rapid urbanization in recent decades li et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 and the magnitude and frequency of rainstorms increased significantly in 1961 2020 li et al 2022 based on the huangshan and xuancheng statistical yearbooks the intensity of fertilizer consumption in the xrb increased significantly from 80 6 kg ha in 1980 to 276 8 kg ha in 2019 2 2 data

spectroradiometer for the period 1982 2019 2 2 2 climatic forcing data the daily meteorological data in 1980 2019 were downloaded from the china meteorological administration http data cma cn for 13 meteorological stations within and near the xrb daily precipitation data were collected from the hydrology yearbook of the people s republic of china hyprc for 40 rainfall stations within the xrb during 1980 1989 and 2000 2019 for the period of 1990 1999 the precipitation from the 0 1 gridded precipitation products developed by yang he 2019 was adopted 2 2 3 pollution data the average annual emission data for point source pollution at each sewage outlet from 1980 to 2019 were provided by the huangshan municipal ecology and environment bureau the annual socioeconomic data for the xrb were obtained for the three districts and five counties from the huangshan and xuancheng statistical yearbooks of 1980 2019 the types of socioeconomic data included rural population crop paddy wheat maize soybean potato oil plants fruit and tea yields fertilizer including n p and compound fertilizer usage and the number of animals including poultry pig cow and sheep and their products including eggs and aquatic products atmospheric wet inorganic n deposition data with a 1 km resolution for four periods 1996 2000 2001 2005 2006 2010 and 2011 2015 were referenced from jia et al 2019 and these included three variables i e nh3 n no3 n and dissolved inorganic n din sum of nh3 n no3 n atmospheric dry inorganic n deposition data with a 10 km resolution for the 2006 2010 and 2010 2015 periods

and environment bureau for the tunxi and yuliang stations during 2003 2017 for the jiekou station during 2010 2019 3 methods 3 1 the framework of the gbnp model the gbnp model was developed on the basis of the geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm yang et al 1998 and incorporated the processes of soil erosion sediment transport and pollutants migration and transformation with the hydrological processes the gbnp model couples soil erosion and nutrient dynamics with rainfall runoff processes on hillslopes and couples the sediment dissolved and absorbed pollutant transport with flow routing in the river network pollutants on hillslopes can be exchanged between soil and runoff during the rainfall runoff processes and leached in unsaturated soil profile tang et al 2011 therefore the pollutant movement is simulated in three layers in the vertical direction moving with runoff exchanging between runoff and soil in a mixed layer of water and soil and leaching in the lower soil layers gao et al 2004 in a river segment pollutants are divided into the dissolved nitrate ammonia and dissolved p and the adsorbed organic n and p phases fig 2 for the absorbed nutrients the movement process in a river segment can be described with sediment yu et al 2006 the movement of dissolved pollutants in a river segment is represented by the longitudinal dispersion equation yu et al 2006 chu 1994 the different components of n and p also have corresponding biochemical reactions during the migration processes more details are given by tang et al 2011 and wang et al 2015 in this study the gbnp model uses a 1 km resolution grid system to represent the spatial variability in climate forcing vegetation and soil then each 1 km grid is represented by a number of topographically similar hillslopes which are the basic units of the hydrological simulation the simulation was run at an hourly time step and the results were analysed on daily monthly and annual time scales on a hillslope soil erosion and nutrient i e nitrate ammonia organic n dissolved p and organic p in this study transport and transformation processes are combined with rainfall runoff processes based on the 1 km grid system the study basin is divided into 77 subcatchments linked by the river network in which the sediment transport and dissolved and absorbed pollutants are simulated together with flow routing the long term 1980 2019 spatiotemporal distributions of nps n and p loads on the hillslope and the variations in tn and tp concentrations in the river network were simulated in the study area fig 3 showed the framework for simulation and analysis of the nps n and p loads and their effects on river water quality in the gbnp model 3 2 methods for calculating pollution inputs various types of pollution sources including point and nonpoint sources were comprehensively covered in this study point source pollution mainly consists of urban domestic sewage or industrial emissions after treatment by sewage treatment plants and the latter is strictly controlled and monitored in the xrb du 2022 in this study we assumed that point source pollution occurred uniformly every hour over a given year then in the model point source pollution directly entered the nearest river channel in a subcatchment according to sewage outlet positions in addition to point source pollution nonpoint source pollution is also studied it refers to the pollution that flows into the river network indirectly along the hillslopes in a decentralized form and includes rural domestic sewage crop fertilizer losses solid waste pollution and pollution from livestock and poultry breeding aquaculture and atmospheric deposition since the nps pollution inputs cannot be monitored directly statistical methods were utilized to calculate them according to the following formula johnes 1996 wang et al 2021 the yearly time series of nps pollution data were generated by using the population planting area crop yields number of breeding heads and aquatic product yields multiplied by the corresponding export coefficients the export coefficient values of nps pollution are shown in table 3 1

amounts were input into the model according to appropriate fertilization times and the proportion of base and additional fertilization of different crops table 3 crop fertilizers were applied to the paddy field upland and tea garden areas except for crop fertilization agricultural nps pollution was assumed to be produced uniformly every day over the same year the rural domestic sewage inputs were loaded into areas where rural settlements were located solid waste and manure inputs from livestock and poultry breeding were placed in areas of paddy fields and uplands aquaculture pollution was localized to a pit pond due to a lack of specific occurrence locations the atmospheric deposition pollution inputs were mainly based on the observed data products this study referred to zhu s 2015 research and used the dissolved inorganic n din sum of nh3 n no3 n data from the xrb to project the tn wet deposition in each period the atmospheric wet n deposition was obtained by multiplying the din data by the conversion coefficient jia et al 2019 zhu et al 2015 because a limited amount of observed data was available the monitoring data from 1996 to 2000 was used for the atmospheric n wet deposition data for the 1980s and 1990s we used the average value over the two periods from 2001 to 2005 and from 2006 to 2010 for the 2000s and we used the monitoring data from 2011 to 2015 for the 2010s referring to the methods of chen et al 2022 and geng et al 2021 the atmospheric wet n depositions were equivalently converted into rainfall n concentrations the atmospheric dry n deposition in the xrb was input into the model as the sum of several particle states of the inorganic n dry deposition data jia et al 2016 because observed data were not available for atmospheric dry n deposition for the 1980s 1990s and 2000s we used the monitored data from 2006 to 2010 for these time periods and we used the monitored data from 2010 to 2015 for the 2010s the atmospheric dry n deposition data were imported into the simulation for the overall river basin for each day according to zhu et al 2016 the ratio of wet deposition between n and p in the xrb is approximately 57 1 and atmospheric dry p deposition accounts for approximately 40 75 of the total atmospheric p deposition hou et al 2012 thus 1 57th of the atmospheric wet n deposition was used as the wet atmospheric p deposition and dry atmospheric p deposition was assumed to account for 58 of the total atmospheric p deposition in this study the spatial distributions of the long term average tn and tp inputs based on the above calculation results are shown in fig 4 a b and the temporal variations in the annual and monthly average tn and tp inputs are shown in fig 4 c and fig 4 d respectively 3 3 model calibration and validation methods as sediment and nutrient yields are generated by rainfall runoff processes the calibrations and validations of model parameters were performed in the order of discharge sediment and nutrients tn tp the 2001 2010 monthly discharge and sediment data for the tunxi and yuliang stations were used for calibration and the data from 2011 to 2017 were used to validate the hydrological and sediment simulations the 2003 2010 monthly tn and tp loads of the tunxi and yuliang stations were used for calibration and the data from 2011 to 2017 were used to validate the river water quality model performances were evaluated using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr nash sutcliffe 1970 gupta et al 1999 legates mccabe 1999 the model simulation was determined to be satisfactory if nse 0 5 and rsr 0 7 if pbias within 25 for runoff if pbias within 55 for sediment and if pbias within 70 for n and p moriasi et al 2007 at a monthly scale 6 nse 1 i 1 n q m i q s i 2 i 1 n q m i q m 2 7 pbias i 1 n 100 q m i q s i i 1 n q m i 8 rsr i 1 n q m i q s i 2 i 1 n q mi q m 2 where n represents the number of simulated or measured data i represents the sequence of the simulated or measured data q m i represents the ith measured data and q m is the mean value of the measured data q s i represents the ith simulated data and q s is the mean value of the simulated data 4 results 4 1 model calibration and validation results the model performance for simulating the monthly discharge and sediment and nutrients during the calibration and validation periods is shown in table 4 the results of the monthly runoff simulations at the tunxi and yuliang stations during both periods showed that the nse was within 0 89 0 97 pbias was within 4 44 2 70 and rsr was 0 33 the statistical indicators met the evaluation criteria indicating that the simulated discharge represented the temporal dynamics of the observed values well table 4 fig 5 a1 b1 the statistical indicators for the monthly sediment simulations of the two stations during both the calibration and validation periods met the model evaluation criteria as the nse was within 0 70 0 86 pbias was within 24 24 40 32 and rsr was within 0 37 0 54 table 4 fig 5 a2 b2 shows that the simulations captured the monthly trends and the peak time for sediment loads accurately although the sediment simulations underestimated the peak the performance of the sediment load simulation was acceptable the simulation performances of the tn loads at the yuliang station and the tp loads at the two stations during both the calibration and validation periods and the tn loads at the tunxi station during the calibration period met the evaluation criteria as the nse was within 0 51 0 75 pbias was within 18 55 46 01 and rsr was within 0 50 0 70 table 4 fig 5 b3 a4 b4 the statistical indicators of tn loads at the tunxi station during the validation period slightly deviated from the evaluation standard nse 0 45 pbias 44 57 and rsr 0 74 table 4 fig 5 a3 the tn concentration was measured once a month and the observed value was used as the mean concentration for the same month which might be a reason for the relatively low values of nse and high values of rsr for tn 4 2 temporal variations in the nutrient load table 5 shows the decadal variability in annual precipitation evapotranspiration runoff soil erosion tn and tp input and load during 1980 2019 the 40 year average precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff depth were 1858 mm yr 840 mm yr and 1018 mm yr respectively the average soil erosion was 3 21 105 kg km 2 yr 1 which means that this area was slightly eroded according to the classification and gradation criteria for soil erosion sl190 2007 standard in china the tn and tp inputs which represented the nonpoint nutrient inputs to the watershed were 7970 kg km 2 yr 1 and 777 kg km 2 yr 1 respectively during the simulated period the tn and tp loads representing the nutrient load from hillslopes to the river network were 3219 kg km 2 yr 1 and 293 kg km 2 yr 1 respectively therefore the average proportional coefficients for tn and tp entering the rivers from the watershed were 0 40 and 0 37 respectively the results also demonstrated that the interdecadal variations in soil erosion and tp load were consistent with those of precipitation and runoff depth table 5 the highest value was in the 1990s and the lowest value was in the 2000s in contrast with soil erosion and the tp load the tn load did not decrease noticeably with precipitation in the 2000s it may have been more influenced by the increased tn input fig 6 shows the monthly average runoff depth soil erosion and tn and tp loads and their interannual variations from 1980 to 2019 in the xrb the tn and tp loads were consistent with runoff depth and soil erosion fig 6 a the tn and tp loads during the flood season april july accounted for 65 0 and 63 2 respectively and the runoff depth and soil erosion during that period accounted for 63 9 and 58 3 respectively the annual tn load ranged from 1879 kg km2 to 4824 kg km2 fig 6 b indicating a large interannual variability the temporal variations in the annual tn load showed an insignificant increasing trend 8 7 kg km 2 yr 1 p 0 05 which was also occurred for the annual runoff depth and soil erosion 1 3 mm yr p 0 05 391 1 kg km 2 yr 1 p 0 05 in contrast the annual tn input showed a significant increasing trend 13 7 kg km 2 yr 1 p 0 05 fig 4 d further analysis showed that the interannual variation in the annual tn load was significantly correlated with that of the annual runoff depth soil erosion and tn input r 0 80 p 0 05 r 0 77 p 0 05 r 0 38 p 0 05 fig s2 a1 a3 the annual tp load ranged from 87 kg km2 to 694 kg km2 fig 6 b and showed an insignificant increasing trend 1 1 kg km 2 yr 1 p 0 05 from 1980 to 2019 although the total tp input exhibited a significant increasing trend 13 6 kg km 2 yr 1 p 0 05 fig 4 d the correlation analysis results showed that the interannual variation in the annual tp load was significantly correlated with that of the annual runoff depth and soil erosion r 0 57 p 0 05 r 0 47 p 0 05 but not with the tp input r 0 16 p 0 05 fig s2 b1 b3 the temporal variations in tp load were mainly affected by the rainfall runoff process and had significant build up effect in dry years and wash off effect in wet years the change in tp load was consistent with that of runoff increasing and decreasing at the same time 4 3 spatial distributions of the nutrient load the nps nutrient load was generated along with the rainfall runoff process fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of the long term average water balance components and their changing trends in the xrb from 1980 to 2019 at the 0 05 significance level the precipitation and runoff depth were higher in the southwest than in the northeast fig 7 a1 c1 the evapotranspiration and runoff values were relatively high in the southwest while other regions had opposite characteristics namely high low evapotranspiration and low high runoff occurred simultaneously fig 7 b1 c1 trends in the annual precipitation and runoff were insignificant in most areas and the areas with significant increasing trends in evapotranspiration were larger than those with significant decreasing trends fig 7 a2 b2 c2 the spatial distribution of the long term average soil erosion and tn and tp loads and their changing trends in the xrb from 1980 to 2019 at the 0 05 significance level are shown in fig 8 soil erosion was higher in the mountain area near the boundary of the basin than in the central region fig 8 a1 in contrast the tn load was higher in the central region than in the other regions and the maximum value reached 8025 kg km 2 yr 1 fig 8 b1 compared with fig 1 the spatial distribution of the tn load was consistent with that of land use which was reflected in a higher load in agricultural land and tea gardens and a lower load in other land use types this result indicated that the spatial characteristics of the tn load were mainly affected by agricultural nps pollution a comparison of fig 7 c1 and fig 8 c1 reveals that the tp load and runoff depth had good consistency in spatial patterns they were higher in the west and south the maximum value reached 2236 kg km 2 yr 1 and lower in the east and north which indicates that the main influencing factor for the tp load may have been the rainfall runoff process the contributions of rainfall to the tn or tp load in the watershed were reflected in both of the following atmospheric rainfall processes the direct introduction of pollutants via rainfall and flushing which introduces pollutants indirectly through surface hydrological processes the trends in the tn load ranged from 121 0 kg km 2 yr 1 to 200 4 kg km 2 yr 1 fig 8 b2 similar to the distribution of tn load the spatial pattern was similar to that of land use fig 8 b2 indicating that human activities have been increasing in agricultural areas the areas with increasing trends in the tn load accounted for 60 6 of the watershed but only 14 2 of the areas were significant among these areas with increasing trends 60 5 were paddy fields and 13 1 were forests or shrubs in contrast the decreasing trends in tn load intensities accounted for 39 4 of the watershed and only 1 4 of the areas were significant among these areas with decreasing trends 41 1 were forest or shrub 24 5 were grassland the areas with significant increasing and decreasing trends in the tn load were mainly agricultural lands and urban and rural settlements respectively the trends in the tp load ranged from 17 8 kg km 2 yr 1 to 45 6 kg km 2 yr 1 fig 8 c2 the tp load and soil erosion showed good agreement in the spatial distribution for the changing trends fig 8 a2 c2 the areas with increasing trends in the tp load accounted for 70 6 of the watershed and correspondingly decreasing trends accounted for 29 4 only 2 3 of the area showed significant trends of which 1 0 showed increasing trends and 1 3 showed decreasing trends the areas with significant increasing and decreasing trends in the tp load were also mainly agricultural lands and urban and rural settlements respectively analysing the influencing factors for the nutrient load at the subcatchment scale is helpful for determining the pollution generation mechanisms strokal et al 2016 we considered four major factors terrain hydrology sediment and nutrient source then we chose slope runoff depth soil erosion intensity and nutrient input as potential impact factors to analyse for their correlations with the nutrient load at the subcatchment scale the results fig s3 indicated that the tn load was significantly positively correlated with tn input r 0 64 p 0 05 and runoff depth r 0 30 p 0 05 and negatively associated with slope r 0 32 p 0 05 the subbasin scale characteristics of the tn load were consistent with the grid scale where a high tn load occurred in agricultural lands with high tn inputs and low slopes showing that the distribution of the tn load was mainly affected by tn inputs in contrast the tp load was significantly and positively associated with runoff depth r 0 72 p 0 05 and soil erosion r 0 29 p 0 05 the results at the subbasin scale were consistent with those of the above grid scale showing that the distribution of the tp load was mainly affected by runoff depth 4 4 effect of the nutrient load on river water quality the discharge at the river outlet of jiekou station accounted for approximately 63 of the total inflow to the xin anjiang reservoir li et al 2022 thus the river water quality at jiekou station has a substantial impact on the water quality of the xin anjiang reservoir fig 9 shows the boxplots of the monthly river tn and tp concentrations in different years at jiekou station which ranged from 0 14 mg l to 1 14 mg l and from 0 01 mg l to 0 07 mg l during 1980 2019 respectively the river water quality at jiekou station exceeded the threshold for the high quality standard of drinking water sources in february and march tn 1 0 mg l the river tn concentrations were lower during the flood season than during the nonflood season indicating that concentration dilution due to increased discharge exceeded concentration increases caused by nps pollution during the flood season in contrast the sediment and tp concentrations were higher during the flood season than during the nonflood season indicating that these concentrations were mainly controlled by the rainfall runoff processes of the study area this revealed that the dominant mechanisms of discharge for tn and tp concentrations were different increasing discharge caused greater dilution of the tn concentration and a greater increase in the tp concentration mainly due to increased erosion in addition the monthly average river tn and tp concentrations from 1980 to 2019 at jiekou station in the xrb are plotted in fig s4 the interannual variability in the annual average discharge and sediment tn and tp concentrations based on monthly concentration analysis from 1980 to 2019 at jiekou station in the xrb is shown in fig s5 all these variables showed nonsignificant increasing trends the average annual tn concentration ranged from 0 33 mg l to 0 90 mg l and was highest in 2007 this year had the lowest recorded discharge and the observed tn concentration was influenced by point source pollution the average annual tp concentration was between 0 017 mg l and 0 048 mg l which was highest in 1996 due to high annual precipitation and runoff and rare heavy precipitation events occurred the same year the interdecadal variability of the above variables was plotted fig s6 and it was found that the 2000s had the highest tn concentrations and lowest discharge while the highest sediment and tp concentrations occurred in the 1990s which had the highest discharge to further analyse the spatial characteristics of water quality boxplots of the average annual river tn and tp concentrations in the 77 subcatchments of the xrb from 1980 to 2009 were constructed fig s7 the average annual river tn and tp concentrations ranged from 0 31 mg l to 6 42 mg l and from 0 0003 mg l to 0 36 mg l respectively river water quality varied greatly among different subcatchments and the higher the median water quality concentration was the greater the difference for the year 5 discussions 5 1 impact of hydrological and biogeochemical interaction on river water quality based on previously obtained results river water quality is closely related to the amounts of runoff and sediment for an in depth analysis of the relationship between hydrologic processes and tn and tp concentration changes on a daily scale a typical year 2007 in which the tn concentration reached a peak was selected the daily hydrograph with discharge and tn and tp concentration at jiekou station is shown in fig 10 although the tn concentration appeared at a local peak simultaneous with a flood event the average tn concentration during the flood season was lower than that in the nonflood season due to the effects of flood dilution fig 10 a1 the daily tn concentration had a clockwise hysteresis relationship with the discharge during the flood events fig 10 a2 when a flood occurred the rainfall runoff processes had build up and wash off effects on the tn concentration due to the build up effect of nutrients before rainfall the tn concentration increased significantly in the early period e g 3 14 3 15 4 22 4 23 5 31 6 1 as the rainfall continued the wash off effect was strengthened and the tn concentration decreased rapidly during the late rainfall period e g 3 16 4 24 6 2 a similar clockwise hysteresis relationship between discharge and tn concentration was also found in tuojiang where the tn load intensity was higher than in other sub basins in the upper yangtze river basin wang et al 2020a this also indicated that the tn input in xrb was in a surplus state and the concentration of tn in river channels was mainly controlled by the rainfall runoff process in the study area in contrast the tp concentrations were higher during the flood season and lower during the nonflood season fig 10 b1 unlike tn there was no hysteresis curve between the tp concentration and discharge but there was a single positive correlation in one year r 2 0 97 fig 10 b2 in general the rate of increase of tp concentration gradually slowed with an increasing discharge rate the above results showed that hydrological and biogeochemical interaction directly affected the river n and p concentration and hence the water quality protection strategies should be based on the spatio temporal variability in the hydrology and biogeochemistry 5 2 contribution of different pollution sources to tn load and river water quality compared with previous studies in the same area the tn load intensities in this study was nearly 3 4 times higher than these results wang et al 2012 wang et al 2014 in 2001 2010 further analysis revealed that atmospheric deposition was not or only somewthat considered in these studies and it was confirmed to be a nonnegligible source of nps pollution in this region quantifying the effects of different pollution sources on river water quality is very important to protect water source area a previous study demonstrated that the tn input had significant influences on both the spatial and temporal distributions of the tn load in the study area meanwhile the observed data indicated that the tn concentrations in winter and spring were 1 0 mg l thus the data from 2000 to 2009 were used to further quantify the contributions of different types of tn inputs a numerical analysis was carried out on the basis of three case studies fig 11 a case 1 c1 only land surface nutrient inputs including rural domestic sewage crop fertilizer losses solid waste pollution and pollution from livestock and poultry breeding and aquaculture b case 2 c2 only atmospheric deposition inputs and c case 3 c3 both land surface nutrient input and atmospheric deposition for case 1 the average tn load of the watershed was 1266 kg km 2 yr 1 meanwhile the average number of days that the river tn concentration was 1 0 mg l at jiekou station was 5 days yr the spatial distribution of the tn load was similar to that of land use type fig 11 a1 fig 1 showing that the load was greater in agricultural lands and lower in other areas for case 2 the average intensity of the tn load was 2250 kg km 2 yr 1 and it increased to 3122 kg km2 in case 3 both the average value and the spatial distribution of the tn load had additive effects fig 11 a1 a3 the number of days with river water tn concentrations 1 0 mg l at jiekou station increased to 15 days yr in case 3 the tn load due to atmospheric deposition accounted for 65 71 of the tn load entering the river in the xrb in other words 65 71 of the tn exported from the watershed was derived from atmospheric n deposition this might be the reason the tn concentrations in the rivers were not significantly reduced when land surface nutrient inputs were reduced in recent years some studies conducted in other river basins in china have reached similar conclusions zhang 2011 revealed that tn loads caused by wet and dry deposition accounted for nearly half of the tn loads in the changle river basin a typical watershed in a relatively developed southeast coastal area in china ma et al 2011 found that the tn inputs from atmospheric deposition in the three gorges area of hubei province accounted for 52 7 of the tn load in the river from 1995 to 2007 chen et al 2022 reported unexpected n flow and water quality changes due to varying atmospheric deposition in the three gorges reservoir region of china however the contribution of atmospheric deposition to the tn load and river water quality in the study by chen et al 2022 13 was lower than that reported in this research the xrb of this study had relatively less human activity and lower input intensities of land surface pollution at the same time the xrb is surrounded by many large cities such as shanghai hangzhou and nanjing which produce considerable amounts of air pollution thereby increasing the contribution from atmospheric deposition 6 uncertainty and limitations uncertainty might come from the model inputs especially the nps pollutants inputs model parameters and model structure this study revealed the important impact of atmospheric deposition on river water quality in the xrb however there might be uncertainty because the atmospheric deposition observations were very sparse other nps pollutants were estimated from the local governments statistical annual report this might also bring a degree of uncertainty due the low spatial resolution of the statistical data through the numerical analysis we found that the tn load introduced by the soil was 5 which implied less nitrogen from the soil background in the study area however the initial soil chemical parameters obtained from the soil data set might also introduce some uncertainties due to the lack of detail soil sampling in the study area in addition we analysed the sensitivity of the key parameters for simulating tn and tp into the river and found that the sensitive parameters for tn were the slope shape factor rate of ammonia release in sediment attenuation coefficient of nitrate nitrogen in the river channel exchange rate between soil water and runoff and mixed layer thickness for tp the sensitive parameters were the slope shape factor sediment settling rate and attenuation coefficient of dissolved phosphorus in addition the model may have uncertainty because it did not simulate the strong biogeochemistry interaction between the atmosphere and the land surface abdolghafoorian dirmeyer 2021 the fertilization of farmland and returning of manure can produce ammonia volatilization and the air pollution around cities can also be transported in the horizontal direction which should be directly simulated in the nps pollution models this is a limitation of the current process based nps pollution model and should be an important topic in future studies 7 conclusions this study analysed the spatiotemporal variations in nutrient loads and their effects on river water quality in the period 1980 2019 in the xrb using a distributed process based nps pollution model according to the results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the average loads of tn and tp in the study basin during 1980 2019 were 3219 kg km 2 yr 1 and 293 kg km 2 yr 1 respectively the proportional coefficients of tn and tp entering the rivers from the watershed were 0 40 and 0 37 respectively the tn and tp loads during the flood season from april to july accounted for 65 0 and 63 2 of the annual total respectively and runoff during the flood season accounted for 63 9 of the annual total the interannual variation in the annual tn load was significantly correlated with that of the annual runoff depth soil erosion and tn input while the tp load variation was significantly correlated with the annual runoff depth and soil erosion 2 the spatial distribution of the average annual tn load was consistent with that of land use which was higher in the agricultural lands and tea gardens than in the other land use types in contrast the spatial distribution of the average annual tp load had a pattern similar to that of the annual runoff depth the area percentages with significant increasing and decreasing trends in the tn load were 14 2 and 1 4 while those for the tp load were 1 0 and 1 3 respectively the areas with significant increasing trends in tn and tp load mainly consisted of agricultural lands while those with significant decreasing trends mainly consisted of urban and rural settlements 3 the monthly tn and tp concentrations of the river water at jiekou station during 1980 2019 ranged from 0 14 mg l 1 14 mg l and 0 01 mg l 0 07 mg l respectively the monthly average tn concentration was lower during the flood season than during the nonflood season the concentrations of sediment and tp were high during the flood season and low during the nonflood season 4 atmospheric n deposition contributed approximately 65 71 of the tn load in the xrb without atmospheric deposition the average tn load decreased from 3122 kg km 2 yr 1 to 1266 kg km 2 yr 1 during 2000 2009 and the days with river water tn concentration 1 0 mg l decreased from 15 days per year to 5 days per year the results showed that the main water pollution source in the studied basin was air pollution from a wider range which suggests that water quality protection involves both local eco environment protection and the air pollution control over a broader region the study demonstrated that spatially distributed modelling of coupled hydrological and biogeochemical processes is crucial to reveal the spatiotemporal variability in the nps pollutants and offer useful information for protecting the

crucial for protecting river water quality in drinking water source areas this study employed a geomorphology based nonpoint source pollution gbnp model to simulate hydrological processes together with nps pollutant transport and transformation processes from 1980 to 2019 in the upper xin an river basin an important drinking water headwater the simulations revealed the spatiotemporal characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus loads and their influences on river water quality the results showed that the long term average total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp loads were 3219 kg km 2 yr 1 and 293 kg km 2 yr 1 respectively the proportional coefficients for tn and tp entering the rivers from the watershed were 0 40 and 0 37 the tn and tp loads during the april to july flood season accounted for 65 0 and 63 2 of the annual total respectively annual tn load was significantly correlated with annual runoff depth soil erosion and tn input in the interannual variation while the interannual variation of tp load was significantly correlated with annual runoff depth and soil erosion the long term average tn and tp loads showed spatial patterns similar to those of land use and runoff depth respectively the daily tn concentrations showed a clockwise hysteresis relationship with discharge during flood events while the daily tp concentrations had a single positive correlation with discharge throughout a whole year without atmospheric n deposition the average tn load would decrease from 3122 kg km 2 yr 1 to 1266 kg km 2 yr 1 in 2000 2009 the tn load from atmospheric deposition accounted for 65 71 of the total load which implies that river water quality protection must include local basin eco environmental protection and air pollution control over broader areas this study showed that the distributed modelling of hydrological and biogeochemical processes is crucial to understand the spatiotemporal variability in nonpoint source nutrient loads over the watershed and is helpful to identifying key factors affecting river water quality keywords nitrogen and phosphorus loads distributed process based nonpoint source pollution modelling atmospheric deposition xin an river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the rapid economic development in china has placed enormous pressures on aquatic environments over the past decades and drinking water quality is threatened due to severe pollution wang et al 2019 hou et al 2022 compared with point source pollutants from factories and power plants nonpoint source nps pollutants are harder to identify and regulate thus npss have received increasing amounts of attention shen et al 2014 rao et al 2022 fertilizer use including n p2o5 and k2o in china increased from 1 3 billion kg yr to 5 4 billion kg yr in 1980 2019 according to the national bureau of statistics of china excessive cultivation and overfertilization have caused nitrogen n and phosphorus p releases leading to severe eutrophication in many water bodies zhang et al 2008 le et al 2010 chen et al 2018 although for decades policies and regulations have been implemented with the aim of reducing sediment and nutrient export from agricultural fields the surface water quality in many watersheds has not improved significantly hansen et al 2021 understanding the spatiotemporal characteristics of various types of pollution sources is needed for effective water quality management especially for the drinking water source areas previous studies have often considered rural human activities agricultural lands livestock and poultry breeding aquaculture and non agricultural lands as nps inputs he et al 2020 liu et al 2021 in addition atmospheric n and p deposition can be an important source of nps pollution across china many studies have shown that atmospheric deposition in china increased from 13 2 kg n ha yr to 21 0 kg n ha yr from the 1980s to the 2000s gao et al 2020 atmospheric n deposition in the three gorges reservoir area accounted for approximately 12 9 of the tn in the river from 2006 to 2015 chen et al 2022 tn and tp from atmospheric deposition in the three gorges reservoir area of hubei province accounted for 52 7 and 21 1 of tn and tp respectively in the river from 1995 to 2007 ma et al 2011 the amount of tn from atmospheric deposition flowing into river channels via surface slopes is estimated to be approximately 13 3 15 2 of the tn flux in typical forest dominated basins of china deng et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to consider the influence of atmospheric deposition on the control and management of water pollution zhang et al 2022 but the relative importance of atmospheric deposition on the water quality of other major drinking water source areas in china remains largely unknown managing the n and p loads in large watersheds is challenging due to the spatiotemporal variations in nutrient inputs from multiple sources shen et al 2014 wang et al 2020b distributed nps pollution models provide important tools to simulate n and p migration and transformation from hillslopes to riverine areas wang et al 2020a widely used physically distributed process based models that consider nps pollution include annagnps bingner theurer 2001 swmm gironás et al 2010 and swat arnold et al 1998 etc the annagnps model and swmm are targeted at agricultural and urban nps pollutants respectively the swat model considers nps pollutants at a basin scale however its hydrological process lacks physical mechanisms which may bring great uncertainty to the simulation of water quality rao et al 2022 tang et al 2011 developed a geomorphology based nonpoint source pollution gbnp model that discretizes a watershed into a hillslope river system and describes the dynamics of hydrology hydraulics sediment and pollutant transport processes the gbnp model simulates the above processes based on physical processes and can well depict the spatiotemporal dynamics of water quantity and water quality the gbnp model has been applied to the yangtze river basin wang et al 2020a chaobai river basin tang et al 2011 and xin an river basin wang et al 2015 and has been demonstrated to be effective for representing the spatiotemporal characteristics of nps pollutants the xin anjiang reservoir located at the outlet of the xin an river basin xrb is an important source of drinking water for the yangtze river delta region of china which provides drinking water for 20 million people despite its importance the water quality in the xrb does not consistently meet the high quality standards for drinking water the observed water quality data from the upstream entrance in 2010 2019 showed that the median and monthly average water tn concentrations in winter and spring were 1 0 mg l many studies have been carried out to investigate the characteristics of nps pollution upstream of the xin anjiang reservoir however most of them ignored inputs from atmospheric deposition zhai et al 2014 yan et al 2016 guo et al 2020 the long term changes in n and p loads the contribution of atmospheric deposition to pollution and the mechanisms of influence on water quality remain unclear in the study area herein multisource observations are combined with a process based gbnp model the objectives of this study are 1 to understand the spatiotemporal variations in n and p loads over the past 40 years in the xrb 2 to investigate the influences of pollution change on river water quality and 3 to clarify the contribution of atmospheric deposition to river water quality in the study area 2 materials 2 1 study area the xrb is located upstream of jiekou station and covers an area of 5760 km2 117 38 118 54 e and 29 29 30 14 n fig 1 the xrb features a subtropical temperate monsoon climate the annual mean temperature and annual precipitation of the xrb are approximately 16 c and 1700 mm respectively li et al 2017 zhai et al 2014 the flood season is from april to july and precipitation in this period accounts for 55 8 of the annual total wang et al 2014 the elevation of the xrb ranges from 113 m to 1729 m with higher elevations near the boundary and lower elevations in the central region the land use map of 2018 indicates that forests shrubs and tea gardens accounted for 77 0 of the entire basin the percentage of paddy field and upland area was 15 4 followed by grassland 4 5 urban and rural settlements 2 4 and water bodies 0 7 fig 1 table 1 from the spatial distribution of land use changes from 1980 to 2018 fig s1 three clear patterns of land use change were found involving changes from forests to shrubs and grassland in the higher mountainous areas from shrubs to forests and from paddy fields to urban and rural settlements the xrb has experienced rapid urbanization in recent decades li et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 and the magnitude and frequency of rainstorms increased significantly in 1961 2020 li et al 2022 based on the huangshan and xuancheng statistical yearbooks the intensity of fertilizer consumption in the xrb increased significantly from 80 6 kg ha in 1980 to 276 8 kg ha in 2019 2 2 data

meteorological stations within and near the xrb daily precipitation data were collected from the hydrology yearbook of the people s republic of china hyprc for 40 rainfall stations within the xrb during 1980 1989 and 2000 2019 for the period of 1990 1999 the precipitation from the 0 1 gridded precipitation products developed by yang he 2019 was adopted 2 2 3 pollution data the average annual emission data for point source pollution at each sewage outlet from 1980 to 2019 were provided by the huangshan municipal ecology and environment bureau the annual socioeconomic data for the xrb were obtained for the three districts and five counties from the huangshan and xuancheng statistical yearbooks of 1980 2019 the types of socioeconomic data included rural population crop paddy wheat maize soybean potato oil plants fruit and tea yields fertilizer including n p and compound fertilizer usage and the number of animals including poultry pig cow and sheep and their products including eggs and aquatic products atmospheric wet inorganic n deposition data with a 1 km resolution for four periods 1996 2000 2001 2005 2006 2010 and 2011 2015 were referenced from jia et al 2019 and these

and environment bureau for the tunxi and yuliang stations during 2003 2017 for the jiekou station during 2010 2019 3 methods 3 1 the framework of the gbnp model the gbnp model was developed on the basis of the geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm yang et al 1998 and incorporated the processes of soil erosion sediment transport and pollutants migration and transformation with the hydrological processes the gbnp model couples soil erosion and nutrient dynamics with rainfall runoff processes on hillslopes and couples the sediment dissolved and absorbed pollutant transport with flow routing in the river network pollutants on hillslopes can be exchanged between soil and runoff during the rainfall runoff processes and leached in unsaturated soil profile tang et al 2011 therefore the pollutant movement is simulated in three layers in the vertical direction moving with runoff exchanging between runoff and soil in a mixed layer of water and soil and leaching in the lower soil layers gao et al 2004 in a river segment pollutants are divided into the dissolved nitrate ammonia and dissolved p and the adsorbed organic n and p phases fig 2 for the absorbed nutrients the movement process in a river segment can be described with sediment yu et al 2006 the movement of dissolved pollutants in a river segment is represented by the longitudinal dispersion equation yu et al 2006 chu 1994 the different components of n and p also have corresponding biochemical reactions during the migration processes more details are given by tang et al 2011 and wang et al 2015 in this study the gbnp model uses a 1 km resolution grid system to represent the spatial variability in climate forcing vegetation and soil then each 1 km grid is represented by a number of topographically similar hillslopes which are the basic units of the hydrological simulation the simulation was run at an hourly time step and the results were analysed on daily monthly and annual time scales on a hillslope soil erosion and nutrient i e nitrate ammonia organic n dissolved p and organic p in this study transport and transformation processes are combined with rainfall runoff processes based on the 1 km grid system the study basin is divided into 77 subcatchments linked by the river network in which the sediment transport and dissolved and absorbed pollutants are simulated together with flow routing the long term 1980 2019 spatiotemporal distributions of nps n and p loads on the hillslope and the variations in tn and tp concentrations in the river network were simulated in the study area fig 3 showed the framework for simulation and analysis of the nps n and p loads and their effects on river water quality in the gbnp model 3 2 methods for calculating pollution inputs various types of pollution sources including point and nonpoint sources were comprehensively covered in this study point source pollution mainly consists of urban domestic sewage or industrial emissions after treatment by sewage treatment plants and the latter is strictly controlled and monitored in the xrb du 2022 in this study we assumed that point source pollution occurred uniformly every hour over a given year then in the model point source pollution directly entered the nearest river channel in a subcatchment according to sewage outlet positions in addition to point source pollution nonpoint source pollution is also studied it refers to the pollution that flows into the river network indirectly along the hillslopes in a decentralized form and includes rural domestic sewage crop fertilizer losses solid waste pollution and pollution from livestock and poultry breeding aquaculture and atmospheric deposition since the nps pollution inputs cannot be monitored directly statistical methods were utilized to calculate them according to the following formula johnes 1996 wang et al 2021 the yearly time series of nps pollution data were generated by using the population planting area crop yields number of breeding heads and aquatic product yields multiplied by the corresponding export coefficients the export coefficient values of nps pollution are shown in table 3 1

amounts were input into the model according to appropriate fertilization times and the proportion of base and additional fertilization of different crops table 3 crop fertilizers were applied to the paddy field upland and tea garden areas except for crop fertilization agricultural nps pollution was assumed to be produced uniformly every day over the same year the rural domestic sewage inputs were loaded into areas where rural settlements were located solid waste and manure inputs from livestock and poultry breeding were placed in areas of paddy fields and uplands aquaculture pollution was localized to a pit pond due to a lack of specific occurrence locations the atmospheric deposition pollution inputs were mainly based on the observed data products this study referred to zhu s 2015 research and used the dissolved inorganic n din sum of nh3 n no3 n data from the xrb to project the tn wet deposition in each period the atmospheric wet n deposition was obtained by multiplying the din data by the conversion coefficient jia et al 2019 zhu et al 2015 because a limited amount of observed data was available the monitoring data from 1996 to 2000 was used for the atmospheric n wet deposition data for the 1980s and 1990s we used the average value over the two periods from 2001 to 2005 and from 2006 to 2010 for the 2000s and we used the monitoring data from 2011 to 2015 for the 2010s referring to the methods of chen et al 2022 and geng et al 2021 the atmospheric wet n depositions were equivalently converted into rainfall n concentrations the atmospheric dry n deposition in the xrb was input into the model as the sum of several particle states of the inorganic n dry deposition data jia et al 2016 because observed data were not available for atmospheric dry n deposition for the 1980s 1990s and 2000s we used the monitored data from 2006 to 2010 for these time periods and we used the monitored data from 2010 to 2015 for the 2010s the atmospheric dry n deposition data were imported into the simulation for the overall river basin for each day according to zhu et al 2016 the ratio of wet deposition between n and p in the xrb is approximately 57 1 and atmospheric dry p deposition accounts for approximately 40 75 of the total atmospheric p deposition hou et al 2012 thus 1 57th of the atmospheric wet n deposition was used as the wet atmospheric p deposition and dry atmospheric p deposition was assumed to account for 58 of the total atmospheric p deposition in this study the spatial distributions of the long term average tn and tp inputs based on the above calculation results are shown in fig 4 a b and the temporal variations in the annual and monthly average tn and tp inputs are shown in fig 4 c and fig 4 d respectively 3 3 model calibration and validation methods as sediment and nutrient yields are generated by rainfall runoff processes the calibrations and validations of model parameters were performed in the order of discharge sediment and nutrients tn tp the 2001 2010 monthly discharge and sediment data for the tunxi and yuliang stations were used for calibration and the data from 2011 to 2017 were used to validate the hydrological and sediment simulations the 2003 2010 monthly tn and tp loads of the tunxi and yuliang stations were used for calibration and the data from 2011 to 2017 were used to validate the river water quality model performances were evaluated using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr nash sutcliffe 1970 gupta et al 1999 legates mccabe 1999 the model simulation was determined to be satisfactory if nse 0 5 and rsr 0 7 if pbias within 25 for runoff if pbias within 55 for sediment and if pbias

s i represents the ith simulated data and q s is the mean value of the simulated data 4 results 4 1 model calibration and validation results the model performance for simulating the monthly discharge and sediment and nutrients during the calibration and validation periods is shown in table 4 the results of the monthly runoff simulations at the tunxi and yuliang stations during both periods showed that the nse was within 0 89 0 97 pbias was within 4 44 2 70 and rsr was 0 33 the statistical indicators met the evaluation criteria indicating that the simulated discharge represented the temporal dynamics of the observed values well table 4 fig 5 a1 b1 the statistical indicators for the monthly sediment simulations of the two stations during both the calibration and validation periods met the model evaluation criteria as the nse was within 0 70 0 86 pbias was within 24 24 40 32 and rsr was within 0 37 0 54 table 4 fig 5 a2 b2 shows that the simulations captured the monthly trends and the peak time for sediment loads accurately although the sediment simulations underestimated the peak the performance of the sediment load simulation was acceptable the simulation performances of the tn loads at the yuliang station and the tp loads at the two stations during both the calibration and validation periods and the tn loads at the tunxi station during the calibration period met the evaluation criteria as the nse was within 0 51 0 75 pbias was within 18 55 46 01 and rsr was within 0 50 0 70 table 4 fig 5 b3 a4 b4 the statistical indicators of tn loads at the tunxi station during the validation period slightly deviated from the evaluation standard nse 0 45 pbias 44 57 and rsr 0 74 table 4 fig 5 a3 the tn concentration was measured once a month and the observed value was used as the mean concentration for the same month which might be a reason for the relatively low values of nse and high values of rsr for tn 4 2 temporal variations in the nutrient load table 5 shows the decadal variability in annual precipitation evapotranspiration runoff soil erosion tn and tp input and load during 1980 2019 the 40 year average precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff depth were 1858 mm yr 840 mm yr and 1018 mm yr respectively the average soil erosion was 3 21 105 kg km 2 yr 1 which means that this area was slightly eroded according to the classification and gradation criteria for soil erosion sl190 2007 standard in china the tn and tp inputs which represented the nonpoint nutrient inputs to the watershed were 7970 kg km 2 yr 1 and 777 kg km 2 yr 1 respectively during the simulated period the tn and tp loads representing the nutrient load from hillslopes to the river network were 3219 kg km 2 yr 1 and 293 kg km 2 yr 1 respectively therefore the average proportional coefficients for tn and tp entering the rivers from the watershed were 0 40 and 0 37 respectively the results also demonstrated that the interdecadal variations in soil erosion and tp load were consistent with those of precipitation and runoff depth table 5 the highest value was in the 1990s and the lowest value was in the 2000s in contrast with soil erosion and the tp load the tn load did not decrease noticeably with precipitation in the 2000s it may have been more influenced by the increased tn input fig 6 shows the monthly average runoff depth soil erosion and tn and tp loads and their interannual variations from 1980 to 2019 in the xrb the tn and tp loads were consistent with runoff depth and soil erosion fig 6 a the tn and tp loads during the flood season april july accounted for 65 0 and 63 2 respectively and the runoff depth and soil erosion during that period accounted for 63 9 and 58 3 respectively the annual tn load ranged from 1879 kg km2 to 4824 kg km2 fig 6 b indicating a large interannual variability the temporal variations in the annual tn load showed an insignificant increasing trend 8 7 kg km 2 yr 1 p 0 05 which was also occurred for the annual runoff depth and soil erosion 1 3 mm yr p 0 05 391 1 kg km 2 yr 1 p 0 05 in contrast the annual tn input showed a significant increasing trend 13 7 kg km 2 yr 1 p 0 05 fig 4 d further analysis showed that the interannual variation in the annual tn load was significantly correlated with that of the annual runoff depth soil erosion and tn input r 0 80 p 0 05 r 0 77 p 0 05 r 0 38 p 0 05 fig s2 a1 a3 the annual tp load ranged from 87 kg km2 to 694 kg km2 fig 6 b and showed an insignificant increasing trend 1 1 kg km 2 yr 1 p 0 05 from 1980 to 2019 although the total tp input exhibited a significant increasing trend 13 6 kg km 2 yr 1 p 0 05 fig 4 d the correlation analysis results showed that the interannual variation in the annual tp load was significantly correlated with that of the annual runoff depth and soil erosion r 0 57 p 0 05 r 0 47 p 0 05 but not with the tp input r 0 16 p 0 05 fig s2 b1 b3 the temporal variations in tp load were mainly affected by the rainfall runoff process and had significant build up effect in dry years and wash off effect in wet years the change in tp load was consistent with that of runoff increasing and decreasing at the same time 4 3 spatial distributions of the nutrient load the nps nutrient load was generated along with the rainfall runoff process fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of the long term average water balance components and their changing trends in the xrb from 1980 to 2019 at the 0 05 significance level the precipitation and runoff depth were higher in the southwest than in the northeast fig 7 a1 c1 the evapotranspiration and runoff values were relatively high in the southwest while other regions had opposite characteristics namely high low evapotranspiration and low high runoff occurred simultaneously fig 7 b1 c1 trends in the annual precipitation and runoff were insignificant in most areas and the areas with significant increasing trends in evapotranspiration were larger than those with significant decreasing trends fig 7 a2 b2 c2 the spatial distribution of the long term average soil erosion and tn and tp loads and their changing trends in the xrb from 1980 to 2019 at the 0 05 significance level are shown in fig 8 soil erosion was higher in the mountain area near the boundary of the basin than in the central region fig 8 a1 in contrast the tn load was higher in the central region than in the other regions and the maximum value reached 8025 kg km 2 yr 1 fig 8 b1 compared with fig 1 the spatial distribution of the tn load was consistent with that of land use which was reflected in a higher load in agricultural land and tea gardens and a lower load in other land use types this result indicated that the spatial characteristics of the tn load were mainly affected by agricultural nps pollution a comparison of fig 7 c1 and fig 8 c1 reveals that the tp load and runoff depth had good consistency in spatial patterns they were higher in the west and south the maximum value reached 2236 kg km 2 yr 1 and lower in the east and north which indicates that the main influencing factor for the tp load may have been the rainfall runoff process the contributions of rainfall to the tn or tp load in the watershed were reflected in both of the following atmospheric rainfall processes the direct introduction of pollutants via rainfall and flushing which introduces pollutants indirectly through surface hydrological processes the trends in the tn load ranged from 121 0 kg km 2 yr 1 to 200 4 kg km 2 yr 1 fig 8 b2 similar to the distribution of tn load the spatial pattern was similar to that of land use fig 8 b2 indicating that human activities have been increasing in agricultural areas the areas with increasing trends in the tn load accounted for 60 6 of the watershed but only 14 2 of the areas were significant among these areas with increasing trends 60 5 were paddy fields and 13 1 were forests or shrubs in contrast the decreasing trends in tn load intensities accounted for 39 4 of the watershed and only 1 4 of the areas were significant among these areas with decreasing trends 41 1 were forest or shrub 24 5 were grassland the areas with significant increasing and decreasing trends in the tn load were mainly agricultural lands and urban and rural settlements respectively the trends in the tp load ranged from 17 8 kg km 2 yr 1 to 45 6 kg km 2 yr 1 fig 8 c2 the tp load and soil erosion showed good agreement in the spatial distribution for the changing trends fig 8 a2 c2 the areas with increasing trends in the tp load accounted for 70 6 of the watershed and correspondingly decreasing trends accounted for 29 4 only 2 3 of the area showed significant trends of which 1 0 showed increasing trends and 1 3 showed decreasing trends the areas with significant increasing and decreasing trends in the tp load were also mainly agricultural lands and urban and rural settlements respectively analysing the influencing factors for the nutrient load at the subcatchment scale is helpful for determining the pollution generation mechanisms strokal et al 2016 we considered four major factors terrain hydrology sediment and nutrient source then we chose slope runoff depth soil erosion intensity and nutrient input as potential impact factors to analyse for their correlations with the nutrient load at the subcatchment scale the results fig s3 indicated that the tn load was significantly positively correlated with tn input r 0 64 p 0 05 and runoff depth r 0 30 p 0 05 and negatively associated with slope r 0 32 p 0 05 the subbasin scale characteristics of the tn load were consistent with the grid scale where a high tn load occurred in agricultural lands with high tn inputs and low slopes showing that the distribution of the tn load was mainly affected by tn inputs in contrast the tp load was significantly and positively associated with runoff depth r 0 72 p 0 05 and soil erosion r 0 29 p 0 05 the results at the subbasin scale were consistent with those of the above grid scale showing that the distribution of the tp load was mainly affected by runoff depth 4 4 effect of the nutrient load on river water quality the discharge at the river outlet of jiekou station accounted for approximately 63 of the total inflow to the xin anjiang reservoir li et al 2022 thus the river water quality at jiekou station has a substantial impact on the water quality of the xin anjiang reservoir fig 9 shows the boxplots of the monthly river tn and tp concentrations in different years at jiekou station which ranged from 0 14 mg l to 1 14 mg l and from 0 01 mg l to 0 07 mg l during 1980 2019 respectively the river water quality at jiekou station exceeded the threshold for the high quality standard of drinking water sources in february and march tn 1 0 mg l the river tn concentrations were lower during the flood season than during the nonflood season indicating that concentration dilution due to increased discharge exceeded concentration increases caused by nps pollution during the flood season in contrast the sediment and tp concentrations were higher during the flood season than during the nonflood season indicating that these concentrations were mainly controlled by the rainfall runoff processes of the study area this revealed that the dominant mechanisms of discharge for tn and tp concentrations were different increasing discharge caused greater dilution of the tn concentration and a greater increase in the tp concentration mainly due to increased erosion in addition the monthly average river tn and tp concentrations from 1980 to 2019 at jiekou station in the xrb are plotted in fig s4 the interannual variability in the annual average discharge and sediment tn and tp concentrations based on monthly concentration analysis from 1980 to 2019 at jiekou station in the xrb is shown in fig s5 all these variables showed nonsignificant increasing trends the average annual tn concentration ranged from 0 33 mg l to 0 90 mg l and was highest in 2007 this year had the lowest recorded discharge and the observed tn concentration was influenced by point source pollution the average annual tp concentration was between 0 017 mg l and 0 048 mg l which was highest in 1996 due to high annual precipitation and runoff and rare heavy precipitation events occurred the same year the interdecadal variability of the above variables was plotted fig s6 and it was found that the 2000s had the highest tn concentrations and lowest discharge while the highest sediment and tp concentrations occurred in the 1990s which had the highest discharge to further analyse the spatial characteristics of water quality boxplots of the average annual river tn and tp concentrations in the 77 subcatchments of the xrb from 1980 to 2009 were constructed fig s7 the average annual river tn and tp concentrations ranged from 0 31 mg l to 6 42 mg l and from 0 0003 mg l to 0 36 mg l respectively river water quality varied greatly among different subcatchments and the higher the median water quality concentration was the greater the difference for the year 5 discussions 5 1 impact of hydrological and biogeochemical interaction on river water quality based on previously obtained results river water quality is closely related to the amounts of runoff and sediment for an in depth analysis of the relationship between hydrologic processes and tn and tp concentration changes on a daily scale a typical year 2007 in which the tn concentration reached a peak was selected the daily hydrograph with discharge and tn and tp concentration at jiekou station is shown in fig 10 although the tn concentration appeared at a local peak simultaneous with a flood event the average tn concentration during the flood season was lower than that in the nonflood season due to the effects of flood dilution fig 10 a1 the daily tn concentration had a clockwise hysteresis relationship with the discharge during the flood events fig 10 a2 when a flood occurred the rainfall runoff processes had build up and wash off effects on the tn concentration due to the build up effect of nutrients before rainfall the tn concentration increased significantly in the early period e g 3 14 3 15 4 22 4 23 5 31 6 1 as the rainfall continued the wash off effect was strengthened and the tn concentration decreased rapidly during the late rainfall period e g 3 16 4 24 6 2 a similar clockwise hysteresis relationship between discharge and tn concentration was also found in tuojiang where the tn load intensity was higher than in other sub basins in the upper yangtze river basin wang et al 2020a this also indicated that the tn input in xrb was in a surplus state and the concentration of tn in river channels was mainly controlled by the rainfall runoff process in the study area in contrast the tp concentrations were higher during the flood season and lower during the nonflood season fig 10 b1 unlike tn there was no hysteresis curve between the tp concentration and discharge but there was a single positive correlation in one year r 2 0 97 fig 10 b2 in general the rate of increase of tp concentration gradually slowed with an increasing discharge rate the above results showed that hydrological and biogeochemical interaction directly affected the river n and p concentration and hence the water quality protection strategies should be based on the spatio temporal variability in the hydrology and biogeochemistry 5 2 contribution of different pollution sources to tn load and river water quality compared with previous studies in the same area the tn load intensities in this study was nearly 3 4 times higher than these results wang et al 2012 wang et al 2014 in 2001 2010 further analysis revealed that atmospheric deposition was not or only somewthat considered in these studies and it was confirmed to be a nonnegligible source of nps pollution in this region quantifying the effects of different pollution sources on river water quality is very important to protect water source area a previous study demonstrated that the tn input had significant influences on both the spatial and temporal distributions of the tn load in the study area meanwhile the observed data indicated that the tn concentrations in winter and spring were 1 0 mg l thus the data from 2000 to 2009 were used to further quantify the contributions of different types of tn inputs a numerical analysis was carried out on the basis of three case studies fig 11 a case 1 c1 only land surface nutrient inputs including rural domestic sewage crop fertilizer losses solid waste pollution and pollution from livestock and poultry breeding and aquaculture b case 2 c2 only atmospheric deposition inputs and c case 3 c3 both land surface nutrient input and atmospheric deposition for case 1 the average tn load of the watershed was 1266 kg km 2 yr 1 meanwhile the average number of days that the river tn concentration was 1 0 mg l at jiekou station was 5 days yr the spatial distribution of the tn load was similar to that of land use type fig 11 a1 fig 1 showing that the load was greater in agricultural lands and lower in other areas for case 2 the average intensity of the tn load was 2250 kg km 2 yr 1 and it increased to 3122 kg km2 in case 3 both the average value and the spatial distribution of the tn load had additive effects fig 11 a1 a3 the number of days with river water tn concentrations 1 0 mg l at jiekou station increased to 15 days yr in case 3 the tn load due to atmospheric deposition accounted for 65 71 of the tn load entering the river in the xrb in other words 65 71 of the tn exported from the watershed was derived from atmospheric n deposition this might be the reason the tn concentrations in the rivers were not significantly reduced when land surface nutrient inputs were reduced in recent years some studies conducted in other river basins in china have reached similar conclusions zhang 2011 revealed that tn loads caused by wet and dry deposition accounted for nearly half of the tn loads in the changle river basin a typical watershed in a relatively developed southeast coastal area in china ma et al 2011 found that the tn inputs from atmospheric deposition in the three gorges area of hubei province accounted for 52 7 of the tn load in the river from 1995 to 2007 chen et al 2022 reported unexpected n flow and water quality changes due to varying atmospheric deposition in the three gorges reservoir region of china however the contribution of atmospheric deposition to the tn load and river water quality in the study by chen et al 2022 13 was lower than that reported in this research the xrb of this study had relatively less human activity and lower input intensities of land surface pollution at the same time the xrb is surrounded by many large cities such as shanghai hangzhou and nanjing which produce considerable amounts of air pollution thereby increasing the contribution from atmospheric deposition 6 uncertainty and limitations uncertainty might come from the model inputs especially the nps pollutants inputs model parameters and model structure this study revealed the important impact of atmospheric deposition on river water quality in the xrb however there might be uncertainty because the atmospheric deposition observations were very sparse other nps pollutants were estimated from the local governments statistical annual report this might also bring a degree of uncertainty due the low spatial resolution of the statistical data through the numerical analysis we found that the tn load introduced by the soil was 5 which implied less nitrogen from the soil background in the study area however the initial soil chemical parameters obtained from the soil data set might also introduce some uncertainties due to the lack of detail soil sampling in the study area in addition we analysed the sensitivity of the key parameters for simulating tn and tp into the river and found that the sensitive parameters for tn were the slope shape factor rate of ammonia release in sediment attenuation coefficient of nitrate nitrogen in the river channel exchange rate between soil water and runoff and mixed layer thickness for tp the sensitive parameters were the slope shape factor sediment settling rate and attenuation coefficient of dissolved phosphorus in addition the model may have uncertainty because it did not simulate the strong biogeochemistry interaction between the atmosphere and the land surface abdolghafoorian dirmeyer 2021 the fertilization of farmland and returning of manure can produce ammonia volatilization and the air pollution around cities can also be transported in the horizontal direction which should be directly simulated in the nps pollution models this is a limitation of the current process based nps pollution model and should be an important topic in future studies 7 conclusions this study analysed the spatiotemporal variations in nutrient loads and their effects on river water quality in the period 1980 2019 in the xrb using a distributed process based nps pollution model according to the results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the average loads of tn and tp in the study basin during 1980 2019 were 3219 kg km 2 yr 1 and 293 kg km 2 yr 1 respectively the proportional coefficients of tn and tp entering the rivers from the watershed were 0 40 and 0 37 respectively the tn and tp loads during the flood season from april to july accounted for 65 0 and 63 2 of the annual total respectively and runoff during the flood season accounted for 63 9 of the annual total the interannual variation in the annual tn load was significantly correlated with that of the annual runoff depth soil erosion and tn input while the tp load variation was significantly correlated with the annual runoff depth and soil erosion 2 the spatial distribution of the average annual tn load was consistent with that of land use which was higher in the agricultural lands and tea gardens than in the other land use types in contrast the spatial distribution of the average annual tp load had a pattern similar to that of the annual runoff depth the area percentages with significant increasing and decreasing trends in the tn load were 14 2 and 1 4 while those for the tp load were 1 0 and 1 3 respectively the areas with significant increasing trends in tn and tp load mainly consisted of agricultural lands while those with significant decreasing trends mainly consisted of urban and rural settlements 3 the monthly tn and tp concentrations of the river water at jiekou station during 1980 2019 ranged from 0 14 mg l 1 14 mg l and 0 01 mg l 0 07 mg l respectively the monthly average tn concentration was lower during the flood season than during the nonflood season the concentrations of sediment and tp were high during the flood season and low during the nonflood season 4 atmospheric n deposition contributed approximately 65 71 of the tn load in the xrb without atmospheric deposition the average tn load decreased from 3122 kg km 2 yr 1 to 1266 kg km 2 yr 1 during 2000 2009 and the days with river water tn concentration 1 0 mg l decreased from 15 days per year to 5 days per year the results showed that the main water pollution source in the studied basin was air pollution from a wider range which suggests that water quality protection involves both local eco environment protection and the air pollution control over a broader region the study demonstrated that spatially distributed modelling of coupled hydrological and biogeochemical processes is crucial to reveal the spatiotemporal variability in the nps pollutants and offer useful information for protecting the

1856,increasing occurrence of large and severe wildfires represents a growing threat to forested watersheds and the many ecosystem services they provide past research has shown that wildfires can cause substantial increases in peak flows and annual water yields leading to potential water quality concerns and land and water management challenges however responses have been variable and there have been few studies at large basin scales leading to uncertainties about post fire hydrologic responses to address these uncertainties we projected the effect of three large wildfires 70 000 ha on streamflow in two important forested watersheds in the cascade range of oregon us we modeled the streamflow response using the soil and water assessment tool swat model calibrated on data from prior to the wildfires we modified model parameters to represent the impacts of the wildfires based on burn severity maps burned and unburned scenarios were compared using random forest models to identify drivers of increased annual water yields and peak flows post fire annual water yield changes were controlled by burn severity annual precipitation area burned aridity and vegetation type while post fire peak flow changes were controlled by burn severity area burned aridity soil type and geologic province we also found that post fire increases in annual water yields peak flows and low flows were greatest at the headwater scale but were more muted at the downstream basin scale our work provides valuable insights into the range of potential post fire streamflow changes at the headwater and larger basin scale which is becoming increasingly critical for effective forest and water management decisions keywords wildfire oregon source water hydrologic model streamflow data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction forested basins are critical sources of drinking water providing water supplies to almost one third of the world s largest cities and two thirds of cities in the united states us committee on hydrologic impacts of forest management 2008 dudley and stolton 2003 healthy forests are naturally effective at filtering and storing water which are services that save an estimated 25 9 billion dollars worldwide every year costanza et al 1997 however healthy source water supplies are increasingly at risk due to growing pressures from urbanization paul and meyer 2001 walsh et al 2005 deforestation warziniack et al 2017 climate change delpla et al 2009 murdoch et al 2000 extreme weather events khan et al 2015 forest pathogens bladon et al 2019 pest outbreaks kurz et al 2008 mikkelson et al 2013 and wildfire bladon et al 2014 hohner et al 2019 as a result water crises or significant issues with streamflow and water quantity have been identified as representing one of the greatest global risks that could negatively impact society martin 2016 world economic forum 2015 therefore it is critical to improve our understanding of the variability and drivers of source water changes from these growing pressures in particular there is increasing concern about the effects of wildfire on surface source water supplies bladon 2018 hallema et al 2018 martin 2016 robinne et al 2021 due to recent and dramatic increases in the timing extent and severity of wildfire activity in many regions of the world flannigan et al 2009 moritz et al 2012 reilly et al 2017 historical evidence and modeling efforts suggest that we will continue to observe years with elevated fire danger contributing to longer fire seasons and increased burned area abatzoglou et al 2021 flannigan et al 2013 murphy et al 2018 in part the increase in area burned is attributable to warmer temperatures earlier spring snowmelts increased fuel aridity and greater fuel accumulation abatzoglou et al 2018 marlon et al 2012 westerling 2016 indeed in recent years many areas around the globe have experienced some of their most destructive wildfire seasons in recorded history for example in 2020 2 9 million ha burned in california washington and oregon alone 29 of the total area burned in the us that year across the entire us the area burned in 2020 was 2 1 times greater than the long term average congressional research service 2021 geographic area coordination center 2020 national interagency fire center n d similarly the 2019 2020 wildfire season in australia burned almost 19 million ha consuming 21 of the temperate forest biome in that region primarily in new south wales and victoria boer et al 2020 filkov et al 2020 in 2017 and 2018 wildfires in british columbia canada burned 3 3 to 3 7 times more area than the 10 year average 2009 2019 bc wildfire service n d in europe many countries including spain italy portugal sweden and the uk have all experienced notable wildfire seasons in recent years henley and jones 2019 san miguel ayanz et al 2020 recent empirical studies have illustrated that wildfires can cause large and long lasting effects on a wide range of hydrological processes niemeyer et al 2020 poon and kinoshita 2018 rhoades et al 2019 for example wildfires can impact soil hydraulic properties reducing infiltration rates and changing water partitioning between surface and subsurface flow ebel and moody 2017 moody et al 2016 moody and ebel 2014 additionally the presence of ash water repellent layers in the soil surface sealing and reduced ground cover can contribute to increased occurrence of surface runoff balfour et al 2014 bodí et al 2012 certini 2005 larsen et al 2009 lavee et al 1995 combined with reduced interception losses and higher net precipitation kusaka et al 1983 ma et al 2020 stoof et al 2012 williams et al 2019 these effects often lead to increased annual water yields and peak flows and changes to the timing of water availability with effects potentially lasting for multiple decades coombs and melack 2013 hallema et al 2017a niemeyer et al 2020 wagenbrenner et al 2021 post fire changes to annual water yields across a number of regions and basin sizes have been observed to range from no change up to a 450 increase bart 2016 bart and hope 2010 campbell et al 1977 1977 hallema

flows have been found to increase between 20 and 290 in alberta can washington us and south africa mahat et al 2016 niemeyer et al 2020 scott 1997 while low flow increases of 40 to 1090 have been measured in california and washington us and alberta can kinoshita and hogue 2015 mahat et al 2016 niemeyer et al 2020 shifts in the streamflow regime can have substantial impacts on aquatic ecosystems and downstream water supply for example elevated low flows which are critical for aquatic ecosystem habitat could help maintain cool stream temperatures and expand fish and other species habitats during the critical summer months bradford and heinonen 2008 mayer 2012 similarly increased low flows could potentially provide additional water supplies to downstream communities during the summer period which is often the period of highest water demand alternatively post fire increases in peak flow can lead to increased flooding and debris flow events moody and ebel 2012 neary et al 2003 wall et al 2020 increased water quality concerns like sediment nutrients and metals bladon et al 2008 emelko et al 2016 smith et al 2011 and greater and more costly challenges for drinking water treatment emelko et al 2011 hohner et al 2019 however there remains a lot of uncertainty about the post fire hydrologic and water quality effects due to the substantial variability in responses as a result of site specific controlling factors for example previous studies have identified burn severity rhoades et al 2011 rust et al 2019 percent area burned rhoades et al 2011 post fire precipitation mast et al 2016 murphy et al 2015 slope moody et al 2013 shakesby 2011 aspect ebel 2013 and aridity rust et al 2019 sheridan et al 2015 van der sant et al 2018 as potential controls on the streamflow or water quality response however little work has been done comparing the importance of these different factors to identify principal drivers especially across scales from headwaters to downstream basin outlets this type of information will facilitate improved policy and land management decisions to mitigate effects on source water supplies both before and after wildfires moody et al 2013 while previous studies have found increases in streamflow after wildfire we have a poor understanding of the range of effects particularly in larger basins emmerton et al 2020 hallema et al 2017a shakesby 2011 wu et al 2021 this is partially due to the random nature of wildfires which makes tightly controlled experiments challenging thus models provide an opportunity to make projections of the magnitude of effects and assess various post fire scenarios one of the major advantages of a modeling approach is its ability to simplify complex systems mirchi et al 2010 this provides a cost and time effective way to generate high frequency continuous data borah and bera 2004 lund and palmer 1997 models also allow for standardized comparisons of future conditions and alternative scenarios borah and bera 2004 lund and palmer 1997 critics may argue that simplification renders model outputs of little value due to model assumptions and uncertainty and indeed some models should not be used to provide quantitative results however the reduced complexity makes models extremely useful for hypothesis development and testing where those hypotheses can be field tested in complex systems grayson et al 1992 additionally for wildfire specific studies the ability of a model to provide unburned and burned outputs for the same spatial and climatic conditions overcomes one of the major challenges in wildfire research ebel and mirus 2014 several hydrologic models have previously been modified to investigate post wildfire hydrologic responses ebel et al 2023 including wepp dobre et al 2022 the mcguire rengers model mcguire et al 2017 rengers et al 2016 and the soil and water assessment tool swat havel et al 2018 loiselle et al 2020 however many models like wepp the mcguire rengers model or rhessys are constrained to hillslope to small basin scales and are rarely used to model wildfire effects at scales larger than 5 km2 ebel et al 2023 comparatively the swat model is a time continuous semi distributed process based model that enables projections of streamflow at a river basin scale neitsch et al 2011 post wildfire hydrologic modeling with swat has been completed for catchments in the western us canada spain portugal and brazil basso et al 2020 loiselle et al 2020 morán tejeda et al 2015 rodrigues et al 2019 these modeling efforts have projected increases in streamflow of 8 to 500 at the subbasin scale 5 270 km2 basso et al 2020 havel et al 2018 loiselle et al 2020 and 2 4 at the larger watershed scale 1500 km2 morán tejeda et al 2015 additionally models have illustrated relationships between streamflow responses and both area burned havel et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2019 and burn severity loiselle et al 2020 which is consistent with empirical studies the objective of our study was to provide additional insights into the potential effects of large scale wildfire on streamflow in two basins in the pacific northwest by using a modeling approach specifically we sought to answer the following questions for key source water catchments on the west slopes of the cascade range in oregon us a how does wildfire affect peak flows and annual water yields at the subbasin and basin scale b how does watershed scale affect the magnitude of post fire streamflow changes c what are the principal drivers of differences in post fire streamflow responses at the sub catchment scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area our study area included two large basins on the west slopes of the cascade range in oregon usa fig 1 specifically we modeled the north santiam river basin 44 47 n 122 45 w which supplies drinking water to 200 000 residents in the salem or area we also modeled the mckenzie river basin 44 40 n 122 57 w which provides drinking water to 200 000 residents in the eugene or area both basins have steep forested uplands where the headwaters to the north santiam and mckenzie rivers originate generally both rivers flow west to agricultural land with little relief both basins are within a mediterranean climate with cool wet winters and dry warm summers kottek et al 2006 snyder et al 2002 the basins receive an average of 2 114 mm of precipitation annually although due to orographic effects it ranges from approximately 1 000 mm to 3 000 mm prism climate group 2012 the basins are rain dominated below 400 m mixed rain and snow between 400 and 1 200 m and snow dominated above 1 200 m the average annual water yield in the mckenzie at the hayden bridge treatment plant is 1 447 mm 2007 2019 usgs site 14164900 average annual water yields in the north santiam near the outlet are 1 830 mm 1960 2019 usgs site 14183000 annual 30 year normal air temperatures range from minimums of 4 0 5 9 c in the winter to maximums of 6 9 17 3 c in the summer prism climate group 2012 approximately 80 of both basins are forested land comprised mainly of douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii western hemlock tsuga heterophylla and pacific silver fir abies amabilis while our two study basins have many similarities they also have slight differences in land use geology topography and area table 1 additionally due to a large proportion of high cascade geology the mckenzie river basin has many influential springs which may contribute as much as 80 of the discharge during the summer low flow period jefferson 2006 wildfires in both basins have been relatively infrequent with a total area burned from 1984 to 2019 of 14 746 ha in the north santiam and 31 534 ha in the mckenzie however in august to october 2020 wildfires in the two basins burned a combined area of 146 580 ha which was 3 2 times greater than the total area burned from 1984 to 2019 specifically the beachie creek and lionshead wildfires burned 51 of the north santiam river basin with 67 of the beachie creek fire and 45 of the lionshead fire burned at moderate to high severity table 2 comparatively the holiday farm fire burned 18 of the mckenzie river basin at slightly higher severity with 77 of the area burning at moderate to high severity as such we sought to model the 2020 oregon wildfires to provide insights into the potential range of streamflow responses and to identify dominant drivers of variability in post fire streamflow 2 2 model description to model the streamflow response to wildfire we used the soil and water assessment tool swat 2012 rev 664 we chose the swat model because of its ability to simulate hillslope runoff processes streamflow and in stream cycling of water quality parameters swat is a physically based basin scale hydrologic model developed by the us department of agriculture basins are divided into sub basins based on topographic maps and further divided into hydrologic response units hrus based on land use soil and slope climate data is input into the model which is used to calculate the water balance in each hru routing water nutrients and sediment through the basin gassman et al 2007 swat was originally developed to model hydrology and crop growth in agricultural settings and has been modified to incorporate forested environments however the model does not have a built in wildfire module thus to simulate wildfire we modified individual parameters in the model source code see section 2 4 to represent expected changes to the landscape and hydrology we constructed the models using the arcswat 2012 10 5 21 interface with a digital elevation model 30 m resolution u s geological survey 2000 statsgo2 soils data 30 m resolution natural resources conservation service 2006 and the 2016 national land cover database 30 m resolution yang et al 2018 we also used a 1 24 degree resolution downscaled global climate model for minimum and maximum daily air temperatures average daily solar radiation average daily wind speed and average daily relative humidity from 1950 through 2019 abatzoglou and brown 2012 the best climate model for each variable was chosen by comparing the modeled climate variables to data from nearby meteorological stations table 3 due to the importance of precipitation in modeling streamflow and the difficulty of modeling it at a daily scale we used observed precipitation data from 1960 to 2019 from various publicly available sources daly et al 2020 national climatic data center n d natural resources conservation service oregon n d the university of utah n d we used data from 13 precipitation stations in the north santiam basin and 21 precipitation stations in the mckenzie basin fig 1 precipitation was gap filled using the hyfo package xu 2020 in r in building the models the basin outlet was set at the drinking water intakes for the cities of salem north santiam and eugene mckenzie the detroit reservoir in the north santiam basin and the blue river and cougar reservoirs in the mckenzie basin were added into the model this included setting up the reservoirs using the basin area and volume of both the emergency and principal spillways we also input daily reservoir outflow data to the model to describe the daily outflow from each of the reservoirs u s army corps of engineers n d model setup resulted in 125 subbasins defined by swat as a first level subdivision of watersheds based on surface topography in the north santiam and 110 subbasins in the mckenzie basin the subbasins were then further divided into hrus where each hru had a single slope class soil type and land use as a compromise between data resolution and computational loads we specified 15 threshold values for slope soil and land use where areas below those thresholds were dissolved into the existing slope classes soil types and land uses her et al 2015 any areas within each basin that were classified as water i e swat model land use class watr were retained as water in the model this resulted in 1 112 hrus for the north santiam and 973 hrus for the mckenzie basin lastly to account for inputs to streamflow from springs in the mckenzie we included seven point sources for spring water discharge to subbasins using an average annual discharge of 0 85 m3 s 1 which was based on estimates by jefferson et al 2006 2 3 model calibration for model calibration we used the swat cup program version 5 1 1 with the sufi 2 method calibration was performed using a parallel processing program allowing the simulations to run simultaneously on multiple cores shortening the calibration process du et al 2020 we used a warm up period of four years and ran the model at a daily time step both models were calibrated for discharge from 2000 to 2019 using seven monitoring points in the north santiam and 13 monitoring points in the mckenzie validation was performed from 1990 to 1999 using six monitoring points in the north santiam and nine monitoring points in the mckenzie both models were calibrated for streamflow and sediment while we only present streamflow results here calibrating for both streamflow and sediment increases confidence that the underlying physical processes are being correctly represented in the model a regionalization approach was taken to calibrate the models where calibration was performed for each subbasin with a monitoring point and its upstream basins we first calibrated the upstream monitoring points working downstream to the basin outlet we evaluated model performance using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and adjusted r 2 coefficients br 2 best parameters were determined by performing 500 simulations at a time manually narrowing parameter ranges based on the best parameter values from the previous model run observed discharge data used to calibrate the model was aggregated from several sources the waterdata package ryberg and vecchia 2017 in r r core team 2020 was used to obtain discharge data from usgs gauging sites we also used stream discharge data from the hj andrews experimental forest johnson et al 2020 and data on spring contributions to streamflow from jefferson et al 2006 to calibrate the model 2 4 wildfire simulations we modeled both the beachie creek and lionshead wildfires in the north santiam basin and the holiday farm wildfire in the mckenzie basin we set the start date of the wildfires in the model to 7 september 2020 which was the actual start date for the holiday farm fire and the date that the beachie creek and lionshead fires rapidly expanded in size a wildfire module was developed where during a model run at the wildfire date multiple parameters in the model were modified to represent the effects of wildfire on the landscape to select the range of parameters to represent the effects of wildfire we developed a conceptual model of expected effects based on literature values and expert opinion fig 2 to model the mixed severity burn patterns of the 2020 wildfires we specified parameter changes for low moderate and high severity conditions wildfire severity was determined from severity maps created by u s forest service burn area emergency response baer teams and used to assign burn severities to hrus in the burned area specifically we used the arcmap zonal statistics as table tool to calculate the mean burn severity for each hru where burn severities were represented by increasing integer values in our model we ensured the percent area burned at each severity class matched the percent area burned at each severity class of the actual fire as closely as possible to do that we chose threshold values of the hru averaged burn severity to classify hru s with burn severities of low moderate and high we used a broad definition of burn severity to refer to the effects of fire on the consumption of large fuels shrubs litter organic matter and buried plant parts monitoring trends in burn severity n d water hrus were not burned in the simulation we ran the calibrated models for one year following the fires from 7 september 2020 to 6 september 2021 we chose to only simulate one year at a time due to annual model memory effects and because the model does not represent wildfire recovery as such running the model continuously in the post fire period would not accurately represent continuous years of post fire conditions we repeated the model run 56 times for the mckenzie and 60 times for the north santiam using different precipitation scenarios repeating the model run multiple times for the first post fire year allowed us to hypothetically examine the effect of different annual precipitation in the initial post fire period precipitation for each single year simulation was generated from the range of historical precipitation for each basin during each simulation a year of the precipitation data was selected from the historic record matching the day of year 7 september 2020 to 6 september 2021 and used as the precipitation input for the post fire year for each simulation we used the reservoir data from the same year as the precipitation data to account for differing annual reservoir management other climate variables including minimum and maximum temperature wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity used the predicted values from the macav2 gridded climate model rcp 8 5 table 3 from 7 september 2020 to 6 september 2021 the historic precipitation data included years 1960 2019 from the north santiam and 1964 to 2019 for the mckenzie we developed a module in swat to enable us to simulate the effects of wildfire by changing various model parameters such as saturated hydraulic conductivity available water capacity bulk density soil and plant uptake evaporation compensation factors used to adjust the depth distribution of soil and plant evaporative demand curve number manning s n for overland flow and land use type details on how each of these factors was modified to represent wildfire in the model are provided below and are summarized in table 4 2 4 1 saturated hydraulic conductivity saturated hydraulic conductivity is used in the model to determine the rate of vertical water percolation through soil layers it is not directly used to calculate runoff volumes we modified soil saturated hydraulic conductivity in the upper soil layer based on the relationship developed by moody et al 2016 equation 1 1 k f s 2360 e 0 0056 d n b r where k f s is field saturated hydraulic conductivity and dnbr is differenced normalized burn ratio a satellite derived metric that is commonly used to capture wildfire caused differences in leaf area plant productivity and moisture for dnbr values less than 400 the saturated hydraulic conductivity remained unchanged for calculating changes in saturated hydraulic conductivity using equation 1 we selected dnbr values of 400 for low burn severity 550 for moderate burn severity and 800 for high burn severity based values proposed by lutes et al 2006 since our starting unburned saturated hydraulic conductivity values were different than those in moody et al 147 mm h 1 2016 we quantified the absolute change between their starting values and the values predicted by the dnbr thresholds we then converted those values to a relative change which was broadly applicable across saturated hydraulic conductivities this resulted in modifications of hydraulic conductivity of 0 for low severity 26 for moderate severity and 82 for high burn severity for the fire module 2 4 2 available water capacity during calibration we increased the available water capacity a model parameter to account for the water available to plants for transpiration in the soils to account for the high resistance to xylem dysfunction and ability to transpire at low soil water potential by douglas fir the dominant tree species in our study basins brooks et al 2006 domec et al 2008 2004 fan et al 2017 however for the wildfire scenario we decreased the available water capacity to account for post fire changes in vegetation i e mortality of douglas fir trees due to wildfire to help meet the expected decrease in catchment level transpiration which has been observed to decline by up to 55 following high severity wildfire ma et al 2020 roche et al 2018 available water capacity was reduced 90 for high severity 70 for moderate severity and 25 for low severity available water capacity changes were determined by testing scenarios where the entire basin burned and choosing changes that would result in et drops matching existing literature values ma et al 2020 roche et al 2018 admittedly adjusting available water capacity is not an ideal way to account for decreased transpiration post fire as it can impact the amount of water held within the soil leaf area index and rooting depth also control plant transpiration within the model however we found these parameters insensitive which is likely due to swat s origins as an agricultural model as such forests are typically not well represented haas et al 2022 2 4 3 soil bulk density we increased the bulk density of the upper soil layer by 13 for high severity 9 for moderate severity and 1 for low severity fire we determined these estimates of post fire changes in bulk density from literature values associated with laboratory burning experiments badía and martí 2003 stoof et al 2010 and empirical studies ebel and moody 2020 xue et al 2014 in general the heat generated during wildfires can affect soil texture badía and martí 2003 ulery and graham 1993 organic matter content alauzis et al 2004 garcía corona et al 2004 and overall soil structure ebel and moody 2020 which modify the overall bulk density 2 4 4 soil and plant uptake evaporation compensation factors the soil evaporation compensation factor esco is a coefficient in the model that allows the user to modify the depth distribution of soil evaporation the coefficient ranges from 0 01 to 1 0 as esco decreases more water can be taken from deeper soil levels similarly the plant uptake compensation factor epco is a coefficient that allows the user to modify the depth of water in the soil that vegetation can access for transpiration epco also ranges from 0 01 to 1 0 however in this case larger values equate to water demand able to be met by deeper soil levels in our wildfire scenarios we increased the esco and decreased the epco which limited the depth of soil water use after fire occurrence specifically for high severity we set esco to 1 and epco to 0 01 for moderate severity we set esco to 0 8 and epco to 0 2 and for low severity we set esco and epco to 0 5 these modifications were made based on the loss of overstory vegetation and transpiration due to wildfire as well as the increased bulk density ebel and moody 2020 xue et al 2014 surface sealing larsen et al 2009 water repellent layers nyman et al 2010 robichaud 2000 and a loss of porosity xue et al 2014 which can all contribute to more surficial evaporative processes 2 4 5 curve number the curve number is a widely used parameter for projecting the approximate proportion of precipitation that ends up as direct runoff we increased the curve number relative to the initial values associated with the soils by 10 units for low severity 20 units for moderate severity and 30 units for high severity burns if these increases resulted in a curve number greater than 98 we adjusted the values back to a maximum of 98 which was representative of impervious surfaces we determined these shifts in curve number values based on knowledge that changes in soil physical properties due to wildfire can lead to elevated infiltration excess overland flow malvar et al 2011 onda et al 2008 and was consistent with previously proposed adjustments usda 2013 usda forest service n d 2 4 6 manning s n for overland flow we also changed the manning s n values a hydraulic roughness coefficient to account for the differential effects of wildfire severity on soil surface roughness and resistance to overland flow in general greater wildfire severity results in greater ground cover consumption and loss of surface roughness components keeley 2009 parson et al 2010 thus we related the expected remaining ground cover associated with different burn severities to similar manning s n ground cover values specifically we set manning s n to 0 80 for low severity 0 40 for moderate severity and 0 011 for high severity fires which was also consistent with previous studies usda soil conservation service 1986 2 4 7 land use given that wildfires can dramatically change forest structure and composition halofsky et al 2020 meng et al 2015 we used the land use function in the model to represent the expected shifts in forest ecosystems associated with different fire severities we made this decision because there was no option in the model to modify forest density but required a way to model the post fire effects on the loss of evapotranspiration similar land use changes have been used previously within swat to account for post fire decreases in transpiration loiselle et al 2020 as such we updated the land use focusing principally on the loss of woody biomass from trees specifically for low severity burns we did not change the original land use and as such forested areas were still considered to be forested as evergreen or conifer forests frse for moderate severity burns we changed the land use to grasses rnge while for high severity burns we updated the land use to barren barr these changes were necessary to produce a reasonably realistic reflection of the transpiration loss associated with wildfire which is often the dominant hydrological process that is impacted leading to additional water availability for runoff generation and streamflow ma et al 2020 niemeyer et al 2020 2 5 sensitivity analysis to determine the most sensitive parameters in our wildfire model we ran a sensitivity analysis for both the north santiam and mckenzie models for each model we ran three wildfire scenarios a low moderate and high where the entire basin was burned at that severity sensitivity was tested by varying the parameters used in the wildfire module one at a time running 100 simulations for each parameter with values ranging from the low to high severity wildfire module values to test land use change we replaced the existing land cover with the other generic land cover types one at a time excluding water which was a total of 18 simulations for each scenario initial conditions were set to the burned wildfire module values for that severity and a median precipitation scenario was used sensitivity was determined for both annual water yields and peak flows by first calculating the average change from the base unburned scenario across all subbasins in the model then to get a measure of sensitivity we calculated the standard deviation of the average change across both models 2 6 statistical analysis unfortunately model predictions of streamflow often remain inaccurate with substantial uncertainty due to limited calibration data unresolved model parameter values and poor representation of physical processes faramarzi et al 2015 zaremehrjardy et al 2021 however in our study we were not concerned about producing accurate predictions of the streamflow response to wildfire rather we were interested in quantifying and estimating the relative change in streamflow from the unburned to burned scenarios which enabled us to not be constrained by model uncertainty model calibration ensured that the physical processes were reasonably represented our model fits provided evidence that the model was indeed representing the physical processes adequately despite the adequate representations of physical processes in the model differences in model parameterization can produce variability in relative streamflow changes boisrame et al 2019 annual summaries of water yield and peak streamflow were determined for both the basin outlets and the headwater subbasins where the headwater subbasins did not have upstream subbasins peak streamflow was determined as the maximum daily flow in each precipitation scenario year linear mixed effects lme models were created for annual water yields and peak streamflow using the nlme package in r pinheiro et al 2020 this analysis was used to find the differences between burn and unburned scenarios and test if there was statistical evidence for an effect of wildfire the basin and wildfire scenario were the fixed effects in the model with precipitation scenario basin as nested random effects variance of errors were allowed to vary by basin subbasins that were not burned were removed before analysis additionally to simplify the headwater models we used the mean percent change of all the headwater subbasins in each model for each precipitation scenario the lme model for peak streamflow changes at the headwater scale was log10 transformed to normalize the residuals we used the r package emmeans to extract the mean and 95 confidence intervals from the lme model and ran tukey multiple comparison tests to check for significant difference in the mean values between groups lenth 2021 to visualize the effect of the wildfire scenario across all flow magnitudes flow duration curves were created for both the burned and unburned scenarios for individual subbasins the streamflow data was sorted and ranked by descending magnitude including all the precipitation scenarios similarly flood recurrence intervals for both burned and unburned scenarios were calculated by ranking the streamflow across all precipitation scenarios in descending order of magnitude we then calculated return periods and probabilities using the weibull plotting position method helsel et al 2020 we also performed random forest analyses to identify variables of importance i e burn severity land use aspect geology table a2 in driving post fire streamflow changes we performed two separate analyses one for annual water yield and one for peak streamflow changes we combined the data for both basins for each analysis the explanatory variables came from gis data layers which were aggregated to a subbasin level using the arcmap zonal statistics as table tool to calculate the mean for continuous data or mode for categorical data then we linked the streamflow data to the aggregated landscape and climate variables associated with each subbasin table a2 to numerically compare the burn severity across subbasins for the random forest analysis a metric of relative burn severity was developed by averaging the wildfire pixels in the area of each subbasin where 0 was unburned 1 was low severity 2 was moderate severity and 3 was high severity thus the metric ranged from 0 to 3 with increasing values representing higher severities the random forest analysis was performed using the cforest function in the party package in r hothorn et al 2006 strobl et al 2008 2007 for both percent change in annual streamflow and percent change in maximum annual peak flow variable importance was determined using the permutation method to find the mean decrease in accuracy of the random forest model on the out of box data using the varimp function analysis used 2000 trees mtry was set to 9 and the model did not use replacement when sampling the observations as recommended by strobel et al 2007 for accurate variable importance measures the subbasins upstream of the fire were removed for analysis due to the limited number of data points the entire dataset was used for training model fit was determined using the out of box data to calculate a pseudo r 2 value by using the predict function from the party package to calculate the sum of squares residuals to investigate directionality of the driver variables partial dependence plots were found for the five most important variables in each model using the pdp package in r greenwell 2017 to minimize computational time 15 equally spaced points were used for continuous variable plots a second set of random forest models were created to look at mean burn severity in each subbasin based on the real burn severity wildfire maps these models used the same procedure to the other models except in the burn severity random forest all the subbasins were retained in the analysis 3 results 3 1 calibration the daily streamflow calibration for the north santiam model had a mean nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse of 0 48 0 19 this was slightly better than the streamflow calibration for the mckenzie basin which had a mean coefficient value of 0 40 0 47 fig 3 in the validation period the north santiam had a mean nse of 0 35 0 32 while the mckenzie had a mean coefficient value of 0 56 0 19 fig 3 although previous recommendations for modeling daily streamflow data have indicated a nse above 0 50 as satisfactory and above 0 70 as good moriasi et al 2015 these recommendations are principally for small headwater catchment scale studies such studies typically only include a single basin at the outlet however our models included 6 to 13 calibration points in each basin making it challenging to achieve an overall nse value above 0 7 given the complexity of our study basins we found these model fits satisfactory see table a1 for more detailed calibration results 3 2 validation of wildfire module we validated our model outputs for the wildfire simulations by comparing predicted streamflow values with a year of observed streamflow from usgs gauges following the wildfires using the most severely burned sub catchment in each basin which had measured streamflow data available we validated the outputs in the north santiam basin with data from subbasin 23 which had a burn severity of 1 86 out of 3 a moderate to high burn severity sub catchment the observed annual water yield for the first year post fire was 2 085 mm comparatively the average predicted annual water yields were 1 449 448 mm for the unburned scenarios and 1 644 462 mm for the burned scenarios while the model underestimated the actual annual water yield the annual water yields 1960 2019 in the burned scenario were more similar to the observed data than the unburned scenario fig 4 the average observed low flows june through august were 0 77 0 54 mm d 1 while average low flows were 0 46 0 30 mm d 1 for the unburned scenarios and 0 79 0 48 mm d 1 for the burned scenarios the observed peak flow for the first year post fire 103 2 mm d 1 exceeded both model predictions the mean predicted peak flow was 34 6 15 8 mm d 1 for the unburned scenarios and 50 4 20 2 mm d 1 for the burned scenarios comparatively in the mckenzie subbasin 65 had a relative burn severity of 0 35 out of 3 so it was less fire affected overall this was reflected in the smaller differences between the unburned and burned scenarios fig 4 the observed annual water yield in the first post fire year was 1 279 mm this was slightly lower than our modeled annual water yield 1964 2019 of 1 313 246 mm in the unburned scenario and 1 342 248 mm in the burned scenario similarly observed average low flows june through august were slightly lower than both modeled scenarios the observed mean low flows were 2 28 0 81 mm d 1 while the unburned scenarios had a mean of 2 66 0 57 mm d 1 and the burned scenarios had a mean of 2 74 0 59 mm d 1 peak flows however were better represented by the burned scenario the peak flow for the observed data was 13 6 mm d 1 while the mean modeled peak flows were 10 1 3 2 mm d 1 for the unburned scenarios and 12 5 4 4 mm d 1 for the burned scenarios 3 3 magnitude and range of wildfire effects inclusion of the wildfire simulations in our models increased annual water yields in the north santiam by an average of 14 6 at the headwater scale and 8 0 at the basin outlet scale comparatively the wildfire simulations in the mckenzie basin increased annual water yields on average by 10 5 in the headwater sub catchments and 2 2 at the basin outlet table 5 while the wildfire simulations resulted in modest increases in annual water yields there were much larger increases in peak streamflow in the north santiam peak streamflow was increased an average of 58 8 in the headwater sub catchments and 17 6 at the basin outlet in the mckenzie the geometric mean of peak flows increased 95 0 in the headwater sub catchments and increased 24 9 at the basin outlet statistically from our linear mixed effects models there was strong evidence p 0 001 that the wildfire simulation increased both the mean annual water yield and peak streamflow in both basins table 5 there was also strong evidence p 0 001 that there was an interaction effect between basin and wildfire for mean annual water yields at both scales and peak streamflow at the headwater scales meaning that the effect of wildfire was different between basins similarly the flow duration curves for each of the study basins illustrated an increase in the infrequent high flows or the largest 5 of flows fig 5 for example the largest 5 of flows in the severely burned headwater catchments of the north santiam increased by 37 0 interestingly the largest 5 of flows in the severely burned headwater catchments in the mckenzie basin increased by 128 at the larger basin scale the upper 5 of flows at the north santiam basin outlet increased 17 0 while in the mckenzie basin they increased by 29 5 flood recurrence intervals also showed increased high flows for example at the north santiam basin outlet the streamflow for a 1 year flood was increased 12 5 and the 6 year flood was increased 20 0 at the mckenzie basin outlet there was a 10 8 increase in streamflow for the 1 year flood and 25 8 increase in the 6 year flood while these changes at the basin scale were notable there were much larger increases in the magnitude of 1 and 6 year floods in the headwater sub catchments that were burned at high severity fig 6 for example in the north santiam in subbasin 14 the 1 year flood was increased by 45 5 while the 6 year flood was increased by 37 8 in subbasin 41 in the mckenzie the 1 year flood was increased by 146 while the 6 year flood was increased by 156 the flow duration curves from both basins also illustrated that the burn scenario resulted in increases in summer low flows fig 5 for example in a severely burned subbasin in the north santiam the lowest 5 of flows increased from 0 mm d 1 to 0 025 mm d 1 while the lowest 5 of flows in a severely burned basin in the mckenzie increased by 144 at the basin outlet of the north santiam the lowest 5 of flows increased by 179 however at the outlet of the mckenzie basin the lowest 5 of flows increased by only 0 43 overall the effect of wildfire on annual water yields peak flows and low flows was most evident in headwater catchments and was dampened at the outlet of both basins fig 7 3 4 drivers of post fire streamflow changes our random forest model for annual water yields pseudo r 2 0 89 fig 8 indicated that burn severity was the most important variable for describing changes between the unburned and burned scenarios accounting for 52 4 of model accuracy our model also indicated that annual precipitation was the second most important variable influencing annual water yields representing 16 7 of the model accuracy percent area burned was the third most important variable influencing annual water yields accounting for 13 4 of the model accuracy other important variables for annual water yield changes included vegetation type and aridity which accounted for 5 4 of model accuracy the remaining variables accounting for the last 12 of the model accuracy our random forest analysis for peak flow changes found different driving factors than the analysis for annual water yields pseudo r 2 0 80 fig 8 here the wildfire characteristics burn severity and percent area burned were the most important variables burn severity accounted for 39 0 of model accuracy with percent area burned accounting for 21 7 other important variables for peak streamflow changes included aridity soil type and geologic province which were responsible for 20 7 of model accuracy the remaining variables accounted for the last 18 6 of model accuracy 4 discussion as expected the results from our model indicated that burn severity and percent area burned were generally the most important factors for projecting both peak flow and annual water yield changes after wildfire in the mckenzie and north santiam basins oregon fig 8 this finding is consistent with previous models which indicated that burn severity or area burned are key predictors of post fire peak flow responses kinoshita et al 2014 or annual water yields feikema et al 2013 several empirical studies have also illustrated the importance of burn severity or the proportion of catchment area burned for driving the streamflow response for example both burn severity and percent area burned were positively correlated with increased peak flows low flows and runoff ratios from 82 burned watersheds in the western us saxe et al 2018 similarly changes in annual streamflow were related to high burn severity in 25 catchments in the pacific northwest using five years of both pre fire and post fire data hallema et al 2017a elevated streamflow after wildfires is often attributed to decreased evapotranspiration and changes to soil hydraulic properties resulting in a greater proportion of precipitation ending up in streams ebel et al 2012 ma et al 2020 moody et al 2016 2008 for instance seven watersheds in new mexico exhibited elevated post fire runoff ratios in areas where hillslope flow paths were burned at high severity moody et al 2008 however while many studies have found a linkage between burn severity and percent area burned and the resulting hydrologic response wildfire effects have been highly variable and are likely due to catchment differences in geophysical properties and climate kinoshita et al 2014 saxe et al 2018 better understanding of how these differences affect post fire streamflow changes is key to identifying areas vulnerable to post fire effects which will help inform land management decisions both before and after fire indeed the proportional changes in annual water yield due to wildfire in our two study basins were also related to catchment characteristics and climatic variables specifically annual precipitation was the second most important variable in our random forest analysis for describing the change in annual water yield the largest annual water yield gains generally occurred during wet years fig a1 however drier years had greater percent changes in annual water yields between the burned and unburned scenarios compared to wetter years fig 9 we posit this was likely due to a greater proportion of the gross precipitation allocated to evapotranspiration et in the unburned scenario for drier years several empirical studies have also identified precipitation as an important driver of post fire annual water yields for example when post fire streamflow was separated using climate elasticity models for a burned watershed in california streamflow was reduced 102 due to precipitation but increased 38 due to fire hallema et al 2017b similarly annual water yields increased after wildfire in six paired catchments in california especially in years with average or above average precipitation bart and hope 2010 a review of 162 large watersheds that experienced land use changes also indicated that watersheds receiving less annual precipitation were more sensitive to water yield changes after the disturbance li et al 2017 while fire characteristics and annual precipitation were the primary drivers of post fire annual water yields explaining 82 of the variation in annual water yield changes the random forest model also identified vegetation type and aridity as important variables fig 8 specifically partial dependence plots indicated greater changes in annual water yields after fire in less arid areas and in catchments dominated by pacific silver fir trees fig 9 this was expected as these areas tended to have greater rates of et during the pre fire period after wildfire these areas likely experienced greater decreases in et due to vegetation loss leading to greater post fire changes in runoff and streamflow this is consistent with a post fire study in california where higher density forests had larger changes in post fire et with the greatest decreases occurring in evergreen forests compared to other land use types ma et al 2020 a number of general land use studies have also found that catchments draining conifer forests exhibited the greatest increases in water yields after disturbance for example a paired watershed study from the pacific northwest and eastern us examined streamflow changes following harvesting during the wet moist season they found the greatest increases in streamflow occurred in hemlock forests followed by mixed conifers redwoods and hardwoods jones and post 2004 similarly a review of 145 deforestation and afforestation studies investigated the estimated changes in annual water yield for seven different kinds of vegetation types the greatest changes occurred in conifer forests while the smallest changes in annual water yields occurred in scrub dominated catchments sahin and hall 1996 comparatively peak flow changes were likely due to fire effects on soil hydraulic properties particularly infiltration besides fire severity and proportion of catchment burned aridity was also identified as an important driver of wildfire caused peak flow changes fig 8 partial dependence plots indicated that more arid areas led to higher peak flow changes with wildfire which was opposite to the relationship between aridity and annual water yield changes figs 9 and 10 greater peak flows in higher aridity catchments was likely due to aridity acting as a high order control on the curve number in the model which controls the proportion of runoff this was particularly interesting because it was consistent with several recent empirical studies for example in a study of two burned basins with differing aridities in victoria aus the more arid basin had infiltration rates 333 times lower and runoff ratios 7 times greater than a wetter basin noske et al 2016 similarly in five burned plots from victoria aus there was a power relationship between aridity and surface runoff ratio with runoff ratios two orders of magnitude greater in the driest site compared to the wettest site van der sant et al 2018 besides aridity infiltration is often also strongly related to soil type which was determined to be the fourth most important factor describing peak flow changes in our study fig 8 partial dependence plots predicted the largest peak flow changes in catchments with soil types with low rock fragments and carbon contents fig 10 a2 a3 the inverse relationship between rock content and peak flows was expected as increased preferential flow where water is transported to depth in soils is known to occur in coarser soils resulting in lower runoff responses hartmann et al 2020 several empirical studies have also illustrated the importance of soil properties for post fire infiltration and runoff changes for example an examination of the wettability of different sized soil aggregates from alkaline calcareous loamy soils in spain showed that the larger aggregates 1 2 mm had low levels of hydrophobicity and retained macropores after burning resulting in less runoff mataix solera and doerr 2004 additionally an erosion lag was observed for soils with high gravel contents in a study of seven burned sites in new mexico which was attributed to an armoring effect of gravel increasing infiltration and preventing surface runoff ebel et al 2018 however unfortunately armoring is not a process explicitly represented in the model additionally gravel does not always lead to decreased runoff during the first storm after a wildfire in california ash filled macropores in gravelly soils leading to increased runoff ratios onda et al 2008 our wildfire simulations did not include ash dynamics which is likely why we did not observe such an effect the inverse relationship between carbon content and peak flow was counter to our expectations generally catchments with greater soil carbon retain and store more water hudson 1994 however our model did not change the soil carbon in the wildfire scenarios so sites with high soil carbon likely continued to retain the soil water limiting surface runoff and peak flows this is counter to what several empirical studies have found for example in northern mongolia soil volumetric water content was reduced in soils after wildfire kopp et al 2017 hypothesized that this was due to loss of the organic layer increasing water movement through preferential flow paths and increasing stormflow similarly water retention was greatly decreased for soils on southern slopes with higher organic matter contents following a wildfire in colorado ebel 2012 lastly geologic province was also identified as an important factor for peak flow changes fig 8 this result was not too surprising for unburned conditions at our sites surface runoff is extremely limited and most peak flows are generated by subsurface stormflow while we did observe an increase in runoff with wildfire we would still expect those subsurface processes to remain important partial dependence plots identified the smallest post fire peak flow changes for high cascades geology while western cascades geology showed the greatest changes fig 10 high cascades province has highly permeable rocks lacks drainage networks and is primarily spring fed with groundwater transit times between 3 and 26 years jefferson et al 2007 2006 comparatively western cascades is dominated by low permeability rocks steep slopes and streamflow is primarily from shallow subsurface flows jefferson et al 2007 2006 these differences are likely leading to differing peak flow responses after wildfire this was also observed in a northern california modeling study which tested how wildfire location impacted runoff and infiltration the greatest changes occurred in areas with sleep complex topography in areas with low permeability maina and siirila woodburn 2020 additionally the long flow path timescales in the high cascades likely helps to delay or mute the effect of wildfire entirely this was noted for two burned catchments in southern california where end member mixing analysis was used to investigate the subsurface response to wildfire jung et al 2009 the basin with greater groundwater contributions prior to the fire showed a more muted response to wildfire with surface runoff only increasing by a mean of 2 8 comparatively surface runoff increased by a mean of 41 4 in the basin where flow is split evenly between soil water and groundwater wildfire effects on streamflow were substantially greater at the headwater scale than the basin outlet our models predicted annual water yield changes between 0 25 155 for headwater subbasins and 1 28 23 4 at the basin scale fig 7 for basins less than 10 000 ha the approximate area of our modeled headwater subbasins measured changes in annual streamflow have ranged from 20 to 450 in empirical studies campbell et al 1977 hallema et al 2017a helvey 1980 lane et al 2006 loáiciga et al 2001 owens et al 2013 scott 1997 wine and cadol 2016 and 1 2 74 6 in modeling studies havel et al 2018 similar to our model results wildfire effects observed in empirical studies have tended to be smaller at larger basin scales 10 000 ha ranging from no change up to a 38 increase in annual water yields in basins up to 122 300 ha in area bart 2016 bart and hope 2010 hallema et al 2017a lane et al 2006 loáiciga et al 2001 owens et al 2013 scott 1997 wine and cadol 2016 in other modeling studies post fire annual water yields have been estimated to increase 0 7 63 7 although most models have projected annual water yield increases of less than 10 basso et al 2020 havel et al 2018 loiselle et al 2020 morán tejeda et al 2015 comparatively peak flows in our models were predicted to change between 0 78 520 at the headwater subbasin scale and 1 1 50 9 at the larger basin scale fig 7 previous modeling studies have also projected a substantial range in potential peak flows responses ranging between 120 and 2 725 for basins less than 2 500 ha seibert et al 2010 sidman et al 2015 these model projections seem to align with empirical studies which have also observed substantial variability in post fire peak flows for example in small basins less than 10 ha increases in post fire peak flows ranged between 0 and 14 200 campbell et al 1977 in moderate to larger basins 300 ha observations of peak flow increases have ranged from 5 to 850 mahat et al 2016 niemeyer et al 2020 scott 1997 soulis et al 2012 indeed much of the variability in both model and empirical results during the immediate post fire years is likely related to the temporal alignment of precipitation intensity precipitation duration soil water content and soil hydraulic properties moody and martin 2001 thomas et al 2021 however in our analysis of post fire flow drivers we focused primarily on long term climate and landscape conditions so effects of these short scale processes were not considered additionally in catchments with reservoirs peak flow responses may be mediated by water managers decreasing reservoir outflows to reduce the potential for downstream flooding across the range of precipitation scenarios our model was not always able to capture post fire observed peak flows particularly in the timing of the peaks fig 4 this was likely because the swat model was not originally designed for predicting wildfire effects and was not able to capture all of the physical landscape changes that occur with wildfire while our fire module was developed to improve existing methods of representing fire in the swat model more work is needed to refine the representation of wildfire effects on the physical processes within the model for instance in building the fire simulation we changed the land use to account for the decrease in et often observed post fire in catchments burned at high severity it is reasonable to assume et rates will decrease due to the loss of vegetation ma et al 2020 however in catchments burned at low to moderate burn severity et may remain unchanged poulos et al 2021 or even increase post fire due to compensatory transpiration from the remaining vegetation nolan et al 2014 another way to represent post fire et changes would have been to adjust the leaf area index and rooting depth within the model however these parameters were found to be insensitive in our models lastly future studies might consider using more complex runoff representations like the green ampt equation to more accurately represent infiltration excess runoff or swat vsa to more accurately represent the effects of topographic convergence on runoff processes easton et al 2008 future refinements of hydrologic models to more accurately represent the effects of wildfire on vegetation and soil characteristics may provide more accurate post fire streamflow predictions additionally we noted poor nse values for many of the smaller headwater catchments table s1 fortunately these were principally located in unburned catchments upstream of our area of focus and were not included in our analysis the poor model simulations in these catchments were likely due to the unique and complex hydrologic flow paths in the catchments in this region streamflow is often discontinuous with substantial groundwater contributions which are poorly represented in all hydrologic models 5 conclusions in our study we modeled two recently burned basins in oregon to project the range of effects on streamflow both at the headwater and downstream scale post fire increases in annual water yields peaks flows and low flows were projected to be greatest in headwater catchments but more muted at the downstream basin scale the post fire hydrological response was most strongly related to burn severity catchment area burned and annual precipitation however catchment aridity vegetation type soil type and geology were also important drivers the influence of a broad range of burn characteristics catchment characteristics and climatic factors highlights the substantial uncertainty that remains regarding the initial hydrologic responses to wildfire as the occurrence of large high severity wildfires has increased in many regions across the planet it is increasingly critical to improve hydrologic model projections post fire shifts in water quantity and quality can create substantial and costly challenges for downstream drinking water treatment and aquatic ecosystem health unfortunately the majority of hydrologic models were not originally developed to include the unique impacts of wildfire as such we require additional efforts to continue to improve model projections of post fire changes in hydrologic processes future research should leverage unfortunate but rare opportunities to quantify post fire hydrologic responses to provide improvements to model parameterization and calibration empirical data may also be used to test results in real world conditions since modeling is a simplified representation of the real world and cannot encompass all of the complexities of a landscape credit authorship contribution statement k a wampler

1856,increasing occurrence of large and severe wildfires represents a growing threat to forested watersheds and the many ecosystem services they provide past research has shown that wildfires can cause substantial increases in peak flows and annual water yields leading to potential water quality concerns and land and water management challenges however responses have been variable and there have been few studies at large basin scales leading to uncertainties about post fire hydrologic responses to address these uncertainties we projected the effect of three large wildfires 70 000 ha on streamflow in two important forested watersheds in the cascade range of oregon us we modeled the streamflow response using the soil and water assessment tool swat model calibrated on data from prior to the wildfires we modified model parameters to represent the impacts of the wildfires based on burn severity maps burned and unburned scenarios were compared using random forest models to identify drivers of increased annual water yields and peak flows post fire annual water yield changes were controlled by burn severity annual precipitation area burned aridity and vegetation type while post fire peak flow changes were controlled by burn severity area burned aridity soil type and geologic province we also found that post fire increases in annual water yields peak flows and low flows were greatest at the headwater scale but were more muted at the downstream basin scale our work provides valuable insights into the range of potential post fire streamflow changes at the headwater and larger basin scale which is becoming increasingly critical for effective forest and water management decisions keywords wildfire oregon source water hydrologic model streamflow data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction forested basins are critical sources of drinking water providing water supplies to almost one third of the world s largest cities and two thirds of cities in the united states us committee on hydrologic impacts of forest management 2008 dudley and stolton 2003 healthy forests are naturally effective at filtering and storing water which are services that save an estimated 25 9 billion dollars worldwide every year costanza et al 1997 however healthy source water supplies are increasingly at risk due to growing pressures from urbanization paul and meyer 2001 walsh et al 2005 deforestation warziniack et al 2017 climate change delpla et al 2009 murdoch et al 2000 extreme weather events khan et al 2015 forest pathogens bladon et al 2019 pest outbreaks kurz et al 2008 mikkelson et al 2013 and wildfire bladon et al 2014 hohner et al 2019 as a result water crises or significant issues with streamflow and water quantity have been identified as representing one of the greatest global risks that could negatively impact society martin 2016 world economic forum 2015 therefore it is critical to improve our understanding of the variability and drivers of source water changes from these growing pressures in particular there is increasing concern about the effects of wildfire on surface source water supplies bladon 2018 hallema et al 2018 martin 2016 robinne et al 2021 due to recent and dramatic increases in the timing extent and severity of wildfire activity in many regions of the world flannigan et al 2009 moritz et al 2012 reilly et al 2017 historical evidence and modeling efforts suggest that we will continue to observe years with elevated fire danger contributing to longer fire seasons and increased burned area abatzoglou et al 2021 flannigan et al 2013 murphy et al 2018 in part the increase in area burned is attributable to warmer temperatures earlier spring snowmelts increased fuel aridity and greater fuel accumulation abatzoglou et al 2018 marlon et al 2012 westerling 2016 indeed in recent years many areas around the globe have experienced some of their most destructive wildfire seasons in recorded history for example in 2020 2 9 million ha burned in california washington and oregon alone 29 of the total area burned in the us that year across the entire us the area burned in 2020 was 2 1 times greater than the long term average congressional research service 2021 geographic area coordination center 2020 national interagency fire center n d similarly the 2019 2020 wildfire season in australia burned almost 19 million ha consuming 21 of the temperate forest biome in that region primarily in new south wales and victoria boer et al 2020 filkov et al 2020 in 2017 and 2018 wildfires in british columbia canada burned 3 3 to 3 7 times more area than the 10 year average 2009 2019 bc wildfire service n d in europe many countries including spain italy portugal sweden and the uk have all experienced notable wildfire seasons in recent years henley and jones 2019 san miguel ayanz et al 2020 recent empirical studies have illustrated that wildfires can cause large and long lasting effects on a wide range of hydrological processes niemeyer et al 2020 poon and kinoshita 2018 rhoades et al 2019 for example wildfires can impact soil hydraulic properties reducing infiltration rates and changing water partitioning between surface and subsurface flow ebel and moody 2017 moody et al 2016 moody and ebel 2014 additionally the presence of ash water repellent layers in the soil surface sealing and reduced ground cover can contribute to increased occurrence of surface runoff balfour et al 2014 bodí et al 2012 certini 2005 larsen et al 2009 lavee et al 1995 combined with reduced interception losses and higher net precipitation kusaka et al 1983 ma et al 2020 stoof et al 2012 williams et al 2019 these effects often lead to increased annual water yields and peak flows and changes to the timing of water availability with effects potentially lasting for multiple decades coombs and melack 2013 hallema et al 2017a niemeyer et al 2020 wagenbrenner et al 2021 post fire changes to annual water yields across a number of regions and basin sizes have been observed to range from no change up to a 450 increase bart 2016 bart and hope 2010 campbell et al 1977 1977 hallema et al 2017b helvey 1980 loáiciga et al 2001 mahat et al 2016 niemeyer et al 2020 owens et al 2013 scott 1997 wine and cadol 2016 wildfire can also affect both peak flows and low flows peak and storm flows have been found to increase between 20 and 290 in alberta can washington us and south africa mahat et al 2016 niemeyer et al 2020 scott 1997 while low flow increases of 40 to 1090 have been measured in california and washington us and alberta can kinoshita and hogue 2015 mahat et al 2016 niemeyer et al 2020 shifts in the streamflow regime can have substantial impacts on aquatic ecosystems and downstream water supply for example elevated low flows which are critical for aquatic ecosystem habitat could help maintain cool stream temperatures and expand fish and other species habitats during the critical summer months bradford and heinonen 2008 mayer 2012 similarly increased low flows could potentially provide additional water supplies to downstream communities during the summer period which is often the period of highest water demand alternatively post fire increases in peak flow can lead to increased flooding and debris flow events moody and ebel 2012 neary et al 2003 wall et al 2020 increased water quality concerns like sediment nutrients and metals bladon et al 2008 emelko et al 2016 smith et al 2011 and greater and more costly challenges for drinking water treatment emelko et al 2011 hohner et al 2019 however there remains a lot of uncertainty about the post fire hydrologic and water quality effects due to the substantial variability in responses as a result of site specific controlling factors for example previous studies have identified burn severity rhoades et al 2011 rust et al 2019 percent area burned rhoades et al 2011 post fire precipitation mast et al 2016 murphy et al 2015 slope moody et al 2013 shakesby 2011 aspect ebel 2013 and aridity rust et al 2019 sheridan et al 2015 van der sant et al 2018 as potential controls on the streamflow or water quality response however little work has been done comparing the importance of these different factors to identify principal drivers especially across scales from headwaters to downstream basin outlets this type of information will facilitate improved policy and land management decisions to mitigate effects on source water supplies both before and after wildfires moody et al 2013 while previous studies have found increases in streamflow after wildfire we have a poor understanding of the range of effects particularly in larger basins emmerton et al 2020 hallema et al 2017a shakesby 2011 wu et al 2021 this is partially due to the random nature of wildfires which makes tightly controlled experiments challenging thus models provide an opportunity to make projections of the magnitude of effects and assess various post fire scenarios one of the major advantages of a modeling approach is its ability to simplify complex systems mirchi et al 2010 this provides a cost and time effective way to generate high frequency continuous data borah and bera 2004 lund and palmer 1997 models also allow for standardized comparisons of future conditions and alternative scenarios borah and bera 2004 lund and palmer 1997 critics may argue that simplification renders model outputs of little value due to model assumptions and uncertainty and indeed some models should not be used to provide quantitative results however the reduced complexity makes models extremely useful for hypothesis development and testing where those hypotheses can be field tested in complex systems grayson et al 1992 additionally for wildfire specific studies the ability of a model to provide unburned and burned outputs for the same spatial and climatic conditions overcomes one of the major challenges in wildfire research ebel and mirus 2014 several hydrologic models have previously been modified to investigate post wildfire hydrologic responses ebel et al 2023 including wepp dobre et al 2022 the mcguire rengers model mcguire et al 2017 rengers et al 2016 and the soil and water assessment tool swat havel et al 2018 loiselle et al 2020 however many models like wepp the mcguire rengers model or rhessys are constrained to hillslope to small basin scales and are rarely used to model wildfire effects at scales larger than 5 km2 ebel et al 2023 comparatively the swat model is a time continuous semi distributed process based model that enables projections of streamflow at a river basin scale neitsch et al 2011 post wildfire hydrologic modeling with swat has been completed for catchments in the western us canada spain portugal and brazil basso et al 2020 loiselle et al 2020 morán tejeda et al 2015 rodrigues et al 2019 these modeling efforts have projected increases in streamflow of 8 to 500 at the subbasin scale 5 270 km2 basso et al 2020 havel et al 2018 loiselle et al 2020 and 2 4 at the larger watershed scale 1500 km2 morán tejeda et al 2015 additionally models have illustrated relationships between streamflow responses and both area burned havel et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2019 and burn severity loiselle et al 2020 which is consistent with empirical studies the objective of our study was to provide additional insights into the potential effects of large scale wildfire on streamflow in two basins in the pacific northwest by using a modeling approach specifically we sought to answer the following questions for key source water catchments on the west slopes of the cascade range in oregon us a how does wildfire affect peak flows and annual water yields at the subbasin and basin scale b how does watershed scale affect the magnitude of post fire streamflow changes c what are the principal drivers of differences in post fire streamflow responses at the sub catchment scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area our study area included two large basins on the west slopes of the cascade range in oregon usa fig 1 specifically we modeled the north santiam river basin 44 47 n 122 45 w which supplies drinking water to 200 000 residents in the salem or area we also modeled the mckenzie river basin 44 40 n 122 57 w which provides drinking water to 200 000 residents in the eugene or area both basins have steep forested uplands where the headwaters to the north santiam and mckenzie rivers originate generally both rivers flow west to agricultural land with little relief both basins are within a mediterranean climate with cool wet winters and dry warm summers kottek et al 2006 snyder et al 2002 the basins receive an average of 2 114 mm of precipitation annually although due to orographic effects it ranges from approximately 1 000 mm to 3 000 mm prism climate group 2012 the basins are rain dominated below 400 m mixed rain and snow between 400 and 1 200 m and snow dominated above 1 200 m the average annual water yield in the mckenzie at the hayden bridge treatment plant is 1 447 mm 2007 2019 usgs site 14164900 average annual water yields in the north santiam near the outlet are 1 830 mm 1960 2019 usgs site 14183000 annual 30 year normal air temperatures range from minimums of 4 0 5 9 c in the winter to maximums of 6 9 17 3 c in the summer prism climate group 2012 approximately 80 of both basins are forested land comprised mainly of douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii western hemlock tsuga heterophylla and pacific silver fir abies amabilis while our two study basins have many similarities they also have slight differences in land use geology topography and area table 1 additionally due to a large proportion of high cascade geology the mckenzie river basin has many influential springs which may contribute as much as 80 of the discharge during the summer low flow period jefferson 2006 wildfires in both basins have been relatively infrequent with a total area burned from 1984 to 2019 of 14 746 ha in the north santiam and 31 534 ha in the mckenzie however in august to october 2020 wildfires in the two basins burned a combined area of 146 580 ha which was 3 2 times greater than the total area burned from 1984 to 2019 specifically the beachie creek and lionshead wildfires burned 51 of the north santiam river basin with 67 of the beachie creek fire and 45 of the lionshead fire burned at moderate to high severity table 2 comparatively the holiday farm fire burned 18 of the mckenzie river basin at slightly higher severity with 77 of the area burning at moderate to high severity as such we sought to model the 2020 oregon wildfires to provide insights into the potential range of streamflow responses and to identify dominant drivers of variability in post fire streamflow 2 2 model description to model the streamflow response to wildfire we used the soil and water assessment tool swat 2012 rev 664 we chose the swat model because of its ability to simulate hillslope runoff processes streamflow and in stream cycling of water quality parameters swat is a physically based basin scale hydrologic model developed by the us department of agriculture basins are divided into sub basins based on topographic maps and further divided into hydrologic response units hrus based on land use soil and slope climate data is input into the model which is used to calculate the water balance in each hru routing water nutrients and sediment through the basin gassman et al 2007 swat was originally developed to model hydrology and crop growth in agricultural settings and has been modified to incorporate forested environments however the model does not have a built in wildfire module thus to simulate wildfire we modified individual parameters in the model source code see section 2 4 to represent expected changes to the landscape and hydrology we constructed the models using the arcswat 2012 10 5 21 interface with a digital elevation model 30 m resolution u s geological survey 2000 statsgo2 soils data 30 m resolution natural resources conservation service 2006 and the 2016 national land cover database 30 m resolution yang et al 2018 we also used a 1 24 degree resolution downscaled global climate model for minimum and maximum daily air temperatures average daily solar radiation average daily wind speed and average daily relative humidity from 1950 through 2019 abatzoglou and brown 2012 the best climate model for each variable was chosen by comparing the modeled climate variables to data from nearby meteorological stations table 3 due to the importance of precipitation in modeling streamflow and the difficulty of modeling it at a daily scale we used observed precipitation data from 1960 to 2019 from various publicly available sources daly et al 2020 national climatic data center n d natural resources conservation service oregon n d the university of utah n d we used data from 13 precipitation stations in the north santiam basin and 21 precipitation stations in the mckenzie basin fig 1 precipitation was gap filled using the hyfo package xu 2020 in r in building the models the basin outlet was set at the drinking water intakes for the cities of salem north santiam and eugene mckenzie the detroit reservoir in the north santiam basin and the blue river and cougar reservoirs in the mckenzie basin were added into the model this included setting up the reservoirs using the basin area and volume of both the emergency and principal spillways we also input daily reservoir outflow data to the model to describe the daily outflow from each of the reservoirs u s army corps of engineers n d model setup resulted in 125 subbasins defined by swat as a first level subdivision of watersheds based on surface topography in the north santiam and 110 subbasins in the mckenzie basin the subbasins were then further divided into hrus where each hru had a single slope class soil type and land use as a compromise between data resolution and computational loads we specified 15 threshold values for slope soil and land use where areas below those thresholds were dissolved into the existing slope classes soil types and land uses her et al 2015 any areas within each basin that were classified as water i e swat model land use class watr were retained as water in the model this resulted in 1 112 hrus for the north santiam and 973 hrus for the mckenzie basin lastly to account for inputs to streamflow from springs in the mckenzie we included seven point sources for spring water discharge to subbasins using an average annual discharge of 0 85 m3 s 1 which was based on estimates by jefferson et al 2006 2 3 model calibration for model calibration we used the swat cup program version 5 1 1 with the sufi 2 method calibration was performed using a parallel processing program allowing the simulations to run simultaneously on multiple cores shortening the calibration process du et al 2020 we used a warm up period of four years and ran the model at a daily time step both models were calibrated for discharge from 2000 to 2019 using seven monitoring points in the north santiam and 13 monitoring points in the mckenzie validation was performed from 1990 to 1999 using six monitoring points in the north santiam and nine monitoring points in the mckenzie both models were calibrated for streamflow and sediment while we only present streamflow results here calibrating for both streamflow and sediment increases confidence that the underlying physical processes are being correctly represented in the model a regionalization approach was taken to calibrate the models where calibration was performed for each subbasin with a monitoring point and its upstream basins we first calibrated the upstream monitoring points working downstream to the basin outlet we evaluated model performance using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and adjusted r 2 coefficients br 2 best parameters were determined by performing 500 simulations at a time manually narrowing parameter ranges based on the best parameter values from the previous model run observed discharge data used to calibrate the model was aggregated from several sources the waterdata package ryberg and vecchia 2017 in r r core team 2020 was used to obtain discharge data from usgs gauging sites we also used stream discharge data from the hj andrews experimental forest johnson et al 2020 and data on spring contributions to streamflow from jefferson et al 2006 to calibrate the model 2 4 wildfire simulations we modeled both the beachie creek and lionshead wildfires in the north santiam basin and the holiday farm wildfire in the mckenzie basin we set the start date of the wildfires in the model to 7 september 2020 which was the actual start date for the holiday farm fire and the date that the beachie creek and lionshead fires rapidly expanded in size a wildfire module was developed where during a model run at the wildfire date multiple parameters in the model were modified to represent the effects of wildfire on the landscape to select the range of parameters to represent the effects of wildfire we developed a conceptual model of expected effects based on literature values and expert opinion fig 2 to model the mixed severity burn patterns of the 2020 wildfires we specified parameter changes for low moderate and high severity conditions wildfire severity was determined from severity maps created by u s forest service burn area emergency response baer teams and used to assign burn severities to hrus in the burned area specifically we used the arcmap zonal statistics as table tool to calculate the mean burn severity for each hru where burn severities were represented by increasing integer values in our model we ensured the percent area burned at each severity class matched the percent area burned at each severity class of the actual fire as closely as possible to do that we chose threshold values of the hru averaged burn severity to classify hru s with burn severities of low moderate and high we used a broad definition of burn severity to refer to the effects of fire on the consumption of large fuels shrubs litter organic matter and buried plant parts monitoring trends in burn severity n d water hrus were not burned in the simulation we ran the calibrated models for one year following the fires from 7 september 2020 to 6 september 2021 we chose to only simulate one year at a time due to annual model memory effects and because the model does not represent wildfire recovery as such running the model continuously in the post fire period would not accurately represent continuous years of post fire conditions we repeated the model run 56 times for the mckenzie and 60 times for the north santiam using different precipitation scenarios repeating the model run multiple times for the first post fire year allowed us to hypothetically examine the effect of different annual precipitation in the initial post fire period precipitation for each single year simulation was generated from the range of historical precipitation for each basin during each simulation a year of the precipitation data was selected from the historic record matching the day of year 7 september 2020 to 6 september 2021 and used as the precipitation input for the post fire year for each simulation we used the reservoir data from the same year as the precipitation data to account for differing annual reservoir management other climate variables including minimum and maximum temperature wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity used the predicted values from the macav2 gridded climate model rcp 8 5 table 3 from 7 september 2020 to 6 september 2021 the historic precipitation data included years 1960 2019 from the north santiam and 1964 to 2019 for the mckenzie we developed a module in swat to enable us to simulate the effects of wildfire by changing various model parameters such as saturated hydraulic conductivity available water capacity bulk density soil and plant uptake evaporation compensation factors used to adjust the depth distribution of soil and plant evaporative demand curve number manning s n for overland flow and land use type details on how each of these factors was modified to represent wildfire in the model are provided below and are summarized in table 4 2 4 1 saturated hydraulic conductivity saturated hydraulic conductivity is used in the model to determine the rate of vertical water percolation through soil layers it is not directly used to calculate runoff volumes we modified soil saturated hydraulic conductivity in the upper soil layer based on the relationship developed by moody et al 2016 equation 1 1 k f s 2360 e 0 0056 d n b r where k f s is field saturated hydraulic conductivity and dnbr is differenced normalized burn ratio a satellite derived metric that is commonly used to capture wildfire caused differences in leaf area plant productivity and moisture for dnbr values less than 400 the saturated hydraulic conductivity remained unchanged for calculating changes in saturated hydraulic conductivity using equation 1 we selected dnbr values of 400 for low burn severity 550 for moderate burn severity and 800 for high burn severity based values proposed by lutes et al 2006 since our starting unburned saturated hydraulic conductivity values were different than those in moody et al 147 mm h 1 2016 we quantified the absolute change between their starting values and the values predicted by the dnbr thresholds we then converted those values to a relative change which was broadly applicable across saturated hydraulic conductivities this resulted in modifications of hydraulic conductivity of 0 for low severity 26 for moderate severity and 82 for high burn severity for the fire module 2 4 2 available water capacity during calibration we increased the available water capacity a model parameter to account for the water available to plants for transpiration in the soils to account for the high resistance to xylem dysfunction and ability to transpire at low soil water potential by douglas fir the dominant tree species in our study basins brooks et al 2006 domec et al 2008 2004 fan et al 2017 however for the wildfire scenario we decreased the available water capacity to account for post fire changes in vegetation i e mortality of douglas fir trees due to wildfire to help meet the expected decrease in catchment level transpiration which has been observed to decline by up to 55 following high severity wildfire ma et al 2020 roche et al 2018 available water capacity was reduced 90 for high severity 70 for moderate severity and 25 for low severity available water capacity changes were determined by testing scenarios where the entire basin burned and choosing changes that would result in et drops matching existing literature values ma et al 2020 roche et al 2018 admittedly adjusting available water capacity is not an ideal way to account for decreased transpiration post fire as it can impact the amount of water held within the soil leaf area index and rooting depth also control plant transpiration within the model however we found these parameters insensitive which is likely due to swat s origins as an agricultural model as such forests are typically not well represented haas et al 2022 2 4 3 soil bulk density we increased the bulk density of the upper soil layer by 13 for high severity 9 for moderate severity and 1 for low severity fire we determined these estimates of post fire changes in bulk density from literature values associated with laboratory burning experiments badía and martí 2003 stoof et al 2010 and empirical studies ebel and moody 2020 xue et al 2014 in general the heat generated during wildfires can affect soil texture badía and martí 2003 ulery and graham 1993 organic matter content alauzis et al 2004 garcía corona et al 2004 and overall soil structure ebel and moody 2020 which modify the overall bulk density 2 4 4 soil and plant uptake evaporation compensation factors the soil evaporation compensation factor esco is a coefficient in the model that allows the user to modify the depth distribution of soil evaporation the coefficient ranges from 0 01 to 1 0 as esco decreases more water can be taken from deeper soil levels similarly the plant uptake compensation factor epco is a coefficient that allows the user to modify the depth of water in the soil that vegetation can access for transpiration epco also ranges from 0 01 to 1 0 however in this case larger values equate to water demand able to be met by deeper soil levels in our wildfire scenarios we increased the esco and decreased the epco which limited the depth of soil water use after fire occurrence specifically for high severity we set esco to 1 and epco to 0 01 for moderate severity we set esco to 0 8 and epco to 0 2 and for low severity we set esco and epco to 0 5 these modifications were made based on the loss of overstory vegetation and transpiration due to wildfire as well as the increased bulk density ebel and moody 2020 xue et al 2014 surface sealing larsen et al 2009 water repellent layers nyman et al 2010 robichaud 2000 and a loss of porosity xue et al 2014 which can all contribute to more surficial evaporative processes 2 4 5 curve number the curve number is a widely used parameter for projecting the approximate proportion of precipitation that ends up as direct runoff we increased the curve number relative to the initial values associated with the soils by 10 units for low severity 20 units for moderate severity and 30 units for high severity burns if these increases resulted in a curve number greater than 98 we adjusted the values back to a maximum of 98 which was representative of impervious surfaces we determined these shifts in curve number values based on knowledge that changes in soil physical properties due to wildfire can lead to elevated infiltration excess overland flow malvar et al 2011 onda et al 2008 and was consistent with previously proposed adjustments usda 2013 usda forest service n d 2 4 6 manning s n for overland flow we also changed the manning s n values a hydraulic roughness coefficient to account for the differential effects of wildfire severity on soil surface roughness and resistance to overland flow in general greater wildfire severity results in greater ground cover consumption and loss of surface roughness components keeley 2009 parson et al 2010 thus we related the expected remaining ground cover associated with different burn severities to similar manning s n ground cover values specifically we set manning s n to 0 80 for low severity 0 40 for moderate severity and 0 011 for high severity fires which was also consistent with previous studies usda soil conservation service 1986 2 4 7 land use given that wildfires can dramatically change forest structure and composition halofsky et al 2020 meng et al 2015 we used the land use function in the model to represent the expected shifts in forest ecosystems associated with different fire severities we made this decision because there was no option in the model to modify forest density but required a way to model the post fire effects on the loss of evapotranspiration similar land use changes have been used previously within swat to account for post fire decreases in transpiration loiselle et al 2020 as such we updated the land use focusing principally on the loss of woody biomass from trees specifically for low severity burns we did not change the original land use and as such forested areas were still considered to be forested as evergreen or conifer forests frse for moderate severity burns we changed the land use to grasses rnge while for high severity burns we updated the land use to barren barr these changes were necessary to produce a reasonably realistic reflection of the transpiration loss associated with wildfire which is often the dominant hydrological process that is impacted leading to additional water availability for runoff generation and streamflow ma et al 2020 niemeyer et al 2020 2 5 sensitivity analysis to determine the most sensitive parameters in our wildfire model we ran a sensitivity analysis for both the north santiam and mckenzie models for each model we ran three wildfire scenarios a low moderate and high where the entire basin was burned at that severity sensitivity was tested by varying the parameters used in the wildfire module one at a time running 100 simulations for each parameter with values ranging from the low to high severity wildfire module values to test land use change we replaced the existing land cover with the other generic land cover types one at a time excluding water which was a total of 18 simulations for each scenario initial conditions were set to the burned wildfire module values for that severity and a median precipitation scenario was used sensitivity was determined for both annual water yields and peak flows by first calculating the average change from the base unburned scenario across all subbasins in the model then to get a measure of sensitivity we calculated the standard deviation of the average change across both models 2 6 statistical analysis unfortunately model predictions of streamflow often remain inaccurate with substantial uncertainty due to limited calibration data unresolved model parameter values and poor representation of physical processes faramarzi et al 2015 zaremehrjardy et al 2021 however in our study we were not concerned about producing accurate predictions of the streamflow response to wildfire rather we were interested in quantifying and estimating the relative change in streamflow from the unburned to burned scenarios which enabled us to not be constrained by model uncertainty model calibration ensured that the physical processes were reasonably represented our model fits provided evidence that the model was indeed representing the physical processes adequately despite the adequate representations of physical processes in the model differences in model parameterization can produce variability in relative streamflow changes boisrame et al 2019 annual summaries of water yield and peak streamflow were determined for both the basin outlets and the headwater subbasins where the headwater subbasins did not have upstream subbasins peak streamflow was determined as the maximum daily flow in each precipitation scenario year linear mixed effects lme models were created for annual water yields and peak streamflow using the nlme package in r pinheiro et al 2020 this analysis was used to find the differences between burn and unburned scenarios and test if there was statistical evidence for an effect of wildfire the basin and wildfire scenario were the fixed effects in the model with precipitation scenario basin as nested random effects variance of errors were allowed to vary by basin subbasins that were not burned were removed before analysis additionally to simplify the headwater models we used the mean percent change of all the headwater subbasins in each model for each precipitation scenario the lme model for peak streamflow changes at the headwater scale was log10 transformed to normalize the residuals we used the r package emmeans to extract the mean and 95 confidence intervals from the lme model and ran tukey multiple comparison tests to check for significant difference in the mean values between groups lenth 2021 to visualize the effect of the wildfire scenario across all flow magnitudes flow duration curves were created for both the burned and unburned scenarios for individual subbasins the streamflow data was sorted and ranked by descending magnitude including all the precipitation scenarios similarly flood recurrence intervals for both burned and unburned scenarios were calculated by ranking the streamflow across all precipitation scenarios in descending order of magnitude we then calculated return periods and probabilities using the weibull plotting position method helsel et al 2020 we also performed random forest analyses to identify variables of importance i e burn severity land use aspect geology table a2 in driving post fire streamflow changes we performed two separate analyses one for annual water yield and one for peak streamflow changes we combined the data for both basins for each analysis the explanatory variables came from gis data layers which were aggregated to a subbasin level using the arcmap zonal statistics as table tool to calculate the mean for continuous data or mode for categorical data then we linked the streamflow data to the aggregated landscape and climate variables associated with each subbasin table a2 to numerically compare the burn severity across subbasins for the random forest analysis a metric of relative burn severity was developed by averaging the wildfire pixels in the area of each subbasin where 0 was unburned 1 was low severity 2 was moderate severity and 3 was high severity thus the metric ranged from 0 to 3 with increasing values representing higher severities the random forest analysis was performed using the cforest function in the party package in r hothorn et al 2006 strobl et al 2008 2007 for both percent change in annual streamflow and percent change in maximum annual peak flow variable importance was determined using the permutation method to find the mean decrease in accuracy of the random forest model on the out of box data using the varimp function analysis used 2000 trees mtry was set to 9 and the model did not use replacement when sampling the observations as recommended by strobel et al 2007 for accurate variable importance measures the subbasins upstream of the fire were removed for analysis due to the limited number of data points the entire dataset was used for training model fit was determined using the out of box data to calculate a pseudo r 2 value by using the predict function from the party package to calculate the sum of squares residuals to investigate directionality of the driver variables partial dependence plots were found for the five most important variables in each model using the pdp package in r greenwell 2017 to minimize computational time 15 equally spaced points were used for continuous variable plots a second set of random forest models were created to look at mean burn severity in each subbasin based on the real burn severity wildfire maps these models used the same procedure to the other models except in the burn severity random forest all the subbasins were retained in the analysis 3 results 3 1 calibration the daily streamflow calibration for the north santiam model had a mean nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse of 0 48 0 19 this was slightly better than the streamflow calibration for the mckenzie basin which had a mean coefficient value of 0 40 0 47 fig 3 in the validation period the north santiam had a mean nse of 0 35 0 32 while the mckenzie had a mean coefficient value of 0 56 0 19 fig 3 although previous recommendations for modeling daily streamflow data have indicated a nse above 0 50 as satisfactory and above 0 70 as good moriasi et al 2015 these recommendations are principally for small headwater catchment scale studies such studies typically only include a single basin at the outlet however our models included 6 to 13 calibration points in each basin making it challenging to achieve an overall nse value above 0 7 given the complexity of our study basins we found these model fits satisfactory see table a1 for more detailed calibration results 3 2 validation of wildfire module we validated our model outputs for the wildfire simulations by comparing predicted streamflow values with a year of observed streamflow from usgs gauges following the wildfires using the most severely burned sub catchment in each basin which had measured streamflow data available we validated the outputs in the north santiam basin with data from subbasin 23 which had a burn severity of 1 86 out of 3 a moderate to high burn severity sub catchment the observed annual water yield for the first year post fire was 2 085 mm comparatively the average predicted annual water yields were 1 449 448 mm for the unburned scenarios and 1 644 462 mm for the burned scenarios while the model underestimated the actual annual water yield the annual water yields 1960 2019 in the burned scenario were more similar to the observed data than the unburned scenario fig 4 the average observed low flows june through august were 0 77 0 54 mm d 1 while average low flows were 0 46 0 30 mm d 1 for the unburned scenarios and 0 79 0 48 mm d 1 for the burned scenarios the observed peak flow for the first year post fire 103 2 mm d 1 exceeded both model predictions the mean predicted peak flow was 34 6 15 8 mm d 1 for the unburned scenarios and 50 4 20 2 mm d 1 for the burned scenarios comparatively in the mckenzie subbasin 65 had a relative burn severity of 0 35 out of 3 so it was less fire affected overall this was reflected in the smaller differences between the unburned and burned scenarios fig 4 the observed annual water yield in the first post fire year was 1 279 mm this was slightly lower than our modeled annual water yield 1964 2019 of 1 313 246 mm in the unburned scenario and 1 342 248 mm in the burned scenario similarly observed average low flows june through august were slightly lower than both modeled scenarios the observed mean low flows were 2 28 0 81 mm d 1 while the unburned scenarios had a mean of 2 66 0 57 mm d 1 and the burned scenarios had a mean of 2 74 0 59 mm d 1 peak flows however were better represented by the burned scenario the peak flow for the observed data was 13 6 mm d 1 while the mean modeled peak flows were 10 1 3 2 mm d 1 for the unburned scenarios and 12 5 4 4 mm d 1 for the burned scenarios 3 3 magnitude and range of wildfire effects inclusion of the wildfire simulations in our models increased annual water yields in the north santiam by an average of 14 6 at the headwater scale and 8 0 at the basin outlet scale comparatively the wildfire simulations in the mckenzie basin increased annual water yields on average by 10 5 in the headwater sub catchments and 2 2 at the basin outlet table 5 while the wildfire simulations resulted in modest increases in annual water yields there were much larger increases in peak streamflow in the north santiam peak streamflow was increased an average of 58 8 in the headwater sub catchments and 17 6 at the basin outlet in the mckenzie the geometric mean of peak flows increased 95 0 in the headwater sub catchments and increased 24 9 at the basin outlet statistically from our linear mixed effects models there was strong evidence p 0 001 that the wildfire simulation increased both the mean annual water yield and peak streamflow in both basins table 5 there was also strong evidence p 0 001 that there was an interaction effect between basin and wildfire for mean annual water yields at both scales and peak streamflow at the headwater scales meaning that the effect of wildfire was different between basins similarly the flow duration curves for each of the study basins illustrated an increase in the infrequent high flows or the largest 5 of flows fig 5 for example the largest 5 of flows in the severely burned headwater catchments of the north santiam increased by 37 0 interestingly the largest 5 of flows in the severely burned headwater catchments in the mckenzie basin increased by 128 at the larger basin scale the upper 5 of flows at the north santiam basin outlet increased 17 0 while in the mckenzie basin they increased by 29 5 flood recurrence intervals also showed increased high flows for example at the north santiam basin outlet the streamflow for a 1 year flood was increased 12 5 and the 6 year flood was increased 20 0 at the mckenzie basin outlet there was a 10 8 increase in streamflow for the 1 year flood and 25 8 increase in the 6 year flood while these changes at the basin scale were notable there were much larger increases in the magnitude of 1 and 6 year floods in the headwater sub catchments that were burned at high severity fig 6 for example in the north santiam in subbasin 14 the 1 year flood was increased by 45 5 while the 6 year flood was increased by 37 8 in subbasin 41 in the mckenzie the 1 year flood was increased by 146 while the 6 year flood was increased by 156 the flow duration curves from both basins also illustrated that the burn scenario resulted in increases in summer low flows fig 5 for example in a severely burned subbasin in the north santiam the lowest 5 of flows increased from 0 mm d 1 to 0 025 mm d 1 while the lowest 5 of flows in a severely burned basin in the mckenzie increased by 144 at the basin outlet of the north santiam the lowest 5 of flows increased by 179 however at the outlet of the mckenzie basin the lowest 5 of flows increased by only 0 43 overall the effect of wildfire on annual water yields peak flows and low flows was most evident in headwater catchments and was dampened at the outlet of both basins fig 7 3 4 drivers of post fire streamflow changes our random forest model for annual water yields pseudo r 2 0 89 fig 8 indicated that burn severity was the most important variable for describing changes between the unburned and burned scenarios accounting for 52 4 of model accuracy our model also indicated that annual precipitation was the second most important variable influencing annual water yields representing 16 7 of the model accuracy percent area burned was the third most important variable influencing annual water yields accounting for 13 4 of the model accuracy other important variables for annual water yield changes included vegetation type and aridity which accounted for 5 4 of model accuracy the remaining variables accounting for the last 12 of the model accuracy our random forest analysis for peak flow changes found different driving factors than the analysis for annual water yields pseudo r 2 0 80 fig 8 here the wildfire characteristics burn severity and percent area burned were the most important variables burn severity accounted for 39 0 of model accuracy with percent area burned accounting for 21 7 other important variables for peak streamflow changes included aridity soil type and geologic province which were responsible for 20 7 of model accuracy the remaining variables accounted for the last 18 6 of model accuracy 4 discussion as expected the results from our model indicated that burn severity and percent area burned were generally the most important factors for projecting both peak flow and annual water yield changes after wildfire in the mckenzie and north santiam basins oregon fig 8 this finding is consistent with previous models which indicated that burn severity or area burned are key predictors of post fire peak flow responses kinoshita et al 2014 or annual water yields feikema et al 2013 several empirical studies have also illustrated the importance of burn severity or the proportion of catchment area burned for driving the streamflow response for example both burn severity and percent area burned were positively correlated with increased peak flows low flows and runoff ratios from 82 burned watersheds in the western us saxe et al 2018 similarly changes in annual streamflow were related to high burn severity in 25 catchments in the pacific northwest using five years of both pre fire and post fire data hallema et al 2017a elevated streamflow after wildfires is often attributed to decreased evapotranspiration and changes to soil hydraulic properties resulting in a greater proportion of precipitation ending up in streams ebel et al 2012 ma et al 2020 moody et al 2016 2008 for instance seven watersheds in new mexico exhibited elevated post fire runoff ratios in areas where hillslope flow paths were burned at high severity moody et al 2008 however while many studies have found a linkage between burn severity and percent area burned and the resulting hydrologic response wildfire effects have been highly variable and are likely due to catchment differences in geophysical properties and climate kinoshita et al 2014 saxe et al 2018 better understanding of how these differences affect post fire streamflow changes is key to identifying areas vulnerable to post fire effects which will help inform land management decisions both before and after fire indeed the proportional changes in annual water yield due to wildfire in our two study basins were also related to catchment characteristics and climatic variables specifically annual precipitation was the second most important variable in our random forest analysis for describing the change in annual water yield the largest annual water yield gains generally occurred during wet years fig a1 however drier years had greater percent changes in annual water yields between the burned and unburned scenarios compared to wetter years fig 9 we posit this was likely due to a greater proportion of the gross precipitation allocated to evapotranspiration et in the unburned scenario for drier years several empirical studies have also identified precipitation as an important driver of post fire annual water yields for example when post fire streamflow was separated using climate elasticity models for a burned watershed in california streamflow was reduced 102 due to precipitation but increased 38 due to fire hallema et al 2017b similarly annual water yields increased after wildfire in six paired catchments in california especially in years with average or above average precipitation bart and hope 2010 a review of 162 large watersheds that experienced land use changes also indicated that watersheds receiving less annual precipitation were more sensitive to water yield changes after the disturbance li et al 2017 while fire characteristics and annual precipitation were the primary drivers of post fire annual water yields explaining 82 of the variation in annual water yield changes the random forest model also identified vegetation type and aridity as important variables fig 8 specifically partial dependence plots indicated greater changes in annual water yields after fire in less arid areas and in catchments dominated by pacific silver fir trees fig 9 this was expected as these areas tended to have greater rates of et during the pre fire period after wildfire these areas likely experienced greater decreases in et due to vegetation loss leading to greater post fire changes in runoff and streamflow this is consistent with a post fire study in california where higher density forests had larger changes in post fire et with the greatest decreases occurring in evergreen forests compared to other land use types ma et al 2020 a number of general land use studies have also found that catchments draining conifer forests exhibited the greatest increases in water yields after disturbance for example a paired watershed study from the pacific northwest and eastern us examined streamflow changes following harvesting during the wet moist season they found the greatest increases in streamflow occurred in hemlock forests followed by mixed conifers redwoods and hardwoods jones and post 2004 similarly a review of 145 deforestation and afforestation studies investigated the estimated changes in annual water yield for seven different kinds of vegetation types the greatest changes occurred in conifer forests while the smallest changes in annual water yields occurred in scrub dominated catchments sahin and hall 1996 comparatively peak flow changes were likely due to fire effects on soil hydraulic properties particularly infiltration besides fire severity and proportion of catchment burned aridity was also identified as an important driver of wildfire caused peak flow changes fig 8 partial dependence plots indicated that more arid areas led to higher peak flow changes with wildfire which was opposite to the relationship between aridity and annual water yield changes figs 9 and 10 greater peak flows in higher aridity catchments was likely due to aridity acting as a high order control on the curve number in the model which controls the proportion of runoff this was particularly interesting because it was consistent with several recent empirical studies for example in a study of two burned basins with differing aridities in victoria aus the more arid basin had infiltration rates 333 times lower and runoff ratios 7 times greater than a wetter basin noske et al 2016 similarly in five burned plots from victoria aus there was a power relationship between aridity and surface runoff ratio with runoff ratios two orders of magnitude greater in the driest site compared to the wettest site van der sant et al 2018 besides aridity infiltration is often also strongly related to soil type which was determined to be the fourth most important factor describing peak flow changes in our study fig 8 partial dependence plots predicted the largest peak flow changes in catchments with soil types with low rock fragments and carbon contents fig 10 a2 a3 the inverse relationship between rock content and peak flows was expected as increased preferential flow where water is transported to depth in soils is known to occur in coarser soils resulting in lower runoff responses hartmann et al 2020 several empirical studies have also illustrated the importance of soil properties for post fire infiltration and runoff changes for example an examination of the wettability of different sized soil aggregates from alkaline calcareous loamy soils in spain showed that the larger aggregates 1 2 mm had low levels of hydrophobicity and retained macropores after burning resulting in less runoff mataix solera and doerr 2004 additionally an erosion lag was observed for soils with high gravel contents in a study of seven burned sites in new mexico which was attributed to an armoring effect of gravel increasing infiltration and preventing surface runoff ebel et al 2018 however unfortunately armoring is not a process explicitly represented in the model additionally gravel does not always lead to decreased runoff during the first storm after a wildfire in california ash filled macropores in gravelly soils leading to increased runoff ratios onda et al 2008 our wildfire simulations did not include ash dynamics which is likely why we did not observe such an effect the inverse relationship between carbon content and peak flow was counter to our expectations generally catchments with greater soil carbon retain and store more water hudson 1994 however our model did not change the soil carbon in the wildfire scenarios so sites with high soil carbon likely continued to retain the soil water limiting surface runoff and peak flows this is counter to what several empirical studies have found for example in northern mongolia soil volumetric water content was reduced in soils after wildfire kopp et al 2017 hypothesized that this was due to loss of the organic layer increasing water movement through preferential flow paths and increasing stormflow similarly water retention was greatly decreased for soils on southern slopes with higher organic matter contents following a wildfire in colorado ebel 2012 lastly geologic province was also identified as an important factor for peak flow changes fig 8 this result was not too surprising for unburned conditions at our sites surface runoff is extremely limited and most peak flows are generated by subsurface stormflow while we did observe an increase in runoff with wildfire we would still expect those subsurface processes to remain important partial dependence plots identified the smallest post fire peak flow changes for high cascades geology while western cascades geology showed the greatest changes fig 10 high cascades province has highly permeable rocks lacks drainage networks and is primarily spring fed with groundwater transit times between 3 and 26 years jefferson et al 2007 2006 comparatively western cascades is dominated by low permeability rocks steep slopes and streamflow is primarily from shallow subsurface flows jefferson et al 2007 2006 these differences are likely leading to differing peak flow responses after wildfire this was also observed in a northern california modeling study which tested how wildfire location impacted runoff and infiltration the greatest changes occurred in areas with sleep complex topography in areas with low permeability maina and siirila woodburn 2020 additionally the long flow path timescales in the high cascades likely helps to delay or mute the effect of wildfire entirely this was noted for two burned catchments in southern california where end member mixing analysis was used to investigate the subsurface response to wildfire jung et al 2009 the basin with greater groundwater contributions prior to the fire showed a more muted response to wildfire with surface runoff only increasing by a mean of 2 8 comparatively surface runoff increased by a mean of 41 4 in the basin where flow is split evenly between soil water and groundwater wildfire effects on streamflow were substantially greater at the headwater scale than the basin outlet our models predicted annual water yield changes between 0 25 155 for headwater subbasins and 1 28 23 4 at the basin scale fig 7 for basins less than 10 000 ha the approximate area of our modeled headwater subbasins measured changes in annual streamflow have ranged from 20 to 450 in empirical studies campbell et al 1977 hallema et al 2017a helvey 1980 lane et al 2006 loáiciga et al 2001 owens et al 2013 scott 1997 wine and cadol 2016 and 1 2 74 6 in modeling studies havel et al 2018 similar to our model results wildfire effects observed in empirical studies have tended to be smaller at larger basin scales 10 000 ha ranging from no change up to a 38 increase in annual water yields in basins up to 122 300 ha in area bart 2016 bart and hope 2010 hallema et al 2017a lane et al 2006 loáiciga et al 2001 owens et al 2013 scott 1997 wine and cadol 2016 in other modeling studies post fire annual water yields have been estimated to increase 0 7 63 7 although most models have projected annual water yield increases of less than 10 basso et al 2020 havel et al 2018 loiselle et al 2020 morán tejeda et al 2015 comparatively peak flows in our models were predicted to change between 0 78 520 at the headwater subbasin scale and 1 1 50 9 at the larger basin scale fig 7 previous modeling studies have also projected a substantial range in potential peak flows responses ranging between 120 and 2 725 for basins less than 2 500 ha seibert et al 2010 sidman et al 2015 these model projections seem to align with empirical studies which have also observed substantial variability in post fire peak flows for example in small basins less than 10 ha increases in post fire peak flows ranged between 0 and 14 200 campbell et al 1977 in moderate to larger basins 300 ha observations of peak flow increases have ranged from 5 to 850 mahat et al 2016 niemeyer et al 2020 scott 1997 soulis et al 2012 indeed much of the variability in both model and empirical results during the immediate post fire years is likely related to the temporal alignment of precipitation intensity precipitation duration soil water content and soil hydraulic properties moody and martin 2001 thomas et al 2021 however in our analysis of post fire flow drivers we focused primarily on long term climate and landscape conditions so effects of these short scale processes were not considered additionally in catchments with reservoirs peak flow responses may be mediated by water managers decreasing reservoir outflows to reduce the potential for downstream flooding across the range of precipitation scenarios our model was not always able to capture post fire observed peak flows particularly in the timing of the peaks fig 4 this was likely because the swat model was not originally designed for predicting wildfire effects and was not able to capture all of the physical landscape changes that occur with wildfire while our fire module was developed to improve existing methods of representing fire in the swat model more work is needed to refine the representation of wildfire effects on the physical processes within the model for instance in building the fire simulation we changed the land use to account for the decrease in et often observed post fire in catchments burned at high severity it is reasonable to assume et rates will decrease due to the loss of vegetation ma et al 2020 however in catchments burned at low to moderate burn severity et may remain unchanged poulos et al 2021 or even increase post fire due to compensatory transpiration from the remaining vegetation nolan et al 2014 another way to represent post fire et changes would have been to adjust the leaf area index and rooting depth within the model however these parameters were found to be insensitive in our models lastly future studies might consider using more complex runoff representations like the green ampt equation to more accurately represent infiltration excess runoff or swat vsa to more accurately represent the effects of topographic convergence on runoff processes easton et al 2008 future refinements of hydrologic models to more accurately represent the effects of wildfire on vegetation and soil characteristics may provide more accurate post fire streamflow predictions additionally we noted poor nse values for many of the smaller headwater catchments table s1 fortunately these were principally located in unburned catchments upstream of our area of focus and were not included in our analysis the poor model simulations in these catchments were likely due to the unique and complex hydrologic flow paths in the catchments in this region streamflow is often discontinuous with substantial groundwater contributions which are poorly represented in all hydrologic models 5 conclusions in our study we modeled two recently burned basins in oregon to project the range of effects on streamflow both at the headwater and downstream scale post fire increases in annual water yields peaks flows and low flows were projected to be greatest in headwater catchments but more muted at the downstream basin scale the post fire hydrological response was most strongly related to burn severity catchment area burned and annual precipitation however catchment aridity vegetation type soil type and geology were also important drivers the influence of a broad range of burn characteristics catchment characteristics and climatic factors highlights the substantial uncertainty that remains regarding the initial hydrologic responses to wildfire as the occurrence of large high severity wildfires has increased in many regions across the planet it is increasingly critical to improve hydrologic model projections post fire shifts in water quantity and quality can create substantial and costly challenges for downstream drinking water treatment and aquatic ecosystem health unfortunately the majority of hydrologic models were not originally developed to include the unique impacts of wildfire as such we require additional efforts to continue to improve model projections of post fire changes in hydrologic processes future research should leverage unfortunate but rare opportunities to quantify post fire hydrologic responses to provide improvements to model parameterization and calibration empirical data may also be used to test results in real world conditions since modeling is a simplified representation of the real world and cannot encompass all of the complexities of a landscape credit authorship contribution statement k a wampler

academy of sciences beijing china corresponding author this manuscript was handled by emmanouil anagnostou editor in chief evaporation from snow surfaces ess is a critical component of snow mass balance and its accurate estimation is essential for the water balance at high latitudes and altitudes selecting an appropriate model is important for achieving an accurate estimation of ess however there have been few studies focused on the choice of ess models in this study we evaluated six commonly used ess models at twelve eddy covariance sites in the fluxnet2015 dataset the six models considered include an empirical method em two bulk aerodynamic ba methods two energy based models maximum entropy production mep model and priestley taylor pt model and a combination model penman model the results show that the performance of the six models differs significantly and no single model consistently outperforms the others across all sites overall the penman method performs the best on both the hourly and daily scales with kling gupta efficiency kge coefficients of 0 75 and 0 65 on the two timescales respectively therefore we recommended the penman model as the preferred model for ess estimation in the absence of net radiation data we suggested using the em model as it noticeably outperforms the other four models the reason for the poor performance of the two ba models with kge values less than 0 4 may be attributed to their unreasonable parameterization of atmospheric stability on the other hand ignoring or simplifying the aerodynamic term is likely responsible for the poor performance of the mep and pt models keywords snow surface evaporation evaporation snow evaporation sublimation penman model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction snowpack is an essential component of the water balance at high latitudes and altitudes acting as a natural reservoir that collects solid precipitation snow during the cold season and recharges runoff through snowmelt during the warm season kattelmann and elder 1991 kling et al 2006 qi et al 2020 snowmelt supplies a critical source of freshwater for over one billion people across the globe meira neto et al 2020 as another form of snowpack loss besides snowmelt evaporation from snow surface ess represents a crucial component of the global water and energy balances ayala et al 2017 fayad et al 2017 strasser et al 2008 ess refers to the process of converting snow into water vapor which can occur in several ways including from the ground snowpack intercepted snow in the forest canopy and blowing snow numerous studies have suggested the significance of ess in the water balance of cold alpine regions marks and dozier 1992 rolf 1915 zhang et al 2004 in certain polar regions or arid high mountain areas ess can be the primary pathway through which the snowpack diminishes strasser et al 2008 yang and zhang 1992 therefore accurate quantification of ess is essential to simulate and predict the snowpack mass balance and regional water availability ess is typically measured by two methods namely the gravimetric method and the eddy covariance ec method the gravimetric method involves the use of an evaporation pan which estimates ess by measuring the weight reduction of the evaporation pan in the absent of snowmelt dewalle and meiman 1971 jackson and prowse 2009 despite being a direct and cost effective approach this method may result in overestimations of ess due to wind induced snow removal thereby affecting the reliability of the observations pomeroy et al 2015 stigter et al 2018 vionnet et al 2014 in addition the material of the evaporation pan can affect energy exchange process between the snowpack atmosphere and soil leading to a disparity between observed and actual ess rates fu et al 2004 in recent decades the ec approach has emerged as a popular method for ess measurement this method provides a continuous estimate of latent heat le fluxes by analyzing high frequency observations of wind speed and water vapor concentration kanda et al 2004 rannik et al 2016 however the cold and smooth nature of the snow surface results in low levels of atmospheric turbulence posing a challenge to accurately measure ess chatain et al 2021 santana et al 2021 as such any systematic errors or disturbances can significantly affect the accuracy of ess observations reba et al 2014 wutzler et al 2018 nevertheless the ec method remains the most reliable method for measuring ess and has been successfully applied in diverse terrains worldwide molotch et al 2007 sexstone et al 2018 zhang et al 2008 the rate of ess is influenced by the interaction between climate and snow surface factors resulting in high degree of spatial heterogeneity it is challenging to directly extend ground based ess measurements to a regional scale because the ground stations have limited spatial representation large scale ess estimation usually relies on various potential evaporation methods as the snow surface like the water surface is saturated however commonly used potential evaporation methods focus on evaporation estimation from the open water or reference crop allen et al 1998 penman 1948 the snow surface has different physical properties from the water surface and reference crop such as albedo roughness and heat storage capacity direct application of these methods could lead to unrealistic ess estimates meira neto et al 2020 parameter adjustment is necessary when using these methods to estimate ess guo et al 2015 reba et al 2014 the commonly used ess estimation methods can be roughly classified into four categories empirical methods kuchment and gelfan 1996 kuzmin 1972 aerodynamic methods box and steffen 2001 hood et al 1999 zhang et al 2008 energy budget methods hajji et al 2021 wang et al 2014 and combination methods miralles et al 2011 nakai et al 1994 wimmer et al 2009 empirical methods are constructed based on statistical relations between ess measurements and meteorological variables without requiring an explicit definition of the physical processes affecting ess however empirical equations usually have poor spatial transferability because they are developed under specific climatic conditions aerodynamic methods estimate ess based on the vertical profile relationship between water vapor fluxes and meteorological factors at two vertical measurement heights box and steffen 2001 hood et al 1999 zhang et al 2008 however conventional meteorological stations only provide single height measurements limiting the application of aerodynamic methods to address this issue a simplified version of aerodynamic methods known as the bulk aerodynamic method has been developed hood et al 1999 kustas et al 1994 although the bulk aerodynamic method is practical several underlying assumptions e g log linear profile and eddy diffusivity equivalence may compromise its reliability for ess estimation daniel moore 1983 energy budget methods are straightforward in principle treating latent heat le consumed by ess as a residual term of the surface energy balance fisher et al 2008 nakai et al 1994 reliable ess estimates can be achieved with energy budget methods if surface energy balance components other than le are accurately measured or estimated wang and dickinson 2012 however accurate measurement or estimation of these surface energy balance terms is challenging due to sparse radiation observation networks the penman combination method integrates energy balance and mass transfer components into a single equation penman 1948 and has long been used as a standard method for estimating water surface evaporation katul and parlange 1992 linacre 1993 mcmahon et al 2016 subsequent variants of the penman model e g the penman monteith model introduced resistance parameters extending their application to evaporative surfaces beyond the water surface allen et al 1998 leuning et al 2008 monteith 1965 however no combination model has been specifically developed for the snow surface method intercomparison is one of the most straightforward ways to assess their strengths and weaknesses however few studies have specifically focused on comparing ess methods sexstone et al 2016 stigter et al 2018 wang et al 2017 in addition most previous comparison studies have been limited to a single site hachikubo 2001 hood et al 1999 lackner et al 2022 leading to questionable generalizability of their findings to address this gap this study systematically evaluated the performance of six ess methods at twelve fluxnet sites specifically we used le flux observations during the snow cover periods as the benchmark for model evaluation the six models include an empirical method two bulk aerodynamic methods two energy based methods mep and pt models and a combination model penman model the aims of this study are threefold i to determine the primary meteorological factors influencing ess section 3 1 ii to evaluate the performance of six ess methods on both the hourly and daily scales sections 3 2 and 3 3 and iii to analyze the reasons for poor model performance and provide specific suggestions for enhancing the model performance section 4 the findings may provide valuable insights for the selection and improvement of ess models 2 data and method 2 1 the eddy covariance based latent heat le flux observations this study collected le flux measurements from 12 eddy covariance sites fig 1 obtained from the fluxnet2015 dataset pastorello et al 2020 these sites cover a diverse range of landscape and climatic conditions table 1 the selection of flux sites follows three criteria first flux sites had a certain length 7 days of observation period completely covered by snow second forest sites were excluded because i a portion of the le fluxes may come from plant transpiration and ii determining whether sites are covered by snow in forested areas is a challenge third flux sites must contain meteorological data required for the six models including wind speed air temperature relative humidity upward and downward longwave radiation air pressure and net radiation as the raw le measurements may contain uncertainties energy closure corrected le data from the fluxnet2015 dataset was used as benchmark data for model evaluation to identify observation periods completely covered by snow the daily modis terra snow cover product mod10a1 version 6 with a resolution of 500 m hall et al 2002 was used for classifying binary snow cover snow or no snow the binary snow cover is classified following hall et al 1995 where only grid cells with a normalized difference snow index ndsi greater than 0 40 are categorized as snow covered this threshold has been adopted by previous versions of the mod10a1 e g version 5 to determine the presence of snow riggs et al 2006 additionally the köppen geiger climate classification map provided by beck et al 2018 was used to classify the climate types of the 12 flux sites 2 2 snow evaporation models 2 2 1 the empirical em method following the form of dorton s water surface evaporation formula kuzmin 1972 proposed an empirical formula to calculate ess 1 λ e s s 32 82 0 18 0 098 u e s e a where λ is the latent heat of sublimation w s kg 1 u is the wind speed usually at the height of 2 m m s kuchment and gelfan

computed as aoki et al 2003 2 t s l w out 1 ε l w in ε σ 1 4 where lw out and lw in are upward and downward longwave radiation w m 2 respectively ε is snow emissivity 0 97 kondo and yamazawa 1986 and σ is the stefan boltzmann constant 5 67 10 8 w m 2 k 4 2 2 2 bulk aerodynamic ba method the evaporation process has been widely estimated using the bulk aerodynamic method which characterizes evaporation as the vertical surface flux of water vapor resulting from turbulent atmospheric transport sexstone et al 2016 stigter et al 2018 the mathematical expression of ess in the ba method is given as kustas et al 1994 3 ess ρ a c e k 2 u q s q a ln z z 0 2 where ρ a is the air density 1 18 kg m 3 k is the von kármán constant 0 4 q a kg kg 1 is the specific humidity at height z m q s is the surface specific humidity kg kg 1 and z 0 is the roughness length of evaporative surfaces m the value of z 0 depends on the characteristics of evaporative surfaces and usually ranges from 0 0001 to 0 005 m marks and dozier 1992 this study set z 0 of the snow surface to 0 0005 m following anderson 1976 langer et al 2011a and reba et al 2014 the rationality of the z 0 setting will be discussed in section 4 3 ce is a non dimensional stability factor that has multiple parameterization schemes dewalle and rango 2008 the accuracy of ess simulations in the ba method was found to be heavily dependent on the selected stability scheme lapo et al 2019 this study employed two widely used parameterization schemes of ce the ce1 scheme proposed by oke 1987 eq 4 and the ce2 scheme proposed by kustas et al 1994 eq 5 the resulting two bulk aerodynamic methods are named ba1 and ba2 respectively 4 ce 1 16 r i 0 75 r i 0 1 5 r i 2 r i 0 5 ce 0 5 1 58 r i 0 25 r i 0 0 5 1 7 r i 0 1 r i 0

of t s and t a k 2 2 3 maximum entropy production mep method wang et al 2014 developed an energy balance method to calculate evaporation from snow surface based on the maximum entropy production theory in this method ess is treated as a residual term of the surface energy budget 7 h 1 b σ b σ σ i s i 0 h 1 6 r n λ e s s b σ h where h is sensible heat flux w m 2 b σ is the inverse bowen ratio

2 k 1 s 1 2 detailed expressions of σ b σ i s and i 0 can refer to wang et al 2014 2 2 4 the penman method the penman method combines the principles of mass transfer and energy balance and was initially developed to estimate evaporation from open water surfaces kohler and parmele 1967 linacre 1993 penman 1948 the snow surface similar to the water surface can also be considered as a saturated or unstressed surface as a result the penman method has also been commonly used for estimating ess nakai et al 1994 stigter et al 2018 wimmer et al 2009 8 λ e s s δ δ γ r n g s ρ a c p δ γ e sat e a r a where δ kpa c 1 is the gradient of the saturation vapor pressure curve r n is the net radiation w m 2 r a is the aerodynamic resistance s m 1 c p is the specific heat capacity of air 1004 j kg 1 k 1 e sat is the saturated water vapor pressure kpa at the air temperature ta γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 g s is the residual term of the surface energy balance in addition to r n le λess and h which includes changes in snowpack energy ground heat flux the advected heat by precipitation and the advected heat by meltwater however accurately quantifying g s is challenging due to the absence of detailed energy budget observations for simplicity we set g s to 0 6r n following langer et al 2011b and wang et al 2017 the two terms on the right side of eq 8 represent the radiative term and aerodynamic term affecting evaporation process respectively r a is calculated as allen et al 1998 9 r a ln z m z 0 ln z h z ov k 2 u where z m and z h are the height of wind and humidity measurements m respectively and z 0v is the roughness length governing the transfer of heat and vapor which is set to z 0 15 following brutsaert 2005 same as the ba method the default z 0 for snow surface is 0 0005 m this value is marginally higher than the one used by the penman model for estimating open water evaporation 0 0002 m abdelrady et al 2016 barthelmie et al 1996 mohamed et al 2012 2 2 5 the priestley taylor pt method the priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 is a simplified version of the penman method that does not explicitly describe the aerodynamic term instead this model treats the aerodynamic term to a fixed proportion of the radiative term and then uses an empirical coefficient α now known as the priestley taylor coefficient to compensate for the biases resulting from ignoring the aerodynamic term utset et al 2004 xu and singh 2002 it provides another solution for ess simulation 10 λ e s s α δ δ γ r n g s priestley and taylor 1972 found that α 1 26 yielded the most accurate results when comparing observations with simulations using data obtained from saturated land surface locations and open water bodies in practice researchers found that this coefficient varied from 0 72 to 1 57 depending on surface vegetation and microclimatic conditions flint and childs 1991 miralles et al 2011 ngongondo et al 2012 despite extensive research no consensus has been reached regarding the optimal α for estimating ess we insist on using the default value of α α 1 26 because its reliability has been verified by a large amount of measured data luo et al 2022 yang and roderick 2019 2 3 method evaluation three metrics are used to quantify the performance of six ess models correlation coefficient r relative bias bias and kling gupta efficiency coefficient kge gupta et al 2009 the r measures the correlation between measurements and simulations while the bias reflects the average tendency of the simulations to be larger positive or smaller negative than observations the kge is used as a composite metric of agreement between measurements and simulations the optimal values for r bias and kge are 1 0 0 1 0 respectively 11 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 12 bias i 1 n y i x i n x 13 kge 1 r 1 2 δ y δ x 1 2 m y m x 1 2 where x i and y i are observed and simulated ess values at the moment i m x and m y are the mean of observed and simulated ess δ x and δ y are the standard deviations of observed and simulated ess n is the number of moments 3 results 3 1 the correlation between meteorological variables and ess we examined the correlation between ess observations and meteorological variables on the hourly and daily scales to identify the main controlling factors for ess fig 2 three variables were considered net radiation rn wind speed u and the vapor pressure difference between the snow surface and atmosphere vpd indicated with an asterisk to distinguish it from atmospheric vpd strictly speaking vpd is not a pure meteorological variable because snow surface temperature ts was used to calculate vpd however the dalton evaporation theory suggests that vpd instead of vpd affects the evaporation rates from saturated surfaces as shown in fig 2 all three variables positively correlate with observed ess in terms of the correlation coefficient hourly rn and vpd exert a similar correlation with ess variability while the correlation between u and ess is relatively weak fig 2a the average correlation coefficients between hourly ess observations and the three meteorological variables rn vpd and u are 0 64 0 39 0 83 0 61 0 33 0 77 and 0 25 0 01 0 38 respectively correlation analysis on the daily scale shows similar results to the hourly scale fig 2b d the correlation coefficients between ess and the three meteorological variables are 0 55 rn 0 50 vpd and 0 21 u respectively 3 2 the model evaluation on the hourly scale the boxplots show the performance of six ess methods on the hourly scale fig 3 the results show that all models except for ba1 tend to underestimate ess compared to observations the average bias values of the six models at all sites are 0 12 em 0 17 ba1 0 50 ba2 0 49 mep 0 09 penman and 0 84 pt respectively regarding the kge score no model consistently outperforms the others at all sites except for the ba2 and pt methods each model achieves the highest kge scores at a certain site table s1 highlighting that each model has unique strengths the average kge scores obtained by the six methods are 0 31 em 0 12 ba1 0 17 ba2 0 20 mep 0 51 penman and 0 01 pt respectively overall the penman method performs best in capturing the variability in ess observations on the hourly scale it achieves the lowest bias at five sites and the highest kge values at seven sites table s1 the em model is inferior to the penman model but significantly better than the other models the ba2 model outperforms the ba1 model for the two ba methods as indicated by a higher kge score 0 17 versus 0 12 the pt model performs the worst among the six models with the lowest kge score of 0 01 fig 4 shows the performance of each model when hourly observation data from all sites are used together for model evaluation in general the relative performance of the six models is consistent with that shown in fig 3 based on the kge score ranking the penman model is ranked first 0 75 followed by the em model 0 66 and they noticeably outperform the other models the ranking order of the other four models is mep 0 46 ba2 0 34 pt 0 28 and ba1 0 01 respectively 3 3 the method evaluation on the daily scale we further evaluated the performance of the six models on the daily scale fig 5 the results demonstrate that the em ba1 and penman methods overestimate ess than observations while the other three models ba2 mep and pt exhibit varying degrees of underestimation with the bias ranging from 0 69 pt to 0 13 em regarding the kge score the penman method performs the best 0 65 followed by the em 0 42 ba1 0 32 mep 0 32 ba2 0 21 and pt 0 20 models generally the model rankings align with those at the hourly scale 4 discussion 4 1 evaluation results and potential uncertainty the primary aim of this study was to provide guidance on selecting and improving of ess models through a multi model intercomparison the evaluation results indicate that the penman model performs the best followed by the em model while the other four models perform poorly previous studies have also reported the good performance of the penman model for ess estimation luo et al 2013 wang et al 2017 surprisingly the two energy balance models mep and pt perform poorly at both hourly and daily scales inconsistent with the satisfactory simulation results reported by hajji et al 2021 using the mep model our results indicate that the mep model performs well at certain sites one possible reason for the poor performance of the two energy balance models is that they do not explicitly consider the effects of wind speed and vpd on ess estimation the correlation analysis revealed that vpd has a comparable correlation with ess as rn fig 2 if the effects of wind speed and vpd are superimposed their impact on ess process is likely to surpass the effect of rn this explain why the dalton type equation can successfully simulate water surface evaporation only using vpd and wind speed dalton 1802 singh and xu 1997 in addition the importance of vpd and wind speed in ess estimation is also be reflected in the performance difference between the penman and pt models figs 3 5 the only difference between the two models is that the penman model explicitly considers the effects of vpd and wind speed via an aerodynamic term see eq 8 whereas the pt model does not explaining the performance difference between them the importance of vpd and wind speed in the ess process has also been highlighted by previous studies anderson 1936 fu et al 2009 mahrt and vickers 2005 we also noticed that the relatively poor performance of ba methods contrary to the results reported by sexstone et al 2016 and stigter et al 2018 this emphasizes the importance of choosing the appropriate ce scheme for the ba model it should be noted that this study only used two ce methods and there may be better ce methods available for the ba model given the numerous ce methods available gray and male 1981 högström 1988 kustas et al 1994 morris 1989 oke 1987 in addition the model performance seems to be related to climate types bottazzi et al 2021 xu and singh 2005 for example the em method performed better at drier sites e g us srg and cn cng while the penman method performed better at cold and non dry locations e g ca sf3 de geb and fi lom table s1 however the reliability of this inference needs to be further verified given the limited number of sites used the evaluation results are subject to several uncertainties the first is related to ec based flux observations accurately measuring turbulent fluxes over snow surfaces is challenging due to the requirements of a stable atmospheric boundary layer and low levels of atmospheric turbulences over snow surfaces chatain et al 2021 pomeroy and essery 1999 santana et al 2021 ec based flux observations commonly suffer from the issue of energy balance non closure foken 2008 the degree of energy balance non closure over snow surfaces tends to be higher than that over other land surfaces chen et al 2011 helgason and pomeroy 2012 humphreys et al 2003 although the bowen ratio corrected le observations were used for model assessment see section 2 1 there remains significant uncertainty still exist in the benchmark data pastorello et al 2020 the second uncertainty stems from the simplification for certain parameters due to the lack of relevant measurements for example snow emissivity and gs are known to vary with snow properties such as depth and age aoki et al 2003 barry 1996 lackner et al 2022 however this study assumed constant values for the two variables based on previous studies kondo and yamazawa 1986 langer et al 2011b additionally some model parameters e g z0 for snow surface were directly adopted from values suggested by previous studies anderson 1976 langer et al 2011b reba et al 2014 potentially biasing evaluation results third the identification of snow cover is another potential source of uncertainty due to the lack of detailed snow depth observations the mod10a1 product was used to determine whether the flux site was covered by snow using a fixed ndsi threshold of 0 40 hall and riggs 2007 huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 however the optimal ndsi threshold is not constant but varies with time and space hall et al 2002 with a range of 0 10 0 70 tong et al 2020 this may result in some le observations used for the model evaluation not meeting the screening requirements of the benchmark data moreover for simplicity gs was assumed as a fixed proportion of rn to estimate ess however gs is time varying and regulated by multiple factors associated with climate and snowpack datt et al 2015 ling and zhang 2006 previous studies have attempted to estimate the individual components of gs using energy balance models harder et al 2018 herrero et al 2009 however these models usually require detailed energy budget measurements and include some empirical parameters that need to be determined making them unsuitable for this study due to limited available forcing data instead this study employed an empirical method commonly used in remotely sensed evapotranspiration estimation which assumes gs as a fixed ratio of rn anderson et al 1997 miralles et al 2011 norman et al 1995 despite the fact that this simplification may bias the evaluation results it provides a compromise for models involving radiation term to estimate ess in the penman and pt models 4 2 what should be a reasonable gs rn accurately estimating gs is challenging in the absence of detailed energy budget measurements brunel et al 2006 guo et al 2015 lhomme 1997 as a compromise we treated gs as a fixed ratio of rn gs rn 0 60 following previous studies langer et al 2011b wang et al 2017 to evaluate the rationality of this ratio we investigated changes in gs rn across the 12 flux sites based on surface energy balance gs rn le h as expected the ratio of gs rn varies considerably across the flux sites on both hourly and daily scales fig 6 with the range of 0 05 0 80 and 0 09 0 94 respectively however the average gs rn for all sites is 0 49 on the hourly scale and 0 57 on the daily scale both ratios are close to the ratio of 0 60 used in this study confirming the rationality of the value set for gs rn 4 3 improving the model performance through parameter optimization like most hydrologic models ess models also contain parameters that are difficult to determine parameter calibration is a commonly used approach in hydrologic models to determine the model s free parameters thereby enhancing the model performance bai et al 2018 bai et al 2021 efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 shao et al 2019 this study also used the calibration strategy to determine the parameters of ess models three parameters involving five models were calibrated based on flux observations the snow surface roughness length z0 the default is 0 0005 reba et al 2014 the coefficient of the em model k the default is 32 82 and pt coefficient α the default is 1 26 guo et al 2015 fig 7 specifically we generated candidate parameters for each model in an equal interval within the specified parameter range then these candidate parameters were sequentially input to the model to generate hourly ess estimates the parameter yielding the maximum kge score was considered the optimized parameter the results show that two ba methods are more sensitive to z0 than penman method fig 7a c the penman ba1 and ba2 methods achieve the best performance when z0 is taken to 0 0007 0 0001 and 0 0043 m respectively the corresponding kge scores for the three models are 0 75 0 42 and 0 67 respectively in the case of using the optimized z0 the ba2 model can achieve a performance similar to the em model 0 67 versus 0 66 besides the calibration slightly improves the performance of the em and pt models fig 7d and e compared to default parameters the optimized parameters k 30 33 and α 1 44 contributed 0 02 to the increase in kge for both models in summary we recommend using 0 0001 and 0 0043 as z0 values when estimating ess using the ba1 and ba2 models respectively 5 conclusions the evaporation from the snow surface ess plays a crucial role in the water and energy cycles of high latitudes and altitudes however the suitability of various ess estimation methods remains unclear this study evaluated six commonly used ess models using hourly and daily latent heat flux observations from twelve fluxnet2015 sites the primary conclusions are as follows 1 balancing model performance and data accessibility we recommended the penman method as the preferred choice for ess estimation the em model proposed by kuzmin 1972 was recommended in the absence of net radiation data 2 the ba models are sensitive to the parameter of snow surface roughness length z0 and two optimized z0 values 0 0001 and 0 0043 are recommended for the ba1 and ba2 models using optimized z0 the ba2 model can achieve similar performance to the em model 3 energy based models should explicitly account for the effect of vpd and wind speed to achieve better ess simulations in summary our results indicate that no model consistently outperforms the other at all sites highlighting the importance of appropriate model selection in addition to the six models evaluated in this study the physically based models may provide better ess estimates given their solid physical foundation nevertheless such models typically require detailed energy budget measurements limiting their application in data scarce areas credit

balance and its accurate estimation is essential for the water balance at high latitudes and altitudes selecting an appropriate model is important for achieving an accurate estimation of ess however there have been few studies focused on the choice of ess models in this study we evaluated six commonly used ess models at twelve eddy covariance sites in the fluxnet2015 dataset the six models considered include an empirical method em two bulk aerodynamic ba methods two energy based models maximum entropy production mep model and priestley taylor pt model and a combination model penman model the results show that the performance of the six models differs significantly and no single model consistently outperforms the others across all sites overall the penman method performs the best on both the hourly and daily scales with kling gupta efficiency kge coefficients of 0 75 and 0 65 on the two timescales respectively therefore we recommended the penman model as the preferred model for ess estimation in the absence of net radiation data we suggested using the em model as it noticeably outperforms the other four models the reason for the poor performance of the two ba models with kge values less than 0 4 may be attributed to their unreasonable parameterization of atmospheric stability on the other hand ignoring or simplifying the aerodynamic term is likely responsible for the poor performance of the mep and pt models keywords snow surface evaporation evaporation snow evaporation sublimation penman model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction snowpack is an essential component of the water balance at high latitudes and altitudes acting as a natural reservoir that collects solid precipitation snow during the cold season and recharges runoff through snowmelt during the warm season kattelmann and elder 1991 kling et al 2006 qi et al 2020 snowmelt supplies a critical source of freshwater for over one billion people across the globe meira neto et al 2020 as another form of snowpack loss besides snowmelt evaporation from snow surface ess represents a crucial component of the global water and energy balances ayala et al 2017 fayad et al 2017 strasser et al 2008 ess refers to the process of converting snow into water vapor which can occur in several ways including from the ground snowpack intercepted snow in the forest canopy and blowing snow numerous studies have suggested the significance of ess in the water balance of cold alpine regions marks and dozier 1992 rolf 1915 zhang et al 2004 in certain polar regions or arid high mountain areas ess can be the primary pathway through which the snowpack diminishes strasser et al 2008 yang and zhang 1992 therefore accurate quantification of ess is essential to simulate and predict the snowpack mass balance and regional water availability ess is typically measured by two methods namely the gravimetric method and the eddy covariance ec method the gravimetric method involves the use of an evaporation pan which estimates ess by measuring the weight reduction of the evaporation pan in the absent of snowmelt dewalle and meiman 1971 jackson and prowse 2009 despite being a direct and cost effective approach this method may result in overestimations of ess due to wind induced snow removal thereby affecting the reliability of the observations pomeroy et al 2015 stigter et al 2018 vionnet et al 2014 in addition the material of the evaporation pan can affect energy exchange process between the snowpack atmosphere and soil leading to a disparity between observed and actual ess rates fu et al 2004 in recent decades the ec approach has emerged as a popular method for ess measurement this method provides a continuous estimate of latent heat le fluxes by analyzing high frequency observations of wind speed and water vapor concentration kanda et al 2004 rannik et al 2016 however the cold and smooth nature of the snow surface results in low levels of atmospheric turbulence posing a challenge to accurately measure ess chatain et al 2021 santana et al 2021 as such any systematic errors or disturbances can significantly affect the accuracy of ess observations reba et al 2014 wutzler et al 2018 nevertheless the ec method remains the most reliable method for measuring ess and has been successfully applied in diverse terrains worldwide molotch et al 2007 sexstone et al 2018 zhang et al 2008 the rate of ess is influenced by the interaction between climate and snow surface factors resulting in high degree of spatial heterogeneity it is challenging to directly extend ground based ess measurements to a regional scale because the ground stations have limited spatial representation large scale ess estimation usually relies on various potential evaporation methods as the snow surface like the water surface is saturated however commonly used potential evaporation methods focus on evaporation estimation from the open water or reference crop allen et al 1998 penman 1948 the snow surface has different physical properties from the water surface and reference crop such as albedo roughness and heat storage capacity direct application of these methods could lead to unrealistic ess estimates meira neto et al 2020 parameter adjustment is necessary when using these methods to estimate ess guo et al 2015 reba et al 2014 the commonly used ess estimation methods can be roughly classified into four categories empirical methods kuchment and gelfan 1996 kuzmin 1972 aerodynamic methods box and steffen 2001 hood et al 1999 zhang et al 2008 energy budget methods hajji et al 2021 wang et al 2014 and combination methods miralles et al 2011 nakai et al 1994 wimmer et al 2009 empirical methods are constructed based on statistical relations between ess measurements and meteorological variables without requiring an explicit definition of the physical processes affecting ess however empirical equations usually have poor spatial transferability because they are developed under specific climatic conditions aerodynamic methods estimate ess based on the vertical profile relationship between water vapor fluxes and meteorological factors at two vertical measurement heights box and steffen 2001 hood et al 1999 zhang et al 2008 however conventional meteorological stations only provide single height measurements limiting the application of aerodynamic methods to address this issue a simplified version of aerodynamic methods known as the bulk aerodynamic method has been developed hood et al 1999 kustas et al 1994 although the bulk aerodynamic method is practical several underlying assumptions e g log linear profile and eddy diffusivity equivalence may compromise its reliability for ess estimation daniel moore 1983 energy budget methods are straightforward in principle treating latent heat le consumed by ess as a residual term of the surface energy balance fisher et al 2008 nakai et al 1994 reliable ess estimates can be achieved with energy budget methods if surface energy balance components other than le are accurately measured or estimated wang and dickinson 2012 however accurate measurement or estimation of these surface energy balance terms is challenging due to sparse radiation observation networks the penman combination method integrates energy balance and mass transfer components into a single equation penman 1948 and has long been used as a standard method for estimating water surface evaporation katul and parlange 1992 linacre 1993 mcmahon et al 2016 subsequent variants of the penman model e g the penman monteith model introduced resistance parameters extending their application to evaporative surfaces beyond the water surface allen et al 1998 leuning et al 2008 monteith 1965 however no combination model has been specifically developed for the snow surface method intercomparison is one of the most straightforward ways to assess their strengths and weaknesses however few studies have specifically focused on comparing ess methods sexstone et al 2016 stigter et al 2018 wang et al 2017 in addition most previous comparison studies have been limited to a single site hachikubo 2001 hood et al 1999 lackner et al 2022 leading to questionable generalizability of their findings to address this gap this study systematically evaluated the performance of six ess methods at twelve fluxnet sites specifically we used le flux observations during the snow cover periods as the benchmark for model evaluation the six models include an empirical method two bulk aerodynamic methods two energy based methods mep and pt models and a combination model penman model the aims of this study are threefold i to determine the primary meteorological factors influencing ess section 3 1 ii to evaluate the performance of six ess methods on both the hourly and daily scales sections 3 2 and 3 3 and iii to analyze the reasons for poor model performance and provide specific suggestions for enhancing the model performance section 4 the findings may provide valuable insights for the selection and improvement of ess models 2 data and method 2 1 the eddy covariance based latent heat le flux observations this study collected le flux measurements from 12 eddy covariance sites fig 1 obtained from the fluxnet2015 dataset pastorello et al 2020 these sites cover a diverse range of landscape and climatic conditions table 1 the selection of flux sites follows three criteria first flux sites had a certain length 7 days of observation period completely covered by snow second forest sites were excluded because i a portion of the le fluxes may come from plant transpiration and ii determining whether sites are covered by snow in forested areas is a challenge third flux sites must contain meteorological data required for the six models including wind speed air temperature relative humidity upward and downward longwave radiation air pressure and net radiation as the raw le measurements may contain uncertainties energy closure corrected le data from the fluxnet2015 dataset was used as benchmark data for model evaluation to identify observation periods completely covered by snow the daily modis terra snow cover product mod10a1 version 6 with a resolution of 500 m hall et al 2002 was used for classifying binary snow cover snow or no snow the binary snow cover is classified following hall et al 1995 where only grid cells with a normalized difference snow index ndsi greater than 0 40 are categorized as snow covered this threshold has been adopted by previous versions of the mod10a1 e g version 5 to determine the presence of snow riggs et al 2006 additionally the köppen geiger climate classification map provided by beck et al 2018 was used to classify the climate types of the 12 flux sites 2 2 snow evaporation models 2 2 1 the empirical em method following the form of dorton s water surface evaporation formula kuzmin 1972 proposed an empirical formula to calculate ess 1 λ e s s 32 82 0 18 0 098 u e s e a where λ is the latent heat of sublimation w s kg 1 u is the wind speed usually at the height of 2 m m s kuchment and gelfan 1996 strasser et al 2008 e a is the water vapor pressure at measurement height of air temperature hpa and e s is the saturated water vapor pressure hpa at the snow surface temperature t s t s can be computed as aoki et al 2003 2 t s l w out 1 ε l w in ε σ 1 4 where lw out and lw in are upward and downward longwave radiation w m 2 respectively ε is snow emissivity 0 97 kondo and yamazawa 1986 and σ is the stefan boltzmann constant 5 67 10 8 w m 2 k 4 2 2 2 bulk aerodynamic ba method the evaporation process has been widely estimated using the bulk aerodynamic method which characterizes evaporation as the vertical surface flux of water vapor resulting from turbulent atmospheric transport sexstone et al 2016 stigter et al 2018 the mathematical expression of ess in the ba method is given as kustas et al 1994 3 ess ρ a c e k 2 u q s q a ln z z 0 2 where ρ a is the air density 1 18 kg m 3 k is the von kármán constant 0 4 q a kg kg 1 is the specific humidity at height z m q s is the surface specific humidity kg kg 1 and z 0 is the roughness length of evaporative surfaces m the value of z 0 depends on the characteristics of evaporative surfaces and usually ranges from 0 0001 to 0 005 m marks and dozier 1992 this study set z 0 of the snow surface to 0 0005 m following anderson 1976 langer et al 2011a and reba et al 2014 the rationality of the z 0 setting will be discussed in section 4 3 ce is a non dimensional stability factor that has multiple parameterization schemes dewalle and rango 2008 the accuracy of ess simulations in the ba method was found to be heavily dependent on the selected stability scheme lapo et al 2019 this study employed two widely used parameterization schemes of ce the ce1 scheme proposed by oke 1987 eq 4 and the ce2 scheme proposed by kustas et al 1994 eq 5 the resulting two bulk aerodynamic methods are named ba1 and ba2 respectively 4 ce 1 16 r i 0 75 r i 0 1 5 r i 2 r i 0 5 ce 0 5 1 58 r i 0 25 r i 0 0 5 1 7 r i 0 1 r i 0

of t s and t a k 2 2 3 maximum entropy production mep method wang et al 2014 developed an energy balance method to calculate evaporation from snow surface based on the maximum entropy production theory in this method ess is treated as a residual term of the surface energy budget 7 h 1 b σ b σ σ i s i 0 h 1 6 r n λ e s s b σ h where h is sensible heat flux w m 2 b σ is the inverse bowen ratio

2 k 1 s 1 2 detailed expressions of σ b σ i s and i 0 can refer to wang et al 2014 2 2 4 the penman method the penman method combines the principles of mass transfer and energy balance and was initially developed to estimate evaporation from open water surfaces kohler and parmele 1967 linacre 1993 penman 1948 the snow surface similar to the water surface can also be considered as a saturated or unstressed surface as a result the penman method has also been commonly used for estimating ess nakai et al 1994 stigter et al 2018 wimmer et al 2009 8 λ e s s δ δ γ r n g s ρ a c p δ γ e

j kg 1 k 1 e sat is the saturated water vapor pressure kpa at the air temperature ta γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 g s is the residual term of the surface energy balance in addition to r n le λess and h which includes changes in snowpack energy ground heat flux the advected heat by precipitation and the advected heat by meltwater however accurately quantifying g s is challenging due to the absence of detailed energy budget observations for simplicity we set g s to 0 6r n following langer et al 2011b and wang et al 2017 the two terms on the right side of eq 8 represent the radiative term and aerodynamic term affecting evaporation process respectively r a is calculated as allen et al 1998 9 r a ln z m z 0 ln z h z ov k 2 u where z m and z h are the height of wind and humidity measurements m respectively and z 0v is the roughness length governing the transfer of heat and vapor which is set to z 0 15 following brutsaert 2005 same as the ba method the default z 0 for snow surface is 0 0005 m this value is marginally higher than the one used by the penman model for estimating open water evaporation 0 0002 m abdelrady et al 2016 barthelmie et al 1996 mohamed et al 2012 2 2 5 the priestley taylor pt method the priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 is a simplified version of the penman method that does not explicitly describe the aerodynamic term instead this model treats the aerodynamic term to a fixed proportion of the radiative term and then uses an empirical coefficient α now known as the priestley taylor coefficient to compensate for the biases resulting from ignoring the aerodynamic term utset et al 2004 xu and singh 2002 it provides another solution for ess simulation 10 λ e s s α δ δ γ r n g s priestley and taylor 1972 found that α 1 26 yielded the most accurate results when comparing observations with simulations using data obtained from saturated land surface locations and open water bodies in practice researchers found that this coefficient varied from 0 72 to 1 57 depending on surface vegetation and microclimatic conditions flint and childs 1991 miralles et al 2011 ngongondo et al 2012 despite extensive research no consensus has been reached regarding the optimal α for estimating ess we insist on using the default value of α α 1 26 because its reliability has been verified by a large amount of measured data luo et al 2022 yang and roderick 2019 2 3 method evaluation three metrics are used to quantify the performance of six ess models correlation coefficient r relative bias bias and kling gupta efficiency coefficient kge gupta et al 2009 the r measures the correlation between measurements and simulations while the bias reflects the average tendency of the simulations to be larger positive or smaller negative than observations the kge is used as a composite metric of agreement between measurements and simulations the optimal values for r bias and kge are 1 0 0 1 0 respectively 11 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 12 bias i 1 n y i x i n x 13 kge 1 r 1 2 δ y δ x 1 2 m y m x 1 2 where x i and y i are observed and simulated ess values at the moment i m x and m y are the mean of observed and simulated ess δ x and δ y are the standard deviations of observed and simulated ess n is the number of moments 3 results 3 1 the correlation between meteorological variables and ess we examined the correlation between ess observations and meteorological variables on the hourly and daily scales to identify the main controlling factors for ess fig 2 three variables were considered net radiation rn wind speed u and the vapor pressure difference between the snow surface and atmosphere vpd indicated with an asterisk to distinguish it from atmospheric vpd strictly speaking vpd is not a pure meteorological variable because snow surface temperature ts was used to calculate vpd however the dalton evaporation theory suggests that vpd instead of vpd affects the evaporation rates from saturated surfaces as shown in fig 2 all three variables positively correlate with observed ess in terms of the correlation coefficient hourly rn and vpd exert a similar correlation with ess variability while the correlation between u and ess is relatively weak fig 2a the average correlation coefficients between hourly ess observations and the three meteorological variables rn vpd and u are 0 64 0 39 0 83 0 61 0 33 0 77 and 0 25 0 01 0 38 respectively correlation analysis on the daily scale shows similar results to the hourly scale fig 2b d the correlation coefficients between ess and the three meteorological variables are 0 55 rn 0 50 vpd and 0 21 u respectively 3 2 the model evaluation on the hourly scale the boxplots show the performance of six ess methods on the hourly scale fig 3 the results show that all models except for ba1 tend to underestimate ess compared to observations the average bias values of the six models at all sites are 0 12 em 0 17 ba1 0 50 ba2 0 49 mep 0 09 penman and 0 84 pt respectively regarding the kge score no model consistently outperforms the others at all sites except for the ba2 and pt methods each model achieves the highest kge scores at a certain site table s1 highlighting that each model has unique strengths the average kge scores obtained by the six methods are 0 31 em 0 12 ba1 0 17 ba2 0 20 mep 0 51 penman and 0 01 pt respectively overall the penman method performs best in capturing the variability in ess observations on the hourly scale it achieves the lowest bias at five sites and the highest kge values at seven sites table s1 the em model is inferior to the penman model but significantly better than the other models the ba2 model outperforms the ba1 model for the two ba methods as indicated by a higher kge score 0 17 versus 0 12 the pt model performs the worst among the six models with the lowest kge score of 0 01 fig 4 shows the performance of each model when hourly observation data from all sites are used together for model evaluation in general the relative performance of the six models is consistent with that shown in fig 3 based on the kge score ranking the penman model is ranked first 0 75 followed by the em model 0 66 and they noticeably outperform the other models the ranking order of the other four models is mep 0 46 ba2 0 34 pt 0 28 and ba1 0 01 respectively 3 3 the method evaluation on the daily scale we further evaluated the performance of the six models on the daily scale fig 5 the results demonstrate that the em ba1 and penman methods overestimate ess than observations while the other three models ba2 mep and pt exhibit varying degrees of underestimation with the bias ranging from 0 69 pt to 0 13 em regarding the kge score the penman method performs the best 0 65 followed by the em 0 42 ba1 0 32 mep 0 32 ba2 0 21 and pt 0 20 models generally the model rankings align with those at the hourly scale 4 discussion 4 1 evaluation results and potential uncertainty the primary aim of this study was to provide guidance on selecting and improving of ess models through a multi model intercomparison the evaluation results indicate that the penman model performs the best followed by the em model while the other four models perform poorly previous studies have also reported the good performance of the penman model for ess estimation luo et al 2013 wang et al 2017 surprisingly the two energy balance models mep and pt perform poorly at both hourly and daily scales inconsistent with the satisfactory simulation results reported by hajji et al 2021 using the mep model our results indicate that the mep model performs well at certain sites one possible reason for the poor performance of the two energy balance models is that they do not explicitly consider the effects of wind speed and vpd on ess estimation the correlation analysis revealed that vpd has a comparable correlation with ess as rn fig 2 if the effects of wind speed and vpd are superimposed their impact on ess process is likely to surpass the effect of rn this explain why the dalton type equation can successfully simulate water surface evaporation only using vpd and wind speed dalton 1802 singh and xu 1997 in addition the importance of vpd and wind speed in ess estimation is also be reflected in the performance difference between the penman and pt models figs 3 5 the only difference between the two models is that the penman model explicitly considers the effects of vpd and wind speed via an aerodynamic term see eq 8 whereas the pt model does not explaining the performance difference between them the importance of vpd and wind speed in the ess process has also been highlighted by previous studies anderson 1936 fu et al 2009 mahrt and vickers 2005 we also noticed that the relatively poor performance of ba methods contrary to the results reported by sexstone et al 2016 and stigter et al 2018 this emphasizes the importance of choosing the appropriate ce scheme for the ba model it should be noted that this study only used two ce methods and there may be better ce methods available for the ba model given the numerous ce methods available gray and male 1981 högström 1988 kustas et al 1994 morris 1989 oke 1987 in addition the model performance seems to be related to climate types bottazzi et al 2021 xu and singh 2005 for example the em method performed better at drier sites e g us srg and cn cng while the penman method performed better at cold and non dry locations e g ca sf3 de geb and fi lom table s1 however the reliability of this inference needs to be further verified given the limited number of sites used the evaluation results are subject to several uncertainties the first is related to ec based flux observations accurately measuring turbulent fluxes over snow surfaces is challenging due to the requirements of a stable atmospheric boundary layer and low levels of atmospheric turbulences over snow surfaces chatain et al 2021 pomeroy and essery 1999 santana et al 2021 ec based flux observations commonly suffer from the issue of energy balance non closure foken 2008 the degree of energy balance non closure over snow surfaces tends to be higher than that over other land surfaces chen et al 2011 helgason and pomeroy 2012 humphreys et al 2003 although the bowen ratio corrected le observations were used for model assessment see section 2 1 there remains significant uncertainty still exist in the benchmark data pastorello et al 2020 the second uncertainty stems from the simplification for certain parameters due to the lack of relevant measurements for example snow emissivity and gs are known to vary with snow properties such as depth and age aoki et al 2003 barry 1996 lackner et al 2022 however this study assumed constant values for the two variables based on previous studies kondo and yamazawa 1986 langer et al 2011b additionally some model parameters e g z0 for snow surface were directly adopted from values suggested by previous studies anderson 1976 langer et al 2011b reba et al 2014 potentially biasing evaluation results third the identification of snow cover is another potential source of uncertainty due to the lack of detailed snow depth observations the mod10a1 product was used to determine whether the flux site was covered by snow using a fixed ndsi threshold of 0 40 hall and riggs 2007 huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 however the optimal ndsi threshold is not constant but varies with time and space hall et al 2002 with a range of 0 10 0 70 tong et al 2020 this may result in some le observations used for the model evaluation not meeting the screening requirements of the benchmark data moreover for simplicity gs was assumed as a fixed proportion of rn to estimate ess however gs is time varying and regulated by multiple factors associated with climate and snowpack datt et al 2015 ling and zhang 2006 previous studies have attempted to estimate the individual components of gs using energy balance models harder et al 2018 herrero et al 2009 however these models usually require detailed energy budget measurements and include some empirical parameters that need to be determined making them unsuitable for this study due to limited available forcing data instead this study employed an empirical method commonly used in remotely sensed evapotranspiration estimation which assumes gs as a fixed ratio of rn anderson et al 1997 miralles et al 2011 norman et al 1995 despite the fact that this simplification may bias the evaluation results it provides a compromise for models involving radiation term to estimate ess in the penman and pt models 4 2 what should be a reasonable gs rn accurately estimating gs is challenging in the absence of detailed energy budget measurements brunel et al 2006 guo et al 2015 lhomme 1997 as a compromise we treated gs as a fixed ratio of rn gs rn 0 60 following previous studies langer et al 2011b wang et al 2017 to evaluate the rationality of this ratio we investigated changes in gs rn across the 12 flux sites based on surface energy balance gs rn le h as expected the ratio of gs rn varies considerably across the flux sites on both hourly and daily scales fig 6 with the range of 0 05 0 80 and 0 09 0 94 respectively however the average gs rn for all sites is 0 49 on the hourly scale and 0 57 on the daily scale both ratios are close to the ratio of 0 60 used in this study confirming the rationality of the value set for gs rn 4 3 improving the model performance through parameter optimization like most hydrologic models ess models also contain parameters that are difficult to determine parameter calibration is a commonly used approach in hydrologic models to determine the model s free parameters thereby enhancing the model performance bai et al 2018 bai et al 2021 efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 shao et al 2019 this study also used the calibration strategy to determine the parameters of ess models three parameters involving five models were calibrated based on flux observations the snow surface roughness length z0 the default is 0 0005 reba et al 2014 the coefficient of the em model k the default is 32 82 and pt coefficient α the default is 1 26 guo et al 2015 fig 7 specifically we generated candidate parameters for each model in an equal interval within the specified parameter range then these candidate parameters were sequentially input to the model to generate hourly ess estimates the parameter yielding the maximum kge score was considered the optimized parameter the results show that two ba methods are more sensitive to z0 than penman method fig 7a c the penman ba1 and ba2 methods achieve the best performance when z0 is taken to 0 0007 0 0001 and 0 0043 m respectively the corresponding kge scores for the three models are 0 75 0 42 and 0 67 respectively in the case of using the optimized z0 the ba2 model can achieve a performance similar to the em model 0 67 versus 0 66 besides the calibration slightly improves the performance of the em and pt models fig 7d and e compared to default parameters the optimized parameters k 30 33 and α 1 44 contributed 0 02 to the increase in kge for both models in summary we recommend using 0 0001 and 0 0043 as z0 values when estimating ess using the ba1 and ba2 models respectively 5 conclusions the evaporation from the snow surface ess plays a crucial role in the water and energy cycles of high latitudes and altitudes however the suitability of various ess estimation methods remains unclear this study evaluated six commonly used ess models using hourly and daily latent heat flux observations from twelve fluxnet2015 sites the primary conclusions are as follows 1 balancing model performance and data accessibility we recommended the penman method as the preferred choice for ess estimation the em model proposed by kuzmin 1972 was recommended in the absence of net radiation data 2 the ba models are sensitive to the parameter of snow surface roughness length z0 and two optimized z0 values 0 0001 and 0 0043 are recommended for the ba1 and ba2 models using optimized z0 the ba2 model can achieve similar performance to the em model 3 energy based models should explicitly account for the effect of vpd and wind speed to achieve better ess simulations in summary our results indicate that no model consistently outperforms the other at all sites highlighting the importance of appropriate model selection in addition to the six models evaluated in this study the physically based models may provide better ess estimates given their solid physical foundation nevertheless such models typically require detailed energy budget measurements limiting their application in data scarce areas credit

1858,non point source nps pollutants may cause water quality deterioration and eutrophication posing a significant threat to aquatic systems understanding and modelling surface and sub surface hydrological processes and nutrient cycles are therefore essential for water resources management and pollution control this paper presents a new hydrological water quality model for application in humid and semi humid catchments in china considering both hydrological processes and nutrient transport and transformation the model divides the soil into three layers and each layer is implemented with individual computational procedures for soil wetness and nutrient process nutrient transport is driven by hydrological processes and follows the same pathways as water flow in the model surface runoff infiltration and outflow from individual soil layers river channels are described separately with routines to account for the turnover of nutrients model parameters are selected according to literature open sourced data or estimated from soil texture or land use types the model is applied to simulate the hydrological processes and phosphorus transport in the tongyang river basin in china and the model performance is confirmed by comparing the predicted discharge and total phosphorus concentrations with measured data at the catchment outlets of tonghe river and yanghe river over 3 years uncertainty analysis has been further carried out using the glue method to demonstrate sensitivity of the simulation results to the selection of model parameters after model calibration the predicted results are found to compare well with field observations in terms of flow discharge and total phosphorus concentration from sensitivity analysis it is found that the recession coefficient of channel system cs and the pollutant recession coefficient of surface runoff p ks are the most influential hydrological and water quality parameters that control the arrival time and duration of flood peak and nutrient concentration peak respectively keywords non point source pollution xinanjiang model hydrological processes phosphorus water quality distributed hydrological model data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction eutrophication is a process triggered and driven by excessive nutrients in aquatic ecosystems and has been recognized as a widespread environmental problem carpenter 2001 le moal et al 2019 consequences of eutrophication include excessive growth of water plants algae blooms more frequent anoxic events and depths of fish or other species watson et al 2016 wolf et al 2017 it may cause serious economic impacts such as increasing cost of water purification for human use losses of fish and wildlife production and disruption to recreational amenities hoagland et al 2002 smith et al 2019 in late may of 2007 a major algae bloom occurred in lake taihu china leaving approximately two million people without drinking water for at least one week qin et al 2007 also on 2nd august 2014 a 3 day do not drink water warning was issued in the city of toledo ohio usa as a result of elevated levels of the toxin microcystin in the lake erie affecting over 400 000 people jetoo et al 2014 phosphorus is considered to be a primary source of nutrients causing eutrophication bertani et al 2016 excessive phosphorus usually coming from agricultural activities fertilizers and pesticides domestic and industrial wastes and discharge from wastewater treatment plants is carried into aquatic systems like rivers and lakes by surface runoff through precipitation and irrigation abbaspour et al 2015 ejigu and amosa 2021 zhi et al 2018 over the time many countries have implemented strict measures to regulate point source pollution such as industrial discharges non point source nps pollutants carried by runoff from agricultural or urban lands have now become the main cause of eutrophication in many regions across the world chen et al 2022 2019 gitau et al 2006 pintos andreoli et al 2023 therefore to inform the development of effective strategies to protect aquatic systems it is essential to identify the critical sources and pathways of nps pollutants and quantify the resulting nutrient loads at a catchment scale this has been largely relied on the use of numerical modelling wang et al 2022 zhang and huang 2011 modelling studies of nps pollution may be dated back to 1960 s in europe and north america focusing preliminarily on the use of statistic and empirical models brezonik and stadelmann 2002 in the following 30 years water quality modelling has also been shifted from the use simplified empirical models to the more complex physically based models during this period water quality models are mostly developed by integrating hydrological models with nutrient routines as nutrient release is closely linked to and driven by hydrological processes a number of models of this type e g cream knisel 1980 agnps young et al 1987 hspf al abed and whiteley 2002 swat soil and water assessment tool arnold and gibbons 1996 gassman et al 2007 are able to simulate the hydrological processes including surface runoff soil infiltration groundwater flow and nutrient transport and transformation nayeb yazdi et al 2019 tan et al 2020 yuan et al 2020 however these models require a large amount of data for model set up calibration and validation which are rarely available in most developing countries wan et al 2022 xue et al 2022 data sparsity necessitates the use of datasets routinely collected for regulatory or monitoring purposes that do not particularly fit for modelling needs wan et al 2022 xue et al 2022 it is then necessary to adapt the model structure to fit for these available databases or to develop models with reduced data requirements due to the limited availability of spatial measurements and data xinanjiang model being a conceptual rainfall runoff hydrological model is still the most popular choice for application in humid basins in china it has been widely applied in humid and semi humid areas in china for event based or long term modelling of hydrological processes since the 1970 s gong et al 2021 xu et al 2013 yao et al 2014 yew gan et al 1997 zhao et al 1980 zhao 1992 after proper model calibration xinanjiang model may provide efficient and reliable estimation of runoff generation based on mass balance taking into account precipitation evapotranspiration and soil moisture content to better account for the spatial heterogeneity at the basin scale xinanjiang model has been further developed and improved to become grid based or distributed to make use of readily available spatial rainfall land use and topographic data for more reliable basin scale hydrological modelling and prediction fang et al 2017 guo et al 2020 li et al 2009 yao et al 2012 zhou et al 2022 there have been several preliminary attempts to extend xinanjiang model to include nps load estimation and support water quality modelling mostly coupled with existing water quality model such as swat or linked with a simplified soil erosion and transport model for example yang et al 2011 coupled xinanjiang model and swat to develop a new water quality model named ecohat to simulate and predict the surface runoff and nutrient yield at songtao watershed in hainan province china zhao 2011 and zhao et al 2011 developed a simple nitrogen soil erosion phosphorus transport model and coupled it to the xinanjiang model xaj np to assess various contributions of phosphorus fluxes to the water systems in the xitiaoxi catchment in china most of these models describe the mobilization of suspended solids ss particulate phosphorus pp and dissolved phosphorus dp in the soil layer and or groundwater and transportation through different pathways providing efficient tools to understand the temporal and spatial variations of phosphorus across a catchment however due to xinanjiang model s inability to account for the vertical variation of soil water content these nps pollutant models are all based on a simplified assumption of lumped soil water storage and pollutant concentration and fail to consider the impact of vertical heterogeneity of soil on the simulation results such oversimplified assumption may lead to inaccurate hydrological and pollution predictions since certain hydrological processes and pollutant movements such as erosion and plant absorption may occur in soil zones of different depth and are highly dependent on the water content to provide more reliable hydrological and pollution predictions to inform pollutant control and catchment management this work aims to improve xinanjiang model by incorporating robust approaches to account for the vertical variation of water content in soil the improved xinanjiang model is then further coupled with a physically based water quality model to more realistically predict the transport and transformation process of phosphorus the rest of the paper is organized as follows in the following section 2 the new xinanjiang water quality modelling framework and detailed methodology are introduced section 3 provides information about the study area and datasets required by the simulations section 4 presents the simulation results and discusses model uncertainty and parameter sensitivity and finally brief conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 methodology the coupled xinanjiang water quality modelling framework proposed in this work is illustrated in fig 1 summarizing the model components as well as the model inputs and outputs the basic data for model set up mainly consist of spatial data of the problem domain including digital elevation model dem and land use hydrological inputs such as precipitation and evapotranspiration and pollutant information that is related to agricultural settings land use soil texture and pollutant sources the modelling system is composed of two computational modules for estimating flow discharge and phosphorus dynamics respectively the outputs of the model are outflow discharge and total phosphorus tp concentration at the outlets of sub basins the calculation procedure and coupling method of these two modules are explained in the following sections 2 1 the improved xinanjiang model xinanjiang model is a lumped rainfall runoff model with four components evapotranspiration runoff generation runoff source partition and runoff routing zhao et al 1980 zhao 1992 evapotranspiration reduces soil moisture according to the watershed saturation excess runoff theory to calculate evapotranspiration the soil column is divided into three layers upper middle and lower runoff generation only occurs upon repletion of the tension water storage and the soil moisture storage capacity curve smscc is utilized to provide a non uniform distribution of tension water capacity in the hydrologic unit under consideration the generated runoff is then partitioned into surface runoff interflow and groundwater runoff the distribution of these three components can be decided using the free water capacity distribution curve finally the runoff contribution to the outflow of each sub basin is represented by a hydrograph unit or through a lag and routine technique the sub basins are connected by the muskingum routing method to represent the attenuation and translation effects of the channel system more details of xinanjiang hydrologic model can be found in zhao et al 1980 and zhao 1992 in the proposed modelling framework xinanjiang model is first improved by considering the horizontal and vertical heterogeneity of catchment characteristics and hydrological processes fig 2 horizontally the model is implemented to become fully distributed to take advantage of the widely available spatial datasets such as radar rainfall and remotely sensed land use land cover data the whole basin is divided into sub basins which are further divided into cells to represent the smallest computational units for rainfall runoff estimation through water balance to better consider vertical soil heterogeneity in each cell the soil column is divided into three layers i e upper 1st layer middle 2nd layer and bottom 3rd layer with different thicknesses as a result whilst evapotranspiration can be still calculated through the original modelling procedure runoff production and separation need to be treated differently at the upper layer when rainfall exceeds evapotranspiration the incoming flow exceeds the maximum infiltration capacity or soil moisture exceeds the maximum water content of the soil the excessive fraction of the water will become surface runoff rs and the rest will infiltrate into the upper soil layer as illustrated in fig 2 in each soil layer free water i e su sl sd is generated until the soil moisture i e wu wl wd exceeds the soil moisture capacity i e wum wlm wdm which then infiltrates into the next layer i e fr 1 fr 2 fr 3 or becomes soil runoff i e sr 1 sr 2 sr 3 the water content of each layer i e θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 is the sum of soil moisture and free water content the amount of water infiltrates to the next soil layer is restricted by the maximum infiltration capacity and available space of the receiving soil soil runoff is the portion of the excessive water determined by runoff coefficients the surface runoff and soil runoffs from each of the cells may carry dissolved phosphorus and particulate phosphorus which will be routed to the outlet of each sub basin and then to the outlet of main basin following the same method as in the original xinanjiang model 2 2 water quality model to consider the horizontal and vertical heterogeneity water quality model is developed to be fully distributed to maintain consistency with the improved xinanjiang model furthermore the grid based water quality model also divides the soil column in each grid into three layers phosphorus transported by runoff through connected grid cells will be converged to the outlet of sub basins that are connected by channel systems therefore in this model the movement of phosphorus may be split into three phases process within a grid cell moving into sub basin outlet and transport in river channels fig 3 2 2 1 phosphorus process within a grid cell as shown in fig 4 within each grid cell the simulated phosphorus pools can be divided into immobile pools and mobile pools immobile pools include the organic phosphorus with a long turnover time slowp a short turnover time fastp and particulate phosphorus absorbed by soil particles partp mobile pools involve eroded particulate phosphorus pp and soluble phosphorus sp the sum of pp and sp gives the total phosphorus tp at each time step non point source pollutants are added to the model as the sources of phosphorus taking into account its spatial and temporal variability then the transformation processes between different phosphorus pools are simulated but only sp can transport vertically together with the infiltrated water flow the lost phosphorus includes the eroded pp the sp uptake by plants and the mobile phosphorus transported into rivers 2 2 2 sources of phosphorus the sources of phosphorus in each grid cell include applied inorganic and organic fertilizers plant residues depending on the crop type fertilizer application and atmospheric deposition on different land use types inorganic f fertsp i i 1 2 and organic fertilizers f fertfastp i i 1 2 are added to the sp pools in the top two soil layers at the specified days when fertilizers are applied and are spread equally over several days to account for uncertainties and spatial variation of the exact fertilizer application time plant residues are returned to the top two soil layers on specific days during which the nutrient contents of the residues are added to the fastp and the slowp pools f plantfastp i f plantslowp i i 1 2 atmospheric deposition is divided into dry deposition f deppp and wet deposition f depsp the dry deposition settles to the pp pools in the surface soil and the soluble wet deposition is added to and infiltrated through the soil as a concentration of sp in precipitation 2 2 3 transformation phosphorus transformation includes degradation solubilization and adsorption desorption which happens in all three soil layers phosphorus is released from the slowp pool to the fastp pool through degradation processes phosphorus in fastp pool is subject to solubilization to be transferred into the sp pool the transfer of phosphorus between the sp and partp pools occurs through the adsorption and desorption processes an equilibrium sorption concentration of phosphorus in the soil is iteratively calculated from the total phosphorus in the two pools using the freundlich sorption isotherm the three transformation processes may be described as 1 f degp i p degp x slowp i f t soil f θ i d t 2 f solp i p spolp x fastp i f t soil f θ i d t 3 f pads i p pads p frco c speq i p frex c slay i c bulkd x partp i d t where i 1 2 3 is the soil layer index f degp i k g k m 2 d f solp i and f pads i are the daily variations of phosphorus from degradation solubilization and adsorption desorption in each soil layer p degp 1 d p spolp 1 d and p pads 1 d are the rates of degradation solubilization and adsorption desorption respectively x slowp i k g km 2 x fastp i k g km 2 and x partp i k g km 2 are the weight of slow turnover phosphorus fast turnover phosphorus and particulate p per unit area in each soil layer f t soil and f θ i represent the functions for soil temperature t soil and soil moisture which can be found in appendix 1 p frco and p frex are the soil dependent coefficient and exponent in the freundlich equation c speq m g l is the sp equilibrium concentration c bulkd k g m 3 is the soil bulk density c slay i m m is the soil layer thickness and finally dt d is the time step 2 2 4 losses through erosion and plant uptake during a rainfall event phosphorus attached to the soil particles in the upper layer may be displaced by rainfall and transported by overland flow particulate p losses from land to watercourses are assumed to occur solely due to erosion of soil particles containing phosphorus the erosion loss of phosphorus is represented in the model through detachment and transport processes detachment is simulated using revised morgan morgan finney model morgan 2001 sediments on the ground surface are detached by rain splash and surface runoff the amount of sediment detached by raindrops is related to soil detachability rainfall kinetic energy and the ratio of vegetation cover surface runoff detachment is determined by a function of flow discharge slope steepness bed friction and percentage of bare soil then the detachment of particulate p is deduced from the detached sediment and the total p content of the slow p and part p pools once detached pp is transported to a landscape storage pool with the overland flow and the amount of detached pp transported to the pool determined by the transport capacity of the flow due to the filtering effects of soil vegetation and other ground features part of particulate phosphorus will be deposited on the ground surface whilst the rest is transported to the linked river channels as equation 4 and equation 5 4 f

enrich is the enrichment factor further details of the formulation are provided in appendix 1 vegetation may absorb soluble phosphorus in the top two soil layers in the nutrient model potential plant uptake of nutrients follows the logistic uptake functions with the phosphorus uptake assumed to be proportional to nitrogen uptake actual uptake only occurs between the sowing date the start of the crop growing season and the harvest date the end of the growing season uptake during the main growing season is limited only by the availability of nutrients autumn sown crops are also limited by a temperature function to account for the less favorite growing conditions during this time of the year the plant uptake is calculated by 6 f putp i m i n p pnrat α put d t 0 8 x sp i where f putp i k g k m 2 is the amount of p up taken by plants per time step in each soil layer i 1 2 p pnrat is the ratio between phosphorus and nitrogen in plant uptake α put k g k m 2 d is the potential nitrogen uptake and x sp i k g k m 2 is the sp pool 2 2 5 phosphorus transport soluble phosphorus sp may be transported between soil layers or out of the cell under consideration through horizontal and lateral water flow the soluble phosphorus is assumed to be fully mixed in each soil layer before infiltration and runoff generation occur with regard to vertical transport through infiltration the amount of phosphorus transported into next soil may be calculated as 7 f infsp i fr i c sp sr i 1 fr i c sp i 1 i 2 3 where f infsp i k g m 2 is the sp transported into layer i fr i m m is the infiltration to layer i predicted by the improved xinanjiang model and c sp sr m g l and c sp i m g l are the sp concentrations respectively in the surface runoff and each soil layer for phosphorus transported by runoffs to leave a grid call sp and pp in surface runoff and sp in soil runoffs are considered with the surface runoff soil runoffs and infiltrated water mass provided by the improved xinanjiang model the following formulae can be used to estimate the amount of phosphorus transported by relevant processes 8 f rfsp i sr i c sp i 9 f srsp r s c sp sr 10 f srpp r s c pp sr where f rfsp i k g m 2 and f

and c pp sr is pp concentration in surface runoff 2 2 6 overall phosphorous process in each soil layer to sum up the change of phosphorus mass of slowp pool δ x slowp fastp pool δ x fastp soluble

transport of phosphorous to rivers phosphorus is transported by different types of runoffs from the upstream grid cells to the outlet of each sub basin to form the outflow of sub basin into rivers using the lag and route method as the improved xinanjiang model the parameters involved in this calculation process are p ks p ku p kl and p k g representing the recession coefficients of phosphorus in surface runoff upper soil runoff middle soil runoff and groundwater runoff respectively 2 2 8 phosphorus in rivers in river channels phosphorus from the sub basin outlets is routed to the final basin outlet through advection diffusion and deposition during this process phosphorus may be further mixed with industrial domestic and livestock wastes that are discharged into the rivers through drainage systems the governing equation of phosphorus transport in rivers is given as 16 c sp v riv t u riv c sp v riv x x d c sp v riv x f pointsp t 17 c pp v riv t u riv c pp v riv x x d c pp v riv

water quality model is illustrated in fig 5 at the beginning of a simulation the soil condition is initialized according to land use information then at each time step the water flow and phosphorus concentration are calculated in each grid cell along the pathways to sub basin outlets and inside rivers after that the overall flow discharge and tp concentration are produced and written to the output files as part of the current study model performance evaluation model parameter sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are also conducted to evaluate the model performance the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient is calculated through 19 nse 1 1 n q m i q o i 1 n q m i q o where n is the total number of time steps q o i denotes an observation measured value q m i is the corresponding model prediction and q o is the mean value of observations nse returns a value ranging from to 1 with nse 1 indicating perfect agreement between model prediction and observation and nse 0 meaning the model predicts the mean observed value a negative nse is returned when the model prediction is worse than the observed mean for analyzing parameter sensitivity and model uncertainty the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method is adopted in this work glue is based on the estimation of weights or probabilities associated with different parameter sets the parameter set that produces the least errors good fit is usually associated with the highest likelihood function and probability the likelihood uncertainty level is calculated as 20 l θ i y 1 σ i 2 σ obs 2 where l is the likelihood measure of the i t h model simulation performed with parameter set θ i related to the measured process y and σ i and σ obs are respectively the error variances of the i t h model simulation and the observation a distribution function is obtained by rescaling the likelihood measures such that the sum of all likelihood values equals 1 the cumulative distribution and the prediction quantiles 95 and 5 confidence levels are used to assess the uncertainty level herein different sets of model parameters are used to generate simulation results and nse is adopted as the likelihood measure indicator regional sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the sensitivity of model parameters freer et al 1996 the parameter sets from the glue method are ranked according to the selected objective which is transformed to a likelihood value and then split into 10 groups for each group the likelihoods are normalized by dividing by their total and the cumulative frequency distribution is finally calculated and plotted if the model performance is sensitive to a particular parameter there will be a large difference between the cumulative frequency distributions i e the parameter has a significant effect on the model output 3 case study to test and demonstrate the new coupled xinanjiang water quality model for real world applications the 150 km2 tongyang river basin in the southeastern china fig 6 is considered and introduced in the following sub sections 3 1 the study area the tongyang river basin is predominated by transitional subtropical to warm temperate monsoon climate with an annual average temperature of 16 1 0 29 c and annual precipitation ranges from 750 to 1700 mm within the study area the tonghe river and yanghe river are the two principal rivers and the subsequent analysis pertains exclusively to these rivers the yellow brown soil and paddy soil are the two major soil types in this area the average soil organic matter som total nitrogen tn and tp concentrations in the soil are 2580 m g k g 1200 m g k g and 500 m g k g respectively lin et al 2021 the tongyang river is one of the most important inlets to the chaohu lake which is the fifth largest freshwater lake in china and plays a significant role in flood control water supply irrigation transportation fishery and tourism for the region but excessive disposal of industrial agricultural and domestic effluents makes the lake suffering from heavy eutrophication and harmful algal blooms since 1995 shang and shang 2007 it is important to better understand the hydrological processes and nutrient dynamics in this area especially the upstream feeding catchments to provide essential information to support water resources and ecosystems management for chaohu lake 3 2 data and model set up a digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 50 m 50 m was provided by chaohu catchment administration and made available by the nanjing institute of geography and limnology niglas chinese academy of sciences to support the following modelling exercises the dem is first used to analyze the topographic features of the catchment hydrological that influence the hydrological and pollutant transport processes e g slope based on simple hydrological analysis the basin may be divided into 24 subbasins other spatial data including land use information soil texture and population pop density are also available and resampled to the same resolution as the dem the soil texture data are acquired from open source song et al 2020 and the land use information and pop density are provided by chaohu catchment administration land use information is needed for initialization of phosphorus pools runoff generation calculation of nutrient uptake informing selection of crop management factors and estimation of atmospheric loads fig 7 in tongyang river basin about 27 6 of the basin is farmland which is mostly located along rivers and the soil texture for this type of land use is mainly loam about 5 9 of the basin area are urban areas mainly concentrating in the confluence of tonghe river and yanghe river other major land use types include 56 1 of bare land and 10 4 of surface water area soil texture data are open source and used to select erosion parameters song et al 2020 in this simulation the topsoil layer 5 cm is loam while second layer 40 cm and third layer 20 cm are clay loam precipitation and evaporation data are available for download from the government website http 61 191 22 157 tyfw infoquery hedao aspx rainfall data from 2019 to 2021 in the format of 4 hourly precipitation are available from the 5 rainfall stations in the basin to support hydrological simulations domestic wastewater agricultural pollutant and atmospheric deposition are considered in the simulations the diffuse pollution emission in the basin is estimated to be 0 8 m g l d per person the farming activity in the tongyang catchment follows a multi crop system with rapeseed and rice planting in rotation rice is planted in mid june and harvested in october rapeseed is sowed at the end of october and harvested between the end of may and beginning of june in the subsequent year according to the information from the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china the phosphorus loads from fertilizer is approximated as 1200 k g k m 2 for rapeseed lands and 450 k g k m 2 for rice fields the atmospheric deposited phosphorus rate is assumed to be 0 2 0 3 k g k m 2 d finally a summary of the input data for the coupled xinanjiang water quality model is given in table 1 4 results and discussion the coupled model is applied to the case study in tongyanghe river basin for predicting streamflow and total phosphorous concentration surveyed water discharge and water quality records measured at river gauges are available for model validation the measured data in the year of 2018 is used for model calibration period and those from 2019 to 2021 for model validation further simulations have also been performed to test the sensitivity of simulation results to key model parameters it should be noted that the river discharges were not directly measured but estimated from the water level records through established rating curves which are inevitably subject to uncertainty 4 1 model calibration and validation as previously mentioned model calibration and validation are achieved through reproducing three years of measurements between 2018 and 2021 in the case study site 4 1 1 hydrological simulation results fig 8 presents the discharge hydrographs produced by the improved xinanjiang model at the outlets of tonghe river and yanghe river for the model calibration and validation periods the nse calculated against the flow measurements in tonghe river gauge is respectively 0 54 and 0 22 during calibration and validation periods for yanghe river the nse is returned to be 0 92 for calibration and 0 58 for validation the simulation results capture the times to peaks well in comparison to the observations for example the serious flooding following an intense rainfall event in july 2020 is clearly captured by the simulation but the tonghe rive gauge was damaged during the event and failed to collect measurements for comparison they were restored after the event overall the simulation slightly overestimates the flow during the draught periods and the absolute errors predicted for the peak periods are relatively high but considering the data uncertainties associated with indirect measurements generated from rating curves and missing records the model results are considered to be satisfactory in both calibration and validation periods demonstrating the performance of the improved model in depicting baseflows and flood peaks 4 1 2 phosphorous simulation results fig 9 compares the predicted and measured monthly total phosphorus concentrations at the tonghe river and yanghe river outlets for both the calibration and validation periods the calculated nse values are 0 13 for calibration and 0 40 for validation in the tonghe river for yanghe river the nse is returned to be 0 53 for calibration and 0 17 for validation the relatively low nse returned from the tonghe river calibration results is related to one of the big challenges of nps pollution modelling i e the challenge in reproducing gauge observations of pollutant concentration that are sensitive to nearby environments and pollutant loads sources the current model assumes pollutants are fully mixed in the river flow and it is difficult for the model to accurately simulate pollutant concentrations with unseen pollutant sources the low nse calculated for the validation period in the yanghe river may be attributed to human activities during the july 2020 flood a range of human interventions were implemented in the simulation area such as installing sandbag barriers and channel dredging furthermore the fertilizer time and amount were also affected by the major flood event but the water quality model is not able to account for these interventions prior to the flood event the nse values for the tonghe river and yanghe river are 0 44 and 0 40 respectively which is satisfactory for pollution modelling the simulation results for tp show a pronounced seasonal variation which is consistent with the observed high tp loads in the rainy seasons a higher tp concentration is also predicted during the early growing season of rice in late june when a large amount of chemical fertilizer and organic manures are applied furthermore the variation of phosphorus load between wet and dry years is correctly captured by the model overall the modelled tp concentration is observed to comply with rainfall patterns but due to the relatively long observation interval data during certain intensive rainfall periods may not be included to provide a reliable dataset for more rigorous model calibration and validation considering the uncertainty associated with the observation data the modelling results are as a whole considered to be acceptable 4 2 model sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to systematically assess the performance of the current new model a total of 1 000 parameter sets consisting of 10 hydrological parameters and 9 water quality parameters are randomly generated using a monte carlo sampling method within their respective value ranges to support simulations of hydrological and pollution processes between 2018 and 2021 4 2 1 hydrological model table 2 lists the 10 parameters for the improved xinanjiang model it is worth pointing out that the free water contents of each soil layer were not included in the original xinanjiang model and their values are considered to be 30 40 of the maximum soil water storage 4 2 1 1 model uncertainty for streamflow prediction based on the simulated river flows the envelope of 5 and 95 likelihood weighted quantiles green area is plotted against the observed time series red scatter in fig 10 it is clearly shown that most observed discharge values are contained within the calculated uncertainty bounds indicating that the improved model can reliably predict the observed hydrographs the simulation uncertainty during the flood periods is found to be higher than that of base flow periods although both are acceptable the overall model uncertainty qualitatively and quantitatively is considered to be acceptable for such a long term simulation including both rainfall flooding process and dry seasons 4 2 1 2 parameter sensitivity for streamflow prediction fig 11 presents the sensitivity plots for the stream flow simulation results it is acknowledged that in the original xinanjiang model c s surface runoff recession constant s m areal free water storage capacity of surface soil and w m mean area tension water capacity are revealed to be more important in the model calibration for water balance and runoff routing c s is important in controlling the flood peak discharge value and duration while s m and w m influence surface runoff generation in the improved xinanjiang model cs is also detected to be the most sensitive parameter for the same reason but fc infiltration capacity takes the place of s m and w m to become a key parameter influencing surface runoff generation this is because surface runoff occurs when the total precipitation exceeds the storage of the topsoil layer in the original model while in the current model runoff is restricted by soil infiltration capacity newly introduced parameters including kg daily groundwater coefficient and ku daily upper soil layer water coefficient that decide the interflow source partition and c l daily interflow recession coefficient of the middle layer that controls the lag and route process of the thickest soil layer are also found to have a major influence on flow prediction during a simulation ffig from the sensitivity analysis for the 10 model parameters the best performing sets of each parameter group are selected and the cumulative distribution is calculated the parameter ranges are split into 10 bins with the associated gradient calculated for each of them the best parameters identified by examining the cumulative distribution and gradients are listed in table 2 which are then used to support water quality modelling more details can be found in fig 15 of the appendix 3 4 2 2 water quality modelling table 3 lists the 8 parameters considered to analyze model uncertainty and sensitivity for water quality modelling these model parameters are divided into 3 groups and classified as recession coefficients and erosion parameters the recession constants p ks p ku and p kl are closely related to hydrological processes as pollutants are transported by water flows equilibrium concentration parameters p frco and p frex are related to the existence form of phosphorus the erosion parameters p erodp p coh and p erod are more related to soil texture which is loam in the current simulation area song et al 2020 4 2 2 1 model uncertainty for water quality modelling the envelopes of 5 and 95 likelihood weighted quantiles from the 1000 simulations green area are plotted against the observed tp concentrations red scatter in fig 12 for both rivers most of the observed tp concentration values are contained within the calculated uncertainty bounds except the data during second half of 2019 where the numerical prediction is obviously overestimated the model uncertainty is relatively higher during the flood periods than the dry seasons but the overall variation pattern is consistent with observation showing that the basic trend of concentration fluctuation can be properly simulated by the model even with uncalibrated parameters to accurately capture the peak tp concentrations it is necessary to carefully select the model parameters through model calibration however the current dataset has a monthly observation interval and may not catch all concentration peaks as happened in the real world and the observation data may contain certain level of uncertainty based on this having a small amount of observed data outside the simulation bounds is considered to be acceptable in this study 4 2 2 2 parameter sensitivity analysis for water quality modelling the results of glue based parameter sensitivity analysis are presented in fig 13 and fig 14 among three groups of model parameters recession coefficients are found to be most influential on the simulation results followed by hydrological parameters for the recession coefficient group p ks is the most influential parameter followed by p kl based on the analysis the sensitive parameters mainly cause simulation uncertainty during the flood periods when insoluble particulate phosphorus is washed off by rainfall and surface runoff and soluble phosphorus is transported by overland and subsurface flows p ks and p kl defined respectively as the pollutant recession coefficients in surface runoff and middle soil layer control the phosphorus concentration peak and duration surface runoff is commonly much stronger than soil runoffs during a flood period the middle soil layer is the thickest and therefore possesses the maximum streamflow among the three soil layers therefore there is no doubt that p ks is the most important parameter affecting the simulation accuracy whilst p kl also has an impact as expected the simulation results are not sensitive to the other two types of parameters which may be because the tp concentration in river is restricted by the sediment transport capacity of the river flow the best 10 parameter ranges of water quality model parameters are shown in fig 16 and summarized in table 3 it is interesting to see that the range of p ks and of cs is very close indicating that phosphorus has similar fate and pathway as the underlying water flow although they are found to be less sensitive than the recession constants the sensitivity of hydrological parameters is nonnegligible especially wlm averaged soil moisture storage capacity of the lower layer kg daily groundwater coefficient and ku daily upper soil layer water coefficient wlm determines the water content in the lower soil layer which can also be called root zone therefore wlm is vital for plant growth and decides the amount of pollutant uptake by crops from fig 14 the simulation results show a poor performance when wlm is less than 65 mm indicating that the water content in this soil layer is lower than 16 and not suitable for rice to grow kg and ku are also important in flow discharge modelling which control the base flow discharge as soluble phosphorus transported into the subbasin outlet by base flow during a dry period and the tp concentration uncertainty is relatively small during this period the effects of these two factors are relatively minor table 2 lists the best hydrological parameter ranges derived from the sensitivity analysis for the current case study with further details provided in fig 17 of the appendix except kg and kl other hydrological parameters do not show noticeable influences on the simulation results of tp concentration the parameter ranges of kg and kl are consistent with those concluded from hydrological simulations 5 conclusions in this study the xinanjiang model is first improved by considering the vertical heterogeneity of water content and runoff in soil which is then coupled with a water quality model to form a new coupled hydrological water quality modelling system compared with the existing nps pollution models the new coupled modelling systems has two highlights 1 the improved xinanjiang model can provide more accurate and detailed information for pollutant prediction due to consideration of the vertical heterogeneity of soil and 2 with the availability of detailed water content and flow discharge in each soil layer the processes related to soil depth such as soil erosion and plant adsorption can be more properly simulated making the model to have the potential of separately determining the contributions of nps pollutants from baseflow and surface flow at the watershed scale the model simulations and following uncertainty and sensitivity analyses in the case study of tongyang river basin have led to the following conclusions after calibration the model is validated to provide reasonable prediction of streamflow and tp concentration at the tonghe and yanghe catchment outlets the model uncertainty for both streamflow and phosphorus concentration predictions is found to be higher during the flood periods than dry seasons the hydrological simulation results are found to be sensitive to parameters c s fc kg and ku with cs being the most influential parameter for flood peak and duration predictions p ks is the most influential water quality parameter controlling the arrival time and duration of peak nutrient concentration besides the range of best 10 p ks is similar to c s showing the pollutants follow the same pathway as the water flow during a simulation p kl is also non neglectable but other parameters are found to be less influential on the results erosion related parameters may be selected according to soil texture the model is only applied to and tested in one case study site in this work due to limited access to data the capability of the model for application outside the calibration conditions and in un gauged catchments should be demonstrated and confirmed in the future credit

1858,non point source nps pollutants may cause water quality deterioration and eutrophication posing a significant threat to aquatic systems understanding and modelling surface and sub surface hydrological processes and nutrient cycles are therefore essential for water resources management and pollution control this paper presents a new hydrological water quality model for application in humid and semi humid catchments in china considering both hydrological processes and nutrient transport and transformation the model divides the soil into three layers and each layer is implemented with individual computational procedures for soil wetness and nutrient process nutrient transport is driven by hydrological processes and follows the same pathways as water flow in the model surface runoff infiltration and outflow from individual soil layers river channels are described separately with routines to account for the turnover of nutrients model parameters are selected according to literature open sourced data or estimated from soil texture or land use types the model is applied to simulate the hydrological processes and phosphorus transport in the tongyang river basin in china and the model performance is confirmed by comparing the predicted discharge and total phosphorus concentrations with measured data at the catchment outlets of tonghe river and yanghe river over 3 years uncertainty analysis has been further carried out using the glue method to demonstrate sensitivity of the simulation results to the selection of model parameters after model calibration the predicted results are found to compare well with field observations in terms of flow discharge and total phosphorus concentration from sensitivity analysis it is found that the recession coefficient of channel system cs and the pollutant recession coefficient of surface runoff p ks are the most influential hydrological and water quality parameters that control the arrival time and duration of flood peak and nutrient concentration peak respectively keywords non point source pollution xinanjiang model hydrological processes phosphorus water quality distributed hydrological model data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction eutrophication is a process triggered and driven by excessive nutrients in aquatic ecosystems and has been recognized as a widespread environmental problem carpenter 2001 le moal et al 2019 consequences of eutrophication include excessive growth of water plants algae blooms more frequent anoxic events and depths of fish or other species watson et al 2016 wolf et al 2017 it may cause serious economic impacts such as increasing cost of water purification for human use losses of fish and wildlife production and disruption to recreational amenities hoagland et al 2002 smith et al 2019 in late may of 2007 a major algae bloom occurred in lake taihu china leaving approximately two million people without drinking water for at least one week qin et al 2007 also on 2nd august 2014 a 3 day do not drink water warning was issued in the city of toledo ohio usa as a result of elevated levels of the toxin microcystin in the lake erie affecting over 400 000 people jetoo et al 2014 phosphorus is considered to be a primary source of nutrients causing eutrophication bertani et al 2016 excessive phosphorus usually coming from agricultural activities fertilizers and pesticides domestic and industrial wastes and discharge from wastewater treatment plants is carried into aquatic systems like rivers and lakes by surface runoff through precipitation and irrigation abbaspour et al 2015 ejigu and amosa 2021 zhi et al 2018 over the time many countries have implemented strict measures to regulate point source pollution such as industrial discharges non point source nps pollutants carried by runoff from agricultural or urban lands have now become the main cause of eutrophication in many regions across the world chen et al 2022 2019 gitau et al 2006 pintos andreoli et al 2023 therefore to inform the development of effective strategies to protect aquatic systems it is essential to identify the critical sources and pathways of nps pollutants and quantify the resulting nutrient loads at a catchment scale this has been largely relied on the use of numerical modelling wang et al 2022 zhang and huang 2011 modelling studies of nps pollution may be dated back to 1960 s in europe and north america focusing preliminarily on the use of statistic and empirical models brezonik and stadelmann 2002 in the following 30 years water quality modelling has also been shifted from the use simplified empirical models to the more complex physically based models during this period water quality models are mostly developed by integrating hydrological models with nutrient routines as nutrient release is closely linked to and driven by hydrological processes a number of models of this type e g cream knisel 1980 agnps young et al 1987 hspf al abed and whiteley 2002 swat soil and water assessment tool arnold and gibbons 1996 gassman et al 2007 are able to simulate the hydrological processes including surface runoff soil infiltration groundwater flow and nutrient transport and transformation nayeb yazdi et al 2019 tan et al 2020 yuan et al 2020 however these models require a large amount of data for model set up calibration and validation which are rarely available in most developing countries wan et al 2022 xue et al 2022 data sparsity necessitates the use of datasets routinely collected for regulatory or monitoring purposes that do not particularly fit for modelling needs wan et al 2022 xue et al 2022 it is then necessary to adapt the model structure to fit for these available databases or to develop models with reduced data requirements due to the limited availability of spatial measurements and data xinanjiang model being a conceptual rainfall runoff hydrological model is still the most popular choice for application in humid basins in china it has been widely applied in humid and semi humid areas in china for event based or long term modelling of hydrological processes since the 1970 s gong et al 2021 xu et al 2013 yao et al 2014 yew gan et al 1997 zhao et al 1980 zhao 1992 after proper model calibration xinanjiang model may provide efficient and reliable estimation of runoff generation based on mass balance taking into account precipitation evapotranspiration and soil moisture content to better account for the spatial heterogeneity at the basin scale xinanjiang model has been further developed and improved to become grid based or distributed to make use of readily available spatial rainfall land use and topographic data for more reliable basin scale hydrological modelling and prediction fang et al 2017 guo et al 2020 li et al 2009 yao et al 2012 zhou et al 2022 there have been several preliminary attempts to extend xinanjiang model to include nps load estimation and support water quality modelling mostly coupled with existing water quality model such as swat or linked with a simplified soil erosion and transport model for example yang et al 2011 coupled xinanjiang model and swat to develop a new water quality model named ecohat to simulate and predict the surface runoff and nutrient yield at songtao watershed in hainan province china zhao 2011 and zhao et al 2011 developed a simple nitrogen soil erosion phosphorus transport model and coupled it to the xinanjiang model xaj np to assess various contributions of phosphorus fluxes to the water systems in the xitiaoxi catchment in china most of these models describe the mobilization of suspended solids ss particulate phosphorus pp and dissolved phosphorus dp in the soil layer and or groundwater and transportation through different pathways providing efficient tools to understand the temporal and spatial variations of phosphorus across a catchment however due to xinanjiang model s inability to account for the vertical variation of soil water content these nps pollutant models are all based on a simplified assumption of lumped soil water storage and pollutant concentration and fail to consider the impact of vertical heterogeneity of soil on the simulation results such oversimplified assumption may lead to inaccurate hydrological and pollution predictions since certain hydrological processes and pollutant movements such as erosion and plant absorption may occur in soil zones of different depth and are highly dependent on the water content to provide more reliable hydrological and pollution predictions to inform pollutant control and catchment management this work aims to improve xinanjiang model by incorporating robust approaches to account for the vertical variation of water content in soil the improved xinanjiang model is then further coupled with a physically based water quality model to more realistically predict the transport and transformation process of phosphorus the rest of the paper is organized as follows in the following section 2 the new xinanjiang water quality modelling framework and detailed methodology are introduced section 3 provides information about the study area and datasets required by the simulations section 4 presents the simulation results and discusses model uncertainty and parameter sensitivity and finally brief conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 methodology the coupled xinanjiang water quality modelling framework proposed in this work is illustrated in fig 1 summarizing the model components as well as the model inputs and outputs the basic data for model set up mainly consist of spatial data of the problem domain including digital elevation model dem and land use hydrological inputs such as precipitation and evapotranspiration and pollutant information that is related to agricultural settings land use soil texture and pollutant sources the modelling system is composed of two computational modules for estimating flow discharge and phosphorus dynamics respectively the outputs of the model are outflow discharge and total phosphorus tp concentration at the outlets of sub basins the calculation procedure and coupling method of these two modules are explained in the following sections 2 1 the improved xinanjiang model xinanjiang model is a lumped rainfall runoff model with four components evapotranspiration runoff generation runoff source partition and runoff routing zhao et al 1980 zhao 1992 evapotranspiration reduces soil moisture according to the watershed saturation excess runoff theory to calculate evapotranspiration the soil column is divided into three layers upper middle and lower runoff generation only occurs upon repletion of the tension water storage and the soil moisture storage capacity curve smscc is utilized to provide a non uniform distribution of tension water capacity in the hydrologic unit under consideration the generated runoff is then partitioned into surface runoff interflow and groundwater runoff the distribution of these three components can be decided using the free water capacity distribution curve finally the runoff contribution to the outflow of each sub basin is represented by a hydrograph unit or through a lag and routine technique the sub basins are connected by the muskingum routing method to represent the attenuation and translation effects of the channel system more details of xinanjiang hydrologic model can be found in zhao et al 1980 and zhao 1992 in the proposed modelling framework xinanjiang model is first improved by considering the horizontal and vertical heterogeneity of catchment characteristics and hydrological processes fig 2 horizontally the model is implemented to become fully distributed to take advantage of the widely available spatial datasets such as radar rainfall and remotely sensed land use land cover data the whole basin is divided into sub basins which are further divided into cells to represent the smallest computational units for rainfall runoff estimation through water balance to better consider vertical soil heterogeneity in each cell the soil column is divided into three layers i e upper 1st layer middle 2nd layer and bottom 3rd layer with different thicknesses as a result whilst evapotranspiration can be still calculated through the original modelling procedure runoff production and separation need to be treated differently at the upper layer when rainfall exceeds evapotranspiration the incoming flow exceeds the maximum infiltration capacity or soil moisture exceeds the maximum water content of the soil the excessive fraction of the water will become surface runoff rs and the rest will infiltrate into the upper soil layer as illustrated in fig 2 in each soil layer free water i e su sl sd is generated until the soil moisture i e wu wl wd exceeds the soil moisture capacity i e wum wlm wdm which then infiltrates into the next layer i e fr 1 fr 2 fr 3 or becomes soil runoff i e sr 1 sr 2 sr 3 the water content of each layer i e θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 is the sum of soil moisture and free water content the amount of water infiltrates to the next soil layer is restricted by the maximum infiltration capacity and available space of the receiving soil soil runoff is the portion of the excessive water determined by runoff coefficients the surface runoff and soil runoffs from each of the cells may carry dissolved phosphorus and particulate phosphorus which will be routed to the outlet of each sub basin and then to the outlet of main basin following the same method as in the original xinanjiang model 2 2 water quality model to consider the horizontal and vertical heterogeneity water quality model is developed to be fully distributed to maintain consistency with the improved xinanjiang model furthermore the grid based water quality model also divides the soil column in each grid into three layers phosphorus transported by runoff through connected grid cells will be converged to the outlet of sub basins that are connected by channel systems therefore in this model the movement of phosphorus may be split into three phases process within a grid cell moving into sub basin outlet and transport in river channels fig 3 2 2 1 phosphorus process within a grid cell as shown in fig 4 within each grid cell the simulated phosphorus pools can be divided into immobile pools and mobile pools immobile pools include the organic phosphorus with a long turnover time slowp a short turnover time fastp and particulate phosphorus absorbed by soil particles partp mobile pools involve eroded particulate phosphorus pp and soluble phosphorus sp the sum of pp and sp gives the total phosphorus tp at each time step non point source pollutants are added to the model as the sources of phosphorus taking into account its spatial and temporal variability then the transformation processes between different phosphorus pools are simulated but only sp can transport vertically together with the infiltrated water flow the lost phosphorus includes the eroded pp the sp uptake by plants and the mobile phosphorus transported into rivers 2 2 2 sources of phosphorus the sources of phosphorus in each grid cell include applied inorganic and organic fertilizers plant residues depending on the crop type fertilizer application and atmospheric deposition on different land use types inorganic f fertsp i i 1 2 and organic fertilizers f fertfastp i i 1 2 are added to the sp pools in the top two soil layers at the specified days when fertilizers are applied and are spread equally over several days to account for uncertainties and spatial variation of the exact fertilizer application time plant residues are returned to the top two soil layers on specific days during which the nutrient contents of the residues are added to the fastp and the slowp pools f plantfastp i f plantslowp i i 1 2 atmospheric deposition is divided into dry deposition f deppp and wet deposition f depsp the dry deposition settles to the pp pools in the surface soil and the soluble wet deposition is added to and infiltrated through the soil as a concentration of sp in precipitation 2 2 3 transformation phosphorus transformation includes degradation solubilization and adsorption desorption which happens in all three soil layers phosphorus is released from the slowp pool to the fastp pool through degradation processes phosphorus in fastp pool is subject to solubilization to be transferred into the sp pool the transfer of phosphorus between the sp and partp pools occurs through the adsorption and desorption processes an equilibrium sorption concentration of phosphorus in the soil is iteratively calculated from the total phosphorus in the two pools using the freundlich sorption isotherm the three transformation processes may be described as 1 f degp i p degp x slowp i f t soil f θ i d t 2 f solp i p spolp x

through erosion and plant uptake during a rainfall event phosphorus attached to the soil particles in the upper layer may be displaced by rainfall and transported by overland flow particulate p losses from land to watercourses are assumed to occur solely due to erosion of soil particles containing phosphorus the erosion loss of phosphorus is represented in the model through detachment and transport processes detachment is simulated using revised morgan morgan finney model morgan 2001 sediments on the ground surface are detached by rain splash and surface runoff the amount of sediment detached by raindrops is related to soil detachability rainfall kinetic energy and the ratio of vegetation cover surface runoff detachment is determined by a function of flow discharge slope steepness bed friction and percentage of bare soil then the detachment of particulate p is deduced from the detached sediment and the total p content of the slow p and part p pools once detached pp is transported to a landscape storage pool with the overland flow and the amount of detached pp transported to the pool determined by the transport capacity of the flow due to the filtering effects of soil vegetation and other ground features part of particulate phosphorus will be deposited on the ground surface whilst the rest is transported to the linked river channels as equation 4 and equation 5 4 f

uptake of nutrients follows the logistic uptake functions with the phosphorus uptake assumed to be proportional to nitrogen uptake actual uptake only occurs between the sowing date the start of the crop growing season and the harvest date the end of the growing season uptake during the main growing season is limited only by the availability of nutrients autumn sown crops are also limited by a temperature function to account for the less favorite growing conditions during this time of the year the plant uptake is calculated by 6 f putp i m i n p pnrat α put d t 0 8 x sp i where f putp i k g

water flow the soluble phosphorus is assumed to be fully mixed in each soil layer before infiltration and runoff generation occur with regard to vertical transport through infiltration the amount of phosphorus transported into next soil may be calculated as 7 f infsp i fr i c sp sr i 1 fr i c sp i 1 i 2 3 where f infsp i k g m 2 is the sp transported into layer i fr i m m is the infiltration to

transport of phosphorous to rivers phosphorus is transported by different types of runoffs from the upstream grid cells to the outlet of each sub basin to form the outflow of sub basin into rivers using the lag and route method as the improved xinanjiang model the parameters involved in this calculation process are p ks p ku p kl and p k g representing the recession coefficients of phosphorus in surface runoff upper soil runoff middle soil runoff and groundwater runoff respectively 2 2 8 phosphorus in rivers in river channels phosphorus from the sub basin outlets is routed to the final basin outlet through advection diffusion and deposition during this process phosphorus may be further mixed with industrial domestic and livestock wastes that are discharged into the rivers through drainage systems the governing equation of phosphorus transport in rivers is given as 16 c sp v riv t u riv c sp v riv x x d c sp v riv x f pointsp t 17 c pp v riv t u riv c pp v riv x x d c pp v riv

water quality model is illustrated in fig 5 at the beginning of a simulation the soil condition is initialized according to land use information then at each time step the water flow and phosphorus concentration are calculated in each grid cell along the pathways to sub basin outlets and inside rivers after that the overall flow discharge and tp concentration are produced and written to the output files as part of the current study model performance evaluation model parameter sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are also conducted to evaluate the model performance the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient is calculated through 19 nse 1 1 n q m i q o i 1 n q m i q o where n is the total number of time steps q o i denotes an observation measured value q m i is the corresponding model prediction and q o is the mean value of observations nse returns a value ranging from to 1 with nse 1 indicating perfect agreement between model prediction and observation and nse 0 meaning the model predicts the mean observed value a negative nse is returned when the model prediction is worse than the observed mean for analyzing parameter sensitivity and model uncertainty the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method is adopted in this work glue is based on the estimation of weights or probabilities associated with different parameter sets the parameter set that produces the least errors good fit is usually associated with the highest likelihood function and probability the likelihood uncertainty level is calculated as 20 l θ i y 1 σ i 2 σ obs 2 where l is the likelihood measure of the i t h model simulation performed with parameter set θ i related to the measured process y and σ i and σ obs are respectively the error variances of the i t h model simulation and the observation a distribution function is obtained by rescaling the likelihood measures such that the sum of all likelihood values equals 1 the cumulative distribution and the prediction quantiles 95 and 5 confidence levels are used to assess the uncertainty level herein different sets of model parameters are used to generate simulation results and nse is adopted as the likelihood measure indicator regional sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the sensitivity of model parameters freer et al 1996 the parameter sets from the glue method are ranked according to the selected objective which is transformed to a likelihood value and then split into 10 groups for each group the likelihoods are normalized by dividing by their total and the cumulative frequency distribution is finally calculated and plotted if the model performance is sensitive to a particular parameter there will be a large difference between the cumulative frequency distributions i e the parameter has a significant effect on the model output 3 case study to test and demonstrate the new coupled xinanjiang water quality model for real world applications the 150 km2 tongyang river basin in the southeastern china fig 6 is considered and introduced in the following sub sections 3 1 the study area the tongyang river basin is predominated by transitional subtropical to warm temperate monsoon climate with an annual average temperature of 16 1 0 29 c and annual precipitation ranges from 750 to 1700 mm within the study area the tonghe river and yanghe river are the two principal rivers and the subsequent analysis pertains exclusively to these rivers the yellow brown soil and paddy soil are the two major soil types in this area the average soil organic matter som total nitrogen tn and tp concentrations in the soil are 2580 m g k g 1200 m g k g and 500 m g k g respectively lin et al 2021 the tongyang river is one of the most important inlets to the chaohu lake which is the fifth largest freshwater lake in china and plays a significant role in flood control water supply irrigation transportation fishery and tourism for the region but excessive disposal of industrial agricultural and domestic effluents makes the lake suffering from heavy eutrophication and harmful algal blooms since 1995 shang and shang 2007 it is important to better understand the hydrological processes and nutrient dynamics in this area especially the upstream feeding catchments to provide essential information to support water resources and ecosystems management for chaohu lake 3 2 data and model set up a digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 50 m 50 m was provided by chaohu catchment administration and made available by the nanjing institute of geography and limnology niglas chinese academy of sciences to support the following modelling exercises the dem is first used to analyze the topographic features of the catchment hydrological that influence the hydrological and pollutant transport processes e g slope based on simple hydrological analysis the basin may be divided into 24 subbasins other spatial data including land use information soil texture and population pop density are also available and resampled to the same resolution as the dem the soil texture data are acquired from open source song et al 2020 and the land use information and pop density are provided by chaohu catchment administration land use information is needed for initialization of phosphorus pools runoff generation calculation of nutrient uptake informing selection of crop management factors and estimation of atmospheric loads fig 7 in tongyang river basin about 27 6 of the basin is farmland which is mostly located along rivers and the soil texture for this type of land use is mainly loam about 5 9 of the basin area are urban areas mainly concentrating in the confluence of tonghe river and yanghe river other major land use types include 56 1 of bare land and 10 4 of surface water area soil texture data are open source and used to select erosion parameters song et al 2020 in this simulation the topsoil layer 5 cm is loam while second layer 40 cm and third layer 20 cm are clay loam precipitation and evaporation data are available for download from the government website http 61 191 22 157 tyfw infoquery hedao aspx rainfall data from 2019 to 2021 in the format of 4 hourly precipitation are available from the 5 rainfall stations in the basin to support hydrological simulations domestic wastewater agricultural pollutant and atmospheric deposition are considered in the simulations the diffuse pollution emission in the basin is estimated to be 0 8 m g l d per person the farming activity in the tongyang catchment follows a multi crop system with rapeseed and rice planting in rotation rice is planted in mid june and harvested in october rapeseed is sowed at the end of october and harvested between the end of may and beginning of june in the subsequent year according to the information from the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china the phosphorus loads from fertilizer is approximated as 1200 k g k m 2 for rapeseed lands and 450 k g k m 2 for rice fields the atmospheric deposited phosphorus rate is assumed to be 0 2 0 3 k g k m 2 d finally a summary of the input data for the coupled xinanjiang water quality model is given in table 1 4 results and discussion the coupled model is applied to the case study in tongyanghe river basin for predicting streamflow and total phosphorous concentration surveyed water discharge and water quality records measured at river gauges are available for model validation the measured data in the year of 2018 is used for model calibration period and those from 2019 to 2021 for model validation further simulations have also been performed to test the sensitivity of simulation results to key model parameters it should be noted that the river discharges were not directly measured but estimated from the water level records through established rating curves which are inevitably subject to uncertainty 4 1 model calibration and validation as previously mentioned model calibration and validation are achieved through reproducing three years of measurements between 2018 and 2021 in the case study site 4 1 1 hydrological simulation results fig 8 presents the discharge hydrographs produced by the improved xinanjiang model at the outlets of tonghe river and yanghe river for the model calibration and validation periods the nse calculated against the flow measurements in tonghe river gauge is respectively 0 54 and 0 22 during calibration and validation periods for yanghe river the nse is returned to be 0 92 for calibration and 0 58 for validation the simulation results capture the times to peaks well in comparison to the observations for example the serious flooding following an intense rainfall event in july 2020 is clearly captured by the simulation but the tonghe rive gauge was damaged during the event and failed to collect measurements for comparison they were restored after the event overall the simulation slightly overestimates the flow during the draught periods and the absolute errors predicted for the peak periods are relatively high but considering the data uncertainties associated with indirect measurements generated from rating curves and missing records the model results are considered to be satisfactory in both calibration and validation periods demonstrating the performance of the improved model in depicting baseflows and flood peaks 4 1 2 phosphorous simulation results fig 9 compares the predicted and measured monthly total phosphorus concentrations at the tonghe river and yanghe river outlets for both the calibration and validation periods the calculated nse values are 0 13 for calibration and 0 40 for validation in the tonghe river for yanghe river the nse is returned to be 0 53 for calibration and 0 17 for validation the relatively low nse returned from the tonghe river calibration results is related to one of the big challenges of nps pollution modelling i e the challenge in reproducing gauge observations of pollutant concentration that are sensitive to nearby environments and pollutant loads sources the current model assumes pollutants are fully mixed in the river flow and it is difficult for the model to accurately simulate pollutant concentrations with unseen pollutant sources the low nse calculated for the validation period in the yanghe river may be attributed to human activities during the july 2020 flood a range of human interventions were implemented in the simulation area such as installing sandbag barriers and channel dredging furthermore the fertilizer time and amount were also affected by the major flood event but the water quality model is not able to account for these interventions prior to the flood event the nse values for the tonghe river and yanghe river are 0 44 and 0 40 respectively which is satisfactory for pollution modelling the simulation results for tp show a pronounced seasonal variation which is consistent with the observed high tp loads in the rainy seasons a higher tp concentration is also predicted during the early growing season of rice in late june when a large amount of chemical fertilizer and organic manures are applied furthermore the variation of phosphorus load between wet and dry years is correctly captured by the model overall the modelled tp concentration is observed to comply with rainfall patterns but due to the relatively long observation interval data during certain intensive rainfall periods may not be included to provide a reliable dataset for more rigorous model calibration and validation considering the uncertainty associated with the observation data the modelling results are as a whole considered to be acceptable 4 2 model sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to systematically assess the performance of the current new model a total of 1 000 parameter sets consisting of 10 hydrological parameters and 9 water quality parameters are randomly generated using a monte carlo sampling method within their respective value ranges to support simulations of hydrological and pollution processes between 2018 and 2021 4 2 1 hydrological model table 2 lists the 10 parameters for the improved xinanjiang model it is worth pointing out that the free water contents of each soil layer were not included in the original xinanjiang model and their values are considered to be 30 40 of the maximum soil water storage 4 2 1 1 model uncertainty for streamflow prediction based on the simulated river flows the envelope of 5 and 95 likelihood weighted quantiles green area is plotted against the observed time series red scatter in fig 10 it is clearly shown that most observed discharge values are contained within the calculated uncertainty bounds indicating that the improved model can reliably predict the observed hydrographs the simulation uncertainty during the flood periods is found to be higher than that of base flow periods although both are acceptable the overall model uncertainty qualitatively and quantitatively is considered to be acceptable for such a long term simulation including both rainfall flooding process and dry seasons 4 2 1 2 parameter sensitivity for streamflow prediction fig 11 presents the sensitivity plots for the stream flow simulation results it is acknowledged that in the original xinanjiang model c s surface runoff recession constant s m areal free water storage capacity of surface soil and w m mean area tension water capacity are revealed to be more important in the model calibration for water balance and runoff routing c s is important in controlling the flood peak discharge value and duration while s m and w m influence surface runoff generation in the improved xinanjiang model cs is also detected to be the most sensitive parameter for the same reason but fc infiltration capacity takes the place of s m and w m to become a key parameter influencing surface runoff generation this is because surface runoff occurs when the total precipitation exceeds the storage of the topsoil layer in the original model while in the current model runoff is restricted by soil infiltration capacity newly introduced parameters including kg daily groundwater coefficient and ku daily upper soil layer water coefficient that decide the interflow source partition and c l daily interflow recession coefficient of the middle layer that controls the lag and route process of the thickest soil layer are also found to have a major influence on flow prediction during a simulation ffig from the sensitivity analysis for the 10 model parameters the best performing sets of each parameter group are selected and the cumulative distribution is calculated the parameter ranges are split into 10 bins with the associated gradient calculated for each of them the best parameters identified by examining the cumulative distribution and gradients are listed in table 2 which are then used to support water quality modelling more details can be found in fig 15 of the appendix 3 4 2 2 water quality modelling table 3 lists the 8 parameters considered to analyze model uncertainty and sensitivity for water quality modelling these model parameters are divided into 3 groups and classified as recession coefficients and erosion parameters the recession constants p ks p ku and p kl are closely related to hydrological processes as pollutants are transported by water flows equilibrium concentration parameters p frco and p frex are related to the existence form of phosphorus the erosion parameters p erodp p coh and p erod are more related to soil texture which is loam in the current simulation area song et al 2020 4 2 2 1 model uncertainty for water quality modelling the envelopes of 5 and 95 likelihood weighted quantiles from the 1000 simulations green area are plotted against the observed tp concentrations red scatter in fig 12 for both rivers most of the observed tp concentration values are contained within the calculated uncertainty bounds except the data during second half of 2019 where the numerical prediction is obviously overestimated the model uncertainty is relatively higher during the flood periods than the dry seasons but the overall variation pattern is consistent with observation showing that the basic trend of concentration fluctuation can be properly simulated by the model even with uncalibrated parameters to accurately capture the peak tp concentrations it is necessary to carefully select the model parameters through model calibration however the current dataset has a monthly observation interval and may not catch all concentration peaks as happened in the real world and the observation data may contain certain level of uncertainty based on this having a small amount of observed data outside the simulation bounds is considered to be acceptable in this study 4 2 2 2 parameter sensitivity analysis for water quality modelling the results of glue based parameter sensitivity analysis are presented in fig 13 and fig 14 among three groups of model parameters recession coefficients are found to be most influential on the simulation results followed by hydrological parameters for the recession coefficient group p ks is the most influential parameter followed by p kl based on the analysis the sensitive parameters mainly cause simulation uncertainty during the flood periods when insoluble particulate phosphorus is washed off by rainfall and surface runoff and soluble phosphorus is transported by overland and subsurface flows p ks and p kl defined respectively as the pollutant recession coefficients in surface runoff and middle soil layer control the phosphorus concentration peak and duration surface runoff is commonly much stronger than soil runoffs during a flood period the middle soil layer is the thickest and therefore possesses the maximum streamflow among the three soil layers therefore there is no doubt that p ks is the most important parameter affecting the simulation accuracy whilst p kl also has an impact as expected the simulation results are not sensitive to the other two types of parameters which may be because the tp concentration in river is restricted by the sediment transport capacity of the river flow the best 10 parameter ranges of water quality model parameters are shown in fig 16 and summarized in table 3 it is interesting to see that the range of p ks and of cs is very close indicating that phosphorus has similar fate and pathway as the underlying water flow although they are found to be less sensitive than the recession constants the sensitivity of hydrological parameters is nonnegligible especially wlm averaged soil moisture storage capacity of the lower layer kg daily groundwater coefficient and ku daily upper soil layer water coefficient wlm determines the water content in the lower soil layer which can also be called root zone therefore wlm is vital for plant growth and decides the amount of pollutant uptake by crops from fig 14 the simulation results show a poor performance when wlm is less than 65 mm indicating that the water content in this soil layer is lower than 16 and not suitable for rice to grow kg and ku are also important in flow discharge modelling which control the base flow discharge as soluble phosphorus transported into the subbasin outlet by base flow during a dry period and the tp concentration uncertainty is relatively small during this period the effects of these two factors are relatively minor table 2 lists the best hydrological parameter ranges derived from the sensitivity analysis for the current case study with further details provided in fig 17 of the appendix except kg and kl other hydrological parameters do not show noticeable influences on the simulation results of tp concentration the parameter ranges of kg and kl are consistent with those concluded from hydrological simulations 5 conclusions in this study the xinanjiang model is first improved by considering the vertical heterogeneity of water content and runoff in soil which is then coupled with a water quality model to form a new coupled hydrological water quality modelling system compared with the existing nps pollution models the new coupled modelling systems has two highlights 1 the improved xinanjiang model can provide more accurate and detailed information for pollutant prediction due to consideration of the vertical heterogeneity of soil and 2 with the availability of detailed water content and flow discharge in each soil layer the processes related to soil depth such as soil erosion and plant adsorption can be more properly simulated making the model to have the potential of separately determining the contributions of nps pollutants from baseflow and surface flow at the watershed scale the model simulations and following uncertainty and sensitivity analyses in the case study of tongyang river basin have led to the following conclusions after calibration the model is validated to provide reasonable prediction of streamflow and tp concentration at the tonghe and yanghe catchment outlets the model uncertainty for both streamflow and phosphorus concentration predictions is found to be higher during the flood periods than dry seasons the hydrological simulation results are found to be sensitive to parameters c s fc kg and ku with cs being the most influential parameter for flood peak and duration predictions p ks is the most influential water quality parameter controlling the arrival time and duration of peak nutrient concentration besides the range of best 10 p ks is similar to c s showing the pollutants follow the same pathway as the water flow during a simulation p kl is also non neglectable but other parameters are found to be less influential on the results erosion related parameters may be selected according to soil texture the model is only applied to and tested in one case study site in this work due to limited access to data the capability of the model for application outside the calibration conditions and in un gauged catchments should be demonstrated and confirmed in the future credit

1859,to achieve carbon neutrality and the united nations sustainable development goals the energy system is transitioning to renewable energy hydropower is one of the main forms of renewable energy but it is significantly affected by the climate anomalies such as droughts here we define energy droughts as the periods where daily developed hydropower potential dhp is below the 20th percentile of its daily climatology at each hydropower plant and analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics over the yangtze river basin yrb based on the high resolution hydrological simulations over 67 hydropower plants in the yrb by using the re calibrated pcr globwb model we find that there are about 10 energy droughts per year during 2007 2021 the mean duration is 7 days event and the dhp is reduced by 26 during energy droughts compared with winter there are more energy droughts in summer but with shorter durations the interannual variation of energy droughts is closely associated with el niño southern oscillation enso affected by strong la niña energy droughts increased during 2008 2009 and 2011 2012 the propagation from meteorological droughts to energy droughts takes up to 4 7 days for most plants and around 31 of the energy drought and meteorological drought events occur simultaneously specifically the accumulated energy deficit during the extreme energy drought in the summer of 2022 has a return period of 52 years and the risk will be further increased by 88 1 2 under the ssp585 scenario in the future this study suggests the need to understand the change of energy droughts for hydropower management and the urgency for climate change adaptation for a more stable hydropower supply keywords hydropower energy drought pcr globwb enso climate change data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction towards achieving the sustainable development goals e g sdg vii affordable and clean energy gielen et al 2019 and mitigating climate change matthews et al 2009 meinshausen et al 2009 the energy transition from fossil fuels to clean energy sources is under way international energy agency 2020 hydroelectric power offers a wide range of applications due to its high flexibility and potential for development which plays an important role in achieving carbon neutrality there are abundant hydroelectric resources in the yangtze river basin yrb in china with an annual water resource of approximately 996 billion cubic meters and a fall of 5400 m the potential installed capacity is 281 000 mw and the annual power generation is 1 30 trillion kwh accounting for a large portion of the nation s total power in particular six giant cascading power plants e g the largest hydropower plant in the world the three gorges dam constructed in the yrb constitute the world s largest clean energy corridor hydropower from the yrb could provide high quality reliable and stable power to central china east china and south china and plays an important role in implementing the west east power supply as a major hydropower base in china the yrb is facing the challenge of energy risk with an undergoing transformation of its energy landscape international energy agency 2020 hydropower could be affected by meteorological and hydrological conditions particularly extreme events such as floods and droughts madani and lund 2009 in recent years extreme events occur frequently under climate change wasko et al 2021 yuan et al 2017 many countries including china have experienced varying degrees of constraints on electricity supply ahmed et al 2012 cannon et al 2015 tarroja et al 2018 in july and august 2022 the yrb encountered a record breaking meteorological drought limited by the hydropower generation sichuan province a large hydropower province in china experienced a serious power shortage to ensure that enough electricity is available to the public many enterprises have limited power supply or even stopped production which affected economic production seriously therefore understanding the effect of drought on hydropower generation could provide a guideline for ensuring energy security during extreme events in the past decade most research on renewable energy mainly focuses on the short term analysis of wind cannon et al 2015 ohlendorf and schill 2020 and solar power kumler et al 2019 rinaldi et al 2021 generation in europe and the united states raynaud et al 2018 analyzed energy drought characteristics of hydropower wind power and solar power generation across 12 regions of europe which reveals significant differences in drought event characteristics among various power sources however they only analyzed the characteristics of energy drought and overlooked the impact of climate change and corresponding risk changes to date most studies have focused on the long term hydropower generation changes in the yrb for example liu et al 2016 used several global hydrological models ghms to simulate the developed hydropower potential dhp and project future changes other studies feng et al 2018 qin et al 2020a 2020b zhao et al 2021 investigated the hydropower generation changes under future climate change scenarios over upper yrb however the short term energy drought events which may lead to short term power shortages and affect the reliability of power generation were ignored the characteristics e g frequency duration and severity of the low hydropower events have not been well analyzed either the reduced production of renewable energy in a short term is greatly affected by meteorological conditions françois 2016 françois et al 2016 handschy et al 2017 ohlendorf and schill 2020 raynaud et al 2018 rinaldi et al 2021 van der wiel et al 2019 weber et al 2019 especially with the increase of drought risk in china yuan et al 2019 yuan et al 2017 it is necessary to consider the impact of meteorological factors on energy conversion bloomfield et al 2016 conway et al 2015 ravestein et al 2018 françois 2016 highlighted a non linear relation between the north atlantic oscillation nao and the renewable energy penetration rates and ng et al 2017 found most dams in the world exhibit statistically significant inter annual variations of energy production under the influence of enso climate variability has been proven to have an impact on energy production conway et al 2015 françois 2016 ng et al 2017 moreover climate change affects meteorological and hydrological drought risk across scales yuan et al 2019 which further suggests a need to assess the impact of climate change on the risk of energy droughts for hydropower a major challenge in hydropower production in the yrb is to cope with periods of low energy production and the purpose of this study is to use hydro meteorological knowledge to interpret energy droughts of hydropower hydropower generation is vulnerable to climate change and extreme hydrometeorological events identifying energy drought events can inform low production risks associated with extreme weather events and guide energy deployment in the yangtze river basin in addition hydropower can integrate wind and solar power through flexible generation to transform energy structures understanding the characteristics of short term hydropower shortages is crucial for renewable energy production and power system reliability thus it is necessary to clarify the characteristics of energy drought for hydropower and the corresponding meteorological factors as well as the changes of drought risks in the future the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study area and data section 3 describes the pcr globwb hydrological model and the energy drought definition the results are presented in section 4 and section 5 and section 6 give the corresponding discussions and conclusions respectively 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area is the yrb 90 33 122 25 e 24 30 35 45 n fig 1 with an area of 1 8 million square kilometers accounting for about 1 5 of china s total land area the yrb stores a large amount of potential water energy and the storage in the upper yangtze above yichang station accounts for roughly 80 of the basin s total reserves this study focuses on 67 small to large hydropower plants table 1 on the mainstream and tributaries in the yrb which were put into operation before 2007 red triangles in fig 1 their installed capacities vary between 0 5 mw and 23 000 mw among which six major hydropower plants have an installed capacity of more than 1240 mw fig 1 also depicts the locations of seven mainstream hydrological stations and two tributary hydrological stations used for hydrological model calibration these hydrological stations located in the upper middle and lower reaches of the yrb can represent the hydrological characteristics of the yrb with long term observational records for model calibration and validation 2 2 data the historical hydrological simulations from january 1979 to september 2022 and future projections from january 2023 to december 2100 were conducted using the pcr globwb hydrological model to drive the pcr globwb model meteorological data including surface air temperature precipitation and reference potential evapotranspiration ep 0 were needed the ep 0 refers to the evaporation under well watered conditions of a reference crop crop height of 0 12 m a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 van beek et al 2011 i e reference crop evapotranspiration xiang et al 2020 based on the temperature forcing data ep 0 is directly calculated by the model according to the hamon potential evapotranspiration equation from 1979 to 2018 the daily temperature and precipitation observations were derived from the china meteorological forced data set cmfd he et al 2020 https data tpdc ac cn zh hans while the data from 2019 to 2022 were derived from the fifth generation reanalysis data era5 hersbach et al 2020 which were bias corrected according to the cmfd data the cmfd data with 0 1 resolution and era5 data with 0 25 resolution were regridded into 5 arcmins using a bilinear interpolation method the reference potential evapotranspiration could be estimated in pcr globwb based on the hamon equation other datasets including land surface and water use data were obtained from the global data sets of the pcr globwb 2 0 model sutanudjaja et al 2018 which were available at https geo data uu nl research pcrglobwb pcr globwb gmd paper sutanudjaja et al 2018 in addition the historical 1979 2022 and future 2023 2100 daily surface air temperature and precipitation data from 20 cmip6 models https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 table 2 were also regridded into 5 arcmins and used to drive the hydrological model previous studies stated that cmip6 models perform well in simulating surface air temperature and precipitation in the yrb li et al 2021 liu et al 2021 yue et al 2021 the future projections under two shared socio economic pathways i e ssp245 and ssp585 with different warming trends were selected the ssps represent the possible alternative trend of social and ecosystem evolution over century timescales o neill et al 2014 ssp245 and ssp585 represent scenarios with business as usual and high emissions respectively ssp585 combines the higher radiative forcing 8 5 w m2 with the fossil fueled development socioeconomic pathway while ssp245 uses the 4 5 w m2 radiative forcing and a moderate development socioeconomic pathway moreover the monthly streamflow observations at 9 hydrological stations fig 1 from 2003 to 2019 were derived from the hydrological yearbook the information on the 67 reservoirs in this study came from global reservoir and dam database grand lehner et al 2011 and a new global hydropower database ghd established by wan et al 2021 the oceanic niño index oni is the 3 month moving average sst anomaly in the eastern tropical pacific 5 n 5 s 170 w 120 w which is available at https ggweather com enso oni htm for a fully developed el niño warm or la niña cold the oni must exceed 0 5 c or 0 5 c for at least five consecutive months 3 methodology 3 1 pcr globwb 2 0 model the pcr globwb 2 0 model sutanudjaja et al 2018 can simulate daily hydrological processes over lands at a high spatial resolution to consider the effects of reservoir operations on water availability a forward looking reservoir operation scheme which is directly implemented in the routing module is included in the pcr globwb model the overall regulation is to determine the target storage and reservoir releases given the forecasted inflow and downstream water demand de graaf et al 2014 as well as the purpose of the reservoir for water supply flood control hydropower etc the 67 yrb reservoirs from grand datasets lehner et al 2011 are gradually incorporated into the model based on their year of operation 3 2 hydrological model calibration sutanudjaja et al 2018 have calibrated the pcr globwb parameters for global application however to better simulate the runoff in the yrb the model needs to be further calibrated in this study we re calibrated six parameters including minimum soil water capacity wmin reference potential evapotranspiration ep 0 minimum soil thickness hmin soil rated hydraulic conductivity ksat1 ksat2 and base flow decay coefficient j based on the pcr globwb model calibration method proposed by sutanudjaja et al 2014 and lópez lópez et al 2017 each parameter was adjusted by multiplying the default parameter for each grid with a spatially uniform pre factor table 3 other parameters of the pcr globwb model were fixed as in sutanudjaja et al 2018 the pcr globwb model was calibrated and validated using monthly streamflow observed at 9 hydrological stations fig 1 the period of this study 1979 2022 was divided into two sub periods the simulations before 2007 were used to spin up the model to achieve its dynamic stability and the simulations during 2007 2022 were used for the subsequent analysis to evaluate the performance of model simulation the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse was used which is defined as 1 nse 1 t 1 t x t y t 2 t 1 t x t y 2 where x t and y t represent observed and simulated streamflow data respectively y is the average value of observations and t is the total time length t is a time step 3 3 index for hydropower potential developed hydropower potential dhp is defined as the maximum possible hydropower generation of the plant rather than the actual hydropower generation dhp can be obtained according to the reservoir information e g location storage capacity dam height and ihc which is calculated as 2 dhp min rm h g i h c where rm is the daily reservoir discharge h is the water head g is the gravitational acceleration 9 8 m2 s and ihc is the installed capacity of the hydropower plant the reservoir storage sm 1 m3 is calculated by the given prescribed reservoir discharge rm 3 s m 1 s m q m r m δ t q wm a m where q m is the expected daily inflow q wm is the forecasted net gain or loss m d 1 over the reservoir surface area a m2 the relationship between the reservoir storage volume s m3 water head h m and the surface area in the pcr globwb model are referred to liebe et al 2005 in which the reservoir volume is represented by an inverted pyramid shape after the calculation of rm the water head h m can be determined as liebe et al 2005 4 h 6 s f 2 3 where f is a dimensionless constant 3 4 definition of energy droughts the daily dhp series was used to identify the energy drought of hydropower specifically the dhp for each calendar day was first converted into a percentile based onthe data during 2007 2021 to ensure the sample size of the data for each calendar day the dhp series was expanded to a 3 day sample using data from one day on either side of the specific day while a 2 day sample for the first and last days of a year an energy drought occurs when the dhp percentile falls below 20 for several consecutive days each red part in fig 2 is an energy drought event note that the 20 threshold is based on the corresponding climatology so it is different for each day based on the definition we further examined the characteristics of energy drought e g duration frequency and severity fig 2 the duration of drought is the number of days between its start and end dates and drought frequency is expressed by the number of drought events per month or year the severity of energy drought is measured by energy deficit i e the accumulative difference between climatological mean dhp and the dhp during an energy drought event in addition taking the difference between daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration p pet as the factor of meteorological conditions we adopted the same definition of energy drought to identify the dry spell of p pet namely meteorological drought 4 results 4 1 evaluation of pcr globwb model simulation due to the availability of data the performance of pcr globwb model is evaluated on a monthly time scale from 2003 to 2019 through re calibration the optimal pre factors are fw 1 fe 1 25 fh 1 25 fk1 0 fk2 0 and fj 0 respectively fig 3 shows the time series of the monthly streamflow simulations and observations at 9 hydrological stations in the yrb it can be observed that the simulated streamflow after calibration is more consistent with the observations and the simulation of peak flow events is also improved before calibration nse is between 0 38 and 0 75 among the nine stations while after calibration the nse increases to 0 54 0 81 table 4 among them the nse of yichang and datong stations which are located downstream of the yrb is the highest in general the improvement of nse shows that the calibrated pcr globwb model can better simulate the hydrological process in the yrb the distributions of the daily average dhp of 67 hydropower plants in the yrb are shown in fig 4 the total daily dhp from the 67 plants in the yrb is 27909 mw with distinct spatial variability a super hydropower plant the three gorges dam with a daily average dhp of 15423 mw accounting for 55 of the total dhp in the yrb is located in the upper reaches in addition three hydropower plants i e ertan gezhouba and wuqiangxi with dhps greater than 1000 mw and six hydropower plants i e gongzui laoyingyan wujiangdu geheyan zhexi and danjiangkou with dhps greater than 500 mw are also distributed in the upper reaches most of the small hydroelectric power plants are located in the middle and lower reaches of the yrb 4 2 analysis of energy drought characteristics fig 5 a c e shows the annual average frequency duration and severity of hydropower energy droughts in the yrb it can be seen that 62 of the hydropower plants have a drought frequency of 5 15 events year in the yrb among them the annual average numbers of energy droughts in the three gorges hydropower plant ihc 22500 mw the ertan hydropower plant ihc 3300 mw on the yalong river and the gongzui hydropower plant ihc 2100 mw on the dadu river are 10 5 12 4 and 25 times respectively frequent energy droughts in these large hydropower plants may pose a big challenge to the stability of hydropower generation in the yrb the mean duration of energy droughts also varies greatly among the 67 hydropower plants from relatively shorter consecutive days 5 days to extremely long periods lasting for nearly one month fig 5c plants with a mean drought duration of 5 10 days event account for 45 of total plants and the mean duration of gaoyan hydropower plants on the xiangjiang river is 24 days event there is a non linear relationship between energy drought frequency and duration specifically for hydropower plants with a drought frequency greater than 15 events year the mean drought duration is generally 5 days event however as the drought frequency decreases the drought duration increases slowly the energy drought severity of hydropower largely depends on the capacity of the hydropower plant the drought severities of most small hydropower plants ihc 100 mw are 100 mw event whereas the severities for large and medium hydropower plants ihc 1000 mw could reach approximately 1000 10 000 mw event for example the drought severities at ertan and gongzui hydropower plants are 1458 mw event and 1236 mw event respectively and the severity at the three gorges hydropower plant is even up to 9360 mw event in other words the mean energy deficits of ertan gongzui and the three gorges dam account for 17 14 and 19 of the dhp of these hydropower plants during the energy droughts respectively for the whole basin energy drought occurs on average 10 times per year with a duration of 54 days year the annual total drought severity of hydropower plants is 304115 mw year accounting for about 26 of the yrb dhp during droughts as shown in fig 5 b more energy droughts are observed during the summer june to august than during the winter december to february while the duration in winter is longer than that in summer fig 5d the mean duration of energy drought is about 7 2 days month with the shortest duration in may and the longest duration in january fig 5d the energy drought severity in the yrb also shows seasonal variation with the least severity in february and the largest severity in october fig 5f 4 3 interannual variations of energy drought and its response to meteorological drought energy production is highly vulnerable to climate variability el niño southern oscillation enso is the primary driving factor of interannual variability that determines droughts and floods over many regions across the globe including the yrb shan et al 2018 zhang et al 2007 but its influence on energy drought is illustrated in the anomalies of local meteorological conditions including precipitation and temperature therefore this study analyzes the impact of enso on energy drought as well as propagation from meteorological drought to energy drought fig 6 a depicts the interannual variations of the characteristics of energy droughts in the yrb from 2007 to 2021 the frequency and duration of energy droughts have strong interannual variations showing an increase in 2017 2021 after a decrease in 2007 2017 the severity is largest in 2011 and smallest in 2017 el niño and la niña events can cause regional flooding and drought conditions including the yangtze river basin so it is possible to connect enso and the energy droughts fig 6 b plots the oni index with the time series of energy drought frequency in yrb the correlation coefficients between the oni index and drought frequency duration are analyzed for a lag period of 0 12 months significant negative correlations are observed between enso and 9 month lagged energy drought frequency and duration with correlation coefficients of 0 47 p 0 01 and 0 48 p 0 01 respectively affected by moderate and strong el niño in 2009 2010 and 2015 2016 the frequency of energy drought decreased during 2010 and fewer energy droughts occurred in 2016 2017 compared to the multi year average on the contrary affected by strong la niña in 2007 2008 and 2010 2011 more energy droughts occurred in 2008 2009 and 2011 2012 respectively this indicates that the enso has a precursory effect on the occurrence of the energy drought event over the yrb and a stronger la niña generally suggests a more severe energy drought in the next year to investigate the relationship between meteorological droughts and energy droughts we focused on the drought lag times over 16 major hydropower plants based on their ihc table 1 we defined the meteorological drought by adopting the same definition of energy drought to identify the dry spell of p pet using the run theory the meteorological and energy drought events of 16 hydropower plants from 2007 to 2021 were identified fig 7 shows the number of days that the energy drought events lag behind the meteorological droughts it is observed that the average lag times are similar among major hydropower plants where energy droughts lag behind meteorological droughts for 4 7 days around 31 of the energy drought events and meteorological drought events occurred simultaneously and 83 of energy drought events lagged behind meteorological droughts for 10 days 4 4 analysis of energy drought in the summer of 2022 and its future risk the recent multi year la niña caused a serious drought event over the yrb in the summer of 2022 leading to electrical overloads in sichuan a province that relies on hydropower for approximately 80 of its energy supply we find that the total energy drought severity of all the hydropower plants is 1 9 105mw from july to august 2022 which is 7 times of the average severity in the summer of 2007 2021 a frechet generalized extreme value gev distribution the shape parameter k 0 78 is chosen to fit drought severity with p 0 05 for the historical period the fitting result suggests that the 2022 yrb energy drought event is about a 1 in 52 year event over 2007 2021 climate in addition we also analyzed the future risk of such extreme drought events based on cmip6 climate model projections firstly the performance of the simulations from 20 cmip6 global climate models was evaluated by comparing the correlation and standard deviation between historical dhp simulations driven by cmip6 climate data and simulations driven by cmfd data 15 models with good historical performance were selected which excludes the canesm5 cnrm cm6 1 cnrm esm2 2 ipsl cm6a lr and ukesm1 0 ll in fig 8 a the choice of fitting functions was consistent with the choice in history and fig 8 b shows the cumulative distribution function cdf of energy drought severity during historical and future periods it can be seen that compared with the historical period energy droughts with the same severity will occur more frequently under both ssps scenarios the uncertainty of future drought risk is estimated through bootstrapping for 1000 times the return periods of extreme events like 2022 under ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios are 10 and 6 years and the future risks will increase by 80 2 4 and 88 1 2 respectively compared with the ssp245 the return period under the ssp585 is shorter suggesting the energy risks will become higher as global warming intensifies however the changes in future water use are not considered in the estimation which might cause uncertainty we believe the increasing drought risk could be alleviated with adaptive water resources managements energy drought is affected by meteorological drought global warming increases the evaporation potential further increasing the risk of energy drought yue et al 2021 projected that climate change would increase evapotranspiration in the yrb due to significant temperature increases and decreased precipitation particularly during the flood season from may to september which can reduce runoff and aggravate energy drought risk in addition the east asian summer monsoon easm has a significant impact on precipitation in china chen and yuan 2021 found that easm would strengthen in the warming future resulting in reduced precipitation in south china and more frequent droughts consequently the yrb would face increasingly severe energy drought risks in the future escalated with rising temperatures 5 discussion data and models may lead to uncertainty in our results firstly due to the differences between the gridded meteorological forcing data and on site observation data uncertainties may be introduced into the hydrological simulations second the pcr globwb model itself also has uncertainties in the simulations and parameter calibration there is uncertainty in the results of dhp simulation dhp is the maximum possible hydropower generation of all reservoirs in this study which is estimated based on reservoir characteristics such as location capacity dam height and ihc in comparison to the actual hydropower generation dhp is not affected by socio economic factors such as energy demand various water consumption etc however dhp has been widely used in many studies lehner et al 2005 gernaat et al 2017 liu et al 2016 meng et al 2020 liu et al 2016 used the reservoir information data of global reservoirs and dams grand to study the future changes in china s dhp most reservoirs are located in eastern china and south central china including the yrb this suggests that dhp could be a reasonable index for hydropower studies over yrb although the actual hydropower data and corresponding module should be incorporated to improve the assessment the reservoir regulation scheme plays a critical role in determining the research results unlike the traditional retrospective schemes that rely on historical runoff and demand data to optimize reservoir operation haddeland et al 2006 hanasaki et al 2006 pcr globwb adopts a prospective reservoir operation scheme that leverages forecast data sutanudjaja et al 2018 which is closer to the actual practices of reservoir operators van beek and bierkens 2009 however the pcr globwb model only distinguishes four types of reservoirs including irrigation flood control hydropower and shipping it does not distinguish between run of river and reservoir type hydropower plants which is needed in future research in addition to ensure the data adequacy and consistency in the number of reservoirs studied only the reservoirs put into operation before 2007 were selected for research despite the construction of several large hydropower plants in the upper reach of the yrb since 2007 such as xiluodu became operational in 2014 wudongde 2021 and baihetan 2022 which may affect the runoff pcr globwb directly implements prospective reservoir operation schemes into the routing model determining the target storage by comparing actual and predicted inflows and downstream demands to alleviate the influence of upstream reservoirs which is better than the retrospective schemes van beek et al 2011 future research should focus on the effect of cascade reservoir operation on the alleviation of the impact of extremes based on long term records of these newly built major hydropower plants furthermore future research should consider energy droughts within a broader spatiotemporal framework and the relationship between local and remote energy supply and demand among different regions furthermore the integration of multiple energy systems integration should be considered such as wind solar and so on to analyze energy droughts and their complementarities finally interdisciplinary researches based on climate impact are more conducive to the development and construction of energy systems 6 conclusions in this study we analyzed the characteristics i e frequency duration and severity of energy droughts for hydropower in the yrb based on streamflow simulations from the pcr globwb hydrological model and explored the main meteorological factors specifically the extreme energy drought event that occurred in the summer of 2022 and its future risks were also investigated we summarized the conclusions as follows 1 over the yrb there are on average 10 energy drought events per year and the mean duration is about 54 days year fig 5a b the total drought severity is 304115 mw year accounting for 26 of the dhp during energy droughts fig 5c 2 energy droughts could be influenced by enso and have a delayed response to meteorological droughts fig 6b and fig 7 in most hydropower plants energy drought is affected by the preceding meteorological drought by 4 7 days while 30 of energy drought events are affected by concurrent precipitation fig 7 3 in the summer of 2022 a record breaking energy drought event occurred in the yrb the total energy drought severity is 1 9 105mw which is estimated as a 1 in 52 year event over the historical period energy droughts would be more frequent and serious under both moderate and high emission scenarios in the future fig 8b an extreme energy drought event like 2022 will become a 1 in 10 year and 1 in 6 year event under ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios indicating that yrb will face more severe energy droughts in the future due to the global energy crisis and the increased need for renewable energy energy drought is a key issue for energy security and sustainable energy supply we suggest that hydropower availability can be predicted through indicators of the enso phenomenon which would help to identify vulnerable hotspots of global energy droughts in addition energy droughts have a close relationship with preceding meteorological conditions thus the results are expected to provide useful knowledge for improving hydropower management and energy drought control in the changing environment credit authorship contribution statement xinyue liu conceptualization methodology software writing original draft xing yuan conceptualization supervision

1859,to achieve carbon neutrality and the united nations sustainable development goals the energy system is transitioning to renewable energy hydropower is one of the main forms of renewable energy but it is significantly affected by the climate anomalies such as droughts here we define energy droughts as the periods where daily developed hydropower potential dhp is below the 20th percentile of its daily climatology at each hydropower plant and analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics over the yangtze river basin yrb based on the high resolution hydrological simulations over 67 hydropower plants in the yrb by using the re calibrated pcr globwb model we find that there are about 10 energy droughts per year during 2007 2021 the mean duration is 7 days event and the dhp is reduced by 26 during energy droughts compared with winter there are more energy droughts in summer but with shorter durations the interannual variation of energy droughts is closely associated with el niño southern oscillation enso affected by strong la niña energy droughts increased during 2008 2009 and 2011 2012 the propagation from meteorological droughts to energy droughts takes up to 4 7 days for most plants and around 31 of the energy drought and meteorological drought events occur simultaneously specifically the accumulated energy deficit during the extreme energy drought in the summer of 2022 has a return period of 52 years and the risk will be further increased by 88 1 2 under the ssp585 scenario in the future this study suggests the need to understand the change of energy droughts for hydropower management and the urgency for climate change adaptation for a more stable hydropower supply keywords hydropower energy drought pcr globwb enso climate change data availability data will be

high flexibility and potential for development which plays an important role in achieving carbon neutrality there are abundant hydroelectric resources in the yangtze river basin yrb in china with an annual water resource of approximately 996 billion cubic meters and a fall of 5400 m the potential installed capacity is 281 000 mw and the annual power generation is 1 30 trillion kwh accounting for a large portion of the nation s total power in particular six giant cascading power plants e g the largest hydropower plant in the world the three gorges dam constructed in the yrb constitute the world s largest clean energy corridor hydropower from the yrb could provide high quality reliable and stable power to central china east china and south china and plays an important role in implementing the west east power supply as a major hydropower base in china the yrb is facing the challenge of energy risk with an undergoing transformation of its energy landscape international energy agency 2020 hydropower could be affected by meteorological and hydrological conditions particularly extreme events such as floods and droughts madani and lund 2009 in recent years extreme events occur frequently under climate change wasko et al 2021 yuan et al 2017 many countries including china have experienced varying degrees of constraints on electricity supply ahmed et al 2012 cannon et al 2015 tarroja et al 2018 in july and august 2022 the yrb encountered a record breaking meteorological drought limited by the hydropower generation sichuan province a large hydropower province in china experienced a serious power shortage to ensure that enough electricity is available to the public many enterprises have limited power supply or even stopped production which affected economic production seriously therefore understanding the effect of drought on hydropower generation could provide a guideline for ensuring energy security during extreme events in the past decade most research on renewable energy mainly focuses on the short term analysis of wind cannon et al 2015 ohlendorf and schill 2020 and solar power kumler et al 2019 rinaldi et al 2021 generation in europe and the united states raynaud et al 2018 analyzed energy drought characteristics of hydropower wind power and solar power generation across 12 regions of europe which reveals significant differences in drought event characteristics among various power sources however they only analyzed the characteristics of energy drought and overlooked the impact of climate change and corresponding risk changes to date most studies have focused on the long term hydropower generation changes in the yrb for example liu et al 2016 used several global hydrological models ghms to simulate the developed hydropower potential dhp and project future changes other studies feng et al 2018 qin et al 2020a 2020b zhao et al 2021 investigated the hydropower generation changes under future climate change scenarios over upper yrb however the short term energy drought events which may lead to short term power shortages and affect the reliability of power generation were ignored the characteristics e g frequency duration and severity of the low hydropower events have not been well analyzed either the reduced production of renewable energy in a short term is greatly affected by meteorological conditions françois 2016 françois et al 2016 handschy et al 2017 ohlendorf and schill 2020 raynaud et al 2018 rinaldi et al 2021 van der wiel et al 2019 weber et al 2019 especially with the increase of drought risk in china yuan et al 2019 yuan et al 2017 it is necessary to consider the impact of meteorological factors on energy conversion bloomfield et al 2016 conway et al 2015 ravestein et al 2018 françois 2016 highlighted a non linear relation between the north atlantic oscillation nao and the renewable energy penetration rates and ng et al 2017 found most dams in the world exhibit statistically significant inter annual variations of energy production under the influence of enso climate variability has been proven to have an impact on energy production conway et al 2015 françois 2016 ng et al 2017 moreover climate change affects meteorological and hydrological drought risk across scales yuan et al 2019 which further suggests a need to assess the impact of climate change on the risk of energy droughts for hydropower a major challenge in hydropower production in the yrb is to cope with periods of low energy production and the purpose of this study is to use hydro meteorological knowledge to interpret energy droughts of hydropower hydropower generation is vulnerable to climate change and extreme hydrometeorological events identifying energy drought events can inform low production risks associated with extreme weather events and guide energy deployment in the yangtze river basin in addition hydropower can integrate wind and solar power through flexible generation to transform energy structures understanding the characteristics of short term hydropower shortages is crucial for renewable energy production and power system reliability thus it is necessary to clarify the characteristics of energy drought for hydropower and the corresponding meteorological factors as well as the changes of drought risks in the future the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study area and data section 3 describes the pcr globwb hydrological model and the energy drought definition the results are presented in section 4 and section 5 and section 6 give the corresponding discussions and conclusions respectively 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area is the yrb 90 33 122 25 e 24 30 35 45 n fig 1 with an area of 1 8 million square kilometers accounting for about 1 5 of china s total land area the yrb stores a large amount of potential water energy and the storage in the upper yangtze above yichang station accounts for roughly 80 of the basin s total reserves this study focuses on 67 small to large hydropower plants table 1 on the mainstream and tributaries in the yrb which were put into operation before 2007 red triangles in fig 1 their installed capacities vary between 0 5 mw and 23 000 mw among which six major hydropower plants have an installed capacity of more than 1240 mw fig 1 also depicts the locations of seven mainstream hydrological stations and two tributary hydrological stations used for hydrological model calibration these hydrological stations located in the upper middle and lower reaches of the yrb can represent the hydrological characteristics of the yrb with long term observational records for model calibration and validation 2 2 data the historical hydrological simulations from january 1979 to september 2022 and future projections from january 2023 to december 2100 were conducted using the pcr globwb hydrological model to drive the pcr globwb model meteorological data including surface air temperature precipitation and reference potential evapotranspiration ep 0 were needed the ep 0 refers to the evaporation under well watered conditions of a reference crop crop height of 0 12 m a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 van beek et al 2011 i e reference crop evapotranspiration xiang et al 2020 based on the temperature forcing data ep 0 is directly calculated by the model according to the hamon potential evapotranspiration equation from 1979 to 2018 the daily temperature and precipitation observations were derived from the china meteorological forced data set cmfd he et al 2020 https data tpdc ac cn zh hans while the data from 2019 to 2022 were derived from the fifth generation reanalysis data era5 hersbach et al 2020 which were bias corrected according to the cmfd data the cmfd data with 0 1 resolution and era5 data with 0 25 resolution were regridded into 5 arcmins using a bilinear interpolation method the reference potential evapotranspiration could be estimated in pcr globwb based on the hamon equation other datasets including land surface and water use data were obtained from the global data sets of the pcr globwb 2 0 model sutanudjaja et al 2018 which were available at https geo data uu nl research pcrglobwb pcr globwb gmd paper sutanudjaja et al 2018 in addition the historical 1979 2022 and future 2023 2100 daily surface air temperature and precipitation data from 20 cmip6 models https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 table 2 were also regridded into 5 arcmins and used to drive the hydrological model previous studies stated that cmip6 models perform well in simulating surface air temperature and precipitation in the yrb li et al 2021 liu et al 2021 yue et al 2021 the future projections under two shared socio economic pathways i e ssp245 and ssp585 with different warming trends were selected the ssps represent the possible alternative trend of social and ecosystem evolution over century timescales o neill et al 2014 ssp245 and ssp585 represent scenarios with business as usual and high emissions respectively ssp585 combines the higher radiative forcing 8 5 w m2 with the fossil fueled development socioeconomic pathway while ssp245 uses the 4 5 w m2 radiative forcing and a moderate development socioeconomic pathway moreover the monthly streamflow observations at 9 hydrological stations fig 1 from 2003 to 2019 were derived from the hydrological yearbook the information on the 67 reservoirs in this study came from global reservoir and dam database grand lehner et al 2011 and a new global hydropower database ghd established by wan et al 2021 the oceanic niño index oni is the 3 month moving average sst anomaly in the eastern tropical pacific 5 n 5 s 170 w 120 w which is available at https ggweather com enso oni htm for a fully developed el niño warm or la niña cold the oni must exceed 0 5 c or 0 5 c for at least five consecutive months 3 methodology 3 1 pcr globwb 2 0 model the pcr globwb 2 0 model sutanudjaja et al 2018 can simulate daily hydrological processes over lands at a high spatial resolution to consider the effects of reservoir operations on water availability a forward looking reservoir operation scheme which is directly implemented in the routing module is included in the pcr globwb model the overall regulation is to determine the target storage and reservoir releases given the forecasted inflow and downstream water demand de graaf et al 2014 as well as the purpose of the reservoir for water supply flood control hydropower etc the 67 yrb reservoirs from grand datasets lehner et al 2011 are gradually incorporated into the model based on their year of operation 3 2 hydrological model calibration sutanudjaja et al 2018 have calibrated the pcr globwb parameters for global application however to better simulate the runoff in the yrb the model needs to be further calibrated in this study we re calibrated six parameters including minimum soil water capacity wmin reference potential evapotranspiration ep 0 minimum soil thickness hmin soil rated hydraulic conductivity ksat1 ksat2 and base flow decay coefficient j based on the pcr globwb model calibration method proposed by sutanudjaja et al 2014 and lópez lópez et al 2017 each parameter was adjusted by multiplying the default parameter for each grid with a spatially uniform pre factor table 3 other parameters of the pcr globwb model were fixed as in sutanudjaja et al 2018 the pcr globwb model was calibrated and validated using monthly streamflow observed at 9 hydrological stations fig 1 the period of this study 1979 2022 was divided into two sub periods the simulations before 2007 were used to spin up the model to achieve its dynamic stability and the simulations during 2007 2022 were used for the subsequent analysis to evaluate the performance of model simulation the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse was used which is defined as 1 nse 1 t 1 t x t y t 2 t 1 t x t y 2 where x t and y t represent observed and simulated streamflow data respectively y is the average value of observations and t is the total time length t is a time step 3 3 index for hydropower potential developed hydropower potential dhp is defined as the maximum possible hydropower generation of the plant rather than the actual hydropower generation dhp can be obtained according to the reservoir information e g location storage capacity dam height and ihc which is calculated as 2 dhp min rm h g i h c where rm is the daily reservoir discharge h is the water head g is the gravitational acceleration 9 8 m2 s and ihc is the installed capacity of the hydropower plant the reservoir storage sm 1 m3 is calculated by the given prescribed reservoir discharge rm 3 s m 1 s m q m r m δ t q wm a m where q m is the expected daily inflow q wm is the forecasted net gain or loss m d 1 over the reservoir surface area a m2 the relationship between the reservoir storage volume s m3 water head h m and the surface area in the pcr globwb model are referred to liebe et al 2005 in which the reservoir volume is represented by an inverted pyramid shape after the calculation of rm the water head h m can be determined as liebe et al 2005 4 h 6 s f 2 3 where f is a dimensionless constant 3 4 definition of energy droughts the daily dhp series was used to identify the energy drought of hydropower specifically the dhp for each calendar day was first converted into a percentile based onthe data during 2007 2021 to ensure the sample size of the data for each calendar day the dhp series was expanded to a 3 day sample using data from one day on either side of the specific day while a 2 day sample for the first and last days of a year an energy drought occurs when the dhp percentile falls below 20 for several consecutive days each red part in fig 2 is an energy drought event note that the 20 threshold is based on the corresponding climatology so it is different for each day based on the definition we further examined the characteristics of energy drought e g duration frequency and severity fig 2 the duration of drought is the number of days between its start and end dates and drought frequency is expressed by the number of drought events per month or year the severity of energy drought is measured by energy deficit i e the accumulative difference between climatological mean dhp and the dhp during an energy drought event in addition taking the difference between daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration p pet as the factor of meteorological conditions we adopted the same definition of energy drought to identify the dry spell of p pet namely meteorological drought 4 results 4 1 evaluation of pcr globwb model simulation due to the availability of data the performance of pcr globwb model is evaluated on a monthly time scale from 2003 to 2019 through re calibration the optimal pre factors are fw 1 fe 1 25 fh 1 25 fk1 0 fk2 0 and fj 0 respectively fig 3 shows the time series of the monthly streamflow simulations and observations at 9 hydrological stations in the yrb it can be observed that the simulated streamflow after calibration is more consistent with the observations and the simulation of peak flow events is also improved before calibration nse is between 0 38 and 0 75 among the nine stations while after calibration the nse increases to 0 54 0 81 table 4 among them the nse of yichang and datong stations which are located downstream of the yrb is the highest in general the improvement of nse shows that the calibrated pcr globwb model can better simulate the hydrological process in the yrb the distributions of the daily average dhp of 67 hydropower plants in the yrb are shown in fig 4 the total daily dhp from the 67 plants in the yrb is 27909 mw with distinct spatial variability a super hydropower plant the three gorges dam with a daily average dhp of 15423 mw accounting for 55 of the total dhp in the yrb is located in the upper reaches in addition three hydropower plants i e ertan gezhouba and wuqiangxi with dhps greater than 1000 mw and six hydropower plants i e gongzui laoyingyan wujiangdu geheyan zhexi and danjiangkou with dhps greater than 500 mw are also distributed in the upper reaches most of the small hydroelectric power plants are located in the middle and lower reaches of the yrb 4 2 analysis of energy drought characteristics fig 5 a c e shows the annual average frequency duration and severity of hydropower energy droughts in the yrb it can be seen that 62 of the hydropower plants have a drought frequency of 5 15 events year in the yrb among them the annual average numbers of energy droughts in the three gorges hydropower plant ihc 22500 mw the ertan hydropower plant ihc 3300 mw on the yalong river and the gongzui hydropower plant ihc 2100 mw on the dadu river are 10 5 12 4 and 25 times respectively frequent energy droughts in these large hydropower plants may pose a big challenge to the stability of hydropower generation in the yrb the mean duration of energy droughts also varies greatly among the 67 hydropower plants from relatively shorter consecutive days 5 days to extremely long periods lasting for nearly one month fig 5c plants with a mean drought duration of 5 10 days event account for 45 of total plants and the mean duration of gaoyan hydropower plants on the xiangjiang river is 24 days event there is a non linear relationship between energy drought frequency and duration specifically for hydropower plants with a drought frequency greater than 15 events year the mean drought duration is generally 5 days event however as the drought frequency decreases the drought duration increases slowly the energy drought severity of hydropower largely depends on the capacity of the hydropower plant the drought severities of most small hydropower plants ihc 100 mw are 100 mw event whereas the severities for large and medium hydropower plants ihc 1000 mw could reach approximately 1000 10 000 mw event for example the drought severities at ertan and gongzui hydropower plants are 1458 mw event and 1236 mw event respectively and the severity at the three gorges hydropower plant is even up to 9360 mw event in other words the mean energy deficits of ertan gongzui and the three gorges dam account for 17 14 and 19 of the dhp of these hydropower plants during the energy droughts respectively for the whole basin energy drought occurs on average 10 times per year with a duration of 54 days year the annual total drought severity of hydropower plants is 304115 mw year accounting for about 26 of the yrb dhp during droughts as shown in fig 5 b more energy droughts are observed during the summer june to august than during the winter december to february while the duration in winter is longer than that in summer fig 5d the mean duration of energy drought is about 7 2 days month with the shortest duration in may and the longest duration in january fig 5d the energy drought severity in the yrb also shows seasonal variation with the least severity in february and the largest severity in october fig 5f 4 3 interannual variations of energy drought and its response to meteorological drought energy production is highly vulnerable to climate variability el niño southern oscillation enso is the primary driving factor of interannual variability that determines droughts and floods over many regions across the globe including the yrb shan et al 2018 zhang et al 2007 but its influence on energy drought is illustrated in the anomalies of local meteorological conditions including precipitation and temperature therefore this study analyzes the impact of enso on energy drought as well as propagation from meteorological drought to energy drought fig 6 a depicts the interannual variations of the characteristics of energy droughts in the yrb from 2007 to 2021 the frequency and duration of energy droughts have strong interannual variations showing an increase in 2017 2021 after a decrease in 2007 2017 the severity is largest in 2011 and smallest in 2017 el niño and la niña events can cause regional flooding and drought conditions including the yangtze river basin so it is possible to connect enso and the energy droughts fig 6 b plots the oni index with the time series of energy drought frequency in yrb the correlation coefficients between the oni index and drought frequency duration are analyzed for a lag period of 0 12 months significant negative correlations are observed between enso and 9 month lagged energy drought frequency and duration with correlation coefficients of 0 47 p 0 01 and 0 48 p 0 01 respectively affected by moderate and strong el niño in 2009 2010 and 2015 2016 the frequency of energy drought decreased during 2010 and fewer energy droughts occurred in 2016 2017 compared to the multi year average on the contrary affected by strong la niña in 2007 2008 and 2010 2011 more energy droughts occurred in 2008 2009 and 2011 2012 respectively this indicates that the enso has a precursory effect on the occurrence of the energy drought event over the yrb and a stronger la niña generally suggests a more severe energy drought in the next year to investigate the relationship between meteorological droughts and energy droughts we focused on the drought lag times over 16 major hydropower plants based on their ihc table 1 we defined the meteorological drought by adopting the same definition of energy drought to identify the dry spell of p pet using the run theory the meteorological and energy drought events of 16 hydropower plants from 2007 to 2021 were identified fig 7 shows the number of days that the energy drought events lag behind the meteorological droughts it is observed that the average lag times are similar among major hydropower plants where energy droughts lag behind meteorological droughts for 4 7 days around 31 of the energy drought events and meteorological drought events occurred simultaneously and 83 of energy drought events lagged behind meteorological droughts for 10 days 4 4 analysis of energy drought in the summer of 2022 and its future risk the recent multi year la niña caused a serious drought event over the yrb in the summer of 2022 leading to electrical overloads in sichuan a province that relies on hydropower for approximately 80 of its energy supply we find that the total energy drought severity of all the hydropower plants is 1 9 105mw from july to august 2022 which is 7 times of the average severity in the summer of 2007 2021 a frechet generalized extreme value gev distribution the shape parameter k 0 78 is chosen to fit drought severity with p 0 05 for the historical period the fitting result suggests that the 2022 yrb energy drought event is about a 1 in 52 year event over 2007 2021 climate in addition we also analyzed the future risk of such extreme drought events based on cmip6 climate model projections firstly the performance of the simulations from 20 cmip6 global climate models was evaluated by comparing the correlation and standard deviation between historical dhp simulations driven by cmip6 climate data and simulations driven by cmfd data 15 models with good historical performance were selected which excludes the canesm5 cnrm cm6 1 cnrm esm2 2 ipsl cm6a lr and ukesm1 0 ll in fig 8 a the choice of fitting functions was consistent with the choice in history and fig 8 b shows the cumulative distribution function cdf of energy drought severity during historical and future periods it can be seen that compared with the historical period energy droughts with the same severity will occur more frequently under both ssps scenarios the uncertainty of future drought risk is estimated through bootstrapping for 1000 times the return periods of extreme events like 2022 under ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios are 10 and 6 years and the future risks will increase by 80 2 4 and 88 1 2 respectively compared with the ssp245 the return period under the ssp585 is shorter suggesting the energy risks will become higher as global warming intensifies however the changes in future water use are not considered in the estimation which might cause uncertainty we believe the increasing drought risk could be alleviated with adaptive water resources managements energy drought is affected by meteorological drought global warming increases the evaporation potential further increasing the risk of energy drought yue et al 2021 projected that climate change would increase evapotranspiration in the yrb due to significant temperature increases and decreased precipitation particularly during the flood season from may to september which can reduce runoff and aggravate energy drought risk in addition the east asian summer monsoon easm has a significant impact on precipitation in china chen and yuan 2021 found that easm would strengthen in the warming future resulting in reduced precipitation in south china and more frequent droughts consequently the yrb would face increasingly severe energy drought risks in the future escalated with rising temperatures 5 discussion data and models may lead to uncertainty in our results firstly due to the differences between the gridded meteorological forcing data and on site observation data uncertainties may be introduced into the hydrological simulations second the pcr globwb model itself also has uncertainties in the simulations and parameter calibration there is uncertainty in the results of dhp simulation dhp is the maximum possible hydropower generation of all reservoirs in this study which is estimated based on reservoir characteristics such as location capacity dam height and ihc in comparison to the actual hydropower generation dhp is not affected by socio economic factors such as energy demand various water consumption etc however dhp has been widely used in many studies lehner et al 2005 gernaat et al 2017 liu et al 2016 meng et al 2020 liu et al 2016 used the reservoir information data of global reservoirs and dams grand to study the future changes in china s dhp most reservoirs are located in eastern china and south central china including the yrb this suggests that dhp could be a reasonable index for hydropower studies over yrb although the actual hydropower data and corresponding module should be incorporated to improve the assessment the reservoir regulation scheme plays a critical role in determining the research results unlike the traditional retrospective schemes that rely on historical runoff and demand data to optimize reservoir operation haddeland et al 2006 hanasaki et al 2006 pcr globwb adopts a prospective reservoir operation scheme that leverages forecast data sutanudjaja et al 2018 which is closer to the actual practices of reservoir operators van beek and bierkens 2009 however the pcr globwb model only distinguishes four types of reservoirs including irrigation flood control hydropower and shipping it does not distinguish between run of river and reservoir type hydropower plants which is needed in future research in addition to ensure the data adequacy and consistency in the number of reservoirs studied only the reservoirs put into operation before 2007 were selected for research despite the construction of several large hydropower plants in the upper reach of the yrb since 2007 such as xiluodu became operational in 2014 wudongde 2021 and baihetan 2022 which may affect the runoff pcr globwb directly implements prospective reservoir operation schemes into the routing model determining the target storage by comparing actual and predicted inflows and downstream demands to alleviate the influence of upstream reservoirs which is better than the retrospective schemes van beek et al 2011 future research should focus on the effect of cascade reservoir operation on the alleviation of the impact of extremes based on long term records of these newly built major hydropower plants furthermore future research should consider energy droughts within a broader spatiotemporal framework and the relationship between local and remote energy supply and demand among different regions furthermore the integration of multiple energy systems integration should be considered such as wind solar and so on to analyze energy droughts and their complementarities finally interdisciplinary researches based on climate impact are more conducive to the development and construction of energy systems 6 conclusions in this study we analyzed the characteristics i e frequency duration and severity of energy droughts for hydropower in the yrb based on streamflow simulations from the pcr globwb hydrological model and explored the main meteorological factors specifically the extreme energy drought event that occurred in the summer of 2022 and its future risks were also investigated we summarized the conclusions as follows 1 over the yrb there are on average 10 energy drought events per year and the mean duration is about 54 days year fig 5a b the total drought severity is 304115 mw year accounting for 26 of the dhp during energy droughts fig 5c 2 energy droughts could be influenced by enso and have a delayed response to meteorological droughts fig 6b and fig 7 in most hydropower plants energy drought is affected by the preceding meteorological drought by 4 7 days while 30 of energy drought events are affected by concurrent precipitation fig 7 3 in the summer of 2022 a record breaking energy drought event occurred in the yrb the total energy drought severity is 1 9 105mw which is estimated as a 1 in 52 year event over the historical period energy droughts would be more frequent and serious under both moderate and high emission scenarios in the future fig 8b an extreme energy drought event like 2022 will become a 1 in 10 year and 1 in 6 year event under ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios indicating that yrb will face more severe energy droughts in the future due to the global energy crisis and the increased need for renewable energy energy drought is a key issue for energy security and sustainable energy supply we suggest that hydropower availability can be predicted through indicators of the enso phenomenon which would help to identify vulnerable hotspots of global energy droughts in addition energy droughts have a close relationship with preceding meteorological conditions thus the results are expected to provide useful knowledge for improving hydropower management and energy drought control in the changing environment credit authorship contribution statement xinyue liu conceptualization methodology software writing original draft xing yuan conceptualization supervision
