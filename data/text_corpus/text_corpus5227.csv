field scale pesticide root zone model przm5 which includes an update for adjusting runoff uptake parameters for the nonuniform model we conceptualized runoff as a distribution of subsurface flow which assisted in revealing that a large amount 81 of runoff must bypass soil interaction to adequately simulate the field data with the remaining runoff acting over about a 3 cm depth similarly the mixing

sensitive areas the mechanism by which runoff removes chemicals from the soil has been simulated in various ways from a simple uniform mixing cell to more complex nonuniform uptake models where uptake potential declines with depth to even more complex coupled mass transfer models the effectiveness of these models has been demonstrated at the laboratory scale ahuja et al 1981 and with modeling exercises wallach and shabtai 1992 but their performance is less clear in more practical applications such as at the field scale the uniform mixing cell concept in which runoff completely mixes to a specific depth is among the most common and simple means to model chemical removal by runoff bruce et al 1975 ahuja 1986 ahuja and lehman 1983 frere et al 1980 haith 1986 steenhuis and walter 1980

manner exponentially decreasing with depth this makes sense as one would expect that chemical near the surface would be carried off easier than chemical deeper in the profile one way to interpret the non uniform model is that the flow of runoff is distributed through the soil in a decreasing manner with depth and that removal of pesticide is a direct function of the flow rate at each depth alternatively others e g ahuja et al 2000 carsel et al 1998 have conceived the modeled process using an uptake factor or using a partially available concentration the two conceptualizations decreasing flow or partial concentration are mathematically equivalent we have adopted the former depiction in this paper because a reduced flow rate is easier to conceive than the more abstract notion of a partially available concentration ahuja s non uniform concept has been implemented in the root zone water quality model ahuja et al 2000 and the pesticide root zone model carsel et al 1998 there are

question as these types of models are not explored here the work here focuses on developing parameters for use of the non uniform model and the mixing cell model at practical scales typical for a pesticide exposure and risk assessment there has not yet been a source of parameters derived from comprehensive sets of field scale studies that could be reliably used for large scale assessments this work addresses that need 1 1 non uniform uptake model the non uniform uptake model considers that only a portion of runoff interacts with the soil and the runoff mixes in a manner that decreases exponentially with depth the runoff interacting with the soil is represented by a subsurface flow intensity distribution described by 1 q q 0 e k z where q area normalized runoff intensity at depth z m runoff day m depth q 0 area normalized runoff intensity at the surface m runoff day m depth k decline factor describing the decrease in flow with depth m 1 z depth m the flow is constrained to a subsurface depth of d below which there is no flow constraining the flow to a finite depth as opposed to allowing an infinite exponential decrease was a modification first appearing in the przm model and was apparently made more for practical reasons rather than for mechanistic reasons carsel et al 1998 additionally only a fraction f of the total runoff is assumed to interact with the soil with these constraints a water balance on the runoff gives 2 f r 0 d q 0 e k z d z where f fraction of total runoff that interacts with soil r area normalized runoff m day d maximum depth of runoff interaction m equation 2 can then be solved to determine the required surface runoff intensity as follows 3 q 0 f r k 1 e k d substituting equation 3 into 1 and rearranging gives the expanded equation of flow intensity as a function of depth z 4 q f r k 1 e k d e k z this equation describes the distribution of runoff uptake potential with depth for the non uniform uptake model fig 1 shows this relationship as relative intensity q r as a function of depth there are three parameters describing this model f k and d the interacting fraction of runoff as defined by f is shown distributed beneath the surface while the non interacting fraction 1 f is shown above the surface the interacting portion shows a declining curve whose shape is determined by the decline factor k larger values of k result in steeper declines in the flows below the surface at depth d the curve abruptly ends and flow is zero the rate of mass uptake by runoff at any particular instant can be calculated from the subsurface flow equation 4 and the concentration at each depth in the profile by the following 5 m f r 0 d q c z d z where m rate of chemical mass uptake into runoff kg m2 day c z vertical aqueous concentration distribution in the soil kg m3 in a field scale model cz would be changing over time and the uptake described by equation 5 would be one of several processes affecting the soil concentration with others including leaching and degradation 1 2 mixing cell model the uniform mixing cell model fig 2 differs from the non uniform model in two important ways first the hypothetical subsurface runoff intensity is uniform to a specified depth secondly there are no vertical concentration gradients within the mixing cell this latter characteristic distinguishes the mixing cell model from simply being a special case of the non uniform model with a decline factor of zero the mixing cell model like the non uniform model can be formulated to divide runoff into an interacting portion f and a non interacting portion 1 f based on these concepts the rate of mass uptake by runoff from the mixing cell is represented by 6 m f r c where c is chemical concentration in the mixing cell kg m3 the depth d of the mixing cell impacts the model in two important ways first depth has a direct impact on how much pesticide mass is captured from the initial pesticide distribution in the soil second is that depth directly impacts the first order washout rate of pesticide from the mixing cell which is one of several processes that impact the soil concentration over time with others including leaching and degradation 2 methods 2 1 implementation into a field scale model przm5 version 5 02 young and fry 2014 was used here as the field scale model as it can implement the non uniform uptake model as well as the mixing cell model przm5 is a submodel within the pesticide water calculator pwc see software availability przm5 implements these uptake models in the larger context of an agricultural field where hydrology pesticide applications chemical transport and crop growth occur additionally przm5 serves as the primary pesticide runoff model used to estimate surface water pesticide concentrations for government regulatory work in the united states and canada with older przm versions in use in the european union przm5 operates on daily time steps and requires daily inputs for precipitation temperature and potential evaporation fry et al 2016 physical processes include consideration for precipitation conversion to runoff evapotranspiration crop growth and its influence on evapotranspiration and erosion runoff is calculated in przm5 by the natural resources conservation services curve number method young and carleton 2006 crop growth is simulated with canopy coverage and root depth increasing linearly between user specified dates przm5 simulates chemical processes including degradation sorption and volatilization and addresses various chemical application methods such as ground spray ground incorporation t banding and foliar spray przm5 is an advancement over the older przm versions in many ways but of particular interest here is its ability to allow manipulation and construction of various runoff uptake conceptualizations previous przm versions had hard coded the uptake parameters and calibration was not possible with the compiled model details regarding these processes as well as a full description of the model can be found in young and fry 2014 2 2 data from previous work there are two studies that heavily influenced the acceptance of the chemical uptake routines in field scale pesticide models like przm5 smith et al 1978 and singh and jones 2002 both of these studies have been used in previous przm runoff calibrations and validations they were chosen for the current work because of their comprehensive inclusion of study details easy accessibility and historical importance to the subject of pesticide runoff the data in smith et al 1978 was used for the original calibration of przm carsel et al 1998 however very little information is available on how those original calibrations were performed in przm from the description of the calibration analysis in carsel et al 1998 visual inspection seems to have been the only criteria used for the original parameter choices there is however sufficient information in smith et al 1978 to populate the input files and rerun the calibrations with the newer przm5 the purpose of the study by singh and jones 2002 was to formally validate przm by using industry studies submitted to the u s environmental protection agency usepa for pesticide registration purposes in singh and jones 2002 przm version 3 12 output was qualitatively compared to data from several field studies singh and jones 2002 indicated that przm version 3 12 did an adequate job of simulating the data but saw that there was room for improvement for the studies in singh and jones 2002 many of the original input files including the weather files were available to facilitate this new calibration effort the salient characteristics of the watersheds used in the current calibrations are given in table 1 the four studies obtained from smith et al 1978 were all located in georgia usa while the studies obtained from singh and jones 2002 were located in various u s states as indicated by the state abbreviation in the watershed id study durations were from 1 to 3 years only studies showing runoff dominated pesticide transport were included in the present work studies showing significant amounts of transport by eroded soil were excluded to eliminate confounding factors from transport mechanisms other than runoff examination and calibration of the erosion removal routine is reserved for a later time the chemicals used in these studies and their properties are given in table 2 note that the names of the chemicals used in the work of singh and jones 2002 were not disclosed by those authors and are designated as chemicals a through e the properties of these latter chemicals were taken solely from the information given by singh and jones 2002 and no independent verification of their accuracy could be made properties used here for the chemicals from smith et al 1978 reflect typical values and were derived from various sources including episuite usepa 2012 caldpr 2013 and publically available usepa studies no site specific chemical property tests were conducted for any of these studies which introduces some uncertainty with regard to their suitability but this uncertainty is in line with the uncertainty in pesticide regulatory applications for which site specific properties are generally not known 2 3 calibration of hydrology przm5 transforms precipitation into runoff by the nrcs curve number method nrcs 2003 young and carleton 2006 but the curve number method can give highly imprecise estimates of runoff roux 2017 which could potentially lead to overwhelming uncertainty for the mass calibration effort to address this przm5 offers a feature that allows users to precisely adjust the curve number any time during a simulation thus we were able to precisely calibrate the przm5 hydrology by adjusting the curve numbers on each day of a precipitation event so that the modeled runoff water matched within 0 1 of the measured runoff water in this way attention could be focused on the effectiveness of the chemical uptake routine instead of deficiencies in the przm5 hydrology because the older versions of przm did not have the curve number adjustment capabilities of przm5 this hydrology calibration step was not taken in the previous chemical uptake calibrations 2 4 initial chemical distribution in soil one of the greatest unknowns for these simulations is the initial distribution of pesticide in the soil immediately after application three types of applications were made in the previous studies see table 2 bare ground foliar spray and t band historically assumed initial chemical distributions for these application types have been used without much effort spent towards justification as in the previous validation work of singh and jones 2002 and the previous calibrations in carsel et al 1998 clearly the initial distribution will have important effects on the runoff uptake thus an effort was made here to derive the best parameterization based on the information available for bare soil applications which included all of the studies in smith et al 1978 and some of the studies in singh and jones 2002 an attempt was made to get a better estimate of the distribution by re examining the data of smith et al 1978 smith et al 1978 reported two cases where diphenamid distributions in the soil were measured immediately after application one on field p1 and one on field p3 in these cases measurements were made at 1 cm intervals after diphenamid was applied as a ground application to bare soil analysis of these results showed that 90 of pesticide remained in the top 1 cm with an additional 5 in the next 1 5 cm and much lesser amounts distributed to deeper depths to derive a distribution from this data the pesticide was assumed to be more intensely distributed at the surface and to decrease with depth in a linear manner the resulting distribution is shown in fig 3 along with the field data under these conditions mass balance requires that the pesticide be distributed to a depth of 1 5 cm thus in all simulations that follow ground applications of pesticide were initialized with a distribution that decreased linearly to 1 5 cm for the foliar and t band applications which appeared only in the study of singh and jones 2002 the application parameters given by singh and jones 2002 were used without further investigation since there were no data to suggest otherwise for t band applications the original przm input files of singh and jones 2002 reported a t band depth of 3 cm with 66 of pesticide distributed in the top 2 cm for foliar applications singh and jones 2002 used the przm default which was to distribute pesticide in the soil down to 4 cm in a linearly decreasing manner for any pesticide not intercepted by foliage 2 5 optimization of uptake parameters there were a total of 17 different watershed chemical scenarios these scenarios are specified in table 2 by the chemical name column 1 and the watersheds to which the chemical was applied column 7 for each of these 17 scenarios simulations using a comprehensive set of parameters were performed for both the non uniform model and the mixing cell model for the non uniform model the interaction fraction f ranged from 0 01 to 0 5 at 0 001 increments maximum depth d ranged from 0 05 to 8 cm with 0 05 cm increments and the decline factor k ranged from 0 to 3 cm 1 at 0 1 cm 1 increments for the mixing cell model adjustments were made to the size of the top soil compartment d and the interaction fraction f for the mixing cell case d was varied from 0 05 to 5 cm in 0 05 cm increments and f from 0 01 to 0 50 at 0 001 increments preliminary work showed that these ranges would sufficiently capture the relevant parameter space of each model for these 17 watershed chemical scenarios a total of 105 runoff events were recorded these events were distributed among the scenarios as shown in table 3 which also gives the amount of mass carried off the field and the percent of the total pesticide applied that was removed from the fields by runoff typically less than 1 percent of the applied pesticide was removed by runoff in these studies but in a few cases between 3 and 4 percent was removed further examination of table 3 shows that the scenarios had significantly different amounts of mass applied to the fields thus a weighting scheme was used to normalize scenario output data by the total chemical mass applied to the respective fields otherwise scenarios with more mass applied would have an undue influence on the results for example since bromide was applied at 100 times greater than the typical application in the table output mass is expected to be orders of magnitude greater than the typical pesticide output the relative sum of the squares residuals which was minimized was calculated as 7 s s q m m m d m a 2 where ssq applied mass normalized sum of the square residuals m d measured chemical mass in runoff event kg m m modeled chemical mass in runoff event kg m a applied mass kg with this objective function relevant parameter space maps of either f k and d or f and d were created for the nonuniform and the mixing cell models respectively the optimum parameters that minimized the ssq were found by conducting a comprehensive search of those spaces 3 results discussion 3 1 optimized runoff uptake values the parameters of the non uniform chemical uptake model that provide the best fit to the field data are a decline factor of 1 40 cm 1 an interaction fraction of 0 19 and a depth greater than 8 cm essentially infinite for the case of the single mixing cell model where vertical pesticide distribution is uniform throughout the cell the optimum parameters are a depth of 0 75 cm and an interacting fraction of 0 16 table 4 summarizes the model parameters along with the original przm default values a comparison of the profiles of the optimized and przm s previous non uniform uptake model is shown in fig 4 given that the original calibration was a first guess the newly calibrated profile is remarkably similar there are however notable differences including the smaller interacting fraction and the elimination of the abrupt cutoff at 2 cm from examination of fig 4 it is apparent that the new curve has essentially reached zero intensity by a depth of about 3 cm and in all practicality the exponential curve does not need a lower bound we could eliminate the depth parameter and allow the curve to approach infinity without impacting the results because of this insensitivity of the depth parameter depth could be eliminated from the model and the non uniform model would take on a less complicated and more intuitive 2 parameter form although it may initially appear that the mixing cell model is a subset of the family of non uniform models for the case where the decline factor is zero this is not correct as the two models are conceptually different in an important way the vertical concentration profile of the mixing cell is uniform whereas the non uniform model has vertically varying concentrations thus convenient statistical comparisons between the two models is not straight forward nevertheless we can compare the outputs on a graph as in fig 5 which shows the relationship between mass simulated and mass measured for the two models mixing cell and non uniform uptake a 45 degree line through fig 5 would represent the line of perfect agreement between model and observations as fig 5 indicates there is no clear difference between the two models as both seem to be reasonable in describing the data used for calibrating the models both models also differ from the data within the range of about a factor of 2 which is well within the expectations for modeling these field scale processes 3 2 effect of the newly calibrated models on regulatory assessments because one of the most common uses of runoff uptake models is for pesticide regulation it is of interest to examine what impact these newly calibrated models may have on typical usepa assessments the usepa has 99 przm5 standard scenarios that it uses for pesticide exposure assessments usepa 2017 these scenarios represent a wide range of crops soil and weather conditions across the united states with use of the pwc the przm5 runoff from these scenarios is routed into a standard water body a farm pond simulated with the variable volume water body model young 2014 the result of these couplings are water concentrations used for usepa surface water exposure estimates huff hartz et al 2017 with help from the pwc przm5 and the vvwm were run with the 99 scenarios using the newly calibrated non uniform uptake model the mixing cell model and the original przm default uptake model for these simulations a hypothetical chemical see below was applied 5 times per year in the spring with each application staggered by 5 days because the application date has a large impact on output application date variability was captured by running each scenario 4 times each with new application start date staggered by 3 days this was repeated 5 times to produce 495 simulations additionally the application methods were varied and included 1 a soil application that linearly decreased to 4 cm the usepa standard for ground applications 2 a soil application that was uniformly distributed to 2 cm 3 a soil application that was linearly decreasing to 1 5 cm and 4 a soil application that was linearly increasing to 1 cm this resulted in a total of 1980 simulations and covered a wide range of possible pesticide application situations the hypothetical chemical simulated had an organic carbon water partition coefficient koc of 10 ml g a soil degradation half life of 100 days and water degradation for use in vvwm half life of 100 days other chemical inputs were set to eliminate other forms of chemical degradation or volatilization these chemical properties were chosen to produce high runoff sensitivity and enhance the influence of the chemical uptake mechanism on the output fig 6 shows how the vvwm surface water acute concentrations resulting from the runoff with the newly calibrated non uniform model fig 6a and the mixing cell model fig 6b compare to the original default model concentrations in these plots the points are first ordered by the 4 different application methods with deeper pesticide incorporations to the right within each of the 4 application methods the points are ordered by increasing absolute magnitude from fig 6a use of the newly calibrated non uniform model will result in about a 20 reduction or less in acute surface water concentrations for most cases for any application method the graph shows more variability at the end of the scale where the magnitudes of the concentrations are lowest chronic concentrations not shown show similar trends and magnitudes some particularly deep application methods e g seed treatment may result in increased surface water concentrations see far right segment of fig 6a this is primarily due to the elimination of the abrupt cutoff at 2 cm that is characteristic of the original przm default model fig 6b shows the comparison between the mixing cell model and the original default model for shallower incorporations i e those applications methods towards the left side of the graph the mixing cell gives concentrations that are 20 percent less than estimates from the original default model as the incorporation depth increases the difference in the concentrations becomes more dramatic this makes sense as the mixing cell has an abrupt cutoff at 0 75 cm and any pesticide placed below this level is inaccessible by the modeled runoff this conceptualization with an abrupt cut off could be problematic for certain application types that place pesticide below the mixing cell depth for example surface water pesticide concentrations resulting from pesticide treated seeds would abruptly become zero if seeds were planted at any depth below 0 75 cm and such abruptness is not consistent with physical reality this likely makes the mixing cell not practical for regulatory use as observed by huff hartz et al 2017 the original przm default model is similarly problematic because of its abrupt cutoff at 2 cm cutoff 4 conclusion given the naturally high variability in field scale environmental measurements either model non uniform or mixing cell adequately simulated the field derived calibration data both were well within a factor of two at the high end of the runoff measurements where the most influential high mass loading events occur in pesticide exposure assessments in practical applications the nonuniform model provides more intuitively reasonable responses than does the mixing cell model where the mixing cell s fixed depth can result in abrupt mass changes from negligibly small changes in pesticide depth in cases where initial pesticide distribution is not taken into account this depth cutoff would present no issues for models like przm where initial pesticide distribution has traditionally been an important means of evaluating the effect of pesticide application methods a mixing cell concept would not be a good selection for these reasons the nonuniform model is recommended for use in przm with a decline factor of 1 4 an interaction factor of 0 19 and without an abrupt cut off depth i e depth of 8 cm or essentially infinity for those models where the mixing cell can be appropriately used the evidence here suggests that it should be parameterized with an interaction fraction of 0 16 and a depth of 0 75 cm disclaimer the views expressed here are solely

przm from the description of the calibration analysis in carsel et al 1998 visual inspection seems to have been the only criteria used for the original parameter choices there is however sufficient information in smith et al 1978 to populate the input files and rerun the calibrations with the newer przm5 the purpose of the study by singh and jones 2002 was to formally validate przm by using industry studies submitted to the u s environmental protection agency usepa for pesticide registration purposes in singh and jones 2002 przm version 3 12 output was qualitatively compared to data from several field studies singh and jones 2002 indicated that przm version 3 12 did an adequate job of simulating the data but saw that there was room for improvement for the studies in singh and jones 2002 many of the original input files including the weather files were available to facilitate this new calibration effort the salient characteristics of the watersheds used in the current calibrations are given in table 1 the four studies obtained from smith et al 1978 were all located in georgia usa while the studies obtained from singh and jones 2002 were located in various u s states as indicated by the state abbreviation in the watershed id study durations were from 1 to 3 years only studies showing runoff dominated pesticide transport were included in the present work studies showing significant amounts of transport by eroded soil were excluded to eliminate confounding factors from transport mechanisms other than runoff examination and calibration of the erosion removal routine is reserved for a later time the chemicals used in these studies and their properties are given in table 2 note that the names of the chemicals used in the work of singh and jones 2002 were not disclosed by those authors and are designated as chemicals a through e the properties of these latter chemicals were taken solely from the information given by singh and jones 2002 and no independent verification of their accuracy could be made properties used here for the chemicals from smith et al 1978 reflect typical values and were derived from various sources including episuite usepa 2012 caldpr 2013 and publically available usepa studies no site specific chemical property tests were conducted for any of these studies which introduces some uncertainty with regard to their suitability but this uncertainty is in line with the uncertainty in pesticide regulatory applications for which site specific properties are generally not known 2 3 calibration of hydrology przm5 transforms precipitation into runoff by the nrcs curve number method nrcs 2003 young and carleton 2006 but the curve number method can give highly imprecise estimates of runoff roux 2017 which could potentially lead to overwhelming uncertainty for the mass calibration effort to address this przm5 offers a feature that allows users to precisely adjust the curve number any time during a simulation thus we were able to precisely calibrate the przm5 hydrology by adjusting the curve numbers on each day of a precipitation event so that the modeled runoff water matched within 0 1 of the measured runoff water in this way attention could be focused on the effectiveness of the chemical uptake routine instead of deficiencies in the przm5 hydrology because the older versions of przm did not have the curve number adjustment capabilities of przm5 this hydrology calibration step was not taken in the previous chemical uptake calibrations 2 4 initial chemical distribution in soil one of the greatest unknowns for these simulations is the initial distribution of pesticide in the soil immediately after application three types of applications were made in the previous studies see table 2 bare ground foliar spray and t band historically assumed initial chemical distributions for these application types have been used without much effort spent towards justification as in the previous validation work of singh and jones 2002 and the previous calibrations in carsel et al 1998 clearly the initial distribution will have important effects on the runoff uptake thus an effort was made here to derive the best parameterization based on the information available for bare soil applications which included all of the studies in smith et al 1978 and some of the studies in singh and jones 2002 an attempt was made to get a better estimate of the distribution by re examining the data of smith et al 1978 smith et al 1978 reported two cases where diphenamid distributions in the soil were measured immediately after application one on field p1 and one on field p3 in these cases measurements were made at 1 cm intervals after diphenamid was applied as a ground application to bare soil analysis of these results showed that 90 of pesticide remained in the top 1 cm with an additional 5 in the next 1 5 cm and much lesser amounts distributed to deeper depths to derive a distribution from this data the pesticide was assumed to be more intensely distributed at the surface and to decrease with depth in a linear manner the resulting distribution is shown in fig 3 along with the field data under these conditions mass balance requires that the pesticide be distributed to a depth of 1 5 cm thus in all simulations that follow ground applications of pesticide were initialized with a distribution that decreased linearly to 1 5 cm for the foliar and t band applications which appeared only in the study of singh and jones 2002 the application parameters given by singh and jones 2002 were used without further investigation since there were no data to suggest otherwise for t band applications the original przm input files of singh and jones 2002 reported a t band depth of 3 cm with 66 of pesticide distributed in the top 2 cm for foliar applications singh and jones 2002 used the przm default which was to distribute pesticide in the soil down to 4 cm in a linearly decreasing manner for any pesticide not intercepted by foliage 2 5 optimization of uptake parameters there were a total of 17 different watershed chemical scenarios these scenarios are specified in table 2 by the chemical name column 1 and the watersheds to which the chemical was applied column 7 for each of these 17 scenarios simulations using a comprehensive set of parameters were performed for both the non uniform model and the mixing cell model for the non uniform model the interaction fraction f ranged from 0 01 to 0 5 at 0 001 increments maximum depth d ranged from 0 05 to 8 cm with 0 05 cm increments and the decline factor k ranged from 0 to 3 cm 1 at 0 1 cm 1 increments for the mixing cell model adjustments were made to the size of the top soil compartment d and the interaction fraction f for the mixing cell case d was varied from 0 05 to 5 cm in 0 05 cm increments and f from 0 01 to 0 50 at 0 001 increments preliminary work showed that these ranges would sufficiently capture the relevant parameter space of each model for these 17 watershed chemical scenarios a total of 105 runoff events were recorded these events were distributed among the scenarios as shown in table 3 which also gives the amount of mass carried off the field and the percent of the total pesticide applied that was removed from the fields by runoff typically less than 1 percent of the applied pesticide was removed by runoff in these studies but in a few cases between 3 and 4 percent was removed further examination of table 3 shows that the scenarios had significantly different amounts of mass applied to the fields thus a weighting scheme was used to normalize scenario output data by the total chemical mass applied to the respective fields otherwise scenarios with more mass applied would have an undue influence on the results for example since bromide was applied at 100 times greater than the typical application in the table output mass is expected to be orders of magnitude greater than the typical pesticide output the relative sum of the squares residuals which was minimized was calculated as 7 s s q m m m d m a 2 where ssq applied mass normalized sum of the square residuals m d measured chemical mass in runoff event kg m m modeled chemical mass in runoff event kg m a applied mass kg with this objective function relevant parameter space maps of either f k and d or f and d were created for the nonuniform and the mixing cell models respectively the optimum parameters that minimized the ssq were found by conducting a comprehensive search of those spaces 3 results discussion 3 1 optimized runoff uptake values the parameters of the non uniform chemical uptake model that provide the best fit to the field data are a decline factor of 1 40 cm 1 an interaction fraction of 0 19 and a depth greater than 8 cm essentially infinite for the case of the single mixing cell model where vertical pesticide distribution is uniform throughout the cell the optimum parameters are a depth of 0 75 cm and an interacting fraction of 0 16 table 4 summarizes the model parameters along with the original przm default values a comparison of the profiles of the optimized and przm s previous non uniform uptake model is shown in fig 4 given that the original calibration was a first guess the newly calibrated profile is remarkably similar there are however notable differences including the smaller interacting fraction and the elimination of the abrupt cutoff at 2 cm from examination of fig 4 it is apparent that the new curve has essentially reached zero intensity by a depth of about 3 cm and in all practicality the exponential curve does not need a lower bound we could eliminate the depth parameter and allow the curve to approach infinity without impacting the results because of this insensitivity of the depth parameter depth could be eliminated from the model and the non uniform model would take on a less complicated and more intuitive 2 parameter form although it may initially appear that the mixing cell model is a subset of the family of non uniform models for the case where the decline factor is zero this is not correct as the two models are conceptually different in an important way the vertical concentration profile of the mixing cell is uniform whereas the non uniform model has vertically varying concentrations thus convenient statistical comparisons between the two models is not straight forward nevertheless we can compare the outputs on a graph as in fig 5 which shows the relationship between mass simulated and mass measured for the two models mixing cell and non uniform uptake a 45 degree line through fig 5 would represent the line of perfect agreement between model and observations as fig 5 indicates there is no clear difference between the two models as both seem to be reasonable in describing the data used for calibrating the models both models also differ from the data within the range of about a factor of 2 which is well within the expectations for modeling these field scale processes 3 2 effect of the newly calibrated models on regulatory assessments because one of the most common uses of runoff uptake models is for pesticide regulation it is of interest to examine what impact these newly calibrated models may have on typical usepa assessments the usepa has 99 przm5 standard scenarios that it uses for pesticide exposure assessments usepa 2017 these scenarios represent a wide range of crops soil and weather conditions across the united states with use of the pwc the przm5 runoff from these scenarios is routed into a standard water body a farm pond simulated with the variable volume water body model young 2014 the result of these couplings are water concentrations used for usepa surface water exposure estimates huff hartz et al 2017 with help from the pwc przm5 and the vvwm were run with the 99 scenarios using the newly calibrated non uniform uptake model the mixing cell model and the original przm default uptake model for these simulations a hypothetical chemical see below was applied 5 times per year in the spring with each application staggered by 5 days because the application date has a large impact on output application date variability was captured by running each scenario 4 times each with new application start date staggered by 3 days this was repeated 5 times to produce 495 simulations additionally the application methods were varied and included 1 a soil application that linearly decreased to 4 cm the usepa standard for ground applications 2 a soil application that was uniformly distributed to 2 cm 3 a soil application that was linearly decreasing to 1 5 cm and 4 a soil application that was linearly increasing to 1 cm this resulted in a total of 1980 simulations and covered a wide range of possible pesticide application situations the hypothetical chemical simulated had an organic carbon water partition coefficient koc of 10 ml g a soil degradation half life of 100 days and water degradation for use in vvwm half life of 100 days other chemical inputs were set to eliminate other forms of chemical degradation or volatilization these chemical properties were chosen to produce high runoff sensitivity and enhance the influence of the chemical uptake mechanism on the output fig 6 shows how the vvwm surface water acute concentrations resulting from the runoff with the newly calibrated non uniform model fig 6a and the mixing cell model fig 6b compare to the original default model concentrations in these plots the points are first ordered by the 4 different application methods with deeper pesticide incorporations to the right within each of the 4 application methods the points are ordered by increasing absolute magnitude from fig 6a use of the newly calibrated non uniform model will result in about a 20 reduction or less in acute surface water concentrations for most cases for any application method the graph shows more variability at the end of the scale where the magnitudes of the concentrations are lowest chronic concentrations not shown show similar trends and magnitudes some particularly deep application methods e g seed treatment may result in increased surface water concentrations see far right segment of fig 6a this is primarily due to the elimination of the abrupt cutoff at 2 cm that is characteristic of the original przm default model fig 6b shows the comparison between the mixing cell model and the original default model for shallower incorporations i e those applications methods towards the left side of the graph the mixing cell gives concentrations that are 20 percent less than estimates from the original default model as the incorporation depth increases the difference in the concentrations becomes more dramatic this makes sense as the mixing cell has an abrupt cutoff at 0 75 cm and any pesticide placed below this level is inaccessible by the modeled runoff this conceptualization with an abrupt cut off could be problematic for certain application types that place pesticide below the mixing cell depth for example surface water pesticide concentrations resulting from pesticide treated seeds would abruptly become zero if seeds were planted at any depth below 0 75 cm and such abruptness is not consistent with physical reality this likely makes the mixing cell not practical for regulatory use as observed by huff hartz et al 2017 the original przm default model is similarly problematic because of its abrupt cutoff at 2 cm cutoff 4 conclusion given the naturally high variability in field scale environmental measurements either model non uniform or mixing cell adequately simulated the field derived calibration data both were well within a factor of two at the high end of the runoff measurements where the most influential high mass loading events occur in pesticide exposure assessments in practical applications the nonuniform model provides more intuitively reasonable responses than does the mixing cell model where the mixing cell s fixed depth can result in abrupt mass changes from negligibly small changes in pesticide depth in cases where initial pesticide distribution is not taken into account this depth cutoff would present no issues for models like przm where initial pesticide distribution has traditionally been an important means of evaluating the effect of pesticide application methods a mixing cell concept would not be a good selection for these reasons the nonuniform model is recommended for use in przm with a decline factor of 1 4 an interaction factor of 0 19 and without an abrupt cut off depth i e depth of 8 cm or essentially infinity for those models where the mixing cell can be appropriately used the evidence here suggests that it should be parameterized with an interaction fraction of 0 16 and a depth of 0 75 cm disclaimer the views expressed here are solely

26136,this study presents an integrated wetland watershed modeling approach that capitalizes on inundation maps and geospatial data to improve spatial prediction of wetland inundation and assess its prediction uncertainty we outline problems commonly arising from data preparation and parameterization used to simulate wetlands within a semi distributed watershed model we demonstrate how wetland inundation can be better captured by the wetland parameters developed from remotely sensed data we then emphasize assessing model prediction using inundation maps derived from remotely sensed data this integrated modeling approach is tested using the soil and water assessment tool swat with an improved riparian wetlands rws extension for an agricultural watershed in the mid atlantic coastal plain us this study illustrates how spatially distributed information is necessary to predict inundation of wetlands and hydrologic function at the local landscape scale where monitoring and conservation decision making take place keywords wetland watershed modeling approach inundation maps wetland inundation soil and water assessment tool swat software availability the swat program is freely downloadable from the following site http swat tamu edu software 1 introduction wetlands provide important ecosystem services such as mitigating flood damage hillman 1998 improving water quality by reducing pollution loads cooper 1990 and serving as natural habitats to support biodiversity nygaard and ejrnæs 2009 these functions highly depend on wetland hydrology determined by its interactions with surrounding areas tiner 2005 kettlewell et al 2008 for example denitrification process is triggered by anaerobic condition within a wetland and incoming nitrate loads which are driven by water inflow to wetlands from the surrounding landscape cooper 1990 wetlands in turn exert a strong influence on the characteristics and functioning of downstream waters usepa 2015 therefore it is important to understand wetland hydrology as it relates to upstream and downstream landscapes to assess the cumulative benefits of wetlands at the watershed scale usepa 2015 it is challenging to predict wetland hydrology owing to complex hydrologic connections between wetlands and surrounding areas via surface and subsurface interactions ranalli and macalady 2010 computational models have been developed to simulate wetland hydrology at the individual site scale for example modflow was used to simulate hydro dynamics of wetlands induced by surface flow and interactions with aquifers restrepo et al 1998 and its groundwater recharge function under different weather conditions bradley 2012 wetland lee et al 2002 and wetland solute transport dynamics wetsand kazezyılmaz alhan et al 2007 were developed to simulate plant uptake and denitrification process within a wetland these models were able to simulate water and nutrient cycling at the site but the results were confined to individual wetlands thus they could not represent the cumulative impacts of multiple wetlands on downstream waters at the watershed scale recently spatially distributed watershed models have been applied to examine catchment scale benefits of wetlands by including a wetland module as a component in a distributed watershed model vining 2002 simulated the devils lake basin wetlands model to estimate water storage capacity of wetlands and its effects on downstream water balance at the watershed scale padmanabhan and bengtson 2001 used the hydrologic engineering center hec 1 model to evaluate the integrated impacts of wetlands on mitigating flooding in a large drainage area 4150 km2 hattermann et al 2006 predicted the impacts of wetlands on overall water and nutrient budgets for an agricultural watershed using the soil and water integrated model swim the soil and water assessment tool swat has been applied to investigate various water quality and hydrological benefits of wetlands for agricultural watersheds gassman et al 2007 for example swat was applied to assess wetland effects on streamflow during wet and dry periods wu and johnston 2008 to predict the impacts of wetland restoration and losses on water quantity and quality wang et al 2010 yang et al 2010 records et al 2014 martinez martinez et al 2014 2015 and to identify optimal locations for wetland restoration to improve water quality and mitigate flood damage babbar sebens et al 2013 comín et al 2014 swat similar to other semi distributed watershed models oversimplified physical processes and representation of wetlands in a watershed context swat simulates the lumped effect of multiple wetlands within a sub watershed neitsch et al 2011 for example multiple wetlands within a sub watershed are spatially aggregated and simulated as one the size of this hypothetical wetland is assumed to be equivalent to the aggregated areal extent of multiple wetlands located within a sub watershed its upland area is set by the relative proportion of aggregated drainage areas of multiple wetlands to a sub watershed and its location is positioned at the outlet of the sub watershed hence outflow from an aggregated wetland is directly transported to the next downstream sub watershed this simplification significantly reduces computational demands however it disregards spatially variable wetland interactions with surrounding areas and local groundwater systems such as recharge feng et al 2013 mclaughlin et al 2014 evenson et al 2015 2016 and the hydrological exchange with streams and groundwater along stream channels within a sub watershed liu et al 2008 conceptually and spatially agglomerated representation of wetlands can be a large source of uncertainty in model prediction zhang et al 2011 several attempts are being made to improve wetland processes by disaggregating and modifying wetland representation by different types feng et al 2013 while considering hydrological connection with surrounding areas evenson et al 2015 2016 and nearby streams liu et al 2008 however it still remains unclear if enhanced model capabilities would lead to improved prediction on wetland function and dynamics this is because simulation results with enhanced capabilities have been often evaluated against aggregate hydrological variables e g streamflow nutrient and sediment loads referred to as hard data in seibert and mcdonnell 2002 collected at the watershed outlet liu et al 2008 evenson et al 2015 while changes were made to improve spatial processes and patterns the relative improvement in aggregated response may not offer any insight into the internal hydrological processes i e hydrological interactions between wetlands and surrounding areas thus the assessment on the modeled dynamics and wetland functions i e spatial results remains incomplete swat similar to other wetland models estimates change in inundation extent i e water levels using a wetland water volume surface area relationship this relationship is specified by four wetland parameters i e surface area and volume within a wetland at normal and maximum water levels required is spatially explicit information that describes the geomorphic and inundation characteristics of individual wetlands however such data rarely exist and thus these parameters have often been set to represent uniform characteristics for all wetlands regardless of spatial locations and site characteristics liu et al 2008 wu and johnston 2008 records et al 2014 furthermore spatially explicit in situ data that can be used to evaluate predicted inundation within multiple wetlands under different conditions rarely exist to cope with data scarcity it has been suggested that qualitative data i e soft data in seibert and mcdonnell 2002 derived from expert knowledge literature and extensive field monitoring of similar sites be used these data have been used to constrain a range of model parameter values for calibration seibert and mcdonnell 2002 2013 vaché and mcdonnell 2006 julich et al 2012 or to qualitatively evaluate if modeled behaviors and internal processes are reasonable seibert and mcdonnell

loumagne et al 2001 the results seem to be promising particularly at the regional or global scale when coupled with conceptual models however data assimilation was shown to be unsatisfactory when tested with more complex spatially distributed process based models such as swat at a local catchment scale chen et al 2011 moreover most routinely collected remotely sensed data products of hydrological variables e g soil moisture are acquired at a coarse spatial resolution tens of kilometers lakshmi 2013 and therefore are limited in their utility for characterizing small to moderate size wetlands which are dominant on the landscape on the other hand commonly available wetland mapping products are categorical maps at much higher spatial resolution e g us fish and wildlife service usfws national wetland inventory nwi us national land cover database nlcd by the multi resolution land characteristics mrlc consortium us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa coastal change analysis program c cap however they cannot provide information on inundation changes in a wetland over time the potential to routinely map inundation of wetlands at a 30 m resolution with high accuracy 92 was recently demonstrated using light detection and ranging lidar and time series landsat data lang and mccarty 2009 lang et al 2013 huang et al 2014 jin et al 2017 the mapping algorithm was applied to detect inundated area for small seasonal forested wetlands which are densely distributed in the coastal plain of the mid atlantic region mar of the us huang et al 2014 forested wetlands are difficult to map due to the presence of the forest canopy and the fact that inundation and saturation in these wetland is often ephemeral inundation maps were produced annually using landsat images and lidar intensity data acquired in early spring jin et al 2017 when most standing water within a wetland was viewable due to the leaf off status of forest canopy lang et al 2012 huang et al 2014 when applied to watersheds in the coastal plain physiographic province of the chesapeake bay watershed cbw spatial patterns of inundation reflected different weather conditions and followed the change trend of streamflow huang et al 2014 jin et al 2017 in this paper we present an integrated wetland watershed modeling approach that capitalizes on time series inundation maps with an aim to improve prediction on wetland inundation using a case study we illustrate the limitations of using catchment scale streamflow to evaluate improved model representation for riparian wetlands then we highlight the needs for additional spatial data to parameterize a wetland module and to demonstrate its improvement by analyzing spatial results indicating wetland inundation we outline problems commonly arising from input data preparation to represent spatially aggregated wetlands within a semi distributed watershed model we demonstrate how wetland inundation can be better captured by setting wetland parameters developed from inundation map derived from remotely sensed data we then place particular emphasis on assessing model prediction using inundation maps under different weather conditions this integrated modeling approach was tested with swat and riparian wetland module rwm an improved swat extension for riparian wetlands rws and hence our analysis on the effects of improved parameterization and process focused on assessing spatial patterns of inundation from riparian wetlands 2 data and method 2 1 study area the tuckahoe creek watershed tcw 220 7 km2 is located on the upper region of the choptank river watershed in the coastal plain of the cbw fig 1 the choptank river watershed is on the list of impaired watersheds designated by the us environmental protection agency usepa due to excessive sediment and nutrient loads from agricultural lands mccarty et al 2008 the site has been selected as one of the us department of agriculture usda conservation effects

soils are evenly split between well drained usda classification of hydrologic soil group hsg a or b and poorly drained soils hsg c or d fig 2b land use is mainly comprised of agriculture 51 3 and forest 38 4 followed by pasture 8 5 urban areas 1 4 and water bodies 0 3 fig 2c the study site includes abundant forested wetlands such as wetland depressions e g delmarva bays wetland flats and riparian wetlands lang et al 2012 according to the nwi map most forested areas are indeed forested wetlands and the total coverage of wetlands is about 34 5 km2 accounting for 15 5 of the entire tcw fig 2d the majority of forested wetlands are known to be seasonally inundated for a relatively short time period in early spring when et is low leading to seasonally high groundwater level tiner and burke 1995 2 2 soil and water assessment tool swat model an overall approach to watershed simulation swat is a semi distributed continuous process based watershed model it has been widely used to simulate hydrology nutrient cycling and sediment loads in an agricultural watershed neitsch et al 2011 swat partitions a watershed into sub watersheds the draining area of the stream segment and further into hydrologic response units hrus based on unique combination of land use soil type and slope the mass balance transport and cycling of hydrologic and water quality variables are simulated at each hru whose outputs aggregated for the sub watershed and then routed to the outlet of the watershed through channel processes swat uses the soil conservation service scs curve number cn method to compute surface runoff and infiltration which is determined based on soil s permeability land use and antecedent soil water conditions the penman monteith method was used to simulate et refer to neitsch et al 2011 for further details swat input data consist of various geospatial and climate data table 1 a high resolution lidar based digital elevation model dem land use map and soil survey geographical database ssurgo were used to characterize the study site and delineate stream network sub watersheds and hrus in total the watershed was divided into 71 sub watersheds and further into 573 hrus by applying the threshold of 10 20 and 20 to land use soil type and slope respectively delineation processes are fully described in winchell et al 2010 daily precipitation and temperature were obtained from three weather stations located near the tcw operated by noaa national climate data center ncdc chestertown usc00181750 royal oak usc00187806 and greensboro us1mdcl0009 daily solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were not monitored so they were generated using swat s built in weather generator neitsch et al 2011 daily streamflow data collected at the outlet of the tcw was obtained from the us geological survey usgs gauge station 01491500 fig 1 a commonly available drought index i e palmer drought severity index pdsi was used to characterize weather conditions e g drought normal and wet based on historic climate records it was downloaded from the noaa ncdc for the climate division md region 5 within where the study watershed is situated 2 3 representation of wetland processes this study used the built in conventional wetland module in swat to simulate non riparian wetlands nrws and the improved riparian wetland module rwm liu et al 2008 for riparian wetlands rws this sub section briefly describes the two modules 2 3 1 non riparian wetlands nrws module swat treats a wetland like an impoundment and simulates its hydrological effects at the sub watershed scale neitsch et al 2011 it aggregates wetlands distributed within a sub watershed then this lumped wetland is assumed to be located at the outlet of the sub watershed neitsch et al 2011 and its water balance is calculated at a daily time step as eq 1 1 v v s t o r e d v f l o w i n v f l o w o u t v p c p v e v a p v s e e p where v is the volume of water stored in a wetland at the end of the day v s t o r e d the volume of water stored in the wetland at the beginning of the day v f l o w i n the volume of water entering the wetland during the day v f l o w o u t the volume of water flowing out of the wetland during the day v p c p the volume of precipitation falling onto the wetland during the day v e v a p the volume of water removed from the wetland by et during the day and v s e e p the volume of water lost from the wetland by seepage during the day note that v f l o w i n is calculated based on the fraction of water draining into a wetland from a sub watershed including surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow swat assumes outflow v f l o w o u t to occur whenever water stored in a wetland exceeds its normal storage volume v n o r as 2 v f l o w o u t 0 i f v v n o r 3 v f l o w o u t v v n o r 10 i f v n o r v v m x 4 v f l o w o u t v v m x i f v v m x where v m x and v n o r are the volume of water held in a wetland at maximum and normal water levels respectively based on the daily volume of water stored in a wetland i e v in eq 1 the surface area of a wetland a w e t is calculated at the daily time step as 5 a w e t β v α where α and β are coefficients these coefficients are estimated as 6 α log 10 s a m x log 10 s a n o r log 10 v m x log 10 v n o r 7 β s a m x v m x α where s a m x and s a n o r are the surface water area of a wetland at maximum and normal water levels and v m x and v n o r the volume of water held in the wetland at maximum and normal water levels respectively further details are available from neitsch et al 2011 2 3 2 riparian wetland module rwm the riparian wetland module rwm developed by liu et al 2008 explicitly simulates the bi directional exchange of water flow and sediments between a rw and the main stream segment in a sub watershed for example rwm calculates the water balance of a rw v r as 8 v r v r s t o r e d v r f l o w i n v r f l o w o u t v r p c p v r e v a p v r s e e p v r r c h f l o w all the components in eq 8 are identical to eq 1 except that eq 8 includes v r r c h f l o w the volume of surface and sub surface water exchange between rws and reach the subscript r denotes simulation of riparian wetlands note that the rwm simulates water flows from upland into a stream segment nrws and rws separately as it divides the sub watershed into three drainage zones i e riparian wetland non riparian wetland and stream drainage zones fig 3 the rwm estimates the amount of inflow i e contributing upland flow into three drainage zones according to its areal fraction relative to the total sub watershed area note that v r f l o w i n can be estimated from surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow surface area within a rw is estimated similar to the nrw module eqs 5 7 after a slight modification liu et al 2008 fig 4 illustrates the conceptual scheme that outlines the lateral exchange of water flows between a rw and a stream segment as in liu et al 2008 rwm assumes that wetland water level at its normal depth is equivalent to reach water level at its bank full depth then the lateral surface flow exchange occurs under high flow conditions when wetland water level is higher than its normal depth and or the channel water level is higher than the bank full depth liu et al 2008 describes how the channel water depth can be estimated using rating curves based on channel geometry watershed drainage characteristics and manning s equation as in swat the lateral subsurface flow exchange occurs when the water level is between the bottom and the bankfull level for both the wetland and stream reach and the groundwater flow exchange was estimated by darcy s law liu et al 2008 lateral subsurface flow exchange follows similar iterative algorithm as the lateral surface flow exchange illustrated in fig 4 groundwater flow from upland areas is assumed to pass under rws i e no groundwater inflow to rws from upland areas and directly contributes to streams if water level in the stream is lower than the bottom of the rws liu et al 2008 see liu et al 2008 for further details 2 4 parameterization of wetlands 2 4 1 delineation of rws and nrws rwm defines rws as those wetlands that intersect nearby streams and assumes rws to have bi directional exchange with nearby streams see discussion in 2 3 2 we identified rws within the study watershed by following this operational definition in liu et al 2008 this operational definition requires the exclusion of two particular groups of rws which are most unlikely to have bi directional exchange with streams the first is headwater wetlands these are initiating intermittent headwater streams that typically have one directional flow into the stream mcdonough et al 2015 the other is wetlands directly connected to artificial ditches which are extensively developed in the region to drain wetlands to local streams during periods of low et denver et al 2014 instead of using commonly available stream maps e g usgs national hydrography dataset nhd that are known to underrepresent streams and ditch length in the study site lang et al 2012 we used a high resolution lidar dem to delineate a more detailed accurate stream network a high resolution lidar dem and the built in stream definition function in arcswat winchell et al 2010 with multiple drainage density thresholds were used to create detailed drainage networks the high resolution stream map helped to identify and isolate those nwi polygons that belong to two particular groups described above we delineated stream maps by applying different drainage area thresholds and then selected one that did not intersect these two particular groups of nwi polygons the delineation was done based on our local knowledge field observation and visual inspection of the study site with high resolution images the selected stream map was overlaid with nwi polygons which were processed to aggregate wetlands in close proximity with 10 cm threshold using the arcgis cartography tool esri redlands ca arcgis v 10 2 those nwi polygons which intersect with the stream map were considered rws and the remaining as non riparian wetlands nrws aggregated areas of rws and nrws identified through this procedure were 13 4 km2 and 21 1 km2 accounting for 6 0 and 9 5 of the tcw respectively 2 4 2 model parameterization for wetlands data and geospatial processing as aforementioned wetland modules compute a daily water balance within a wetland eqs 1 and 8 and then update its surface water area using the nonlinear volume surface area relationship eq 5 specified by two parameters i e α and β to estimate them detailed information on the surface area and volume of wetlands at normal and maximum water levels eqs 6 and 7 is required however such data rarely exist especially from field monitoring we used three geospatial datasets i e nwi map inundation maps and dem to calculate surface area under the two conditions i e normal and maximum water levels and applied the gis based methods shown in lane and d amico 2010 to estimate the water volume of wetlands this gis based method takes the average elevation of each wetland polygon boundary as the maximum stage height of a wetland and then estimates the maximum water storage volume using the arcgis 3d analyst tool lane and d amico 2010 the nwi was used to calculate surface water area at the maximum water level the nwi shows the spatial distribution and extent of wetlands tiner 1997 developed from high resolution aerial photographs or multispectral satellite images commonly collected on multiple dates the nwi dataset undergoes an extensive validation process tiner 1997 nwi polygons located within a close proximity were spatially aggregated and then partitioned into sub watersheds based on the spatial distribution and positioning this partitioning resulted in slivers i e the extremely small portion of the nwi polygon to a sub watershed see examples from fig 5 a those slivers were removed for further processing we used the median elevation value instead of the average as shown in lane and d amico 2010 of the polygon boundary as the maximum water stage and calculated the maximum water volume we then aggregated the maximum surface area and storage volume separately for nrws and rws at the sub watershed scale use of nwi data as part of this study will lead to a higher level of uncertainty that the use of detailed filed data this is due in part to the lack of contemporary nwi data in some portions of the us and the difficulty of identifying some wetland types using remotely sensed data morrissey and sweeney 2006 dvorett et al 2012 however the use of field data is not practical and nwi geospatial dataset is the most accurate as well as spatially and categorically detailed wetland map available for the us the resolution and geopositional accuracy necessary to quantify the spatial relationships between wetlands and adjacent streams simply isn t present in any other us national or regional wetland dataset nwi is also the most suitable dataset for simulating hydrologic models since it provides spatially explicit wetland boundaries and positions as well as information on hydrologic regimes furthermore multiple studies have found the accuracy of nwi to meet the needs of their applications kudray and gale 2000 tiner 2005 surface water area at the normal water level was estimated from the inundation map derived with the landsat image acquired in early spring of 2007 huang et al 2014 jin et al 2017 fig 6 the inundation maps showed surface water fraction swf or percent inundation within a 30 m landsat pixel in early spring the landsat images used for inundation mapping were taken several days before after precipitation events it was because inundated areas could be overestimated right after precipitation events we selected the 2007 inundation map to capture typical patterns of surface water area at the normal spring water level as weather condition and seasonal streamflow were shown to be normal according to the pdsi and the long term records of streamflow and precipitation over last 30 years in addition the 2007 map was evaluated with extensive field data collected at the study site providing confidence for this spatial dataset lang et al 2009 huang et al 2014 jin et al 2017 surface area at the normal water level was estimated by calculating a weighted sum of inundation pixels using swf as a weight the normal water volume was computed after we delineated contiguous inundated polygons which show the edge of the flooded area this data processing involved multiple steps as follows 1 conversion of inundation pixels into polygons 2 aggregation of inundation polygons in a close proximity with a threshold 10 cm and 3 filling holes island polygon if any inside aggregated inundation polygon fig 5b we applied the gis based method by lane and d amico 2010 to estimate normal water volume using the 2007 map and dem the normal depth of rw required for simulating the lateral water exchange between rws and streams fig 4 was estimated by simply dividing the aggregate water volume by the aggregate surface area at the sub watershed scale assuming the geometry of this hypothetical wetland as a cubic liu et al 2008 the spatial distribution of inundated areas could be irregular and uneven relative to the nwi polygon coverage fig 5c for example some sub watersheds e g 22 and 23 in fig 5c contained a very small portion of wetlands aggregated nwi which did not show any sign of inundation in this case we estimated inundated area using the original nwi polygon prior to aggregation fig 5d the inundation maps derived from a 30 meter landsat pixel could be limited to accurately estimate the volume and depth of small wetlands vanderhoof et al 2017 however these maps show the degree of inundation at 30 m pixel the fraction of 30 m pixel being inundated based on a higher resolution lidar 2 m and therefore they have better applicability for small wetlands compared to the other categorical binary wetland maps the volume estimation method by lane and d amico 2010 requires the elevation value of wetland perimeter that can be captured based on the explicit boundary of wetlands we used the elevation of inundation pixel perimeter due to unavailability of explicit wetland boundary at the normal water level caused by a coarser pixel size of the inundation map and therefore the normal wetland volume and depth may be inaccurately calculated however the landsat image is freely available relatively high resolution data that can provide the time records of inundation in a consistent manner use of higher spatial resolution image data to map inundation for small wetlands is relatively limited due to high cost and short temporal coverage klemas and pieterse 2015 therefore the landsat image is the most appropriate data to identify inundation patterns at the landscape level through time 2 5 model calibration and validation swat was simulated at a daily time step over 10 years including 2 year warm up 1999 2000 5 year calibration 2001 2005 and 3 year validation 2006 2008 we calibrated swat twice against observed streamflow collected at the outlet of the watershed fig 7 following liu et al 2008 this calibration scheme may reveal the importance of wetland processes within the watershed system particularly on the routing process see discussion below and this may be reflected from changed parameter values during the second calibration for the first calibration wetland modules were turned off referred to as flow wo and 18 parameters deemed to be most sensitive to streamflow were manually calibrated based on previous swat modeling studies conducted in the study watershed sexton et al 2010 yeo et al 2014 lee et al 2016 table 2 model calibration was conducted manually by adjusting parameter values within an allowable range following the swat model technical guideline selected were those parameter values that produced the best model performances while meeting swat performance criteria outlined by moriasi et al 2007 for the second calibration wetland modules referred to as flow w were turned on five parameters in bold font in table 2 that control the routing processes e g surface water and groundwater routing to stream segments and then to watershed outlet via the main channels were further fine tuned assuming wetlands could affect flow routing liu et al 2008 but the conditions for other parameters e g selected parameters range of parameter values initial value or number of iteration were forced to be set the same as the first calibration wetland parameters developed in section 2 4 2 were directly used for the second calibration and other parameters required for wetland modules were set as the default values in swat table 2 the following statistical performance measures were considered to assess model performance during the calibration nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean squared error rmse standard deviation ratio rsr and percent bias p bias moriasi et al 2007 the equations for three statistics are provided in the section a of our supplementary material 2 6 evaluation of inundated area prediction spatial pattern analysis despite the fact that semi distributed hydrological models are used for a wide variety of applications it is not always possible to find spatialized parameter values within modeling units the implication of imposing uniform spatial parameters or characteristics on simulated spatial results e g inundated areas is not easily measurable as model performance is generally tested against aggregated hydrological variables in this case simulation results can be equally acceptable regardless of the degree of spatial heterogeneity imposed on parameters or process representation we illustrate this problem with rwm using the three sets referred to as set a b and c of wetland parameters as discussed in section 2 4 3 rwm requires information on the surface area and volume of wetlands at normal and maximum water level to define the nonlinear volume surface area relationship due to limited field data little was available to characterize the inundation dynamics varying by locations and a uniform assumption on wetland characteristics e g depth and relative change was typically made liu et al 2008 wu and johnston 2008 records et al 2014 we illustrate how the simulated inundated areas differed by imposing varying degree of spatial heterogeneity on wetland inundation characteristics at the sub watershed scale table 3 note that the sub watershed scale is the elementary modeling unit of rwm swat delineates a sub watershed as a drainage area of each stream segment and wetland are aggregated and interact with stream segment within a sub watershed the first set set a i e wetland parameters from inundation maps was prepared using spatially explicit information from inundation maps and nwi as in section 2 4 2 two additional sets set b and c were prepared by assuming uniform wetland characteristics for the entire watershed except for the maximum surface area delineated by nwi following typical approaches used in previous studies liu et al 2008 wu and johnston 2008 records et al 2014 for set b and c it was assumed all wetland have the same characteristics i e normal and maximum depth and the proportion of normal area relative to maximum surface area these values in set b were determined by taking mean values of set a to represent uniform wetland characteristics these values in set c was directly adopted from the values used in liu et al 2008 as it described parameters for forested wetlands the most dominant type of wetlands at the study site fig 8 illustrates the differences in the parameter values from set a c summarized by stream order and hierarchy the simulated inundated areas within rws were compared with inundation maps at the sub watershed scale since the focus of this study was to evaluate rwm we only assessed the inundation pattern of rws in addition the default wetland module of swat does not provide the daily surface area of nrws and it is not straightforward to assess inundation within nrw inundated extent estimated as a weighted sum of inundation pixels as discussed in section 2 4 2 within rws from inundation maps were spatially aggregated at the sub watershed scale and this was served as the baseline for the comparison we computed the spearman s rank order correlation coefficient r s to statistically measure similarity between the simulated and observed inundated areas after ranking inundated areas aggregated at the sub watershed scale from the largest to the smallest and calculating differences d in ranks between the observed and the simulated inundation the correlation coefficient r s was computed as 9 r s 1 6 i 1 n d 2 n n 2 1 where n is the number of sub watersheds that included rws n 60 as r s is closer to 1 the simulated is more closely matched to the observed in addition a mean squared error mse was computed to quantify the difference between the observed and the predicted moriasi et al 2007 as 10 m s e 1 n i 1 n p i y i 2 where p i is predicted inundated area ha within rws and y i observed from inundation maps the spatial pattern analysis was performed with annual inundation maps delineated over the period of 2001 2008 under different weather conditions the 2007 inundation map was excluded from the analysis as it was used to develop set a section 2 4 2 and the model calibration 2 7 evaluation of inter annual variability of wetland water storage we analyzed seasonal variations in the water stored in rws by stream hierarchy it was to investigate whether spatial wetland parameterization set a better captured local wetland characteristics and inter annual variability in wetland function compared to two other sets with uniform wetland characteristics sets b and c we computed 8 year monthly averages and coefficient of variation i e mean normalized by the standard deviation of wetland water storage the monthly means and coefficients of variations were categorized by stream order and compared to each other in total there were 60 rws aggregated at the sub watershed scale in total there were 60 rws aggregated at the sub watershed scale we analyzed 57 rws excluding those outliers with extremely high water storage values outliers were those whose water storage values were more than 1 5 times the interquartile ranges above the third quartiles or below the first quartiles tukey 1977 outlier detection was made per rw sub groups categorized by stream order 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation daily observations of streamflow at the outlet of the tcw were compared with simulated streamflow without the wetland modules flow wo and then those with the modules flow w fig 9 overall the simulation output was in good agreement with corresponding observations of streamflow the model performance statistics computed with daily simulation table 4 met evaluation criteria outlined by moriasi et al 2007 although nse and rsr estimated during the calibration period was slightly below the satisfactory rank however it should be noted these criteria and accuracy ratings moriasi et al 2007 were established based on monthly simulation and our study used a daily simulation period use of more relaxed criteria was recommended for daily simulation as model prediction naturally becomes less accurate at a finer time step moriasi et al 2007 indeed these statistical performance measures when computed using the monthly simulation outputs aggregated from the same daily simulation were shown to exceed the satisfactory criteria table 4 overall both simulations flow w and flow wo provide very similar results as indicated from very close parameterizations table 2 the overall performance statistics measured by the nse or rsr values seemed to be slightly improved with wetland modules table 4 but the differences were insignificant we noted that flow w was slightly lower than flow wo at peak flow events this was probably because the wetland module simulated wetland water storage i e the portion of inflow received from uplands that was stored in wetlands and then released slowly over time to the stream the wetland module was expected to reduce streamflow after precipitation and during wet periods while both simulations deemed to provide satisfactory outcomes against streamflow these statistics did not show the evidence that the addition of wetland modules significantly improved prediction it was probably because the relative long term effects of wetlands on streamflow were small hence both models were calibrated very similarly against streamflow and showed similar prediction while the overall modeled discharge pattern depicted seasonal variations and low flows well it did not capture peak streamflow after large storm events this study tested 3000 sets of parameter combinations to calibrate the model although the calibrated model indicated an acceptable performance more thorough calibration e g increasing simulation numbers and tuning parameters affecting peak flow might improve prediction for peak flows arnold et al 2012 in addition inaccurate simulation of peak flow can be potentially attributed from the inherent limitation of swat and input climate data the scs cn method used in swat has a limited ability to accurately predict storm effects because its surface runoff calculation does not consider the duration and intensity of precipitation kim and lee 2008 neitsch et al 2011 qiu et al 2012 climate input data were acquired from two weather stations located either 15 or 35 km away from the study watershed these datasets did not capture localized storm effects and instead provided inaccurate spatial distribution of rainfalls over the study area sexton et al 2010 yeo et al 2014 lastly the simulations with a shorter time step e g daily time step were shown to have less accuracy on predicting stream flow compared to those with longer time steps e g monthly or annual time step arnold et al 2012 3 2 effects of wetland parameterization on simulated inundated areas streamflow outputs that were simulated using with the three different wetland parameter sets were very similar to each other fig 10 however the spatial distribution of simulated inundated areas within rws varied with different parameterizations figs 11 13 while all parameter sets predicted the distribution of inundated area reasonably with rwm r s 0 68 with p value 0 01 the spatial pattern of predicted inundation derived from set a showed the highest correlation with inundation maps r s 0 86 with p value 0 01 with a much lower mse value compared to those from sets b and c fig 11ab sets b and c considerably overestimated absolute inundated areas on upstream sub watersheds e g 1 4 and 8 in fig 3 by 8 ha and underestimated those on downstream sub watersheds e g 53 60 66 and 69 in fig 3 by 35 ha compared to observed inundation resulting in a large mse value fig 11b fig 12 illustrates how well simulated inundation patterns with different parameterization sets matched with inundation maps under different weather conditions i e dry normal and wet weather conditions were determined according to monthly pdsi and long term records of streamflow and precipitation regardless of weather conditions inundation maps showed increasing inundation downstream following the hierarchical structure of the stream network and associated floodplain inundation maps consistently showed most inundated area near the outlet where tuckahoe lake is located and the sub watershed located immediately downstream of the confluence of two main upstream channels the inundation maps showed less inundation in upstream areas regardless of weather conditions fig 12 simulated inundation from set a replicated this spatial pattern quite well for all sub watersheds with varying degrees of inundation under different weather conditions fig 13 as indicated by the small mse value however this spatial pattern was less pronounced within simulated results from sets b and c set b resulted in underestimation of inundated area particularly for those sub watersheds that included larger inundation extent i e downstream sub watersheds regardless of weather conditions spatial inundation prediction from set b remained more uniform for most sub watersheds with predicted inundated areas under 10 ha figs 12 and 13 while set c showed more variable estimates of inundated areas compared to set b resulting spatial patterns of inundation in upstream sub watersheds did not follow a logical distribution the spatial pattern evaluation was made once per year using the inundation maps generated with the lidar and landsat records collected in early spring it was when most wetlands in the study area remained inundated for a short period as the level of evapotranspiration was low lang and mccarty 2009 and standing surface water under canopies was detectable from optical sensors it was difficult to map inundation for other growing seasons leaf on seasons with optical images and to evaluate the inundation spatial patterns for other seasons we noticed the largest disagreement between simulated and referenced inundation patterns was shown in 2004 fig 13a this could be resulted from mapping errors caused by the processing algorithm or image data quality land cover maps derived from remotely sensed data have some degree of uncertainty while overall accuracy of the inundation maps was quite high 93 for the coastal plain of the cbw jin et al 2017 the quality of each inundation map varies depending on image condition and training data samples used in the mapping algorithm for example the 2004 map showed more noticeable anomalies in swf than other maps due to overfitting this overfitting was caused by insufficient training samples and this could be reduced by including varying degree of inundation in training samples when developing mapping algorithms jin et al 2017 this technical problem likely misrepresented inundated areas and resulted in the largest disagreement between simulated and observed inundation patterns in 2004 the limitation of remotely sensed data products and associated mapping errors should be considered when developing the parameters or assessing the prediction uncertainty 3 3 spatial parameterization to improve understanding of wetland function fig 14 shows 8 year monthly averages of water volume stored in 57 rws with different parameterization sets categorized by stream order overall all simulation results regardless of stream orders showed that water stored gradually decreased from spring to summer and increased during winter season it followed patterns exhibited in local field based studies fisher et al 2010 denver et al 2014 however the amount of water stored in rws when analyzed by stream order varied by different parameterizations set a exhibited much lower water storage in upstream rws 1st and 2nd order streams but higher in downstream rws 4th order stream sets b and c predicted relatively less difference in stored volume between upstream and downstream rws the seasonal variation in water storage remained relatively constant within these two sets as exhibited by the monthly coefficient of variation which remained constant throughout year regardless of stream order the seasonal variation in water stored in rws predicted by set a offers important insights to infer spatially varying wetland functions at the landscape scale in this study site the simulation results highlight the potentials of rws located on downstream areas due to great inundation pattern therefore downstream rws would likely have greater impacts on hydrological processes e g water retention and purification under different weather conditions compared to those in upstream areas the representation of spatially varying wetland hydrologic characteristics imposed by set a helps to realize the value of downstream rws and identify critical locations in need of wetland conservation restoration 4 summary and conclusion at the study site significant efforts are being made to restore wetlands and the water quality benefits that they provide strategic targeting and prioritizing of areas for restoration require spatially explicit knowledge regarding wetland hydro geochemical functions and their interaction with the surrounding landscape recent advances in integrated wetland and watershed modeling offer the opportunity to study cumulative impacts of wetlands and their spatial interactions with surrounding areas with improved process representation however improved models still suffer from the model prediction uncertainty e g spatial pattern of inundation and related wetland function has been rarely evaluated due to the limited field data improved models are commonly calibrated and evaluated against aggregated hydrological variables such as streamflow and resulted model performance statistics may not provide the evidence for improved prediction with add on processes such practice do not offer insights onto the underlying internal processes and wetland dynamics imposed by the enhanced model in this study we illustrated such problems and highlighted the need for spatial data to guide modeling practice and support decision making using the default version of swat and rwm swat we showed how two models could be calibrated very similarly against streamflow leading to very similar streamflow predictions however the improved prediction by rwm swat became clear and significant when 1 it was parameterized using spatial data to constrain surface water area and volume under the normal weather condition and 2 its spatial prediction on inundated areas was evaluated in addition to streamflow wetland inundation dynamics and changes in soil moisture i e hydroperiod are a key abiotic factor that controls wetland functioning and hence a crucial simulation need the large uncertainty in predicted inundation pattern can significantly decrease vital information content when inferring location dependent wetland function to guide landscape scale decision making site specific information such as reference inundation data is needed to guide spatial parameterization for wetlands e g wetland geometry and the area volume relationship and assess the predicted results however it is rarely available recently developed inundation maps with lidar intensity and landsat time series data provide crucial site information these maps show surface water fraction swf or inundation percentage at a 30 m resolution in early spring on an annual basis we demonstrated how this new spatial information can be used to constrain and generate the landscape level wetland parameters as required by semi distributed hydrologic models such as swat while rwm was constrained using only one inundation map from the normal weather condition spatialized wetland characteristics set a developed from inundation map better captured inundated area under varying weather conditions compared to those uniform wetland characteristics set b and c the comparison of three different parameter sets highlights the importance of spatial characterization parameterization and model evaluation using remotely sensed data soft data hence the relative value of spatial information to improve the model prediction seibert and mcdonnell 2002 as the availability of lidar and landsat data as well as in situ information increase more accurate long term inundation data should be used to develop wetland parameters and evaluate the spatial prediction of inundation in particular the inundation maps that we used were produced during the leaf off season early spring as dense plant canopies would obscure the ground surface from being observed by optical sensors e g landsat the successful launch of the landsat 8 and sentinel 1 2 missions may help to overcome this data limitation and may offer unprecedented opportunities to improve the spatial prediction of inundation through wetland modeling the use of synthetic aperture radar sar data e g sentinel 1 can improve the ability to map and monitor seasonal inundation of wetlands as longer wavelength microwave signals can penetrate the tree canopy and detect the underlying ground lang et al 2008 with the launch of landsat 8 and sentinel 1 2 a continuous stream of satellite data is now freely available for monitoring land cover with a higher temporal coverage the continuous inundation maps derived from the use of satellite optical and radar data will be extremely useful to better understand the spatial processes that control wetland functioning aid spatial parameterization via data assimilation and improve the capability of integrated wetland

26136,this study presents an integrated wetland watershed modeling approach that capitalizes on inundation maps and geospatial data to improve spatial prediction of wetland inundation and assess its prediction uncertainty we outline problems commonly arising from data preparation and parameterization used to simulate wetlands within a semi distributed watershed model we demonstrate how wetland inundation can be better captured by the wetland parameters developed from remotely sensed data we then emphasize assessing model prediction using inundation maps derived from remotely sensed data this integrated modeling approach is tested using the soil and water assessment tool swat with an improved riparian wetlands rws extension for an agricultural watershed in the mid atlantic coastal plain us this study illustrates how spatially distributed information is necessary to predict inundation of wetlands and hydrologic function at the local landscape scale where monitoring and conservation decision making take place keywords wetland watershed modeling approach inundation maps wetland inundation soil and water assessment tool swat software availability the swat program is freely downloadable from the following site http swat tamu edu software 1 introduction wetlands provide important ecosystem services such as mitigating flood damage hillman 1998 improving water quality by reducing pollution loads cooper 1990 and serving as natural habitats to support biodiversity nygaard and ejrnæs 2009 these functions highly depend on wetland hydrology determined by its interactions with surrounding areas tiner 2005 kettlewell et al 2008 for example denitrification process is triggered by anaerobic condition within a wetland and incoming nitrate loads which are driven by water inflow to wetlands from the surrounding landscape cooper 1990 wetlands in turn exert a strong influence on the characteristics and functioning of downstream waters usepa 2015 therefore it is important to understand wetland hydrology as it relates to upstream and downstream landscapes to assess the cumulative benefits of wetlands at the watershed scale usepa 2015 it is challenging to predict wetland hydrology owing to complex hydrologic connections between wetlands and surrounding areas via surface and subsurface interactions ranalli and macalady 2010 computational models have been developed to simulate wetland hydrology at the individual site scale for example modflow was used to simulate hydro dynamics of wetlands induced by surface flow and interactions with aquifers restrepo et al 1998 and its groundwater recharge function under different weather conditions bradley 2012 wetland lee et al 2002 and wetland solute transport dynamics wetsand kazezyılmaz alhan et al 2007 were developed to simulate plant uptake and denitrification process within a wetland these models were able to simulate water and nutrient cycling at the site but the results were confined to individual wetlands thus they could not represent the cumulative impacts of multiple wetlands on downstream waters at the watershed scale recently spatially distributed watershed models have been applied to examine catchment scale benefits of wetlands by including a wetland module as a component in a distributed watershed model vining 2002 simulated the devils lake basin wetlands model to estimate water storage capacity of wetlands and its effects on downstream water balance at the watershed scale padmanabhan and bengtson 2001 used the hydrologic engineering center hec 1 model to evaluate the integrated impacts of wetlands on mitigating flooding in a large drainage area 4150 km2 hattermann et al 2006 predicted the impacts of wetlands on overall water and nutrient budgets for an agricultural watershed using the soil and water integrated model swim the soil and water assessment tool swat has been applied to investigate various water quality and hydrological benefits of wetlands for agricultural watersheds gassman et al 2007 for example swat was applied to assess wetland effects on streamflow during wet and dry periods wu and johnston 2008 to predict the impacts of wetland restoration and losses on water quantity and quality wang et al 2010 yang et al 2010 records et al 2014 martinez martinez et al 2014 2015 and to identify optimal locations for wetland restoration to improve water quality and mitigate flood damage babbar sebens et al 2013 comín et al 2014 swat similar to other semi distributed watershed models oversimplified physical processes and representation of wetlands in a watershed context swat simulates the lumped effect of multiple wetlands within a sub watershed neitsch et al 2011 for example multiple wetlands within a sub watershed are spatially aggregated and simulated as one the size of this hypothetical wetland is assumed to be equivalent to the aggregated areal extent of multiple wetlands located within a sub watershed its upland area is set by the relative proportion of aggregated drainage areas of multiple wetlands to a sub watershed and its location is positioned at the outlet of the sub watershed hence outflow from an aggregated wetland is directly transported to the next downstream sub watershed this simplification significantly reduces computational demands however it disregards spatially variable wetland interactions with surrounding areas and local groundwater systems such as recharge feng et al 2013 mclaughlin et al 2014 evenson et al 2015 2016 and the hydrological exchange with streams and groundwater along stream channels within a sub watershed liu et al 2008 conceptually and spatially agglomerated representation of wetlands can be a large source of uncertainty in model prediction zhang et al 2011 several attempts are being made to improve wetland processes by disaggregating and modifying wetland representation by different types feng et al 2013 while considering hydrological connection with surrounding areas evenson et al 2015 2016 and nearby streams liu et al 2008 however it still remains unclear if enhanced model capabilities would lead to improved prediction on wetland function and dynamics this is because simulation results with enhanced capabilities have been often evaluated against aggregate hydrological variables e g streamflow nutrient and sediment loads referred to as hard data in seibert and mcdonnell 2002 collected at the watershed outlet liu et al 2008 evenson et al 2015 while changes were made to improve spatial processes and patterns the relative improvement in aggregated response may not offer any insight into the internal hydrological processes i e hydrological interactions between wetlands and surrounding areas thus the assessment on the modeled dynamics and wetland functions i e spatial results remains incomplete swat similar to other wetland models estimates change in inundation extent i e water levels using a wetland water volume surface area relationship this relationship is specified by four wetland parameters i e surface area and volume within a wetland at normal and maximum water levels required is spatially explicit information that describes the geomorphic and inundation characteristics of individual wetlands however such data rarely exist and thus these parameters have often been set to represent uniform characteristics for all wetlands regardless of spatial locations and site characteristics liu et al 2008 wu and johnston 2008 records et al 2014 furthermore spatially explicit in situ data that can be used to evaluate predicted inundation within multiple wetlands under different conditions rarely exist to cope with data scarcity it has been suggested that qualitative data i e soft data in seibert and mcdonnell 2002 derived from expert knowledge literature and extensive field monitoring of similar sites be used these data have been used to constrain a range of model parameter values for calibration seibert and mcdonnell 2002 2013 vaché and mcdonnell 2006 julich et al 2012 or to qualitatively evaluate if modeled behaviors and internal processes are reasonable seibert and mcdonnell 2002 remotely sensed data provide synoptic information on the spatial distribution of various hydrological variables e g precipitation soil moisture and inundation at multiple spatial and temporal scales nielsen et al 2008 huang et al 2014 with improved technology and increasing coverage significant efforts are being made to integrate remotely sensed data products e g soil moisture and vegetation into various land surface models the aim is to reduce the degree of equifinality i e many different parameter sets are equally good at reproducing an output signal beven 2006 using observed spatial patterns to reduce ambiguity in the input data change states condition parameters and represented processes and improve model prediction e g soil moisture and streamflow via data assimilation loumagne et al 2001 the results seem to be promising particularly at the regional or global scale when coupled with conceptual models however data assimilation was shown to be unsatisfactory when tested with more complex spatially distributed process based models such as swat at a local catchment scale chen et al 2011 moreover most routinely collected remotely sensed data products of hydrological variables e g soil moisture are acquired at a coarse spatial resolution tens of kilometers lakshmi 2013 and therefore are limited in their utility for characterizing small to moderate size wetlands which are dominant on the landscape on the other hand commonly available wetland mapping products are categorical maps at much higher spatial resolution e g us fish and wildlife service

are difficult to map due to the presence of the forest canopy and the fact that inundation and saturation in these wetland is often ephemeral inundation maps were produced annually using landsat images and lidar intensity data acquired in early spring jin et al 2017 when most standing water within a wetland was viewable due to the leaf off status of forest canopy lang et al 2012 huang et al 2014 when applied to watersheds in the coastal plain physiographic province of the chesapeake bay watershed cbw spatial patterns of inundation reflected different weather conditions and followed the change trend of streamflow huang et al 2014 jin et al 2017 in this paper we present an integrated wetland watershed modeling approach that capitalizes on time series inundation maps with an aim to improve prediction on wetland inundation using a case study we illustrate the limitations of using catchment scale streamflow to evaluate improved model representation for riparian wetlands then we highlight the needs for additional spatial data to parameterize a wetland module and to demonstrate its improvement by analyzing spatial results indicating wetland inundation we outline problems commonly arising from input data preparation to represent spatially aggregated wetlands within a semi distributed watershed model we demonstrate how wetland inundation can be better captured by setting wetland parameters developed from inundation map derived from remotely sensed data we then place particular emphasis on assessing model prediction using inundation maps under different weather conditions this integrated modeling approach was tested with swat and riparian wetland module rwm an improved swat extension for riparian wetlands rws and hence our analysis on the effects of improved parameterization and process focused on assessing spatial patterns of inundation from riparian wetlands 2 data and method 2 1 study area the tuckahoe creek watershed tcw 220 7 km2 is located on the upper region of the choptank river watershed in the coastal plain of the cbw fig 1 the choptank river watershed is on the list of impaired watersheds designated by the us environmental protection agency usepa due to excessive sediment and nutrient loads from agricultural lands mccarty et al 2008 the site has been selected as one of the us department of agriculture usda conservation effects assessment project ceap benchmark watersheds and extensively monitored and studied it is characterized by a relative flat topography fig 2 a with humid and temperate climate ator et al 2005 overall soils are evenly split between well drained usda classification of hydrologic soil group hsg a or b and poorly drained soils hsg c or d fig 2b land use is mainly comprised of agriculture 51 3 and forest 38 4 followed by pasture 8 5 urban areas 1 4 and water bodies 0 3 fig 2c the study site includes abundant forested wetlands such as wetland depressions e g delmarva bays wetland flats and riparian wetlands lang et al 2012 according to the nwi map most forested areas are indeed forested wetlands and the total coverage of wetlands is about 34 5 km2 accounting for 15 5 of the entire tcw fig 2d the majority of forested wetlands are known to be seasonally inundated for a relatively short time period in early spring when et is low leading to seasonally high groundwater level tiner and burke 1995 2 2 soil and water assessment tool swat model an overall approach to watershed simulation swat is a semi distributed continuous process based watershed model it has been widely used to simulate hydrology nutrient cycling and sediment loads in an agricultural watershed neitsch et al 2011 swat partitions a watershed into sub watersheds the draining area of the stream segment and further into hydrologic response units hrus based on unique combination of land use soil type and slope the mass balance transport and cycling of hydrologic and water quality variables are simulated at each hru whose outputs aggregated for the sub watershed and then routed to the outlet of the watershed through channel processes swat uses the soil conservation service scs curve number cn method to compute surface runoff and infiltration which is determined based on soil s permeability land use and antecedent soil water conditions the penman monteith method was used to simulate et refer to neitsch et al 2011 for further details swat input data consist of various geospatial and climate data table 1 a high resolution lidar based digital elevation model dem land use map and soil survey geographical database ssurgo were used to characterize the study site and delineate stream network sub watersheds and hrus in total the watershed was divided into 71 sub watersheds and further into 573 hrus by applying the threshold of 10 20 and 20 to land use soil type and slope respectively delineation processes are fully described in winchell et al 2010 daily precipitation and temperature were obtained from three weather stations located near the tcw operated by noaa national climate data center ncdc chestertown usc00181750 royal oak usc00187806 and greensboro us1mdcl0009 daily solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were not monitored so they were generated using swat s built in weather generator neitsch et al 2011 daily streamflow data collected at the outlet of the tcw was obtained from the us geological survey usgs gauge station 01491500 fig 1 a commonly available drought index i e palmer drought severity index pdsi was used to characterize weather conditions e g drought normal and wet based on historic climate records it was downloaded from the noaa ncdc for the climate division md region 5 within where the study watershed is situated 2 3 representation of wetland processes this study used the built in conventional wetland module in swat to simulate non riparian wetlands nrws and the improved riparian wetland module rwm liu et al 2008 for riparian wetlands rws this sub section briefly describes the two modules 2 3 1 non riparian wetlands nrws module swat treats a wetland like an impoundment and simulates its hydrological effects at the sub watershed scale neitsch et al 2011 it aggregates wetlands distributed within a sub watershed then this lumped wetland is assumed to be located at the outlet of the sub watershed neitsch et al 2011 and its water balance is calculated at a daily time step as eq 1 1 v v s t o r e d v f l o w i n v f l o w o u t v p c p v e v a p v s e e p where v is the volume of water stored in a wetland at the end of the day v s t o r e d the volume of water stored in the wetland at the beginning of the day v f l o w i n the volume of water entering the wetland during the day v f l o w o u t the volume of water flowing out of the wetland during the day v p c p the volume of precipitation falling onto the wetland during the day v e v a p the volume of water removed from the wetland by et during the day and v s e e p the volume of water lost from the wetland by seepage during the day note that v f l o w i n is calculated based on the fraction of water draining into a wetland from a sub watershed including surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow swat assumes outflow v f l o w o u t to occur whenever water stored in a wetland exceeds its normal storage volume v n o r as 2 v f l o w o u t 0 i f v v n o r 3 v f l o w o u t v v n o r 10 i f v n o r v v m x 4 v f l o w o u t v v m x i f v v m x where v m x and v n o r are the volume of water held in a wetland at maximum and normal water levels respectively based on the daily volume of water stored in a wetland i e v in eq 1 the surface area of a wetland a w e t is calculated at the daily time step as 5 a w e t β v α where α and β are coefficients these coefficients are estimated as 6 α log 10 s a m x log 10 s a n o r log 10 v m x log 10 v n o r 7 β s a m x v m x α where s a m x and s a n o r are the surface water area of a wetland at maximum and normal water levels and v m x and v n o r the volume of water held in the wetland at maximum and normal water levels respectively further details are available from neitsch et al 2011 2 3 2 riparian wetland module rwm the riparian wetland module rwm developed by liu et al 2008 explicitly simulates the bi directional exchange of water flow and sediments between a rw and the main stream segment in a sub watershed for example rwm calculates the water balance of a rw v r as 8 v r v r s t o r e d v r f l o w i n v r f l o w o u t v r p c p v r e v a p v r s e e p v r r c h f l o w all the components in eq 8 are identical to eq 1 except that eq 8 includes v r r c h f l o w the volume of surface and sub surface water exchange between rws and reach the subscript r denotes simulation of riparian wetlands note that the rwm simulates water flows from upland into a stream segment nrws and rws separately as it divides the sub watershed into three drainage zones i e riparian wetland non riparian wetland and stream drainage zones fig 3 the rwm estimates the amount of inflow i e contributing upland flow into three drainage zones according to its areal fraction relative to the total sub watershed area note that v r f l o w i n can be estimated from surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow surface area within a rw is estimated similar to the nrw module eqs 5 7 after a slight modification liu et al 2008 fig 4 illustrates the conceptual scheme that outlines the lateral exchange of water flows between a rw and a stream segment as in liu et al 2008 rwm assumes that wetland water level at its normal depth is equivalent to reach water level at its bank full depth then the lateral surface flow exchange occurs under high flow conditions when wetland water level is higher than its normal depth and or the channel water level is higher than the bank full depth liu et al 2008 describes how the channel water depth can be estimated using rating curves based on channel geometry watershed drainage characteristics and manning s equation as in swat the lateral subsurface flow exchange occurs when the water level is between the bottom and the bankfull level for both the wetland and stream reach and the groundwater flow exchange was estimated by darcy s law liu et al 2008 lateral subsurface flow exchange follows similar iterative algorithm as the lateral surface flow exchange illustrated in fig 4 groundwater flow from upland areas is assumed to pass under rws i e no groundwater inflow to rws from upland areas and directly contributes to streams if water level in the stream is lower than the bottom of the rws liu et al 2008 see liu et al 2008 for further details 2 4 parameterization of wetlands 2 4 1 delineation of rws and nrws rwm defines rws as those wetlands that intersect nearby streams and assumes rws to have bi directional exchange with nearby streams see discussion in 2 3 2 we identified rws within the study watershed by following this operational definition in liu et al 2008 this operational definition requires the exclusion of two particular groups of rws which are most unlikely to have bi directional exchange with streams the first is headwater wetlands these are initiating intermittent headwater streams that typically have one directional flow into the stream mcdonough et al 2015 the other is wetlands directly connected to artificial ditches which are extensively developed in the region to drain wetlands to local streams during periods of low et denver et al 2014 instead of using commonly available stream maps e g usgs national hydrography dataset nhd that are known to underrepresent streams and ditch length in the study site lang et al 2012 we used a high resolution lidar dem to delineate a more detailed accurate stream network a high resolution lidar dem and the built in stream definition function in arcswat winchell et al 2010 with multiple drainage density thresholds were used to create detailed drainage networks the high resolution stream map helped to identify and isolate those nwi polygons that belong to two particular groups described above we delineated stream maps by applying different drainage area thresholds and then selected one that did not intersect these two particular groups of nwi polygons the delineation was done based on our local knowledge field observation and visual inspection of the study site with high resolution images the selected stream map was overlaid with nwi polygons which were processed to aggregate wetlands in close proximity with 10 cm threshold using the arcgis cartography tool esri redlands ca arcgis v 10 2 those nwi polygons which intersect with the stream map were considered rws and the remaining as non riparian wetlands nrws aggregated areas of rws and nrws identified through this procedure were 13 4 km2 and 21 1 km2 accounting for 6 0 and 9 5 of the tcw respectively 2 4 2 model parameterization for wetlands data and geospatial processing as aforementioned wetland modules compute a daily water balance within a wetland eqs 1 and 8 and then update its surface water area using the nonlinear volume surface area relationship eq 5 specified by two parameters i e α and β to estimate them detailed information on the surface area and volume of wetlands at normal and maximum water levels eqs 6 and 7 is required however such data rarely exist especially from field monitoring we used three geospatial datasets i e nwi map inundation maps and dem to calculate surface area under the two conditions i e normal and maximum water levels and applied the gis based methods shown in lane and d amico 2010 to estimate the water volume of wetlands this gis based method takes the average elevation of each wetland polygon boundary as the maximum stage height of a wetland and then estimates the maximum water storage volume using the arcgis 3d analyst tool lane and d amico 2010 the nwi was used to calculate surface water area at the maximum water level the nwi shows the spatial distribution and extent of wetlands tiner 1997 developed from high resolution aerial photographs or multispectral satellite images commonly collected on multiple dates the nwi dataset undergoes an extensive validation process tiner 1997 nwi polygons located within a close proximity were spatially aggregated and then partitioned into sub watersheds based on the spatial distribution and positioning this partitioning resulted in slivers i e the extremely small portion of the nwi polygon to a sub watershed see examples from fig 5 a those slivers were removed for further processing we used the median elevation value instead of the average as shown in lane and d amico 2010 of the polygon boundary as the maximum water stage and calculated the maximum water volume we then aggregated the maximum surface area and storage volume separately for nrws and rws at the sub watershed scale use of nwi data as part of this study will lead to a higher level of uncertainty that the use of detailed filed data this is due in part to the lack of contemporary nwi data in some portions of the us and the difficulty of identifying some wetland types using remotely sensed data morrissey and sweeney 2006 dvorett et al 2012 however the use of field data is not practical and nwi geospatial dataset is the most accurate as well as spatially and categorically detailed wetland map available for the us the resolution and geopositional accuracy necessary to quantify the spatial relationships between wetlands and adjacent streams simply isn t present in any other us national or regional wetland dataset nwi is also the most suitable dataset for simulating hydrologic models since it provides spatially explicit wetland boundaries and positions as well as information on hydrologic regimes furthermore multiple studies have found the accuracy of nwi to meet the needs of their applications kudray and gale 2000 tiner 2005 surface water area at the normal water level was estimated from the inundation map derived with the landsat image acquired in early spring of 2007 huang et al 2014 jin et al 2017 fig 6 the inundation maps showed surface water fraction swf or percent inundation within a 30 m landsat pixel in early spring the landsat images used for inundation mapping were taken several days before after precipitation events it was because inundated areas could be overestimated right after precipitation events we selected the 2007 inundation map to capture typical patterns of surface water area at the normal spring water level as weather condition and seasonal streamflow were shown to be normal according to the pdsi and the long term records of streamflow and precipitation over last 30 years in addition the 2007 map was evaluated with extensive field data collected at the study site providing confidence for this spatial dataset lang et al 2009 huang et al 2014 jin et al 2017 surface area at the normal water level was estimated by calculating a weighted sum of inundation pixels using swf as a weight the normal water volume was computed after we delineated contiguous inundated polygons which show the edge of the flooded area this data processing involved multiple steps as follows 1 conversion of inundation pixels into polygons 2 aggregation of inundation polygons in a close proximity with a threshold 10 cm and 3 filling holes island polygon if any inside aggregated inundation polygon fig 5b we applied the gis based method by lane and d amico 2010 to estimate normal water volume using the 2007 map and dem the normal depth of rw required for simulating the lateral water exchange between rws and streams fig 4 was estimated by simply dividing the aggregate water volume by the aggregate surface area at the sub watershed scale assuming the geometry of this hypothetical wetland as a cubic liu et al 2008 the spatial distribution of inundated areas could be irregular and uneven relative to the nwi polygon coverage fig 5c for example some sub watersheds e g 22 and 23 in fig 5c contained a very small portion of wetlands aggregated nwi which did not show any sign of inundation in this case we estimated inundated area using the original nwi polygon prior to aggregation fig 5d the inundation maps derived from a 30 meter landsat pixel could be limited to accurately estimate the volume and depth of small wetlands vanderhoof et al 2017 however these maps show the degree of inundation at 30 m pixel the fraction of 30 m pixel being inundated based on a higher resolution lidar 2 m and therefore they have better applicability for small wetlands compared to the other categorical binary wetland maps the volume estimation method by lane and d amico 2010 requires the elevation value of wetland perimeter that can be captured based on the explicit boundary of wetlands we used the elevation of inundation pixel perimeter due to unavailability of explicit wetland boundary at the normal water level caused by a coarser pixel size of the inundation map and therefore the normal wetland volume and depth may be inaccurately calculated however the landsat image is freely available relatively high resolution data that can provide the time records of inundation in a consistent manner use of higher spatial resolution image data to map inundation for small wetlands is relatively limited due to high cost and short temporal coverage klemas and pieterse 2015 therefore the landsat image is the most appropriate data to identify inundation patterns at the landscape level through time 2 5 model calibration and validation swat was simulated at a daily time step over 10 years including 2 year warm up 1999 2000 5 year calibration 2001 2005 and 3 year validation 2006 2008 we calibrated swat twice against observed streamflow collected at the outlet of the watershed fig 7 following liu et al 2008 this calibration scheme may reveal the importance of wetland processes within the watershed system particularly on the routing process see discussion below and this may be reflected from changed parameter values during the second calibration for the first calibration wetland modules were turned off referred to as flow wo and 18 parameters deemed to be most sensitive to streamflow were manually calibrated based on previous swat modeling studies conducted in the study watershed sexton et al 2010 yeo et al 2014 lee et al 2016 table 2 model calibration was conducted manually by adjusting parameter values within an allowable range following the swat model technical guideline selected were those parameter values that produced the best model performances while meeting swat performance criteria outlined by moriasi et al 2007 for the second calibration wetland modules referred to as flow w were turned on five parameters in bold font in table 2 that control the routing processes e g surface water and groundwater routing to stream segments and then to watershed outlet via the main channels were further fine tuned assuming wetlands could affect flow routing liu et al 2008 but the conditions for other parameters e g selected parameters range of parameter values initial value or number of iteration were forced to be set the same as the first calibration wetland parameters developed in section 2 4 2 were directly used for the second calibration and other parameters required for wetland modules were set as the default values in swat table 2 the following statistical performance measures were considered to assess model performance during the calibration nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean squared error rmse standard deviation ratio rsr and percent bias p bias moriasi et al 2007 the equations for three statistics are provided in the section a of our supplementary material 2 6 evaluation of inundated area prediction spatial pattern analysis despite the fact that semi distributed hydrological models are used for a wide variety of applications it is not always possible to find spatialized parameter values within modeling units the implication of imposing uniform spatial parameters or characteristics on simulated spatial results e g inundated areas is not easily measurable as model performance is generally tested against aggregated hydrological variables in this case simulation results can be equally acceptable regardless of the degree of spatial heterogeneity imposed on parameters or process representation we illustrate this problem with rwm using the three sets referred to as set a b and c of wetland parameters as discussed in section 2 4 3 rwm requires information on the surface area and volume of wetlands at normal and maximum water level to define the nonlinear volume surface area relationship due to limited field data little was available to characterize the inundation dynamics varying by locations and a uniform assumption on wetland characteristics e g depth and relative change was typically made liu et al 2008 wu and johnston 2008 records et al 2014 we illustrate how the simulated inundated areas differed by imposing varying degree of spatial heterogeneity on wetland inundation characteristics at the sub watershed scale table 3 note that the sub watershed scale is the elementary modeling unit of rwm swat delineates a sub watershed as a drainage area of each stream segment and wetland are aggregated and interact with stream segment within a sub watershed the first set set a i e wetland parameters from inundation maps was prepared using spatially explicit information from inundation maps and nwi as in section 2 4 2 two additional sets set b and c were prepared by assuming uniform wetland characteristics for the entire watershed except for the maximum surface area delineated by nwi following typical approaches used in previous studies liu et al 2008 wu and johnston 2008 records et al 2014 for set b and c it was assumed all wetland have the same characteristics i e normal and maximum depth and the proportion of normal area relative to maximum surface area these values in set b were determined by taking mean values of set a to represent uniform wetland characteristics these values in set c was directly adopted from the values used in liu et al 2008 as it described parameters for forested wetlands the most dominant type of wetlands at the study site fig 8 illustrates the differences in the parameter values from set a c summarized by stream order and hierarchy the simulated inundated areas within rws were compared with inundation maps at the sub watershed scale since the focus of this study was to evaluate rwm we only assessed the inundation pattern of rws in addition the default wetland module of swat does not provide the daily surface area of nrws and it is not straightforward to assess inundation within nrw inundated extent estimated as a weighted sum of inundation pixels as discussed in section 2 4 2 within rws from inundation maps were spatially aggregated at the sub watershed scale and this was served as the baseline for the comparison we computed the spearman s rank order correlation coefficient r s to statistically measure similarity between the simulated and observed inundated areas after ranking inundated areas aggregated at the sub watershed scale from the largest to the smallest and calculating differences d in ranks between the observed and the simulated inundation the correlation coefficient r s was computed as 9 r s 1 6 i 1 n d 2 n n 2 1 where n is the number of sub watersheds that included rws n 60 as r s is closer to 1 the simulated is more closely matched to the observed in addition a mean squared error mse was computed to quantify the difference between the observed and the predicted moriasi et al 2007 as 10 m s e 1 n i 1 n p i y i 2 where p i is predicted inundated area ha within rws and y i observed from inundation maps the spatial pattern analysis was performed with annual inundation maps delineated over the period of 2001 2008 under different weather conditions the 2007 inundation map was excluded from the analysis as it was used to develop set a section 2 4 2 and the model calibration 2 7 evaluation of inter annual variability of wetland water storage we analyzed seasonal variations in the water stored in rws by stream hierarchy it was to investigate whether spatial wetland parameterization set a better captured local wetland characteristics and inter annual variability in wetland function compared to two other sets with uniform wetland characteristics sets b and c we computed 8 year monthly averages and coefficient of variation i e mean normalized by the standard deviation of wetland water storage the monthly means and coefficients of variations were categorized by stream order and compared to each other in total there were 60 rws aggregated at the sub watershed scale in total there were 60 rws aggregated at the sub watershed scale we analyzed 57 rws excluding those outliers with extremely high water storage values outliers were those whose water storage values were more than 1 5 times the interquartile ranges above the third quartiles or below the first quartiles tukey 1977 outlier detection was made per rw sub groups categorized by stream order 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation daily observations of streamflow at the outlet of the tcw were compared with simulated streamflow without the wetland modules flow wo and then those with the modules flow w fig 9 overall the simulation output was in good agreement with corresponding observations of streamflow the model performance statistics computed with daily simulation table 4 met evaluation criteria outlined by moriasi et al 2007 although nse and rsr estimated during the calibration period was slightly below the satisfactory rank however it should be noted these criteria and accuracy ratings moriasi et al 2007 were established based on monthly simulation and our study used a daily simulation period use of more relaxed criteria was recommended for daily simulation as model prediction naturally becomes less accurate at a finer time step moriasi et al 2007 indeed these statistical performance measures when computed using the monthly simulation outputs aggregated from the same daily simulation were shown to exceed the satisfactory criteria table 4 overall both simulations flow w and flow wo provide very similar results as indicated from very close parameterizations table 2 the overall performance statistics measured by the nse or rsr values seemed to be slightly improved with wetland modules table 4 but the differences were insignificant we noted that flow w was slightly lower than flow wo at peak flow events this was probably because the wetland module simulated wetland water storage i e the portion of inflow received from uplands that was stored in wetlands and then released slowly over time to the stream the wetland module was expected to reduce streamflow after precipitation and during wet periods while both simulations deemed to provide satisfactory outcomes against streamflow these statistics did not show the evidence that the addition of wetland modules significantly improved prediction it was probably because the relative long term effects of wetlands on streamflow were small hence both models were calibrated very similarly against streamflow and showed similar prediction while the overall modeled discharge pattern depicted seasonal variations and low flows well it did not capture peak streamflow after large storm events this study tested 3000 sets of parameter combinations to calibrate the model although the calibrated model indicated an acceptable performance more thorough calibration e g increasing simulation numbers and tuning parameters affecting peak flow might improve prediction for peak flows arnold et al 2012 in addition inaccurate simulation of peak flow can be potentially attributed from the inherent limitation of swat and input climate data the scs cn method used in swat has a limited ability to accurately predict storm effects because its surface runoff calculation does not consider the duration and intensity of precipitation kim and lee 2008 neitsch et al 2011 qiu et al 2012 climate input data were acquired from two weather stations located either 15 or 35 km away from the study watershed these datasets did not capture localized storm effects and instead provided inaccurate spatial distribution of rainfalls over the study area sexton et al 2010 yeo et al 2014 lastly the simulations with a shorter time step e g daily time step were shown to have less accuracy on predicting stream flow compared to those with longer time steps e g monthly or annual time step arnold et al 2012 3 2 effects of wetland parameterization on simulated inundated areas streamflow outputs that were simulated using with the three different wetland parameter sets were very similar to each other fig 10 however the spatial distribution of simulated inundated areas within rws varied with different parameterizations figs 11 13 while all parameter sets predicted the distribution of inundated area reasonably with rwm r s 0 68 with p value 0 01 the spatial pattern of predicted inundation derived from set a showed the highest correlation with inundation maps r s 0 86 with p value 0 01 with a much lower mse value compared to those from sets b and c fig 11ab sets b and c considerably overestimated absolute inundated areas on upstream sub watersheds e g 1 4 and 8 in fig 3 by 8 ha and underestimated those on downstream sub watersheds e g 53 60 66 and 69 in fig 3 by 35 ha compared to observed inundation resulting in a large mse value fig 11b fig 12 illustrates how well simulated inundation patterns with different parameterization sets matched with inundation maps under different weather conditions i e dry normal and wet weather conditions were determined according to monthly pdsi and long term records of streamflow and precipitation regardless of weather conditions inundation maps showed increasing inundation downstream following the hierarchical structure of the stream network and associated floodplain inundation maps consistently showed most inundated area near the outlet where tuckahoe lake is located and the sub watershed located immediately downstream of the confluence of two main upstream channels the inundation maps showed less inundation in upstream areas regardless of weather conditions fig 12 simulated inundation from set a replicated this spatial pattern quite well for all sub watersheds with varying degrees of inundation under different weather conditions fig 13 as indicated by the small mse value however this spatial pattern was less pronounced within simulated results from sets b and c set b resulted in underestimation of inundated area particularly for those sub watersheds that included larger inundation extent i e downstream sub watersheds regardless of weather conditions spatial inundation prediction from set b remained more uniform for most sub watersheds with predicted inundated areas under 10 ha figs 12 and 13 while set c showed more variable estimates of inundated areas compared to set b resulting spatial patterns of inundation in upstream sub watersheds did not follow a logical distribution the spatial pattern evaluation was made once per year using the inundation maps generated with the lidar and landsat records collected in early spring it was when most wetlands in the study area remained inundated for a short period as the level of evapotranspiration was low lang and mccarty 2009 and standing surface water under canopies was detectable from optical sensors it was difficult to map inundation for other growing seasons leaf on seasons with optical images and to evaluate the inundation spatial patterns for other seasons we noticed the largest disagreement between simulated and referenced inundation patterns was shown in 2004 fig 13a this could be resulted from mapping errors caused by the processing algorithm or image data quality land cover maps derived from remotely sensed data have some degree of uncertainty while overall accuracy of the inundation maps was quite high 93 for the coastal plain of the cbw jin et al 2017 the quality of each inundation map varies depending on image condition and training data samples used in the mapping algorithm for example the 2004 map showed more noticeable anomalies in swf than other maps due to overfitting this overfitting was caused by insufficient training samples and this could be reduced by including varying degree of inundation in training samples when developing mapping algorithms jin et al 2017 this technical problem likely misrepresented inundated areas and resulted in the largest disagreement between simulated and observed inundation patterns in 2004 the limitation of remotely sensed data products and associated mapping errors should be considered when developing the parameters or assessing the prediction uncertainty 3 3 spatial parameterization to improve understanding of wetland function fig 14 shows 8 year monthly averages of water volume stored in 57 rws with different parameterization sets categorized by stream order overall all simulation results regardless of stream orders showed that water stored gradually decreased from spring to summer and increased during winter season it followed patterns exhibited in local field based studies fisher et al 2010 denver et al 2014 however the amount of water stored in rws when analyzed by stream order varied by different parameterizations set a exhibited much lower water storage in upstream rws 1st and 2nd order streams but higher in downstream rws 4th order stream sets b and c predicted relatively less difference in stored volume between upstream and downstream rws the seasonal variation in water storage remained relatively constant within these two sets as exhibited by the monthly coefficient of variation which remained constant throughout year regardless of stream order the seasonal variation in water stored in rws predicted by set a offers important insights to infer spatially varying wetland functions at the landscape scale in this study site the simulation results highlight the potentials of rws located on downstream areas due to great inundation pattern therefore downstream rws would likely have greater impacts on hydrological processes e g water retention and purification under different weather conditions compared to those in upstream areas the representation of spatially varying wetland hydrologic characteristics imposed by set a helps to realize the value of downstream rws and identify critical locations in need of wetland conservation restoration 4 summary and conclusion at the study site significant efforts are being made to restore wetlands and the water quality benefits that they provide strategic targeting and prioritizing of areas for restoration require spatially explicit knowledge regarding wetland hydro geochemical functions and their interaction with the surrounding landscape recent advances in integrated wetland and watershed modeling offer the opportunity to study cumulative impacts of wetlands and their spatial interactions with surrounding areas with improved process representation however improved models still suffer from the model prediction uncertainty e g spatial pattern of inundation and related wetland function has been rarely evaluated due to the limited field data improved models are commonly calibrated and evaluated against aggregated hydrological variables such as streamflow and resulted model performance statistics may not provide the evidence for improved prediction with add on processes such practice do not offer insights onto the underlying internal processes and wetland dynamics imposed by the enhanced model in this study we illustrated such problems and highlighted the need for spatial data to guide modeling practice and support decision making using the default version of swat and rwm swat we showed how two models could be calibrated very similarly against streamflow leading to very similar streamflow predictions however the improved prediction by rwm swat became clear and significant when 1 it was parameterized using spatial data to constrain surface water area and volume under the normal weather condition and 2 its spatial prediction on inundated areas was evaluated in addition to streamflow wetland inundation dynamics and changes in soil moisture i e hydroperiod are a key abiotic factor that controls wetland functioning and hence a crucial simulation need the large uncertainty in predicted inundation pattern can significantly decrease vital information content when inferring location dependent wetland function to guide landscape scale decision making site specific information such as reference inundation data is needed to guide spatial parameterization for wetlands e g wetland geometry and the area volume relationship and assess the predicted results however it is rarely available recently developed inundation maps with lidar intensity and landsat time series data provide crucial site information these maps show surface water fraction swf or inundation percentage at a 30 m resolution in early spring on an annual basis we demonstrated how this new spatial information can be used to constrain and generate the landscape level wetland parameters as required by semi distributed hydrologic models such as swat while rwm was constrained using only one inundation map from the normal weather condition spatialized wetland characteristics set a developed from inundation map better captured inundated area under varying weather conditions compared to those uniform wetland characteristics set b and c the comparison of three different parameter sets highlights the importance of spatial characterization parameterization and model evaluation using remotely sensed data soft data hence the relative value of spatial information to improve the model prediction seibert and mcdonnell 2002 as the availability of lidar and landsat data as well as in situ information increase more accurate long term inundation data should be used to develop wetland parameters and evaluate the spatial prediction of inundation in particular the inundation maps that we used were produced during the leaf off season early spring as dense plant canopies would obscure the ground surface from being observed by optical sensors e g landsat the successful launch of the landsat 8 and sentinel 1 2 missions may help to overcome this data limitation and may offer unprecedented opportunities to improve the spatial prediction of inundation through wetland modeling the use of synthetic aperture radar sar data e g sentinel 1 can improve the ability to map and monitor seasonal inundation of wetlands as longer wavelength microwave signals can penetrate the tree canopy and detect the underlying ground lang et al 2008 with the launch of landsat 8 and sentinel 1 2 a continuous stream of satellite data is now freely available for monitoring land cover with a higher temporal coverage the continuous inundation maps derived from the use of satellite optical and radar data will be extremely useful to better understand the spatial processes that control wetland functioning aid spatial parameterization via data assimilation and improve the capability of integrated wetland

26137,most spatiotemporal studies treat spatial and temporal analysis separately however spatial and temporal changes occur simultaneously and are correlated in this study we propose a generic framework to simultaneously analyse the spatial and temporal variations of water quality on a catchment scale specifically we analyse the heterogeneity of temporal evolution of water quality data among different sampling sites and the heterogeneity of spatial distribution of water quality data over different sampling times respectively by integrating the techniques of normalized mutual information dynamic time wrapping and cluster analysis to bring deep insight into the spatiotemporal variations inter change and intra change are further defined and distinguished respectively taking the fuxi river catchment as a case study results indicate that the proposed framework is intuitive and efficient beyond this the generic framework can be expanded for other catchments and various

water quality data variation analysis the water quality of a river can be attributed to both natural processes and anthropogenic activities including surface runoff abbaspour et al 2007 climate change whitehead et al 2009 geological structure bilgin and konanç 2016 land use sliva and williams 2001 ding et al 2015 and sewage discharge zhen and zhu 2016 different atmospheric inputs climatic conditions and anthropogenic inputs may result in spatial variation of water quality in rivers bricker and jones 1995 on the other hand seasonal variation in precipitation may cause river discharge variations and subsequently affect the concentration of pollutants in river water vega et al 1998 therefore a good understanding of temporal and spatial variations of water quality on a catchment scale is of great importance for water pollution control aquatic ecosystem restoration and water management by regional communities bu et al 2010 iscen et al 2008 the methods for temporal and or spatial analysis on water quality data have developed from univariate analysis to multivariate analysis in the early stage spatial and or temporal analysis of water quality data mainly focused on a single argument laznik et al 1999 niu et al 2004 this kind of analysis method cannot fit well to more and more complex water challenges with the development of computer science multivariate statistical analysis methods have grown mainly including principal component analysis pca principal factor analysis pfa factor analysis fa cluster analysis ca and discriminant analysis da singh et al 2004 smeti and golfinopoulos 2016 these multivariate statistical techniques have been well accepted and widely applied in water quality assessments shrestha and kazama 2007 iscen et al 2008 wang et al 2013 particularly for key parameter extraction and main pollution source identification for instance applying ca and fa bu et al 2010 grouped 12 sampling sites into three pollution level clusters no pollution moderate pollution and high pollution and identified five factors of pollution sources for the jinshui river of the south qinling mountains in china wang et al 2013 applied ca and pca fa to evaluate temporal spatial variations in water quality and identify latent sources of water pollution in the songhua river harbin region china smeti and golfinopoulos 2016 applied da on surface water quality data of yliki lake to determine which variables were the most efficient in discriminating between clusters however most existing spatiotemporal variation analytical works treat the temporal and spatial analysis of water quality data separately for instance ouyang et al 2006 assessed the seasonal variations in surface water quality in the lower st johns river wang et al 2013 performed the temporal and spatial cluster analysis of water quality in the songhua river harbin region separately classifying monitoring time into three periods and classifying monitoring stations into three groups chang 2008 conducted spatial analysis of water quality trends in the han river basin south korea however the co occurrence and correlation of temporal and spatial variations were not thoroughly considered during the previous spatiotemporal variation assessment therefore an approach which allows to comprehensively analyse the temporal and spatial variations of water quality data simultaneously is highly needed especially in the context of a changing environment it is essential to study the spatiotemporal variations of water quality data so as to adapt to climate change and environment deterioration 1 2 aims and objectives this paper aims to propose a generic framework to simultaneously analyse the spatiotemporal variations of water quality data on a catchment scale the importance of this paper lies in teaching environmental engineers and scientists without a computational background to systemically analyse temporal and spatial variations of water quality data in a more effective intuitive and easier way the objectives of this paper are as follows 1 to analyse how the spatial distributions of water quality data change over time 2 to analyse the spatial heterogeneity of temporal evolution of water quality data and 3 to demonstrate the procedure and verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework taking a water quality dataset in fuxi river catchment as a typical example 2 study area and data acquisition 2 1 study area to demonstrate the proposed framework any catchment could have been chosen for illustration here the fuxi river catchment is used as a case study as the authors are familiar with this example catchment and reliable data have been collected by trusted sources the fuxi river catchment 28 58 29 46 n 103 43 105 36 e fig 1 covers 3490 km2 of drainage area with a mainstream fuxi river length of 73 2 km a bending coefficient of 2 21 and an average gradient of 0 27 according to the recorded hydrological data the natural multiple annual average runoff in the fuxi river catchment is 42 25 m3 s and the measured annual average runoff is 19 26 m3 s the meteorological data indicate that the average annual precipitation is 1023 mm 58 in july and august and the mean temperature is 17 8 c the altitude ranges from 250 m to 500 m the land use in the catchment is dominated by farmland about 70 which contributes to non point pollution of fuxi river the fuxi river is one of the first level tributaries of the tuojiang river which is located in the southwest of china it originates from the xushui river length of 118 km source in the west and the weiyuan river length of 123 km source in the north joining as the mainstream at shuanghekou fig 1 site 4 further downstream the tieqian river and the zhenxi river join the fuxi river which finally flows into the tuojiang river the locations of seven sampling sites are presented in table 1 site 1 is located on weiyuan river sites 2 and 3 are by the xushui river and the other sites are selected on the mainstream of fuxi river fig 1 the fuxi river is the only watercourse flowing across zigong city and is regarded as the mother river by local citizens zigong city is one of 50 cities facing serious water shortages in china with a population of 3 30 million in 2013 and per capita water resources of 585 m3 accounting for 18 84 of the provincial level sichuan province in recent years with the rapid economic development and population growth the water quality in the fuxi river has degraded considerably the degradation grades differ at different times e g eutrophication often shows up during the dry season and different locations e g water quality is worse downstream water quality in the catchment exhibits temporal and spatial variations and makes water pollution control challenging 2 2 data acquisition water quality data in the study area were provided by the environmental protection agency of zigong city china the dataset consists of ten water quality variables at seven sampling stations with monthly records from january 2012 to december 2014 a basic summary of the water quality data is presented in table 2 here the authors use it as a representative dataset of water quality measurements on a catchment scale to illustrate the proposed new method for extended applications the studied variables the number of variables and the number of sampling stations could be different depends on specific practices 3 framework and the fundamental techniques 3 1 overview of the framework an overview of the proposed framework to analyse the spatiotemporal variation of water quality data is presented in fig 2 in general the framework consists of two routes the first route is to analyse the heterogeneity of temporal evolution of water quality among different sampling sites namely how the water quality of each sampling site evolves over time and is the temporal evolution of water quality at different sampling sites similar or not the second route focuses on the heterogeneity of spatial distribution of water quality over time as the water quality is usually spatially distributed i e different sampling sites show different levels of water quality the second route aims to answer the question does the spatial distribution of water quality evolves over time and how does this happen beyond this to systematically explore the spatiotemporal variations inter change and intra change of each route are further defined respectively specifically inter change of the first route focuses on the temporal variation of water quality among different sampling sites for intra change it characterizes the differences of inner temporal clusters generated from each sampling site similarly the inter change of the second route refers to the difference of spatial distribution of water quality among different sampling times while the intra change means the difference among inner spatial clusters generated at each sampling time to capture the similarities of the inter and intra changes of water quality data normalized mutual information nmi and dynamic time warping dtw were integrated more detailed descriptions of how to use the framework can be found in the following subsections 3 2 to 3 4 3 2 analysis on heterogeneity of temporal evolution at different sites for a catchment water quality often varies with time due to climatic or and anthropic factors furthermore different sites generally show different temporal variations of water quality to study the heterogeneity of temporal evolution of water quality at different sites two perspectives are considered one is from the inter change view which aims to investigate which sampling sites have similar temporal evolution another is from the intra change view which aims to study which sampling sites exhibit similar change of inner temporal pattern 3 2 1 inter change analysis to investigate the heterogeneity of temporal evolution of water quality among different sampling sites at the inter change level the following steps are involved 1 dynamic time warping dtw is first extended to calculate the pair wise dissimilarity of the temporal evolution of water quality among different sampling sites specifically the water quality data of each sampling site is characterized as a multi variable time series for instance assume that a given water quality data set consists of k variables with w sampling sites k 10 and w 7 in our case study since the data of each variable are collected over time for a given sampling site we can use k time series to represent its data where each time series captures the values of one variable over time with the time series representation the dissimilarity between any two sampling sites for each water quality variable is calculated based on dynamic time warping and then the derived dissimilarities of all variables are averaged to quantify the dissimilarity of water quality between any two sampling sites the description of dtw will be introduced in section 3 4 1 2 based on the dissimilarity matrix cluster analysis is employed to partition of all sampling sites into different groups where the sites with similar temporal evolution characteristics tend to stay in the same group 3 2 2 intra change analysis to investigate the heterogeneity of temporal evolution of water quality among different sampling sites at the intra change level three steps are needed 1 first we investigate the temporal cluster on each sampling site via cluster analysis namely since the water quality of each sampling site evolves over time the time steps of similar water quality are identified for example given the water quality of a sampling site i in a certain period e g one year the cluster analysis is applied to investigate in which months the water quality is similar 2 next normalized mutual information is used to quantify the similarities of the derived temporal clusters at different sampling sites and 3 finally based on the similarity cluster analysis is used again to group the sampling sites into different clusters the sites having similar inner temporal pattern will fall into the same cluster 3 3 analysis on heterogeneity of spatial distributions over time the spatial distribution of water quality within a catchment may differ over time therefore it is essential to investigate what changes have happened in order to analyse the heterogeneity of temporal evolution at different sites section 3 2 and to study the heterogeneity of spatial destructions over time two aspects are also investigated inter change and intra change for inter change analysis the objective is to investigate the change of spatial distributions at different sampling times as for intra change the aim is to study the change of inner spatial patterns at different sampling times 3 3 1 inter change analysis to investigate the heterogeneity of spatial distributions at different sampling times at the inter change level the following two steps are performed 1 we regard the water quality data at each sampling time as a multi instance and then use euclidean distance to calculate the dissimilarity of spatial distribution of water quality among different sampling times for instance given water quality data with k variables sampling at w sites over m time points k 10 m 36 and w 7 in our case study the multi instance consists of w instances and each instance is a k dimensional feature vector the dissimilarity of spatial distribution of water quality between any two sampling times are thus transformed to compute the distance between the corresponding two multi instances specifically the euclidean distance for each instance is calculated and then distances for all w instances are averaged to obtain the dissimilarity between two multi instances 2 building upon the dissimilarity matrix we cluster all sampling times into different groups the sampling times which have similar spatial distributions of water quality tend to group together 3 3 2 intra change analysis to investigate the heterogeneity of temporal evolution of water quality among different sampling sites at the intra change level three steps are needed 1 first we investigate the temporal cluster on each sampling site via cluster analysis namely since the water quality of each sampling site evolves over time the time steps of similar water quality are identified for example given the water quality of a sampling site i in a certain period e g one year the cluster analysis is applied to investigate in which months the water quality is similar 2 normalized mutual information is used to quantify the similarities of the derived temporal clusters at different sampling sites 3 finally based on the similarity matrix cluster analysis is used again to group the sampling sites into different clusters therefore the sampling sites having similar inner temporal pattern will fall into the same cluster 3 4 fundamental techniques 3 4 1 dynamic time warping dtw dynamic time warping is a technique that identifies the optimal alignment of two time series to achieve this goal the time series are warped together non linearly by stretching or shrinking them along the time axes salvador and chan 2007 the dtw technique provides a good solution known for time series challenges in many domains including environment science jha and datta 2014 medicine pan and li 2016 shao et al 2010a 2010b engineering kim et al 2016 and entertainment kostoulas et al 2015 suppose we have two time series x and y equations 1 and 2 of lengths m and n respectively here m n 36 in our case study fig 3 where 1 x x 1 x 2 x i x m 2 y y 1 y 2 y j y n the objective is to optimise a warping path w equation 3 3 w w1 w2 wi wk where k is the length of w with max m n k m n 1 the kth element of w is a pair of indices indicating a connection of time points in x and y and is written as wk i j a warping path follows these constraints keogh and ratanamahatana 2005 1 boundary conditions w1 1 1 and wk m n this requires the warping path to start and finish in the first and last points of the series respectively 2 monotony given wk i j then wk 1 i j with i i 0 and j j 0 this forces the points in w to be monotonically spaced in time 3 continuity given wk i j then wk 1 i j with i i 1 and j j 1 this restricts the admissible steps in the warping path to adjacent points of the series there are many warping paths satisfying the above conditions in order to find a best match between two time series it looks for that path which minimizes the cumulative distance between them the distance dtw for this optimum path is defined in equation 4 4 d t w x y min i 1 k d w i where d is a distance function we use the euclidean distance in this study the optimum warping path for dtw x y can be obtained through a dynamical programming approach itakura 1975 it proceeds as follows first a m by n cost matrix d is constructed fig 3 a a component d i j is defined recursively as sum of the distance d i j and the minimum of the cumulative distances in the adjacent elements equation 5 5 d i j d i j m i n d i 1 j 1 d i 1 j d i j 1 3 4 2 cluster analysis cluster analysis is an unsupervised multi variate technique used to uncover the grouping structure of a given data set vega et al 1998 among the clustering approaches agglomerative hierarchical clustering gains wide popularity since it is simple intuitive and easy to interpret jain et al 1999 therefore we chose it to analyse the water quality data in this example case study agglomerative hierarchical clustering forms clusters sequentially by starting with the most similar pair of objects and merge higher clusters step by step steinbach et al 2000 to determine which clusters should be merged it requires a measure of similarity between sets of observations and the linkage criterion which is a function of the pair wise distances of observations the similarity of the clusters is determined by the corresponding measure of distance e g euclidean distance between pairs of observations for the merging criterion several alternatives have been proposed the most well known of which are single link average link complete link and ward s link olson 1995 various partitioning clusters can be obtained by cutting the hierarchy at various desired levels the higher the level the coarser the clustering is and the smaller is the number of clusters ward s link ward 1963 has been applied in this study the method works in a manner that the pair of clusters whose combination results in minimum increase in information loss are merged this happens on every possible pair of clusters at each stage of the hierarchical clustering information loss is defined by ward s link in terms of an error sum of squares ess criterion equation 6 6 ess n a n b n a n b x a x b 2 where ees is the error sum of squares x a and x b are the centroids of clusters a and b x a x b is the euclidean distance between the clusters a and b and n a and n b are the number of objects in clusters a and b 3 4 3 normalized mutual information nmi mutual information which is a symmetric measure to quantify the statistical information shared between two distributions cover and thomas 1991 provides a sound indication of the shared information between a pair of clustering the mutual information of two discrete random variables x and y is defined as 7 i x y y y x x p x y l o g 2 p x y p x p y where p x and p y are the probability functions of x and y and p x y is the joint probability function of variables of x and y as i x y has no upper bound for easier interpretation and comparisons a normalized mutual information ranging from 0 to 1 is defined in equations 8 10 witten and frank 2005 8 n m i x y 2 i x y h x h y 9 h x x x p x l o g 2 p x 10 h y y y p y l o g 2 p y h x and h y indicate the information entropy of x and y respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 overview this section presents the spatiotemporal analysis results of water quality by applying the proposed generic framework on fuxi river catchment the results include two parts the results of spatial heterogeneity of temporal evaluation of water quality and the results of distinct changes of spatial distribution over time in addition potential reasons behind the results have been discussed by integrating the meteorological environment agriculture and human activities in the studied catchment 4 2 spatial heterogeneity of temporal evolution of water quality 4 2 1 inter change assessment regarding the data of each water quality variable at one sampling site as a time series extended dtw is used to quantify the similarities of multi variable time series among different sampling sites fig 4 a shows the dissimilarities of seven sampling sites in terms of the temporal evolution of water quality based on dtw from the dissimilarity matrix we can observe that the sites 1 and 4 are most similar with the lowest distance the rational is that site 1 and site 4 are nearly located on the same branch of river furthermore the industrial water pollution sources are rare around site 1 and site 4 fig 4 b shows the dendrogram of cluster analysis based on the calculated similarities with a given split indicated by the dashed line the 7 sites can be grouped into 2 clusters where the water quality at sites 1 2 4 and 7 cluster 1 have similar temporal evolution patterns while the water quality at the other sites 3 5 and 6 cluster 2 exhibit similar temporal variation characteristics cluster 2 is consistent with the distribution of those industries which are intensively monitored see fig 1 this can be explained by industrial factories located near sites 3 5 and 6 discharging water pollutants in a certain pattern e g time amount into the river and thus worsening the water quality in the long term to improve the water quality of fuxi river zigong government may consider industrial discharge control to further validate our results the spatial variations of 10 water quality variables in the fuxi river catchment are presented in fig 5 by box whiskers plots showing the median 25th and 75th percentiles the bottom and top of the box are the first and third quartiles and the band inside the box is the median the whisker above and below the box represents the maximum and minimum of all data the cross represents outliers with three times the interquartile range 3iqr the box whiskers provide a statistical summary of each water quality variable of each individual sampling site where the median indicates the averaging value and the bottom and top of the box characterize the variation by first examining the medians of water quality variables we can see that the sites 3 5 and 6 have higher concentrations of bod5 than the others similarly the sites 3 and 5 show highest concentrations of cod while sites 5 and 6 also exhibit higher concentrations of nh4 n compared with other sites therefore water quality at sites 3 5 and 6 are similar from statistic perspective and worse than those of sites 1 2 4 and 7 that is because more industries discharge pollutants into the river causing the water quality to deteriorate in addition by examining the variance of the water quality variables we can observe that the sampling sites 3 5 and 6 are similar in most cases the similarity of median and variance gives a hint that the three sites may show a similar temporal evolution of water quality in summary in the fuxi river catchment sites 3 5 and 6 show similar temporal variation of water quality mainly due to industrial wastewater discharge in contrast sites 1 2 4 and 7 are grouped together as they indicate better water quality 4 2 2 intra change assessment to investigate the intra change of water quality s temporal variations cluster analysis was applied on the time series data of each site fig 6 plots the corresponding temporal clusters over the period between 2012 and 2014 and over each year specifically the sub figures on the left column of fig 6 show the temporal clusters over the whole period of 2012 2014 and the subfigures on the right three columns demonstrate the specific temporal clusters in each individual years not surprisingly different sampling sites exhibit different temporal clustering results for the annual scale and three year period i e the spatial heterogeneity of temporal distribution patterns on an annual scale water quality at most sites are clustered into two groups which roughly correspond to wet seasons generally from december to next may and dry seasons generally from june to november this is in line with the uneven distributions of precipitation and runoff in the catchment which implies that water quality s temporal variations are largely impacted by seasons the rationale is that in wet seasons more precipitation and runoff would dilute pollutants and thus improve water quality in contrast during dry seasons less rainfall and runoff will increase the concentration of the contaminants and thus lead to worse water quality specifically sites 1 and 3 obtained the same temporal cluster results jan may dec jun nov in 2012 sites 1 3 and 5 obtained the same cluster results jan may jun dec in 2013 sites 3 and 6 sites 2 and 5 and sites 1 and 7 formed the same cluster results respectively in 2014 here sites which achieve the same temporal cluster results mean they have similar temporal variation patterns in the specific year the differences of temporal clusters among different sampling sites might be due to the fact that the runoff is interfered with by humans such as setting up sluices on the river for irrigation purposes more broadly looking at the circumstances from the three year period different sites show various temporal clusters of water quality in general water quality at each sampling site can be roughly grouped into 2 clusters from jun to oct from nov to may corresponding to two hydrologic levels high flow period and low flow period time steps with similar precipitation and runoff tend to cluster together this can be further verified by the changes of precipitation and runoff during 2012 and 2014 fig 7 to quantify the similarity of these temporal clusters generated from each sampling site nmi is introduced the similarities of temporal clusters among different sampling sites are shown in fig 8 a afterwards based on the calculated nmi cluster analysis was reapplied and the dendrogram is presented in fig 8 b the dendrogram can be interpreted on two levels on a coarse level seven sites are grouped into two clusters c1 and c2 where site 7 is isolated from all the other sites which can be seen in the similarity matrix fig 8 a this implies that the water quality at site 7 has a different temporal structural pattern relative to those of the other sites the reason might be that site 7 is located at the outlet of the catchment the quality and quantity of water at other places would lead to water quality changes at site 7 under the complicated impacts of both climate and human activities in the catchment temporal change of water quality at site 7 is different from others on a fine grained lever c2 was further separated and seven sites can be divided into three clusters c1 7 c3 2 4 c4 1 3 5 6 which means that the water quality characteristics at sites 2 and 4 have more similar inner temporal change patterns and differ from those at sites 1 3 5 and 6 specifically sites 1 3 5 and 6 show similar temporal clusters in line with seasonal change which implies that water quality at these sites are mainly affected by precipitation in contrast water at the upstream of site 2 is mainly reserved for changhu reservoir used to supply drinking water while water between liaojiayan and shuanghekou site 4 is for the purpose of agricultural irrigation therefore the temporal changes of water quality at sites 2 and 4 are strongly interfered by humans and different from that of sites 1 3 5 and 6 in the long run climate change will affect the water quality temporal evolution and people hav eto take appropriate actions such as water storage water use to adapt to climate change water quality samples at sites 1 3 5 and 6 exhibit similar temporal variation which might be mainly because of precipitation change differently sites 2 and 4 show another temporal pattern of variation where human activities might be the main contributor water quality at site 7 shows a different temporal change pattern and the derived reason might be that both climate and human activities impact on that climate conditions e g precipitation and human activities e g drinking water storage irrigation are two main contributors to the spatial heterogeneity of temporal variation of water quality in the fuxi river catchment 4 3 distinct changes of spatial distribution over time 4 3 1 inter change assessment in this part regarding the spatial distribution of water quality at each sampling time as an instance the dissimilarity of these instances have been investigated based on euclidean distances fig 9 a shows the euclidean distances of water quality distribution among different sampling times from the distance matrix we can observe that time steps from june to november for each year are relatively closer it indicates that water quality parameters at these sampling times have similar spatial distributions the potential reasons are that precipitation during june and november wet season is relative high and thus it can mitigate water pollution at each site by diluting pollutants which finally reduce the spatial heterogeneity of water quality while during the dry season water quality is dominated by local conditions e g different pollutants different amount of discharge and water capacity and thus tend identification to reveal reasons for spatial heterogeneity is challenging therefore in the future people should be cautious concerning local water quality degradation especially during dry seasons based on the euclidean distance cluster analysis was utilised and the corresponding result is illustrated in fig 9 b the dendrogram can be divided into three clusters with the first cluster c1 mainly ranging from june to november summer and autumn and the second c2 and third cluster c3 both ranging from december to may winter and spring the difference between c2 and c3 is noticeable c2 mainly includes time steps of winter and spring in the year of 2014 while c3 primarily covers winter and spring time steps over the years of 2012 and 2013 these results reveal that the spatial distribution of water quality exhibits both seasonal and annual variations to verify the effectiveness of our results the temporal variations of ten water quality variables in the fuxi river catchment are displayed by box whiskers plots in fig 10 seen from the medians bands inside the boxes in fig 10 among ten water quality variables temperature shows the most obvious seasonal variation patterns for the years 2012 2014 followed by do cod and bod5 observed from the box variations from top to bottom in fig 8 a relatively high spatial variation of temperature appeared between april and june of 2012 and the high spatial variations of cod bod5 and nh4 n often happened in spring and early summer these findings are consistent with the cluster results in fig 9 b furthermore the concentrations of cod and nh4 in 2014 were stable small variations and kept at a low level which implies that water quality improved in 2012 and 2013 this also explain our findings that time steps in winter and spring for 2014 fell in a different cluster compared to those of 2012 and 2013 in summary water quality at time steps during june and november show similar spatial distributions since precipitation is intensive during this period and thus can dilute pollutants and reduce the spatial heterogeneity of water quality in contrast water quality in winter and spring share similar spatial distributions exhibiting larger spatial heterogeneity which might be due to the water quality during dry seasons being more impacted by local conditions 4 3 2 intra change assessment from the cluster perspective the variation of spatial distribution of water quality is studied cluster analysis using the ward distance is applied on water quality data at each sampling time and all the corresponding spatial cluster results are displayed in fig 9 apparently spatial distribution of water quality differs among different sampling times in general fig 11 indicates that the ward distances among different sampling sites become smaller and smaller on average from 2012 to 2014 especially for the period from january to august this implies that water quality at these sampling sites becomes more similar specifically ward distances among 7 sites larger than 1 5 appeared in march and april of 2012 and only in april of 2013 all ward distances of 7 sampling sites in 2014 were less than 1 to compare the differences of these generated spatial clusters from a perspective of entropy nmi is firstly applied to represent their similarities as illustrated in fig 12 a and cluster analysis is then performed based on the similarities fig 12 b presents the cluster results where the dendrogram can be split into three clusters by the user defined dash line the time steps represent numbered months jan 2012 to dec 2014 were numbered from 1 to 36 the first cluster c1 includes the numbered months 7 jul 2012 22 oct 2013 23 nov 2013 27 mar 2014 and 28 apr 2014 the third cluster c3 consists of time steps 25 jan 2014 33 sep 2014 34 oct 2014 and 31 jul 2014 and the other sampling times are grouped together c2 the time steps which fall into one group indicate that water quality variables at these sampling times have similar spatial distribution 4 4 application and extension of the framework and limitations the proposed framework can be applied to other catchments where there are continuous monitoring data of water quality from certain sampling points more than 2 points during a certain period suggest no less than 3 years when the computational results come out of the proposed framework we suggest users interpret the results and reasons behind the results by thoroughly identifying all kinds of natural and human factors in the studied catchment for better understanding furthermore the proposed framework can be extended to other environmental phenomenon studies on catchment scale such as air pollution noise pollution and climate change whereas there are different sampling sites in the study area and each site has a series of observations over a certain period the number of the variables are flexible depending on the research problems in practice and the data availability after finding the research problem and available data how can the framework be applied fig 13 gives a flowchart to guide users to apply the generic framework to other applications before spatiotemporal analysis data pre processing is usually needed such as normalization or noisy filtering if necessary the analysis mainly consists of two tasks one task is the analysis on heterogeneity of temporal evolution at different sites while another task is the analysis of change concerning spatial distributions over time the application and extension of the proposed framework is limited by data availability and data quality regarding data availability one aspect is that for long term continuous water quality monitoring data are generally owned by environment agencies and there is a lack of sharing detailed data internationally another aspect is that the number of data monitoring points are limited especially in remote areas due to economic and human resources costs there might be a missing data challenge missing data often result in uncertainty and imprecision of the analysis results therefore high data availability and good data quality are important prerequisites for using the proposed framework 5 conclusions and recommendations a generic framework for the spatiotemporal variations of water quality on the catchment scale has been proposed this framework includes two tasks of water quality analysis spatial heterogeneity of temporal evolution and changes of spatial distribution over time the results with respect to the specific case study indicate that our framework allows revealing the inter and intra change of water quality systematically and report the spatial and temporal changes of water quality simultaneously the proposed framework will provide environment scientists and managers with an intuitive and effectively tool for spatiotemporal analysis of water quality data allowing for better decision making on water pollution control and ecological restoration on a catchment scale in the future more research should be undertaken on extending the proposed framework to other

26137,most spatiotemporal studies treat spatial and temporal analysis separately however spatial and temporal changes occur simultaneously and are correlated in this study we propose a generic framework to simultaneously analyse the spatial and temporal variations of water quality on a catchment scale specifically we analyse the heterogeneity of temporal evolution of water quality data among different sampling sites and the heterogeneity of spatial distribution of water quality data over different sampling times respectively by integrating the techniques of normalized mutual information dynamic time wrapping and cluster analysis to bring deep insight into the spatiotemporal variations inter change and intra change are further defined and distinguished respectively taking the fuxi river catchment as a case study results indicate that the proposed framework is intuitive and efficient beyond this the generic framework can be expanded for other catchments and various

water quality data variation analysis the water quality of a river can be attributed to both natural processes and anthropogenic activities including surface runoff abbaspour et al 2007 climate change whitehead et al 2009 geological structure bilgin and konanç 2016 land use sliva and williams 2001 ding et al 2015 and sewage discharge zhen and zhu 2016 different atmospheric inputs climatic conditions and anthropogenic inputs may result in spatial variation of water quality in rivers bricker and jones 1995 on the other hand seasonal variation in precipitation may cause river discharge variations and subsequently affect the concentration of pollutants in river water vega et al 1998 therefore a good understanding of temporal and spatial variations of water quality on a catchment scale is of great importance for water pollution control aquatic ecosystem restoration and water management by regional communities bu et al 2010 iscen et al 2008 the methods for temporal and or spatial analysis on water quality data have developed from univariate analysis to multivariate analysis in the early stage spatial and or temporal analysis of water quality data mainly focused on a single argument laznik et al 1999 niu et al 2004 this kind of analysis method cannot fit well to more and more complex water challenges with the development of computer science multivariate statistical analysis methods have grown mainly including principal component analysis pca principal factor analysis pfa factor analysis fa cluster analysis ca and discriminant analysis da singh et al 2004 smeti and golfinopoulos 2016 these multivariate statistical techniques have been well accepted and widely applied in water quality assessments shrestha and kazama 2007 iscen et al 2008 wang et al 2013 particularly for key parameter extraction and main pollution source identification for instance applying ca and fa bu et al 2010 grouped 12 sampling sites into three pollution level clusters no pollution moderate pollution and high pollution and identified five factors of pollution sources for the jinshui river of the south qinling mountains in china wang et al 2013 applied ca and pca fa to evaluate temporal spatial variations in water quality and identify latent sources of water pollution in the songhua river harbin region china smeti and golfinopoulos 2016 applied da on surface water quality data of yliki lake to determine which variables were the most efficient in discriminating between clusters however most existing spatiotemporal variation analytical works treat the temporal and spatial analysis of water quality data separately for instance ouyang et al 2006 assessed the seasonal variations in surface water quality in the lower st johns river wang et al 2013 performed the temporal and spatial cluster analysis of water quality in the songhua river harbin region separately classifying monitoring time into three periods and classifying monitoring stations into three groups chang 2008 conducted spatial analysis of water quality trends in the han river basin south korea however the co occurrence and correlation of temporal and spatial variations were not thoroughly considered during the previous spatiotemporal variation assessment therefore an approach which allows to comprehensively analyse the temporal and spatial variations of water quality data simultaneously is highly needed especially in the context of a changing environment it is essential to study the spatiotemporal variations of water quality data so as to adapt to climate change and environment deterioration 1 2 aims and objectives this paper aims to propose a generic framework to simultaneously analyse the spatiotemporal variations of water quality data on a catchment scale the importance of this paper lies in teaching environmental engineers and scientists without a computational background to systemically analyse temporal and spatial variations of water quality data in a more effective intuitive and easier way the objectives of this paper are as follows 1 to analyse how the spatial distributions of water quality data change over time 2 to analyse the spatial heterogeneity of temporal evolution of water quality data and 3 to demonstrate the procedure and verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework taking a water quality dataset in fuxi river catchment as a typical example 2 study area and data acquisition 2 1 study area to demonstrate the proposed framework any catchment could have been chosen for illustration here the fuxi river catchment is used as a case study as the authors are familiar with this example catchment and reliable data have been collected by trusted sources the fuxi river catchment 28 58 29 46 n 103 43 105 36 e fig 1 covers 3490 km2 of drainage area with a mainstream fuxi river length of 73 2 km a bending coefficient of 2 21 and an average gradient of 0 27 according to the recorded hydrological data the natural multiple annual average runoff in the fuxi river catchment is 42 25 m3 s and the measured annual average runoff is 19 26 m3 s the meteorological data indicate that the average annual precipitation is 1023 mm 58 in july and august and the mean temperature is 17 8 c the altitude ranges from 250 m to 500 m the land use in the catchment is dominated by farmland about 70 which contributes to non point pollution of fuxi river the fuxi river is one of the first level tributaries of the tuojiang river which is located in the southwest of china it originates from the xushui river length of 118 km source in the west and the weiyuan river length of 123 km source in the north joining as the mainstream at shuanghekou fig 1 site 4 further downstream the tieqian river and the zhenxi river join the fuxi river which finally flows into the tuojiang river the locations of seven sampling sites are presented in table 1 site 1 is located on weiyuan river sites 2 and 3 are by the xushui river and the other sites are selected on the mainstream of fuxi river fig 1 the fuxi river is the only watercourse flowing across zigong city and is regarded as the mother river by local citizens zigong city is one of 50 cities facing serious water shortages in china with a population of 3 30 million in 2013 and per capita water resources of 585 m3 accounting for 18 84 of the provincial level sichuan province in recent years with the rapid economic development and population growth the water quality in the fuxi river has degraded considerably the degradation grades differ at different times e g eutrophication often shows up during the dry season and different locations e g water quality is worse downstream water quality in the catchment exhibits temporal and spatial variations and makes water pollution control challenging 2 2 data acquisition water quality data in the study area were provided by the environmental protection agency of zigong city china the dataset consists of ten water quality variables at seven sampling stations with monthly records from january 2012 to december 2014 a basic summary of the water quality data is presented in table 2 here the authors use it as a representative dataset of water quality measurements on a catchment scale to illustrate the proposed new method for extended applications the studied variables the number of variables and the number of sampling stations could be different depends on specific practices 3 framework and the fundamental techniques 3 1 overview of the framework an overview of the proposed framework to analyse the spatiotemporal variation of water quality data is presented in fig 2 in general the framework consists of two routes the first route is to analyse the heterogeneity of temporal evolution of water quality among different sampling sites namely how the water quality of each sampling site evolves over time and is the temporal evolution of water quality at different sampling sites similar or not the second route focuses on the heterogeneity of spatial distribution of water quality over time as the water quality is usually spatially distributed i e different sampling sites show different levels of water quality the second route aims to answer the question does the spatial distribution of water quality evolves over time and how does this happen beyond this to systematically explore the spatiotemporal variations inter change and intra change of each route are further defined respectively specifically inter change of the first route focuses on the temporal variation of water quality among different sampling sites for intra change it characterizes the differences of inner temporal clusters generated from each sampling site similarly the inter change of the second route refers to the difference of spatial distribution of water quality among different sampling times while the intra change means the difference among inner spatial clusters generated at each sampling time to capture the similarities of the inter and intra changes of water quality data normalized mutual information nmi and dynamic time warping dtw were integrated more detailed descriptions of how to use the framework can be found in the following subsections 3 2 to 3 4 3 2 analysis on heterogeneity of temporal evolution at different sites for a catchment water quality often varies with time due to climatic or and anthropic factors furthermore different sites generally show different temporal variations of water quality to study the heterogeneity of temporal evolution of water quality at different sites two perspectives are considered one is from the inter change view which aims to investigate which sampling sites have similar temporal evolution another is from the intra change view which aims to study which sampling sites exhibit similar change of inner temporal pattern 3 2 1 inter change analysis to investigate the heterogeneity of temporal evolution of water quality among different sampling sites at the inter change level the following steps are involved 1 dynamic time warping dtw is first extended to calculate the pair wise dissimilarity of the temporal evolution of water quality among different sampling sites specifically the water quality data of each sampling site is characterized as a multi variable time series for instance assume that a given water quality data set consists of k variables with w sampling sites k 10 and w 7 in our case study since the data of each variable are collected over time for a given sampling site we can use k time series to represent its data where each time series captures the values of one variable over time with the time series representation the dissimilarity between any two sampling sites for each water quality variable is calculated based on dynamic time warping and then the derived dissimilarities of all variables are averaged to quantify the dissimilarity of water quality between any two sampling sites the description of dtw will be introduced in section 3 4 1 2 based on the dissimilarity matrix cluster analysis is employed to partition of all sampling sites into different groups where the sites with similar temporal evolution characteristics tend to stay in the same group 3 2 2 intra change analysis to investigate the heterogeneity of temporal evolution of water quality among different sampling sites at the intra change level three steps are needed 1 first we investigate the temporal cluster on each sampling site via cluster analysis namely since the water quality of each sampling site evolves over time the time steps of similar water quality are identified for example given the water quality of a sampling site i in a certain period e g one year the cluster analysis is applied to investigate in which months the water quality is similar 2 next normalized mutual information is used to quantify the similarities of the derived temporal clusters at different sampling sites and 3 finally based on the similarity cluster analysis is used again to group the sampling sites into different clusters the sites having similar inner temporal pattern will fall into the same cluster 3 3 analysis on heterogeneity of spatial distributions over time the spatial distribution of water quality within a catchment may differ over time therefore it is essential to investigate what changes have happened in order to analyse the heterogeneity of temporal evolution at different sites section 3 2 and to study the heterogeneity of spatial destructions over time two aspects are also investigated inter change and intra change for inter change analysis the objective is to investigate the change of spatial distributions at different sampling times as for intra change the aim is to study the change of inner spatial patterns at different sampling times 3 3 1 inter change analysis to investigate the heterogeneity of spatial distributions at different sampling times at the inter change level the following two steps are performed 1 we regard the water quality data at each sampling time as a multi instance and then use euclidean distance to calculate the dissimilarity of spatial distribution of water quality among different sampling times for instance given water quality data with k variables sampling at w sites over m time points k 10 m 36 and w 7 in our case study the multi instance consists of w instances and each instance is a k dimensional feature vector the dissimilarity of spatial distribution of water quality between any two sampling times are thus transformed to compute the distance between the corresponding two multi instances specifically the euclidean distance for each instance is calculated and then distances for all w instances are averaged to obtain the dissimilarity between two multi instances 2 building upon the dissimilarity matrix we cluster all sampling times into different groups the sampling times which have similar spatial distributions of water quality tend to group together 3 3 2 intra change analysis to investigate the heterogeneity of temporal evolution of water quality among different sampling sites at the intra change level three steps are needed 1 first we investigate the temporal cluster on each sampling site via cluster analysis namely since the water quality of each sampling site evolves over time the time steps of similar water quality are identified for example given the water quality of a sampling site i in a certain period e g one year the cluster analysis is applied to investigate in which months the water quality is similar 2 normalized mutual information is used to quantify the similarities of the derived temporal clusters at different sampling sites 3 finally based on the similarity matrix cluster analysis is used again to group the sampling sites into different clusters therefore the sampling sites having similar inner temporal pattern will fall into the same cluster 3 4 fundamental techniques 3 4 1 dynamic time warping dtw dynamic time warping is a technique that identifies the optimal alignment of two time series to achieve this goal the time series are warped together non linearly by stretching or shrinking them along the time axes salvador and chan 2007 the dtw technique provides a good solution known for time series challenges in many domains including environment science jha and datta 2014 medicine pan and li 2016 shao et al 2010a 2010b engineering kim et al 2016 and entertainment kostoulas et al 2015 suppose we have two time series x and y equations 1 and 2 of lengths m and n respectively here m n 36 in our case study fig 3 where 1 x x 1 x 2 x i x m 2 y y 1 y 2 y j y n the objective is to optimise a warping path w equation 3 3 w w1 w2 wi wk where k is the length of w with max m n k m n 1 the kth element of w is a pair of indices indicating a connection of time points in x and y and is written as wk i j a warping path follows these constraints keogh and ratanamahatana 2005 1 boundary conditions w1 1 1 and wk m n this requires the warping path to start and finish in the first and last points of the series respectively 2 monotony given wk i j then wk 1 i j with i i 0 and j j 0 this forces the points in w to be monotonically spaced in time 3 continuity given wk i j then wk 1 i j with i i 1 and j j 1 this restricts the admissible steps in the warping path to adjacent points of the series there are many warping paths satisfying the above conditions in order to find a best match between two time series it looks for that path which minimizes the cumulative distance between them the distance dtw for this optimum path is defined in equation 4 4 d t w x y min i 1 k d w i where d is a distance function we use the euclidean distance in this study the optimum warping path for dtw x y can be obtained through a dynamical programming approach itakura 1975 it proceeds as follows first a m by n cost matrix d is constructed fig 3 a a component d i j is defined recursively as sum of the distance d i j and the minimum of the cumulative distances in the adjacent elements equation 5 5 d i j d i j m i n d i 1 j 1 d i 1 j d i j 1 3 4 2 cluster analysis cluster analysis is an unsupervised multi variate technique used to uncover the grouping structure of a given data set vega et al 1998 among the clustering approaches agglomerative hierarchical clustering gains wide popularity since it is simple intuitive and easy to interpret jain et al 1999 therefore we chose it to analyse the water quality data in this example case study agglomerative hierarchical clustering forms clusters sequentially by starting with the most similar pair of objects and merge higher clusters step by step steinbach et al 2000 to determine which clusters should be merged it requires a measure of similarity between sets of observations and the linkage criterion which is a function of the pair wise distances of observations the similarity of the clusters is determined by the corresponding measure of distance e g euclidean distance between pairs of observations for the merging criterion several alternatives have been proposed the most well known of which are single link average link complete link and ward s link olson 1995 various partitioning clusters can be obtained by cutting the hierarchy at various desired levels the higher the level the coarser the clustering is and the smaller is the number of clusters ward s link ward 1963 has been applied in this study the method works in a manner that the pair of clusters whose combination results in minimum increase in information loss are merged this happens on every possible pair of clusters at each stage of the hierarchical clustering information loss is defined by ward s link in terms of an error sum of squares ess criterion equation 6 6 ess n a n b n a n b x a x b 2 where ees is the error sum of squares x a and x b are the centroids of clusters a and b x a x b is the euclidean distance between the clusters a and b and n a and n b are the number of objects in clusters a and b 3 4 3 normalized mutual information nmi mutual information which is a symmetric measure to quantify the statistical information shared between two distributions cover and thomas 1991 provides a sound indication of the shared information between a pair of clustering the mutual information of two discrete random variables x and y is defined as 7 i x y y y x x p x y l o g 2 p x y p x p y where p x and p y are the probability functions of x and y and p x y is the joint probability function of variables of x and y as i x y has no upper bound for easier interpretation and comparisons a normalized mutual information ranging from 0 to 1 is defined in equations 8 10 witten and frank 2005 8 n m i x y 2 i x y h x h y 9 h x x x p x l o g 2 p x 10 h y y y p y l o g 2 p y h x and h y indicate the information entropy of x and y respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 overview this section presents the spatiotemporal analysis results of water quality by applying the proposed generic framework on fuxi river catchment the results include two parts the results of spatial heterogeneity of temporal evaluation of water quality and the results of distinct changes of spatial distribution over time in addition potential reasons behind the results have been discussed by integrating the meteorological environment agriculture and human activities in the studied catchment 4 2 spatial heterogeneity of temporal evolution of water quality 4 2 1 inter change assessment regarding the data of each water quality variable at one sampling site as a time series extended dtw is used to quantify the similarities of multi variable time series among different sampling sites fig 4 a shows the dissimilarities of seven sampling sites in terms of the temporal evolution of water quality based on dtw from the dissimilarity matrix we can observe that the sites 1 and 4 are most similar with the lowest distance the rational is that site 1 and site 4 are nearly located on the same branch of river furthermore the industrial water pollution sources are rare around site 1 and site 4 fig 4 b shows the dendrogram of cluster analysis based on the calculated similarities with a given split indicated by the dashed line the 7 sites can be grouped into 2 clusters where the water quality at sites 1 2 4 and 7 cluster 1 have similar temporal evolution patterns while the water quality at the other sites 3 5 and 6 cluster 2 exhibit similar temporal variation characteristics cluster 2 is consistent with the distribution of those industries which are intensively monitored see fig 1 this can be explained by industrial factories located near sites 3 5 and 6 discharging water pollutants in a certain pattern e g time amount into the river and thus worsening the water quality in the long term to improve the water quality of fuxi river zigong government may consider industrial discharge control to further validate our results the spatial variations of 10 water quality variables in the fuxi river catchment are presented in fig 5 by box whiskers plots showing the median 25th and 75th percentiles the bottom and top of the box are the first and third quartiles and the band inside the box is the median the whisker above and below the box represents the maximum and minimum of all data the cross represents outliers with three times the interquartile range 3iqr the box whiskers provide a statistical summary of each water quality variable of each individual sampling site where the median indicates the averaging value and the bottom and top of the box characterize the variation by first examining the medians of water quality variables we can see that the sites 3 5 and 6 have higher concentrations of bod5 than the others similarly the sites 3 and 5 show highest concentrations of cod while sites 5 and 6 also exhibit higher concentrations of nh4 n compared with other sites therefore water quality at sites 3 5 and 6 are similar from statistic perspective and worse than those of sites 1 2 4 and 7 that is because more industries discharge pollutants into the river causing the water quality to deteriorate in addition by examining the variance of the water quality variables we can observe that the sampling sites 3 5 and 6 are similar in most cases the similarity of median and variance gives a hint that the three sites may show a similar temporal evolution of water quality in summary in the fuxi river catchment sites 3 5 and 6 show similar temporal variation of water quality mainly due to industrial wastewater discharge in contrast sites 1 2 4 and 7 are grouped together as they indicate better water quality 4 2 2 intra change assessment to investigate the intra change of water quality s temporal variations cluster analysis was applied on the time series data of each site fig 6 plots the corresponding temporal clusters over the period between 2012 and 2014 and over each year specifically the sub figures on the left column of fig 6 show the temporal clusters over the whole period of 2012 2014 and the subfigures on the right three columns demonstrate the specific temporal clusters in each individual years not surprisingly different sampling sites exhibit different temporal clustering results for the annual scale and three year period i e the spatial heterogeneity of temporal distribution patterns on an annual scale water quality at most sites are clustered into two groups which roughly correspond to wet seasons generally from december to next may and dry seasons generally from june to november this is in line with the uneven distributions of precipitation and runoff in the catchment which implies that water quality s temporal variations are largely impacted by seasons the rationale is that in wet seasons more precipitation and runoff would dilute pollutants and thus improve water quality in contrast during dry seasons less rainfall and runoff will increase the concentration of the contaminants and thus lead to worse water quality specifically sites 1 and 3 obtained the same temporal cluster results jan may dec jun nov in 2012 sites 1 3 and 5 obtained the same cluster results jan may jun dec in 2013 sites 3 and 6 sites 2 and 5 and sites 1 and 7 formed the same cluster results respectively in 2014 here sites which achieve the same temporal cluster results mean they have similar temporal variation patterns in the specific year the differences of temporal clusters among different sampling sites might be due to the fact that the runoff is interfered with by humans such as setting up sluices on the river for irrigation purposes more broadly looking at the circumstances from the three year period different sites show various temporal clusters of water quality in general water quality at each sampling site can be roughly grouped into 2 clusters from jun to oct from nov to may corresponding to two hydrologic levels high flow period and low flow period time steps with similar precipitation and runoff tend to cluster together this can be further verified by the changes of precipitation and runoff during 2012 and 2014 fig 7 to quantify the similarity of these temporal clusters generated from each sampling site nmi is introduced the similarities of temporal clusters among different sampling sites are shown in fig 8 a afterwards based on the calculated nmi cluster analysis was reapplied and the dendrogram is presented in fig 8 b the dendrogram can be interpreted on two levels on a coarse level seven sites are grouped into two clusters c1 and c2 where site 7 is isolated from all the other sites which can be seen in the similarity matrix fig 8 a this implies that the water quality at site 7 has a different temporal structural pattern relative to those of the other sites the reason might be that site 7 is located at the outlet of the catchment the quality and quantity of water at other places would lead to water quality changes at site 7 under the complicated impacts of both climate and human activities in the catchment temporal change of water quality at site 7 is different from others on a fine grained lever c2 was further separated and seven sites can be divided into three clusters c1 7 c3 2 4 c4 1 3 5 6 which means that the water quality characteristics at sites 2 and 4 have more similar inner temporal change patterns and differ from those at sites 1 3 5 and 6 specifically sites 1 3 5 and 6 show similar temporal clusters in line with seasonal change which implies that water quality at these sites are mainly affected by precipitation in contrast water at the upstream of site 2 is mainly reserved for changhu reservoir used to supply drinking water while water between liaojiayan and shuanghekou site 4 is for the purpose of agricultural irrigation therefore the temporal changes of water quality at sites 2 and 4 are strongly interfered by humans and different from that of sites 1 3 5 and 6 in the long run climate change will affect the water quality temporal evolution and people hav eto take appropriate actions such as water storage water use to adapt to climate change water quality samples at sites 1 3 5 and 6 exhibit similar temporal variation which might be mainly because of precipitation change differently sites 2 and 4 show another temporal pattern of variation where human activities might be the main contributor water quality at site 7 shows a different temporal change pattern and the derived reason might be that both climate and human activities impact on that climate conditions e g precipitation and human activities e g drinking water storage irrigation are two main contributors to the spatial heterogeneity of temporal variation of water quality in the fuxi river catchment 4 3 distinct changes of spatial distribution over time 4 3 1 inter change assessment in this part regarding the spatial distribution of water quality at each sampling time as an instance the dissimilarity of these instances have been investigated based on euclidean distances fig 9 a shows the euclidean distances of water quality distribution among different sampling times from the distance matrix we can observe that time steps from june to november for each year are relatively closer it indicates that water quality parameters at these sampling times have similar spatial distributions the potential reasons are that precipitation during june and november wet season is relative high and thus it can mitigate water pollution at each site by diluting pollutants which finally reduce the spatial heterogeneity of water quality while during the dry season water quality is dominated by local conditions e g different pollutants different amount of discharge and water capacity and thus tend identification to reveal reasons for spatial heterogeneity is challenging therefore in the future people should be cautious concerning local water quality degradation especially during dry seasons based on the euclidean distance cluster analysis was utilised and the corresponding result is illustrated in fig 9 b the dendrogram can be divided into three clusters with the first cluster c1 mainly ranging from june to november summer and autumn and the second c2 and third cluster c3 both ranging from december to may winter and spring the difference between c2 and c3 is noticeable c2 mainly includes time steps of winter and spring in the year of 2014 while c3 primarily covers winter and spring time steps over the years of 2012 and 2013 these results reveal that the spatial distribution of water quality exhibits both seasonal and annual variations to verify the effectiveness of our results the temporal variations of ten water quality variables in the fuxi river catchment are displayed by box whiskers plots in fig 10 seen from the medians bands inside the boxes in fig 10 among ten water quality variables temperature shows the most obvious seasonal variation patterns for the years 2012 2014 followed by do cod and bod5 observed from the box variations from top to bottom in fig 8 a relatively high spatial variation of temperature appeared between april and june of 2012 and the high spatial variations of cod bod5 and nh4 n often happened in spring and early summer these findings are consistent with the cluster results in fig 9 b furthermore the concentrations of cod and nh4 in 2014 were stable small variations and kept at a low level which implies that water quality improved in 2012 and 2013 this also explain our findings that time steps in winter and spring for 2014 fell in a different cluster compared to those of 2012 and 2013 in summary water quality at time steps during june and november show similar spatial distributions since precipitation is intensive during this period and thus can dilute pollutants and reduce the spatial heterogeneity of water quality in contrast water quality in winter and spring share similar spatial distributions exhibiting larger spatial heterogeneity which might be due to the water quality during dry seasons being more impacted by local conditions 4 3 2 intra change assessment from the cluster perspective the variation of spatial distribution of water quality is studied cluster analysis using the ward distance is applied on water quality data at each sampling time and all the corresponding spatial cluster results are displayed in fig 9 apparently spatial distribution of water quality differs among different sampling times in general fig 11 indicates that the ward distances among different sampling sites become smaller and smaller on average from 2012 to 2014 especially for the period from january to august this implies that water quality at these sampling sites becomes more similar specifically ward distances among 7 sites larger than 1 5 appeared in march and april of 2012 and only in april of 2013 all ward distances of 7 sampling sites in 2014 were less than 1 to compare the differences of these generated spatial clusters from a perspective of entropy nmi is firstly applied to represent their similarities as illustrated in fig 12 a and cluster analysis is then performed based on the similarities fig 12 b presents the cluster results where the dendrogram can be split into three clusters by the user defined dash line the time steps represent numbered months jan 2012 to dec 2014 were numbered from 1 to 36 the first cluster c1 includes the numbered months 7 jul 2012 22 oct 2013 23 nov 2013 27 mar 2014 and 28 apr 2014 the third cluster c3 consists of time steps 25 jan 2014 33 sep 2014 34 oct 2014 and 31 jul 2014 and the other sampling times are grouped together c2 the time steps which fall into one group indicate that water quality variables at these sampling times have similar spatial distribution 4 4 application and extension of the framework and limitations the proposed framework can be applied to other catchments where there are continuous monitoring data of water quality from certain sampling points more than 2 points during a certain period suggest no less than 3 years when the computational results come out of the proposed framework we suggest users interpret the results and reasons behind the results by thoroughly identifying all kinds of natural and human factors in the studied catchment for better understanding furthermore the proposed framework can be extended to other environmental phenomenon studies on catchment scale such as air pollution noise pollution and climate change whereas there are different sampling sites in the study area and each site has a series of observations over a certain period the number of the variables are flexible depending on the research problems in practice and the data availability after finding the research problem and available data how can the framework be applied fig 13 gives a flowchart to guide users to apply the generic framework to other applications before spatiotemporal analysis data pre processing is usually needed such as normalization or noisy filtering if necessary the analysis mainly consists of two tasks one task is the analysis on heterogeneity of temporal evolution at different sites while another task is the analysis of change concerning spatial distributions over time the application and extension of the proposed framework is limited by data availability and data quality regarding data availability one aspect is that for long term continuous water quality monitoring data are generally owned by environment agencies and there is a lack of sharing detailed data internationally another aspect is that the number of data monitoring points are limited especially in remote areas due to economic and human resources costs there might be a missing data challenge missing data often result in uncertainty and imprecision of the analysis results therefore high data availability and good data quality are important prerequisites for using the proposed framework 5 conclusions and recommendations a generic framework for the spatiotemporal variations of water quality on the catchment scale has been proposed this framework includes two tasks of water quality analysis spatial heterogeneity of temporal evolution and changes of spatial distribution over time the results with respect to the specific case study indicate that our framework allows revealing the inter and intra change of water quality systematically and report the spatial and temporal changes of water quality simultaneously the proposed framework will provide environment scientists and managers with an intuitive and effectively tool for spatiotemporal analysis of water quality data allowing for better decision making on water pollution control and ecological restoration on a catchment scale in the future more research should be undertaken on extending the proposed framework to other

26138,the ability to simulate algal systems is critical for watershed scale models the objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a modified algal module that simulates the dynamics of three major algal groups cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms in a stream using variables available in the soil and water assessment tool the proposed module 1 models the dynamics of the three algal groups while accounting for nutrients from algal die off and 2 has temperature multipliers that consider the effect of temperature changes on kinetic rates data to test the module were collected from a forest dominated watershed over two years the modified module was efficient in predicting seasonal variations in algal group biomass and simulated the regeneration of nutrients after algal die off

of the quality of freshwater and aquatic ecosystems worldwide schindler 2006 the main cause of eutrophication is anthropogenic activity lewis 2011 paerl et al 2006 for example when nitrogen and phosphorus compounds are released into aquatic systems from point and non point nutrient sources eutrophication is accelerated and the intensity amplifies carpenter 1998 cho et al 2009a land use practices in agriculture and urban development can directly stimulate eutrophication keatley et al 2011 in particular harmful algal blooms habs driven by eutrophication are widespread globally and are a major cause of concern in local ecosystems o neil et al 2012 example is given by the largest hab outbreak in lake erie in 2011 which was caused by abnormal nutrient load meteorological conditions and long water retention time micalak et al 2013 from an environmental management perspective particularly with regard to drinking water resources it is essential to be able to predict habs in a given waterbody rolland et al 2013 in river systems various models have been used to predict the spatial and temporal distributions of phytoplankton ranging from fully process based models to simple empirical models crabtree et al 1986 garnier et al 1995 maier and dandy 1997 reichert et al 2001 sellers and bukaveckas 2003 whitehead et al 1997 2015 empirical models have shown good performance in predicting algal growth in relation to environmental variables e g temperature solar intensity and nutrient concentrations maier and dandy 1997 whitehead et al 1997 however these models are limited in terms of representing physical processes and understanding the interactions between these processes whitehead et al 1997 moreover these models cannot be directly implemented in watershed scale environmental management whitehead et al 2015 because they cannot simulate the water quality effects of land use changes soil properties and weather conditions watershed scale process based water quality models are suitable for investigating the effects of watershed management actions on water quality oliver et al 2016 these models have been widely used to predict water quality while considering land use soil properties and climate cho et al 2016 douglas mankin et al 2010 likewise norton et al 2012 used a multi modeling approach to simulate lake algal blooms in relation to land use changes three complex models were implemented to calculate a nutrient budget describe nutrient release from a catchment and predict the abundance of various algal groups the soil and water assessment tool swat model is a powerful tool for describing the fate and transport of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus which are major factors affecting the growth of phytoplankton in aquatic systems wetzel 1983 the swat can model complex interactions between processes such as meteorology hydrology nutrient cycling and algae simulation the current in stream algal module of swat simulates algal biomass without considering the diverse behavior of different algal groups and their influences on organic nutrient forms typically algae are grouped into three categories in freshwater cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms liska 2015 the biological properties of the different algal groups vary and this is reflected in their different optimal survival temperatures as well as their differential growth and mortality rates faafeng and nilssen 1981 showed that light conditions significantly affect cyanobacteria blooms in an epilimnetic environment mur et al 1978 found that cyanobacteria growth was favored under low light conditions water temperature and light intensity are influential factors for green algae tillberg and rowley 1989 but the epilimnetic environment is not a dominant factor accounting for the growth of diatoms because they also survive under phosphorus deficient conditions flynn et al 1986 the swat considers temperature corrections of the kinetic rate coefficient based on a simplified temperature dependence formulation cole and wells 2015 and hipsey et al 2006 applied more complex temperature dependencies to simulate algal populations the swat also does not consider the additional availability of nutrients originating from the die off of one algae group to the other groups the importance of the above features in the swat modeling framework remains unclear because attempts to verify and apply the existing swat algae module are extremely scarce therefore the objectives of this study were as follows i to develop a swat module for modeling a multi group algal system including cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms and ii to test the modified module based on observations at the sangju reservoir korea 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the sangju reservoir 36 26 0 92 n 128 14 57 56 e fig 1 is located upstream of the nakdong river which is the longest river in south korea 510 km the surface area of the sangju reservoir watershed srw is 7407 km2 and includes two multipurpose dams andong and imha dams the srw was constructed via the four major rivers restoration project which was announced as a part of the green new deal policy noh et al 2015 from 1981 to 2010 the average annual precipitation on the watershed was 1173 mm and the maximum and minimum temperatures were 17 8 c and 5 5 c respectively in addition during this period the annual solar intensity was 4631 mj m 2 and the duration of sunshine was 2297 h which was approximately 4 longer than the average solar duration of the country as a whole table s1 shows land uses over the entire srw basin agricultural land and forest occupied approximately 20 and 73 of the basin respectively these are significant sources of nutrients for the water system during rainfall although the nakdong river plays an important role in providing drinking water to the southeastern region of korea it has suffered from severe algal blooms over a long period kim et al 2002 2 2 data acquisition a digital elevation model dem land use data and soil maps were obtained from the national geographic information institute and rural development administration in korea specific weather data were obtained from the meteorological information portal service system afso kma go kr for calibrating the model two year daily flow rate data at five stations and monthly water quality data at one station i e the final outlet of the watershed were obtained from the water resource management information system www wamis go kr and water information system water nier go kr respectively see the locations in fig 1 the concentrations of the three different phytoplankton species which were measured weekly at the final outlet of the watershed were obtained from the ministry of environment the time period from 2009 to 2011 was the model warm up period to stabilize model operations the period from 2012 to 2014 was the model calibration period for flow rate sediments and water quality however because of insufficient algal data we could not validate the module 2 3 the swat model the 2009 version of the swat was used for this study the swat model is a watershed scale water quality model for simulating hydrologic processes and predicting the influence of land management practices neitsch et al 2011 it is a physics based model suitable for large basins santhi et al 2001 the swat uses a dem to delineate the watershed into sub basins based on the stream network and land use and soil property data to form a hydrologic response unit that has homogeneous soil and land use properties the model also requires weather data e g air temperature rainfall relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation and management operations information e g planting harvest tillage operations and irrigation nutrient and pesticide applications to simulate streamflow and water quality the model has typically been used to provide continuous time step simulations and can be applied over long periods santhi et al 2001 for example the swat model can be used to simulate the effect of climate change on the hydrologic cycle and water quality of an environment abbaspour et al 2007 cho et al 2012 douglas mankin et al 2010 in particular the swat model simulates in stream nutrient processes which are adapted from the enhanced stream water quality model neitsch et al 2011 the processes include nutrient cycles biological oxygen demand and algal dynamics algae concentrations are influenced by environmental factors and nutrient supply fig 2 algal biomass is eventually transformed into organic nitrogen and phosphorus which are then converted to their inorganic forms the modified swat module includes three different algal groups whereas the original module only simulated the total algal biomass the difference between the original and modified algal modules is shown schematically in fig 2 2 3 1 original algal dynamic module the original swat algal module simulated algal biomass by considering algae growth and mortality biomass changes were calculated from the algae growth respiration and settling rates in the stream the variation in algal biomass was expressed as follows 1 a a μ ag a ρ ar a σ as depth a t a where a a is the algae biomass change mg l 1 μ a g is the specific growth rate day 1 ρ a r is the respiration rate day 1 σ a s is the settling rate m day 1 d e p t h is the water depth in the channel t a is the flow travel time in the reach segment days and a is the algae concentration at the beginning of the simulation day mg l detailed information on the original swat module can be found in the supplementary material 2 3 2 modified algal dynamic module the modified module which was previously employed in the ce qual w2 model cole and wells 2015 has been integrated to the swat model this modified module was implemented to simulate the dynamics of three algal groups i e cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms in the modified module the biomass of each algal group depended on the group s growth respiration excretion mortality and settling and is expressed as follows 2 s x μ xg a x t α θ t β θ ρ xrmax a x σ xs depth a x where x denotes the specific algal group s x indicates daily changes in the specific algal biomass concentration mg m 3 μ x g is the algal growth rate day 1 ρ x r m a x is the maximum algal death rate day 1 σ x s is the algal settling rate day 1 d e p t h is the water depth m and a x is the specific algal concentration at the beginning of the day mg m 3 the growth rate of each algal group depends on temperature solar radiation light and nutrient concentration 3 μ xg t α θ t β θ μ xgmax min light phosphorus nitrogen where t α θ and t β θ are the temperature increasing and decreasing multipliers and μ x g m a x is the maximum growth rate of the algal group day 1 in particular light and nutrients are limiting factors that determine the growth rate of each algal group with the multipliers in the case of diatoms silica in addition to nitrogen and phosphorus is an essential nutrient for growth bailey watts 1976 for light availability the equation is 4 l i i s e i i s 1 where l is the light limiting factor i is the available light w m 2 and i s is the saturating light w m 2 the nutrient limiting factor is expressed as follows 5 n x ϕ x κ x ϕ x where ϕ x represents the nitrogen constituents i e nitrate and ammonium or phosphorus concentration mg l 1 κ x is the half saturation coefficient of nitrogen constituents or phosphorus mg l 1 and n x is the nutrient limiting factor for nitrogen or phosphorus the rates of growth respiration excretion and mortality were calculated on the basis of temperature multiplier functions to study the effects of temperature variations on the biological processes thornton and lessem 1978 the following equation represents the temperature multiplier functions for low to optimal temperature values 6 t α θ t 1 e λ 1 θ θ 1 1 t 1 e λ 1 θ θ 1 1 where t α represents the rising temperature multiplier θ is the temperature c t 1 is the temperature multiplier factor at the lowest threshold temperature λ 1 is the specific multiplier coefficient for the temperature rising stage and θ 1 is the temperature at the lower threshold c the specific multiplier coefficient in eq 6 is 7 λ 1 1 θ 2 θ 1 ln t 2 1 t 1 t 1 1 t 2 where θ 2 is the optimal temperature at the maximum biological rate c and t 2 is the temperature multiplier factor at the optimal temperature for optimal to high temperatures the equation of the falling temperature multiplier is as follows 8 t β θ t 4 e λ 2 θ 4 θ 1 t 4 e λ 2 θ 4 θ 1 where t β is the falling temperature multiplier t 4 is the temperature multiplier factor at the highest threshold temperature λ 2 is the specific multiplier coefficient in the temperature falling stage and θ 4 is the temperature at the highest threshold c the specific multiplier coefficient in eq 8 was estimated by finding the solution to the following equation 9 λ 2 1 θ 4 θ 3 ln t 3 1 t 4 t 4 1 t 3 where θ 3 is the optimal temperature at the maximum biological rate c and t 3 is the temperature multiplier factor at the optimal temperature this study applied the stokes equation to the algal settling by including the densities and diameters of each specific algal group miklasz and denny 2010 assuming that the streamflow of the study area was laminar the stokes equation for the algal settling was defined as follows 10 σ xs g d x d w d x 18 μ v where g is gravitational acceleration m s 2 d x is the density of each algal group kg m 3 d w is the density of water kg m 3 d x is the diameter of the algal group m and μ v is dynamic viscosity of water at 20 c ns m 2 the primary nutrients from algal die off contribute to the water system in the form of organic nitrogen and phosphorus 11 org n x α xn t α θ t β θ ρ xrmax a x 12 org p x α xp t α θ t β θ ρ xrmax a x where orgn x is the organic nitrogen concentration mg l 1 orgp x is the organic phosphorus concentration mg l 1 α xn is the nitrogen fraction of algal biomass which is equal to 0 11 0 087 and 0 035 for cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms respectively and α xp is the phosphorus fraction of the algal biomass which is equal to 0 006 0 011 and 0 003 for cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms respectively the fraction values were obtained from the nutrient stoichiometries of the three algal groups which were based on the data of park 2014 2 4 model calibration 2 4 1 parameter optimization this study applied swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cups to calibrate daily flow rate and monthly sediment and nutrient concentrations using sensitivity analysis swat cups were used to calibrate hydrological sediment and water quality parameters which were initially set as default values the hydrologic module of the model was calibrated using five sub basins whereas the sediment and water quality components were calibrated using the final outlet of the watershed in swat cups the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm was applied to find the optimal parameters that most satisfactorily reproduced the observational data the objective function of the calibration process was the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse value for which a value above 0 5 indicates satisfactory model performance nash and sutcliffe 1970 moriasi et al 2007 the parameters of the modified algae module were manually calibrated to be within the reference range cole and wells 2015 2 4 2 evaluation of model performance the difference between the predicted and observed flow rates sediment loads and nutrient loads was evaluated using the coefficient of determination r2 and nse root mean square error rmse and r2 were used to evaluate the difference between the predicted and observed algal biomass the rmse and nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 values were computed as follows 13 rmse a e a m 2 n 14 nse 1 a m a e 2 a m a avg m 2 where a e is the estimated algal concentration cell ml 1 a m is the measured algal concentration cell ml 1 n is the sample number and a a v g m is the average concentration of the measured algae 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration of the model with observed data 3 1 1 flow rate in this study flow observations from five stations were used to calibrate the hydrologic module of the swat model fig 1 swat cups were used to optimize the 23 most relevant hydrological parameters table 1 shows the sensitivities of the parameters and the calibrated values the surface runoff lag coefficient surlag was the most sensitive parameter in the hydrological process this was followed in order by the effective hydraulic conductivity in main channel alluvium ch k2 soil conversion service runoff curve number moisture condition ii cn2 threshold depth of water in shallow aquifer for return flow gwqmn and snow melt base temperature smtmp table 1 the calibration results of the flow rates of the five sub basins are presented in fig 3 the coefficients of determination r2 from four stations ranged from 0 50 to 0 67 and nses ranged from 0 45 to 0 66 table 3 all the stations showed satisfactory results i e nses were above 0 5 3 1 2 sediments the model parameters related to sediments were calibrated and sensitivity analysis was conducted on the parameters associated with sediment dynamics the usle support practice factor usle p was indicated as the most sensitive factor table 2 the peak rate adjustment factor for sediment routing in the sub basin adj pkr and main channel prf were the second and third most sensitive parameters respectively results of the calibrated sediment module performance are presented in fig 4 the r2 and nse values of the results were 0 70 and 0 46 respectively 3 1 3 total nitrogen and total phosphorus for total nitrogen tn the most sensitive parameter was the nitrogen percolation coefficient nperco table 2 the concentration of nitrogen in rainfall rcn was the second most sensitive parameter followed by the denitrification threshold water content sdnco fig 4 shows the calibration results for tn the coefficient of determination and nse values of the calibrated result were 0 85 and 0 84 respectively table 3 with regard to total phosphorus tp the most sensitive parameter was the phosphorus uptake distribution parameter p updis the phosphorus soil partitioning coefficient and organic phosphorus settling rate in the reach rs5 were the second and third most sensitive parameters respectively the calibration results for tp are shown in fig 4 the r2 and nse of the results had the same value 0 59 table 3 3 1 4 cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms the modified algal module in the swat was used to estimate the cyanobacteria green algae and diatom concentrations the obtained results were compared with those from the original swat module figs 5 7 the calibrated parameters in the modified algal module are presented in table 4 the rmse values are presented in table 5 in experiments the growth rate of cyanobacteria is typically lower than those for the other algal groups prokop et al 1986 however in this study the calibrated maximum growth rate of cyanobacteria had the highest rate among the algal groups this was because the biomass accumulation of cyanobacteria i e water blooms on the water surface led to an overestimation of the maximum growth rate prokop et al 1986 previously suggested that biomass accumulation could influence growth rate estimates of phytoplankton moreover cyanobacteria had the lowest saturating light intensity this is because cyanobacteria usually require low levels of light energy for optimal growth zevenboom and mur 1980 niklisch and kohl 1989 schreurs 1992 dokulil and teubner 2000 in contrast green algae and diatoms can tolerate a relatively high light intensity for growth richardson et al 1983 3 2 temporal variations in the observed and simulated flow rates and water quality data 3 2 1 flow rate summer monsoon contributes approximately two thirds of the annual precipitation in east asia chang and kwon 2007 this intense precipitation caused a higher flow rate in the srw during summer june august than during the other seasons based on a comparison between the observed and simulated flow rates the results show a clear underestimation of peak flow rate fig 3 a similar underestimation has been reported in previous studies kircsh et al 2002 chu et al 2004 cho et al 2012 this is probably because the swat model has a one day simulation step whereas the actual peak flow arises within a shorter time atkinson et al 2003 in addition to this limitation in the model structure poor performance values could be a result of uncertainty in the measured rainfall data chaubey et al 1999 moreover rainfall data that were measured at local stations may contain large errors in mountainous areas because of regionalization of the data abbaspour et al 2007 3 2 2 sediment tn and tp loads the calibrated sediment tn and tp loads to the sangju reservoir varied with flow rate and season figs 3 and 4 hydrometeorological effects and land use characteristics of the watershed may explain fluctuations in tn and tp loads cho et al 2009b the land use of the srw is predominantly forest 73 and agricultural land 20 the amount of tn and tp released from forested areas is substantially lower than that released from all other land uses such as agricultural lands urban areas and feedlots beaulac and reckhow 1982 however climate vegetation type and ecological succession have an important effect on the magnitude of the nutrient flux from forested areas the highest loads occurred during the summer monsoon fig 4 even though the canopy readily captured nutrient input to the forest floor the nutrients could be leached and washed from the canopy by heavy rainfall to subsequently enter streams rivers or lakes ma et al 2007 unlike variations in tn and tp loads sediment loads showed summer peaks only for two years there are distinct discrepancies between the observed and simulated sediment tn and tp loads from september 1 17 2012 fig 3 the underestimated flow rate during this period may have caused the bias in these loads fig 3 inaccurate predictions of sediment loads may result from i inappropriate representation of spatial rainfall variation by the defined climate stations ii deficiencies in the input data iii uncertainties in the model structures or iv uncertainties in the observed sediment loads bieger et al 2014 du et al 2014 similarly reported underestimated tn and tp loads resulting from underestimated flow rates 3 2 3 cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms there were seasonal variations in cyanobacteria and green algae biomass at the final outlet of the watershed figs 5 and 6 whereas there was no clear seasonal variation in diatom biomass fig 7 in the sangju reservoir maximum increases in cyanobacteria and green algae biomass were observed between july and september during two years 2012 and 2013 these months are attributed to summer and fall june to october in korea lehmann et al 2004 reported that 70 90 of summer and fall blooms were formed by cyanobacteria and green algae various studies have reported that cyanobacteria blooms usually occur during summer in eutrophic lakes jöhnk et al 2008 yamamoto and nakahara 2009 xu et al 2010 in general the optimal temperature for maximum growth of phytoplankton species varies as the temperature increases from 10 to 30 c diatoms green algae cyanobacteria canale and vogel 1974 davis et al 2009 reynolds 1997 the change in growth rates may lead to peaks in cyanobacteria and green algae biomass during summer and fall in the sangju reservoir on the other hand peak cyanobacteria biomass was approximately one order of magnitude higher than those of green algae and diatoms this difference could be explained by the consensus view that cyanobacteria dominate other phytoplankton species in eutrophic freshwater lakes in temperate regions during the warmest periods of the year canale and vogel 1974 davis et al 2009 paerl and huisman 2008 in addition to temperature phytoplankton growth and composition may be affected by the concentration of nutrients such as nitrate phosphate and silicate conley et al 2009 paerl 2009 oversupply of nutrients is known to promote cyanobacteria blooms paerl et al 2001 and many cyanobacterial genera grow at their maximal rate at relatively high water temperatures paerl and otten 2013 the summer monsoon resulted in high precipitation which yielded high tn and tp loads in the sangju reservoir fig 4 phosphorus enrichment i e a low n p ratio in the eutrophic state may also facilitate cyanobacteria blooms because n2 fixing cyanobacterial genera can fulfill their own nitrogen requirements through enzymatic processes using atmospheric nitrogen downing et al 2001 the simulation results of the modified module represented the observed temporal variations in the three algal groups more accurately than did the results of the original module figs 5 7 the application of temperature multipliers to the modified module enabled the model to reasonably describe seasonal variations thornton and lessem 1978 figs 5a 6a and 7a in addition compared with the original swat model the modified module reasonably simulated variations in organic nutrient concentrations caused by algal die off figs 5b c 6b c and 7b c the rapid growth and die off of cyanobacteria resulted from the significant difference in the temperature multiplier coefficient however there is a discrepancy between the measured and simulated green algae and cyanobacteria biomass levels during spring march june figs 5a and 6a a possible reason for this underestimation is that the model has limitations when describing unicellular algae when temperatures decrease during fall particularly in temperate regions algal colonies sink to the bottom of the waterbody to survive through winter whereas cells that form very small colonies ascend during spring mur et al 1999 the model cannot simulate algal growth for the initial cells that can increase in size during spring more complex models of algal dynamics were implemented in other studies cerco et al 2010 kuo et al 2006 leon et al 2011 park et al 2014 2015 wu and xu 2011 often the ce qual w2 and caedym models cole and wells 2015 hipsey et al 2006 have been used these models appear to be more dynamic because they consider more details of algal biomass growth and removal watershed scale water quality models have to be modified to incorporate these algal dynamics models because these models require knowledge regarding environmental controls e g dissolved oxygen concentrations that are not simulated in many watershed scale water quality models incorporating more flexible algal dynamics models into watershed scale water quality models represents an interesting research avenue unlike cyanobacteria and green algae a moderated shape was used to describe the seasonal variation in diatoms in eutrophic lakes diatom growth shows little response to changes in temperature elliott 2010 whereas their growth is very sensitive to variations in silica concentration bailey watts 1976 the dominance of phytoplankton species changes from diatoms to non siliceous forms such as cyanobacteria and green algae because the supply of silica in the surface water declines schelske and eugene 1970 as mentioned earlier section 2 3 2 silica concentrations were not monitored in the sangju reservoir the non application of silica concentrations to the modified module might have caused inaccurate predictions and high uncertainty in diatom modeling the insensitivity of their growth to temperature might cause less seasonal variations in the number of diatoms compared with those in the number of cyanobacteria and green algae this could be one of the reasons why the observed diatom numbers were much higher than those of simulated diatoms when using the modified module during the winters of 2012 and 2013 in the modified module settling of the algal groups was simulated using the stokes equation typical values of the densities and diameters used in the equation were assumed to be constant in this study because of limitations in determining appropriate values for the algal groups using a constant value might result in inaccurate estimation of settling settling of diatoms is regarded a significant factor in biomass decreases miklasz and denny 2010 the performance of the modified module may be improved through the application of more accurate density and diameter values for the algal groups 4 conclusions this study intended to modify the algal module in the swat model to estimate concentrations of three algal groups cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms in the sangju reservoir basin the original swat algal module did not provide a satisfactory estimation of the algal groups and nutrient contributions because of the model s simplistic temperature function the current model was improved by i introducing more flexible and efficient temperature corrections that were specific to algae ii introducing settling and iii adding amounts of organic nutrients that were proportional to the total die off the biomass estimations of the three algal groups mostly depended on light intensity and temperature the seasonal variation in the three algal groups substantially followed the observational data this might provided a reliable assessment of the nutrient contributions of the algal groups and thus improved our understanding of the nutrient cycle in water systems this improvement was possible because an algae specific temperature correction term was applied to the process rates the effect of settling was nearly negligible because the parameter values used in the settling equation were assumed to be constant that is appropriate values for the densities and diameters were not used for the algal groups further research is necessary to overcome the limitations of the proposed module and improve the obtained results overall this study provides a modified algal module in the swat that is useful for predicting the dynamics of three major algal groups and evaluating the best management practices for algal blooms in watersheds acknowledgments this research was supported by the basic

of the quality of freshwater and aquatic ecosystems worldwide schindler 2006 the main cause of eutrophication is anthropogenic activity lewis 2011 paerl et al 2006 for example when nitrogen and phosphorus compounds are released into aquatic systems from point and non point nutrient sources eutrophication is accelerated and the intensity amplifies carpenter 1998 cho et al 2009a land use practices in agriculture and urban development can directly stimulate eutrophication keatley et al 2011 in particular harmful algal blooms habs driven by eutrophication are widespread globally and are a major cause of concern in local ecosystems o neil et al 2012 example is given by the largest hab outbreak in lake erie in 2011 which was caused by abnormal nutrient load meteorological conditions and long water retention time micalak et al 2013 from an environmental management perspective particularly with regard to drinking water resources it is essential to be able to predict habs in a given

use changes three complex models were implemented to calculate a nutrient budget describe nutrient release from a catchment and predict the abundance of various algal groups the soil and water assessment tool swat model is a powerful tool for describing the fate and transport of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus which are major factors affecting the growth of phytoplankton in aquatic systems wetzel 1983 the swat can model complex interactions between processes such as meteorology hydrology nutrient cycling and algae simulation the current in stream algal module of swat simulates algal biomass without considering the diverse behavior of different algal groups and their influences on organic nutrient forms typically algae are grouped into three categories in freshwater cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms liska 2015 the biological properties of the different algal groups vary and this is reflected in their different optimal survival temperatures as well as their differential growth and mortality rates faafeng and nilssen 1981 showed that light conditions significantly affect cyanobacteria blooms in an epilimnetic environment mur et al 1978 found that cyanobacteria growth was favored under low light conditions water temperature and light intensity are influential factors for green algae tillberg and rowley 1989 but the epilimnetic environment is not a dominant factor accounting for the growth of diatoms because they also survive under phosphorus deficient conditions flynn et al 1986 the swat considers temperature corrections of the kinetic rate coefficient based on a simplified temperature dependence formulation cole and wells 2015 and hipsey et al 2006 applied more complex temperature dependencies to simulate algal populations the swat also does not consider the additional availability of nutrients originating from the die off of one algae group to the other groups the importance of the above features in the swat modeling framework remains unclear because attempts to verify and apply the existing swat algae module are extremely scarce therefore the objectives of this study were as follows i to develop a swat module for modeling a multi group algal system including cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms and ii to test the modified module based on observations at the sangju reservoir korea 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the sangju reservoir 36 26 0 92 n 128 14 57 56 e fig 1 is located upstream of the nakdong river which is the longest river in south korea 510 km the surface area of the sangju reservoir watershed srw is 7407 km2 and includes two multipurpose dams andong and imha dams the srw was constructed via the four major rivers restoration project which was announced as a part of the green new deal policy noh et al 2015 from 1981 to 2010 the average annual precipitation on the watershed was 1173 mm and the maximum and minimum temperatures were 17 8 c and 5 5 c respectively in addition during this period the annual solar intensity was 4631 mj m 2 and the duration of sunshine was 2297 h which was approximately 4 longer than the average solar duration of the country as a whole table s1 shows land uses over the entire srw basin agricultural land and forest occupied approximately 20 and 73 of the basin respectively these are significant sources of nutrients for the water system during rainfall although the nakdong river plays an important role in providing drinking water to the southeastern region of korea it has suffered from severe algal blooms over a long period kim et al 2002 2 2 data acquisition a digital elevation model dem land use data and soil maps were obtained from the national geographic information institute and rural development administration in korea specific weather data were obtained from the meteorological information portal service system afso kma go kr for calibrating the model two year daily flow rate data at five stations and monthly water quality data at one station i e the final outlet of the watershed were obtained from the water resource management information system www wamis go kr and water information system water nier go kr respectively see the locations in fig 1 the concentrations of the three different phytoplankton species which were measured weekly at the final outlet of the watershed were obtained from the ministry of environment the time period from 2009 to 2011 was the model warm up period to stabilize model operations the period from 2012 to 2014 was the model calibration period for flow rate sediments and water quality however because of insufficient algal data we could not validate the module 2 3 the swat model the 2009 version of the swat was used for this study the swat model is a watershed scale water quality model for simulating hydrologic processes and predicting the influence of land management practices neitsch et al 2011 it is a physics based model suitable for large basins santhi et al 2001 the swat uses a dem to delineate the watershed into sub basins based on the stream network and land use and soil property data to form a hydrologic response unit that has homogeneous soil and land use properties the model also requires weather data e g air temperature rainfall relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation and management operations information e g planting harvest tillage operations and irrigation nutrient and pesticide applications to simulate streamflow and water quality the model has typically been used to provide continuous time step simulations and can be applied over long periods santhi et al 2001 for example the swat model can be used to simulate the effect of climate change on the hydrologic cycle and water quality of an environment abbaspour et al 2007 cho et al 2012 douglas mankin et al 2010 in particular the swat model simulates in stream nutrient processes which are adapted from the enhanced stream water quality model neitsch et al 2011 the processes include nutrient cycles biological oxygen demand and algal dynamics algae concentrations are influenced by environmental factors and nutrient supply fig 2 algal biomass is eventually transformed into organic nitrogen and phosphorus which are then converted to their inorganic forms the modified swat module includes three different algal groups whereas the original module only simulated the total algal biomass the difference between the original and modified algal modules is shown schematically in fig 2 2 3 1 original algal dynamic module the original swat algal module simulated algal biomass by considering algae growth and mortality biomass changes were calculated from the algae growth respiration and settling rates in the stream the variation in algal biomass was expressed as follows 1 a

is the water depth in the channel t a is the flow travel time in the reach segment days and a is the algae concentration at the beginning of the simulation day mg l detailed information on the original swat module can be found in the supplementary material 2 3 2 modified algal dynamic module the modified module which was previously employed in the ce qual w2 model cole and wells 2015 has been integrated to the swat model this modified module was implemented to simulate the dynamics of three algal groups i e cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms in the modified module the biomass of each algal group depended on the group s growth respiration excretion mortality and settling and is expressed as follows 2 s x μ xg a x t α θ t β θ ρ xrmax a x σ xs depth a x where x denotes the specific algal group s x indicates daily changes in the specific algal biomass concentration mg m 3 μ x g is the algal growth rate day 1 ρ x r m a x is the maximum algal death rate day 1 σ x s is the algal settling rate day 1 d e p t h is the water depth m and a x is the specific algal concentration at the beginning of the day mg m 3 the growth rate of each algal group depends on temperature solar radiation light and nutrient concentration 3 μ xg t α θ t β θ μ xgmax min light phosphorus nitrogen where t α θ and t β θ are the temperature increasing and decreasing multipliers and μ x g m a x is the maximum growth rate of the algal group day 1 in particular light and nutrients are limiting factors that determine the growth rate of each algal group with the multipliers in the case of diatoms silica in addition to nitrogen and phosphorus is an essential nutrient for growth bailey watts 1976 for light availability the equation is 4 l i i s e i i s 1 where l is the light limiting factor i is the available light w m 2 and i s is the saturating light w m 2 the nutrient limiting factor is expressed as follows 5 n x ϕ x κ x ϕ x where ϕ x represents the nitrogen constituents i e nitrate and ammonium or phosphorus concentration mg l 1 κ x is the half saturation coefficient of nitrogen constituents or phosphorus mg l 1 and n x is the nutrient limiting factor for nitrogen or phosphorus the rates of growth respiration excretion and mortality were calculated on the basis of temperature multiplier functions to study the effects of temperature variations on the biological processes thornton and lessem 1978 the following equation represents the temperature multiplier functions for low to optimal temperature values 6 t α θ t 1 e λ 1 θ θ 1 1 t 1 e λ 1 θ θ 1 1 where t α represents the rising temperature multiplier θ is the temperature c t 1 is the temperature multiplier factor at the lowest threshold temperature λ 1 is the specific multiplier coefficient for the temperature rising stage and θ 1 is the temperature at the lower threshold c the specific multiplier coefficient in eq 6 is 7 λ 1 1 θ 2 θ 1 ln t 2 1 t 1 t 1 1 t 2 where θ 2 is the optimal temperature at the maximum biological rate c and t 2 is the temperature multiplier factor at the optimal temperature for optimal to high temperatures the equation of the falling temperature multiplier is as follows 8 t β θ t 4 e λ 2 θ 4 θ 1 t 4 e λ 2 θ 4 θ 1 where t β is the falling temperature multiplier t 4 is the temperature multiplier factor at the highest threshold temperature λ 2 is the specific multiplier coefficient in the temperature falling stage and θ 4 is the temperature at the highest threshold c the specific multiplier coefficient in eq 8 was estimated by finding the solution to the following equation 9 λ 2 1 θ 4 θ 3 ln t 3 1 t 4 t 4 1 t 3 where θ 3 is the optimal temperature at the maximum biological rate c and t 3 is the temperature multiplier factor at the optimal temperature this study applied the stokes equation to the algal settling by including the densities and diameters of each specific algal group miklasz and denny 2010 assuming that the streamflow of the study area was laminar the stokes equation for the algal settling was defined as follows 10 σ xs g d x d w d x 18 μ v where g is gravitational acceleration m s 2 d x is the density of each algal group kg m 3 d w is the density of water kg m 3 d x is the diameter of the algal group m and μ v is dynamic viscosity of water at 20 c ns m 2 the primary nutrients from algal die off contribute to the water system in the form of organic nitrogen and phosphorus 11 org n x α xn t α θ t β θ ρ xrmax a x 12 org p x α xp t α θ t β θ ρ xrmax a x where orgn x is the organic nitrogen concentration mg l 1 orgp x is the organic phosphorus concentration mg l 1 α xn is the nitrogen fraction of algal biomass which is equal to 0 11 0 087 and 0 035 for cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms respectively and α xp is the phosphorus fraction of the algal biomass which is equal to 0 006 0 011 and 0 003 for cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms respectively the fraction values were obtained from the nutrient stoichiometries of the three algal groups which were based on the data of park 2014 2 4 model calibration 2 4 1 parameter optimization this study applied swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cups to calibrate daily flow rate and monthly sediment and nutrient concentrations using sensitivity analysis swat cups were used to calibrate hydrological sediment and water quality parameters which were initially set as default values the hydrologic module of the model was calibrated using five sub basins whereas the sediment and water quality components were calibrated using the final outlet of the watershed in swat cups the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm was applied to find the optimal parameters that most satisfactorily reproduced the observational data the objective function of the calibration process was the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse value for which a value above 0 5 indicates satisfactory model performance nash and sutcliffe 1970 moriasi et al 2007 the parameters of the modified algae module were manually calibrated to be within the reference range cole and wells 2015 2 4 2 evaluation of model performance the difference between the predicted and observed flow rates sediment loads and nutrient loads was evaluated using the coefficient of determination r2 and nse root mean square error rmse and r2 were used to evaluate the difference between the predicted and observed algal biomass the rmse and nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 values were computed as follows 13 rmse a e a m 2 n 14 nse 1 a m a e 2 a m a avg m 2 where a e is the estimated algal concentration cell ml 1 a m is the measured algal concentration cell ml 1 n is the sample number and a a v g m is the average concentration of the measured algae 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration of the model with observed data 3 1 1 flow rate in this study flow observations from five stations were used to calibrate the hydrologic module of the swat model fig 1 swat cups were used to optimize the 23 most relevant hydrological parameters table 1 shows the sensitivities of the parameters and the calibrated values the surface runoff lag coefficient surlag was the most sensitive parameter in the hydrological process this was followed in order by the effective hydraulic conductivity in main channel alluvium ch k2 soil conversion service runoff curve number moisture condition ii cn2 threshold depth of water in shallow aquifer for return flow gwqmn and snow melt base temperature smtmp table 1 the calibration results of the flow rates of the five sub basins are presented in fig 3 the coefficients of determination r2 from four stations ranged from 0 50 to 0 67 and nses ranged from 0 45 to 0 66 table 3 all the stations showed satisfactory results i e nses were above 0 5 3 1 2 sediments the model parameters related to sediments were calibrated and sensitivity analysis was conducted on the parameters associated with sediment dynamics the usle support practice factor usle p was indicated as the most sensitive factor table 2 the peak rate adjustment factor for sediment routing in the sub basin adj pkr and main channel prf were the second and third most sensitive parameters respectively results of the calibrated sediment module performance are presented in fig 4 the r2 and nse values of the results were 0 70 and 0 46 respectively 3 1 3 total nitrogen and total phosphorus for total nitrogen tn the most sensitive parameter was the nitrogen percolation coefficient nperco table 2 the concentration of nitrogen in rainfall rcn was the second most sensitive parameter followed by the denitrification threshold water content sdnco fig 4 shows the calibration results for tn the coefficient of determination and nse values of the calibrated result were 0 85 and 0 84 respectively table 3 with regard to total phosphorus tp the most sensitive parameter was the phosphorus uptake distribution parameter p updis the phosphorus soil partitioning coefficient and organic phosphorus settling rate in the reach rs5 were the second and third most sensitive parameters respectively the calibration results for tp are shown in fig 4 the r2 and nse of the results had the same value 0 59 table 3 3 1 4 cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms the modified algal module in the swat was used to estimate the cyanobacteria green algae and diatom concentrations the obtained results were compared with those from the original swat module figs 5 7 the calibrated parameters in the modified algal module are presented in table 4 the rmse values are presented in table 5 in experiments the growth rate of cyanobacteria is typically lower than those for the other algal groups prokop et al 1986 however in this study the calibrated maximum growth rate of cyanobacteria had the highest rate among the algal groups this was because the biomass accumulation of cyanobacteria i e water blooms on the water surface led to an overestimation of the maximum growth rate prokop et al 1986 previously suggested that biomass accumulation could influence growth rate estimates of phytoplankton moreover cyanobacteria had the lowest saturating light intensity this is because cyanobacteria usually require low levels of light energy for optimal growth zevenboom and mur 1980 niklisch and kohl 1989 schreurs 1992 dokulil and teubner 2000 in contrast green algae and diatoms can tolerate a relatively high light intensity for growth richardson et al 1983 3 2 temporal variations in the observed and simulated flow rates and water quality data 3 2 1 flow rate summer monsoon contributes approximately two thirds of the annual precipitation in east asia chang and kwon 2007 this intense precipitation caused a higher flow rate in the srw during summer june august than during the other seasons based on a comparison between the observed and simulated flow rates the results show a clear underestimation of peak flow rate fig 3 a similar underestimation has been reported in previous studies kircsh et al 2002 chu et al 2004 cho et al 2012 this is probably because the swat model has a one day simulation step whereas the actual peak flow arises within a shorter time atkinson et al 2003 in addition to this limitation in the model structure poor performance values could be a result of uncertainty in the measured rainfall data chaubey et al 1999 moreover rainfall data that were measured at local stations may contain large errors in mountainous areas because of regionalization of the data abbaspour et al 2007 3 2 2 sediment tn and tp loads the calibrated sediment tn and tp loads to the sangju reservoir varied with flow rate and season figs 3 and 4 hydrometeorological effects and land use characteristics of the watershed may explain fluctuations in tn and tp loads cho et al 2009b the land use of the srw is predominantly forest 73 and agricultural land 20 the amount of tn and tp released from forested areas is substantially lower than that released from all other land uses such as agricultural lands urban areas and feedlots beaulac and reckhow 1982 however climate vegetation type and ecological succession have an important effect on the magnitude of the nutrient flux from forested areas the highest loads occurred during the summer monsoon fig 4 even though the canopy readily captured nutrient input to the forest floor the nutrients could be leached and washed from the canopy by heavy rainfall to subsequently enter streams rivers or lakes ma et al 2007 unlike variations in tn and tp loads sediment loads showed summer peaks only for two years there are distinct discrepancies between the observed and simulated sediment tn and tp loads from september 1 17 2012 fig 3 the underestimated flow rate during this period may have caused the bias in these loads fig 3 inaccurate predictions of sediment loads may result from i inappropriate representation of spatial rainfall variation by the defined climate stations ii deficiencies in the input data iii uncertainties in the model structures or iv uncertainties in the observed sediment loads bieger et al 2014 du et al 2014 similarly reported underestimated tn and tp loads resulting from underestimated flow rates 3 2 3 cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms there were seasonal variations in cyanobacteria and green algae biomass at the final outlet of the watershed figs 5 and 6 whereas there was no clear seasonal variation in diatom biomass fig 7 in the sangju reservoir maximum increases in cyanobacteria and green algae biomass were observed between july and september during two years 2012 and 2013 these months are attributed to summer and fall june to october in korea lehmann et al 2004 reported that 70 90 of summer and fall blooms were formed by cyanobacteria and green algae various studies have reported that cyanobacteria blooms usually occur during summer in eutrophic lakes jöhnk et al 2008 yamamoto and nakahara 2009 xu et al 2010 in general the optimal temperature for maximum growth of phytoplankton species varies as the temperature increases from 10 to 30 c diatoms green algae cyanobacteria canale and vogel 1974 davis et al 2009 reynolds 1997 the change in growth rates may lead to peaks in cyanobacteria and green algae biomass during summer and fall in the sangju reservoir on the other hand peak cyanobacteria biomass was approximately one order of magnitude higher than those of green algae and diatoms this difference could be explained by the consensus view that cyanobacteria dominate other phytoplankton species in eutrophic freshwater lakes in temperate regions during the warmest periods of the year canale and vogel 1974 davis et al 2009 paerl and huisman 2008 in addition to temperature phytoplankton growth and composition may be affected by the concentration of nutrients such as nitrate phosphate and silicate conley et al 2009 paerl 2009 oversupply of nutrients is known to promote cyanobacteria blooms paerl et al 2001 and many cyanobacterial genera grow at their maximal rate at relatively high water temperatures paerl and otten 2013 the summer monsoon resulted in high precipitation which yielded high tn and tp loads in the sangju reservoir fig 4 phosphorus enrichment i e a low n p ratio in the eutrophic state may also facilitate cyanobacteria blooms because n2 fixing cyanobacterial genera can fulfill their own nitrogen requirements through enzymatic processes using atmospheric nitrogen downing et al 2001 the simulation results of the modified module represented the observed temporal variations in the three algal groups more accurately than did the results of the original module figs 5 7 the application of temperature multipliers to the modified module enabled the model to reasonably describe seasonal variations thornton and lessem 1978 figs 5a 6a and 7a in addition compared with the original swat model the modified module reasonably simulated variations in organic nutrient concentrations caused by algal die off figs 5b c 6b c and 7b c the rapid growth and die off of cyanobacteria resulted from the significant difference in the temperature multiplier coefficient however there is a discrepancy between the measured and simulated green algae and cyanobacteria biomass levels during spring march june figs 5a and 6a a possible reason for this underestimation is that the model has limitations when describing unicellular algae when temperatures decrease during fall particularly in temperate regions algal colonies sink to the bottom of the waterbody to survive through winter whereas cells that form very small colonies ascend during spring mur et al 1999 the model cannot simulate algal growth for the initial cells that can increase in size during spring more complex models of algal dynamics were implemented in other studies cerco et al 2010 kuo et al 2006 leon et al 2011 park et al 2014 2015 wu and xu 2011 often the ce qual w2 and caedym models cole and wells 2015 hipsey et al 2006 have been used these models appear to be more dynamic because they consider more details of algal biomass growth and removal watershed scale water quality models have to be modified to incorporate these algal dynamics models because these models require knowledge regarding environmental controls e g dissolved oxygen concentrations that are not simulated in many watershed scale water quality models incorporating more flexible algal dynamics models into watershed scale water quality models represents an interesting research avenue unlike cyanobacteria and green algae a moderated shape was used to describe the seasonal variation in diatoms in eutrophic lakes diatom growth shows little response to changes in temperature elliott 2010 whereas their growth is very sensitive to variations in silica concentration bailey watts 1976 the dominance of phytoplankton species changes from diatoms to non siliceous forms such as cyanobacteria and green algae because the supply of silica in the surface water declines schelske and eugene 1970 as mentioned earlier section 2 3 2 silica concentrations were not monitored in the sangju reservoir the non application of silica concentrations to the modified module might have caused inaccurate predictions and high uncertainty in diatom modeling the insensitivity of their growth to temperature might cause less seasonal variations in the number of diatoms compared with those in the number of cyanobacteria and green algae this could be one of the reasons why the observed diatom numbers were much higher than those of simulated diatoms when using the modified module during the winters of 2012 and 2013 in the modified module settling of the algal groups was simulated using the stokes equation typical values of the densities and diameters used in the equation were assumed to be constant in this study because of limitations in determining appropriate values for the algal groups using a constant value might result in inaccurate estimation of settling settling of diatoms is regarded a significant factor in biomass decreases miklasz and denny 2010 the performance of the modified module may be improved through the application of more accurate density and diameter values for the algal groups 4 conclusions this study intended to modify the algal module in the swat model to estimate concentrations of three algal groups cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms in the sangju reservoir basin the original swat algal module did not provide a satisfactory estimation of the algal groups and nutrient contributions because of the model s simplistic temperature function the current model was improved by i introducing more flexible and efficient temperature corrections that were specific to algae ii introducing settling and iii adding amounts of organic nutrients that were proportional to the total die off the biomass estimations of the three algal groups mostly depended on light intensity and temperature the seasonal variation in the three algal groups substantially followed the observational data this might provided a reliable assessment of the nutrient contributions of the algal groups and thus improved our understanding of the nutrient cycle in water systems this improvement was possible because an algae specific temperature correction term was applied to the process rates the effect of settling was nearly negligible because the parameter values used in the settling equation were assumed to be constant that is appropriate values for the densities and diameters were not used for the algal groups further research is necessary to overcome the limitations of the proposed module and improve the obtained results overall this study provides a modified algal module in the swat that is useful for predicting the dynamics of three major algal groups and evaluating the best management practices for algal blooms in watersheds acknowledgments this research was supported by the basic

with impervious area provokes a change in the characteristics of surface runoff hydrograph thereby increasing the potential for floods and drought davis and mccuen 2005 kayhanian et al 2012 the increase of impervious area can also impact the ecological and hydrological environments at the global regional and local scales gao et al 2003 shi et al 2016 hence the urbanization of a watershed needs careful assessment and planning to attain sustainability randhir and raposa 2014 in the last two decades low impact development lid practices have been developed to deliver better hydrologic functions and also improve the environmental economic social and cultural outcomes elliott and trowsdale 2007 these lid facilities have been largely applied as two different methods centralized conventional method and distributed lid conventional lid facilities have been employed in a centralized strategy adjacent to a stream channel focusing on mitigating peak discharge and minimizing hydrologic alterations recently however distributed treatment in the urban areas mentioned runoff management in the watershed and located nearby source i e rainwater runoff spot with an emphasis on infiltration davis 2005 roy et al 2008 loperfido et al 2014 the appropriate combination of centralized lid and distributed lid is practical and significant due to the different hydrological functions of each type of lid davis 2005 loperfido et al 2014 us epa 2000 albeit there are increasing needs and awareness of lid and urbanization the transition to a more sustainable urban design has been slow elliott and trowsdale 2007 since it is difficult to generate an adequate guideline for an effective lid performance that considers the characteristics of both lid and watershed ahiablame et al 2012a many researchers have made efforts to produce an appropriate guideline for the monitoring and modeling of lid baek et al 2015 davis et al 2001 elliot et al 2009 numerical modeling was used in lid modeling because it has significant potential strength that is applicable for diverse experimental scenarios while lid monitoring needs considerable cost and labor for watershed scale experiments elliott and trowsdale 2007 prez pedini et al 2005 however previous lid modeling researches largely focused on simple applications that simulated the effects of lid on a study site and mostly targeting short term rainfall events lee et al 2012a kwak et al 2016 there are few studies about long term lid simulations and the optimization of the size and position of lid in the watershed which some researchers consider as an important part of lid installation ahiablame et al 2012a the existing lid modeling softwares e g swmm rossman 2009 l thia lid ahiablame et al 2012b sustain lee et al 2012b are still having issues on reasonable lid simulations such as infiltration under the unsaturated soil condition this problem leads to deviations of simulated infiltration from the actual process herrada et al 2014 and significant assumptions with regards to simulating infiltration in homogeneous soil with uniform initial moisture ali et al 2016 here we developed a modeling software that was able to simulate and optimize bioretentions in a given watershed the software was employed in three different hydrological strategies based on critical exceedance percentiles of streamflow to provide improved urban water management 1 flood mitigation used as an index to alleviate high flow 2 base flow restoration used as an index to enhance low flow and 3 hydrological properties improvement used as an index for stabilizing middle flow variation the aims of this study were 1 to develop the watershed model to predict hydrological effect 2 to analyze model performance and 3 to develop the optimization system of bioretention and determine the optimal bioretention strategy for the watershed 2 development of k lidm model the korea low impact development model k lidm is a decision tool based on the world wide hydrology model version 4 wwhm4 beyerlein 2011 and the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf bicknel et al 2001 it is used to design lid on a target watershed the model can be used for long term simulations to derive practical strategies that can easily calculate the hydrologic processes related to bioretention k lidm essentially comprises two components the watershed and lid modules which simulate bioretention the watershed module of k lidm is to use a hydrological simulation in a watershed the lid module of k lidm can also consider water infiltration throughout the bioretention media under either unsaturated or saturated soil conditions the main goal of k lidm is to provide a practical solution for optimizing bioretention performance in the watershed fig 1 2 1 watershed module the watershed module of k lidm is based on the hydrologic module of the hspf where there exists a function that incorporates the meteorological data into the model the module has three main sub modules perlndc which simulates the pervious areas impland for impervious areas and rchres for the open channels combined with reservoirs singh et al 2005 the parameters in the k lidm are defined in table 4 the selected parameters are referred to the hspf manual and literature al abed and whiteley 2002 bicknel et al 2001 mishra et al 2007 in this model each sub watershed is connected to the reach reservoir and lake modules that utilize the ftable the ftable can calculate discharge by considering the hydraulic characteristics of reach reservoir and lake these are grounded in the function table based on the relationship between the surface area stream stage volume and discharge zhang et al 2009 in this study we use ftable for simulating the performance of bioretention considering infiltration of both saturated and unsaturated statues 2 2 lid module bioretention consists of surface and subsurface layers that include hydrologic e g infiltration evaporation surface runoff and hydraulic e g riser notch orifice processes fig 2 the surface layer calculates discharge from the riser and considers the evapotranspiration however the discharge of surface layer can be simulated through the riser if the water depth is above the riser the subsurface layer simulates infiltration in the soil layer and water movement along the underdrain from the soil to orifice however each layer has a different soil characteristic hence the water movement simulation in each soil layer considered different hydrologic and hydraulic characteristics the two processes can be simulated in different layers by undergoing the following processes fig 3 1 the rate of the water movement through the top soil layer was determined by van genuchten s and darcy s equations 2 the beginning of infiltration into the second layer was calculated after considering the metric head as the soil approaches field capacity 3 water enters the underdrain towards the orifice and riser clear creek solutions 2014 k can be calculated using the van genuchten approximation equation blum et al 2001 1 k θ k s θ θ r θ r 1 2 1 1 θ θ r θ r 1 m m 2 where k θ relative hydraulic conductivity k s saturated hydraulic conductivity θ water content θ r residual water content and porosity and m constant storage and movement of water into soil layers is calculated using darcy s

the pungyeoungjeoncheon py basin 35 10 13 5 n 126 48 54 3 e in gwangju and jangseong city republic of korea for applying optimization of bioretention fig 5 the basin has a total area of 56 25 km2 and the upper regions of the watershed mostly constitute agricultural areas that are used for rice production industrial and residential areas are located in the middle and lower regions of the watershed arcgis version 10 2 was used to delineate 14 sub basins of the watershed using the digital elevation model dem from the national geographic information institute the meteorological and geographical data were acquired from a nearby gwangju weather station gwangju republic of korea and national geographic information in korea the average annual rainfall is 1391 mm and the average annual maximum and minimum temperature are 29 3 c and 1 9 c the daily flow rate was obtained from the water resource management system to calibrate and validate the model the period from 2010 to 2012 was used for the model calibration period for flow rate and the period from 2013 to 2014 was used for the model validation the average and standard deviation of flow rates for the calibration were 2 35 and 5 77 cms respectively with maximum and minimum figures of 100 4 and 0 11 cms respectively the average and standard deviation of flow rates for the validation were 1 93 and 5 56 cms respectively with maximum and minimum figures of 119 5 and 0 28 cms respectively fig 6 is the schematic diagram of the k lidm that was applied in this study the diagram shows the integration of the distributed and centralized bioretention across the watershed distributed bioretention takes charge of the runoff from each subbasin before entering the runoff of each subbasin in reach while centralized bioretention is in charge of the whole basin through the main reach after applying bioretention we generated the optimal size and the soil type of bioretention by considering fdc 3 2 calibration validation and sensitivity analysis we executed the sensitivity analysis before the calibration process for a more effective calibration in the k lidm table 4 shows the sensitivity rank determined by lhoat and the calibrated values of the parameters in the watershed module yielded by the pattern search tool of matlab lewis and virginia 2002 the parameters involved in the interflow intfw and infilt base flow basetp and ground water functions deeper are ranked as the most influenced parameters in k lidm table 4 their results were similar to those of other studies in which the hspf model took on a central role jairo et al 2013 xie and lian 2013 deepfr and infilt can affect normal flow hence these parameters show that normal flow is the most important for calibration jairo et al 2013 and the results also indicate that it is important to consider ground water for watershed modeling fig 7 a showed the plot of standard deviation vs mean of the elementary effects ees of each parameter in the bioretention module the figure also includes for parameter in bioretention module with the confidence bound of each value these results were calculated by using morris s sensitivity analysis among the gsa the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and constant n of the van genuchten equation have considerable mean values of ees this indicates that ks and n can significantly affect the bioretention mechanism however the standard deviations of ees for these parameters are high compared with those for the other parameters both parameters significantly influenced the effects of the ensemble of factors saltelli et al 2008 by contrast as indicated by their low standard deviations porosity and residual saturation weakly interacted with other parameters ks bubbling pressure and n have broad confidence bounds for their mean and standard deviation of ees indicating that these parameters possess significant uncertainties fig 7 a saltelli et al 2008 the convergence plot for analyzing the sensitivity variations with the model evaluations is shown in fig 7 b each dashed line of the parameter indicates the confidence bound of the mean of ees as the model iteration increased the estimated morris s sensitivity is plotted against the gradually increasing number of model evaluations yang 2011 the ees mean values of k s and n have considerable variations with the model evaluation initially the difference between k s and n is relatively large however this difference decreases as the number of model evaluation increases fig 7 b this result showed that these parameters are sensitive to sample size indicating that sample size significantly affects the sensitive analysis however porosity residual saturation and bubbling pressure are weakly affected by model evaluation our model yielded an acceptable performance during calibration 2010 2012 and validation 2013 2014 as shown in fig 8 the value of nse and r2 were greater than 0 7 for both periods this means that the model performance can be evaluated as very good and it has a good representation of the watershed hydrology moriasi et al 2007 although k lidm showed acceptable prediction accuracy it was found that the model underestimated the peak flow many researchers have the same problem the model tends to underestimate the simulated values due to the time step of simulating the high peak flow cho et al 2012 kirsch et al 2002 3 3 optimizing design for distributed and centralized bioretention fig 9 presented the pareto optimal front in terms of each different index for the optimized plans that considered distributed and centralized bioretention the total number of iteration of each scenario was 10000 and the run time was almost 4 days on a computer with intel xeon cpu e3 1270 v3 running at 3 50 ghz with 16 gb ram there were pareto optimal solutions encircled in fig 9 at the most convex areas of the curve caramia and dell olmo 2008 hu et al 2011 these regions are at the inflection point according to the values for both index and total area each point represents an optimal plan for distributed and centralized bioretention our study representatively selected the most convex point to show the detailed optimal plan the pareto front of the baseflow restoration index showed the steepest region for optimal solution and its optimal plan for reducing flood had a gentle slope in the most convex area the differences between each optimal plan indicated that each opposing objective for installing bioretention significantly influenced on the optimization results thus we should consider discreetly choosing an optimal index in the optimization process the inflection points from the most convex regions of each scenario are located approximately at 7 fig 9 a 2 fig 9 b and 1 2 fig 9 c which respectively represent reduction flood effect baseflow restoration and better hydrological properties indices however fig 9 a showed that bioretention has a weak effect on flood reduction compared to other the objectives because it cannot fully capture the volume of flood this result shows that the bioretention for flood needs a considerable size lee et al 2012a b ahiablame and shakya 2016 the optimal sizes of the distributed and centralized bioretention are presented in fig 10 a c e which includes each optimized scenario the ratios of distributed bioretention and central bioretention indicate the area of bioretention over the area of each sub basin and the area of bioretention over the total basin area respectively the figure shows that the size ranges for distributed bioretention are 0 60 4 10 0 022 0 132 and 0 0006 0 1089 fig s1 and tables 1 3 in supplementary show the specific optimal plan of bioretention these ranges respectively represent flood reduction baseflow restoration and better hydrological properties the optimal plan regarding the flood reduction effect states that it needs a considerable area of distributed bioretenion in comparison to others and these results are coherent to previous studies damodaram and zechman 2012 prez pedini et al 2005 fig 10 a the results indicate that bioretention is more effective for the improvement of baseflow than lessening flood overall the py basin needs a large area of bioretention at the distal subbasin fig 10 a c e showed that the area of distributed bioretention increased from the upper subbasin to the distal subbasin for the optimal design of each objective these results are due to locations of the impervious area in the study site that are mostly at the distal subbasin prez pedini et al 2005 also suggest that imperviousness is an important element for the optimal location of treatment facilities the optimal sizes of centralized bioretention for lessening flood improving baseflow and better hydrological properties are 0 75 0 21 and 4 05 respectively fig 10 a c e as shown in the figure the py basin required a considerable size of centralized bioretention for reducing flood compared to restoring baseflow this result was induced by the facilities in centralized manner that traditionally focused on mitigating peak discharge and flood prez pedini et al 2005 loperfido et al 2014 specifically the optimal plan to improve the hydrological process showed this distinct aspect fig 10 c this plan requires the largest size of centralized bioretention among the scenarios while the optimal size for distributed bioretention is the smallest fig 10 b d f shows the optimal soil type of distributed and centralized bioretention given each different optimizing scenario the number of soil types having the objectives of mitigating flood restoration of baseflow and better hydrological properties are 7 5 and 12 respectively as the figure shows the optimal soil combination of distributed bioretention for lessening flood largely consists of soil types having the properties of the loam soil series while the optimal plan for restoring baseflow have characteristics mostly of the sand soil series however the results from these optimal plans do not include the properties of clay soil the outcomes are primarily due to different hydrological properties of each soil type e g residual saturation porosity saturated hydraulic conductivity table 3 generally sand soil type is easy to go through in the soil media compared to the loam soil type because the sand usually has high hydrologic conductivity compared to loam rawls et al 1982 therefore we should deliberate the soil type when expecting an effective outcome due to different soil water properties of each soil texture the optimal soil types of distributed bioretention for better hydrological properties showed the need of varying combinations which have different characteristics compared to other optimal plans fig 10 f the optimal soil types for centralized bioretention for lessening the flood effect increasing baseflow and better hydrological properties consist largely of soil types having properties of loam and sand it indicated that these combinations of soil types are appropriate for centralized bioretention 4 conclusion this study developed the optimizing tool in order to propose an optimal bioretention plan that will consider the characteristics of the distributed and centralized treatment system by considering three different hydrologic scenarios using fdc an optimal plan was designed to mitigate the effects of each scenario 1 we developed the hydrologic assessment tool for generating the optimal bioretention system which can simulate infiltration under unsaturated soil conditions 2 the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s and constant n from the van genuchten equation can significantly affect the bioretention mechanism from the result of gsa 3 the k lidm provides the optimal plans having the dimensions and soil type of the centralized and distributed bioretentions in terms of the three different hydrologic scenarios 4 the optimized result from the simulation demonstrated that the soil texture and the location and size of bioretention are important elements for an efficient bioretention 5 the k lidm is used as the interface allowing a bioretention design tool to be applicable in identifying correspondence between flood reduction effects baseflow restoration and better hydrological properties the bioretention design generated by k lidm is based on critical exceedance percentiles of streamflow which was extracted from the fdc in this study the optimal combination of centralized and distributed bioretentions was designed by applying the numerical modeling approach in the watershed these conclusions suggest that the optimizing tool will be useful in establishing an appropriate scheme for lid installment acknowledgement this work is supported by the

with impervious area provokes a change in the characteristics of surface runoff hydrograph thereby increasing the potential for floods and drought davis and mccuen 2005 kayhanian et al 2012 the increase of impervious area can also impact the ecological and hydrological environments at the global regional and local scales gao et al 2003 shi et al 2016 hence the urbanization of a watershed needs careful assessment and planning to attain sustainability randhir and raposa 2014 in the last two decades low impact development lid practices have been developed to deliver better hydrologic functions and also improve the environmental economic social and cultural outcomes elliott and trowsdale 2007 these lid facilities have been largely applied as two different methods centralized conventional method and distributed lid conventional lid facilities have been employed in a centralized strategy adjacent to a stream channel focusing on mitigating peak discharge and minimizing hydrologic alterations recently however distributed treatment in the urban areas mentioned runoff management in the watershed and located nearby source i e rainwater runoff spot with an emphasis on infiltration davis 2005 roy et al 2008 loperfido et al 2014 the appropriate combination of centralized lid and distributed lid is practical and significant due to the different hydrological functions of each type of lid davis 2005 loperfido et al 2014 us epa 2000 albeit there are increasing needs and awareness of lid and urbanization the transition to a more sustainable urban design has been slow elliott and trowsdale 2007 since it is difficult to generate an adequate guideline for an effective lid performance that considers the characteristics of both lid and watershed ahiablame et al 2012a many researchers have made efforts to produce an appropriate guideline for the monitoring and modeling of lid baek et al 2015 davis et al 2001 elliot et al 2009 numerical modeling was used in lid modeling because it has significant potential strength that is applicable for diverse experimental scenarios while lid monitoring needs considerable cost and labor for watershed scale experiments elliott and trowsdale 2007 prez pedini et al 2005 however previous lid modeling researches largely focused on simple applications that simulated the effects of lid on a study site and mostly targeting short term rainfall events lee et al 2012a kwak et al 2016 there are few studies about long term lid simulations and the optimization of the size and position of lid in the watershed which some researchers consider as an important part of lid installation ahiablame et al 2012a the existing lid modeling softwares e g swmm rossman 2009 l thia lid ahiablame et al 2012b sustain lee et al 2012b are still having issues on reasonable lid simulations such as infiltration under the unsaturated soil condition this problem leads to deviations of simulated infiltration from the actual process herrada et al 2014 and significant assumptions with regards to simulating infiltration in homogeneous soil with uniform initial moisture ali et al 2016 here we developed a modeling software that was able to simulate and optimize bioretentions in a given watershed the software was employed in three different hydrological strategies based on critical exceedance percentiles of streamflow to provide improved urban water management 1 flood mitigation used as an index to alleviate high flow 2 base flow restoration used as an index to enhance low flow and 3 hydrological properties improvement used as an index for stabilizing middle flow variation the aims of this study were 1 to develop the watershed model to predict hydrological effect 2 to analyze model performance and 3 to develop the optimization system of bioretention and determine the optimal bioretention strategy for the watershed 2 development of k lidm model the korea low impact development model k lidm is a decision tool based on the world wide hydrology model version 4 wwhm4 beyerlein 2011 and the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf bicknel et al 2001 it is used to design lid on a target watershed the model can be used for long term simulations to derive practical strategies that can easily calculate the hydrologic processes related to bioretention k lidm essentially comprises two components the watershed and lid modules which simulate bioretention the watershed module of k lidm is to use a hydrological simulation in a watershed the lid module of k lidm can also consider water infiltration throughout the bioretention media under either unsaturated or saturated soil conditions the main goal of k lidm is to provide a practical solution for optimizing bioretention performance in the watershed fig 1 2 1 watershed module the watershed module of k lidm is based on the hydrologic module of the hspf where there exists a function that incorporates the meteorological data into the model the module has three main sub modules perlndc which simulates the pervious areas impland for impervious areas and rchres for the open channels combined with reservoirs singh et al 2005 the parameters in the k lidm are defined in table 4 the selected parameters are referred to the hspf manual and literature al abed and whiteley 2002 bicknel et al 2001 mishra et al 2007 in this model each sub watershed is connected to the reach reservoir and lake modules that utilize the ftable the ftable can calculate discharge by considering the hydraulic characteristics of reach reservoir and lake these are grounded in the function table based on the relationship between the surface area stream stage volume and discharge zhang et al 2009 in this study we use ftable for simulating the performance of bioretention considering infiltration of both saturated and unsaturated statues 2 2 lid module bioretention consists of surface and subsurface layers that include hydrologic e g infiltration evaporation surface runoff and hydraulic e g riser notch orifice processes fig 2 the surface layer calculates discharge from the riser and considers the evapotranspiration however the discharge of surface layer can be simulated through the riser if the water depth is above the riser the subsurface layer simulates infiltration in the soil layer and water movement along the underdrain from the soil to orifice however each layer has a different soil characteristic hence the water movement simulation in each soil layer considered different hydrologic and hydraulic characteristics the two processes can be simulated in different layers by undergoing the following processes fig 3 1 the rate of the water movement through the top soil layer was determined by van genuchten s and darcy s equations 2 the beginning of infiltration into the second layer was calculated after considering the metric head as the soil approaches field capacity 3 water enters the underdrain towards the orifice

arcgis version 10 2 was used to delineate 14 sub basins of the watershed using the digital elevation model dem from the national geographic information institute the meteorological and geographical data were acquired from a nearby gwangju weather station gwangju republic of korea and national geographic information in korea the average annual rainfall is 1391 mm and the average annual maximum and minimum temperature are 29 3 c and 1 9 c the daily flow rate was obtained from the water resource management system to calibrate and validate the model the period from 2010 to 2012 was used for the model calibration period for flow rate and the period from 2013 to 2014 was used for the model validation the average and standard deviation of flow rates for the calibration were 2 35 and 5 77 cms respectively with maximum and minimum figures of 100 4 and 0 11 cms respectively the average and standard deviation of flow rates for the validation were 1 93 and 5 56 cms respectively with maximum and minimum figures of 119 5 and 0 28 cms respectively fig 6 is the schematic diagram of the k lidm that was applied in this study the diagram shows the integration of the distributed and centralized bioretention across the watershed distributed bioretention takes charge of the runoff from each subbasin before entering the runoff of each subbasin in reach while centralized bioretention is in charge of the whole basin through the main reach after applying bioretention we generated the optimal size and the soil type of bioretention by considering fdc 3 2 calibration validation and sensitivity analysis we executed the sensitivity analysis before the calibration process for a more effective calibration in the k lidm table 4 shows the sensitivity rank determined by lhoat and the calibrated values of the parameters in the watershed module yielded by the pattern search tool of matlab lewis and virginia 2002 the parameters involved in the interflow intfw and infilt base flow basetp and ground water functions deeper are ranked as the most influenced parameters in k lidm table 4 their results were similar to those of other studies in which the hspf model took on a central role jairo et al 2013 xie and lian 2013 deepfr and infilt can affect normal flow hence these parameters show that normal flow is the most important for calibration jairo et al 2013 and the results also indicate that it is important to consider ground water for watershed modeling fig 7 a showed the plot of standard deviation vs mean of the elementary effects ees of each parameter in the bioretention module the figure also includes for parameter in bioretention module with the confidence bound of each value these results were calculated by using morris s sensitivity analysis among the gsa the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and constant n of the van genuchten equation have considerable mean values of ees this indicates that ks and n can significantly affect the bioretention mechanism however the standard deviations of ees for these parameters are high compared with those for the other parameters both parameters significantly influenced the effects of the ensemble of factors saltelli et al 2008 by contrast as indicated by their low standard deviations porosity and residual saturation weakly interacted with other parameters ks bubbling pressure and n have broad confidence bounds for their mean and standard deviation of ees indicating that these parameters possess significant uncertainties fig 7 a saltelli et al 2008 the convergence plot for analyzing the sensitivity variations with the model evaluations is shown in fig 7 b each dashed line of the parameter indicates the confidence bound of the mean of ees as the model iteration increased the estimated morris s sensitivity is plotted against the gradually increasing number of model evaluations yang 2011 the ees mean values of k s and n have considerable variations with the model evaluation initially the difference between k s and n is relatively large however this difference decreases as the number of model evaluation increases fig 7 b this result showed that these parameters are sensitive to sample size indicating that sample size significantly affects the sensitive analysis however porosity residual saturation and bubbling pressure are weakly affected by model evaluation our model yielded an acceptable performance during calibration 2010 2012 and validation 2013 2014 as shown in fig 8 the value of nse and r2 were greater than 0 7 for both periods this means that the model performance can be evaluated as very good and it has a good representation of the watershed hydrology moriasi et al 2007 although k lidm showed acceptable prediction accuracy it was found that the model underestimated the peak flow many researchers have the same problem the model tends to underestimate the simulated values due to the time step of simulating the high peak flow cho et al 2012 kirsch et al 2002 3 3 optimizing design for distributed and centralized bioretention fig 9 presented the pareto optimal front in terms of each different index for the optimized plans that considered distributed and centralized bioretention the total number of iteration of each scenario was 10000 and the run time was almost 4 days on a computer with intel xeon cpu e3 1270 v3 running at 3 50 ghz with 16 gb ram there were pareto optimal solutions encircled in fig 9 at the most convex areas of the curve caramia and dell olmo 2008 hu et al 2011 these regions are at the inflection point according to the values for both index and total area each point represents an optimal plan for distributed and centralized bioretention our study representatively selected the most convex point to show the detailed optimal plan the pareto front of the baseflow restoration index showed the steepest region for optimal solution and its optimal plan for reducing flood had a gentle slope in the most convex area the differences between each optimal plan indicated that each opposing objective for installing bioretention significantly influenced on the optimization results thus we should consider discreetly choosing an optimal index in the optimization process the inflection points from the most convex regions of each scenario are located approximately at 7 fig 9 a 2 fig 9 b and 1 2 fig 9 c which respectively represent reduction flood effect baseflow restoration and better hydrological properties indices however fig 9 a showed that bioretention has a weak effect on flood reduction compared to other the objectives because it cannot fully capture the volume of flood this result shows that the bioretention for flood needs a considerable size lee et al 2012a b ahiablame and shakya 2016 the optimal sizes of the distributed and centralized bioretention are presented in fig 10 a c e which includes each optimized scenario the ratios of distributed bioretention and central bioretention indicate the area of bioretention over the area of each sub basin and the area of bioretention over the total basin area respectively the figure shows that the size ranges for distributed bioretention are 0 60 4 10 0 022 0 132 and 0 0006 0 1089 fig s1 and tables 1 3 in supplementary show the specific optimal plan of bioretention these ranges respectively represent flood reduction baseflow restoration and better hydrological properties the optimal plan regarding the flood reduction effect states that it needs a considerable area of distributed bioretenion in comparison to others and these results are coherent to previous studies damodaram and zechman 2012 prez pedini et al 2005 fig 10 a the results indicate that bioretention is more effective for the improvement of baseflow than lessening flood overall the py basin needs a large area of bioretention at the distal subbasin fig 10 a c e showed that the area of distributed bioretention increased from the upper subbasin to the distal subbasin for the optimal design of each objective these results are due to locations of the impervious area in the study site that are mostly at the distal subbasin prez pedini et al 2005 also suggest that imperviousness is an important element for the optimal location of treatment facilities the optimal sizes of centralized bioretention for lessening flood improving baseflow and better hydrological properties are 0 75 0 21 and 4 05 respectively fig 10 a c e as shown in the figure the py basin required a considerable size of centralized bioretention for reducing flood compared to restoring baseflow this result was induced by the facilities in centralized manner that traditionally focused on mitigating peak discharge and flood prez pedini et al 2005 loperfido et al 2014 specifically the optimal plan to improve the hydrological process showed this distinct aspect fig 10 c this plan requires the largest size of centralized bioretention among the scenarios while the optimal size for distributed bioretention is the smallest fig 10 b d f shows the optimal soil type of distributed and centralized bioretention given each different optimizing scenario the number of soil types having the objectives of mitigating flood restoration of baseflow and better hydrological properties are 7 5 and 12 respectively as the figure shows the optimal soil combination of distributed bioretention for lessening flood largely consists of soil types having the properties of the loam soil series while the optimal plan for restoring baseflow have characteristics mostly of the sand soil series however the results from these optimal plans do not include the properties of clay soil the outcomes are primarily due to different hydrological properties of each soil type e g residual saturation porosity saturated hydraulic conductivity table 3 generally sand soil type is easy to go through in the soil media compared to the loam soil type because the sand usually has high hydrologic conductivity compared to loam rawls et al 1982 therefore we should deliberate the soil type when expecting an effective outcome due to different soil water properties of each soil texture the optimal soil types of distributed bioretention for better hydrological properties showed the need of varying combinations which have different characteristics compared to other optimal plans fig 10 f the optimal soil types for centralized bioretention for lessening the flood effect increasing baseflow and better hydrological properties consist largely of soil types having properties of loam and sand it indicated that these combinations of soil types are appropriate for centralized bioretention 4 conclusion this study developed the optimizing tool in order to propose an optimal bioretention plan that will consider the characteristics of the distributed and centralized treatment system by considering three different hydrologic scenarios using fdc an optimal plan was designed to mitigate the effects of each scenario 1 we developed the hydrologic assessment tool for generating the optimal bioretention system which can simulate infiltration under unsaturated soil conditions 2 the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s and constant n from the van genuchten equation can significantly affect the bioretention mechanism from the result of gsa 3 the k lidm provides the optimal plans having the dimensions and soil type of the centralized and distributed bioretentions in terms of the three different hydrologic scenarios 4 the optimized result from the simulation demonstrated that the soil texture and the location and size of bioretention are important elements for an efficient bioretention 5 the k lidm is used as the interface allowing a bioretention design tool to be applicable in identifying correspondence between flood reduction effects baseflow restoration and better hydrological properties the bioretention design generated by k lidm is based on critical exceedance percentiles of streamflow which was extracted from the fdc in this study the optimal combination of centralized and distributed bioretentions was designed by applying the numerical modeling approach in the watershed these conclusions suggest that the optimizing tool will be useful in establishing an appropriate scheme for lid installment acknowledgement this work is supported by the
