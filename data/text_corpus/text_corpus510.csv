2550,data driven models ddms have gained increasing popularity in groundwater hydrology in recent years due to the advancement of machine learning algorithms and the flexibility of easily accessible data for groundwater purposes the differences in deep learning dl algorithms compared with traditional tree based machine learning tb algorithms have not been fully investigated and the importance of different input features for groundwater level simulation has rarely been addressed in this study we test and validate six ddms for simulating the groundwater levels of the north china plain ncp at selected boreholes the ncp is a large alluvial aquifer system 144 000 km2 overexploited by massive water withdrawals since the 1960s in our simulations four ddms were tree based random forest xgboost gradient boosting regression lightgbm and two were deep learning algorithms vanilla lstm and encoder decoder lstm the results showed that deep learning based ddms provided a better correlation to observed data than tree based models additionally encoder decoder lstm had the best model performance among all ddms and it had the ability to generate compelling results r2 0 61 rmse 0 73 m although each individual driving factor had a low correlation to the simulation target gini coefficient analysis and permutation feature importance analysis were used to determine the ranking of different model driving factors for the interpretable results the results showed that the factors related to human activities had a much stronger impact on groundwater level variation than other factors a preprocessing procedure of the driving factors helps produce satisfactory simulations aimed at sustainable water management and aquifer restoration especially in data scarce areas keywords groundwater dynamics data driven models machine learning lstm north china plain data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is a strategic resource supporting human welfare and development however overexploitation pollution and arid climate have adversely affected its availability jasechko and perrone 2021 andrews and hennet 2022 in recent decades groundwater withdrawals have resulted in severe groundwater depletion worldwide with water levels declining at alarming rates wada et al 2010 zheng and guo 2022 to alleviate present and future water crises triggered by unsustainable pumping rates groundwater level is a critical parameter that must be monitored and if possible predicted groundwater levels from observation wells are expensive and often sparsely located the occurrence of shallow and confined aquifers with uneven groundwater levels makes the characterization of groundwater systems more challenging computer based models are developed to generate groundwater level maps to support research and decision making there are two approaches to provide computer based groundwater level simulations physically based models pbms and data driven models ddms asher et al 2015 shen 2018 the pbms accommodate physical processes that can be explained by mass and energy balance mechanisms as a result the input and output of pbms are always linked with known or approximated physical equations the ddms attempt to construct statistical regressions between the input and output data to mine the potential correlation between the driving factors and the targets without the exact physical links rajaee et al 2019 both pbms and ddms have been successfully used in predicting groundwater levels in several case studies asher et al 2015 shapiro and day lewis 2022 ddms such as artificial neural networks anns random forests and logistic regression models have been introduced and tested for hydrological purposes since the 2000s shen 2018 sun and scanlon 2019 hydrological applications of ddms are now gaining increasing popularity with the rapid advancement of machine learning ml techniques deep learning dl has gradually demonstrated its modeling capability due to the recent increase in computing power and data volume traditional tree based methods and deep learning models have both shown high accuracy in simulating groundwater levels in different areas zhang et al 2018 rajaee et al 2019 chen et al 2020 however a comparative analysis among different ml models to solve hydrogeological problems has rarely been performed deep learning algorithms may bring added value to traditional machine learning when groundwater levels vary under the strong anthropic influence compared with pbms ddms are often treated as black boxes in hydrological science shen 2018 this feature has certain advantages and disadvantages the ddm can combine data from multiple sources within a single groundwater level prediction model such as precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration data from observation stations and water utility data zhang et al 2018 sun et al 2022 river discharge data from observation sites sahu et al 2020 water storage data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace sun 2013 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and hydrological data such as soil moisture and plant canopy surface water from the global land data assimilation system gldas seyoum et al 2019 multisource data are fed into ddms after common data preprocessing procedures such as data normalization compared to pbms ddms also have the advantage of allowing the use of easily accessible datasets from remote sensing and open source databases however it is still unclear what kind of datasets and processing procedures are the most suitable to make full use of the potential of ddms for groundwater level prediction because of the black box nature ddms cannot provide a direct explanation of the model s intrinsic choices even though they yield a better prediction capability than pbms most previous studies indeed only report satisfactory results without exploring the inherent mechanism of the black box characteristics because of the ddms pure reliance on the mining relationships among inputs and targets more attention is currently focused on investigating the inherent mechanism to identify the contribution of the driving factors most examples are seen with traditional tree based machine learning methods by using feature importance fi analysis friedman and meulman 2003 seyoum et al 2019 used a boosted regression tree brt to predict the groundwater level in a glaciated area using hydrological datasets grace and the land data assimilation system datasets leveraging the feature importance fi to quantify the variable contribution of simulating groundwater dynamics in this area referring to artificial neural networks anns there are numerous measures for determining the relative relevance of driving factors among them coppola et al 2003 used backward stepwise elimination to identify the feature importance in the groundwater level prediction of ann models based on this method sun 2013 used an improved approach to quantify the feature importance in the ann based groundwater level prediction model sahu et al 2020 deployed sensitivity analysis for ann based groundwater level prediction via different combinations of feature importance recent studies have proven that deep learning models have reliable accuracy for hydrological forecasting such as rainfall runoff modeling shen 2018 kratzert et al 2019 xiang et al 2020 and groundwater level prediction zhang et al 2018 sun et al 2022 however not enough attention is given to driving factor analysis for deep learning models in groundwater level prediction especially in areas with strong withdrawals to assess the potential of the ddms for hydrogeological application the north china plain ncp is selected as a case study area fig 1 a the site is a strategic basin of china 144 000 km2 with 311 million inhabitants characterized by stressed groundwater resources striving to satisfy the increasing water demand gleeson et al 2012 in the ncp groundwater has been overpumped since the 1960 s leading to a groundwater level decline at a speed of 1 m y by the end of the 1990s liu et al 2011 since 2014 the water crisis has been mitigated by south to north water transfer snwt project an expensive water resource that provides additional surface water from catchments in southern china yang et al 2022 strong water pumping and climate change have imposed obvious nonstationarity on groundwater dynamics pbms have already been utilized to establish groundwater flow models in the ncp to investigate the groundwater flow system and water resource management strategies cao et al 2013 qin et al 2013 cao et al 2014 yang et al 2022 in the area a pioneering ddm has been deployed for groundwater level prediction sun et al 2022 however since groundwater depletion is a tangible sign of a highly complex groundwater system influenced by many factors this paper aims to 1 develop ddms for groundwater level simulation in ncp based on remote sensing and open source data 2 examine the ability of different machine learning algorithms both classic tree based and deep learning when simulating groundwater level variations under sparse and nonstationary data conditions and 3 identify the most influential forcing variables in the ddms using feature importance analysis for the interpretable results 2 study area and dataset 2 1 study area the north china plain ncp is a large alluvial multilayer aquifer located between the taihang mts yan mts and bohai bay including the beijing tianjin shandong hebei and henan provinces fig 1a the basin has a tectonic origin and consists of continental coarse deposits alternated with deltaic and lacustrine fine sediments lancia et al 2021 the ncp alluvial sequence has a variable thickness exceeding 1 000 m from the lower cenozoic to quaternary xu et al 2016 from a hydrogeological point of view a classical schematization of the stratigraphy identifies four main aquifers fig 1b interrupted by discontinuous layers of clay cao et al 2013 the first and second aquifers are shallow aquifers and represent the major water supply source the third and fourth are confined aquifers zhang et al 2009 water resources have been considered the most critical limiting factor to the development of the ncp since the aquifer system has become one of the most overexploited areas in the world kendy et al 2003 liu et al 2008 additionally the groundwater quality has experienced an increasing deterioration on average the annual precipitation is approximately 500 mm which accounts for only 335 m3 of renewable water resources per capita per year 2 2 simulation target and hydrological inputs 1 groundwater level data historical groundwater levels from the china institute of geo environmental monitoring cigem consist of 230 monthly water levels monitored from 2003 to 2014 including 178 wells and 38 multilevel wells however the majority of the wells have gaps in the time series record and cannot be implemented in the modeling only 11 observation wells with complete groundwater level records from 2003 are selected as the target labels for model training and evaluation fig 2 selected observation wells in shallow and confined aquifers are shown in fig 1a 2 gldas gldas 2 0 noah 3 6 and gldas 2 0 clsm f2 5 were utilized as the driving dataset in ddms the precipitation p evapotranspiration et storm surface runoff runoff baseflow groundwater runoff baseflow soil moisture from 0 to 200 cm soil moisture temperature t and specific humidity h taken from gldas 2 0 noah 3 6 and groundwater storage gws were used as input data in our study table 1 all these data were arranged into monthly average or accumulative forms to be consistent with groundwater level data the gws and soil moisture were transferred into gldas groundwater storage anomalies gwsagldas and soil moisture anomalies of gldas soil moistureagldas by subtracting the average value through the same time span with grace processing 2004 2009 it is worth noting that the gws in the gldas 2 0 clsm f2 5 only simulates shallow groundwater hence gwsagldas only includes shallow groundwater storage the gldas data were retrieved from https disc gsfc nasa gov hydrology data holdings 3 grace an ensemble means of the release 05 grace level 3 grace product from the center for space research at the university of texas csr the jet propulsion laboratory jpl and the geoforschungszentrum potsdam gfz were used to ensure the highest level of accuracy in accordance with landerer and swenson 2012 the grace terrestrial water storage data twsagrace were multiplied using the scaling factor given with the grace data to recover the signal weakened during filtering and truncation of twsagrace observations throughout processing table 1 grace data are available at https grace jpl nasa gov 4 ndvi the ndvi normalized difference vegetation index can represent the covering of surface vegetation spot vegetation proba v 1km products available at https www vito eodata be ten day 1km vegetation index data were utilized to create the monthly 1km vegetation index ndvi spatial distribution dataset used in this study table 1 the maximum value synthesis approach was used to create a monthly vegetation index dataset dating back to 1998 this dataset effectively reflects the geographical and temporal distribution of the vegetation throughout china which is relevant for ecological research such as vegetation monitoring the influence of human agricultural operations was used as input data in the model to replicate the groundwater dynamics as ndvi reflects crop growth 3 methodology 3 1 workflow to simulate groundwater dynamics we utilized tree based machine learning algorithms and recurrent neural network based deep learning algorithms to investigate the potentiality of ddms the comprehensive workflow is shown in fig 2 all the driving factors and simulation targets were utilized by the tree based machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms to establish the groundwater level prediction model during the data preparation all of the driving factors and simulation targets have been normalized by min max normalization during the training process the hyperparameters were automatically tuned the tree structured of parzen estimators tpe method was used for the tree based machine learning models and the bayesian optimization method was used for the deep learning models due to this workflow the training process achieved the best performance and reproducibility for all the models feature importance analysis was conducted on the established machine learning models and deep learning models to identify the driving factors contributions to groundwater level prediction 3 2 feature engineering groundwater data on large scale basins are difficult to model especially as water pumping affects water table dynamics via feature engineering a dataset that examines the influence of human activity on groundwater storage variation is built based on grace and gldas datasets gldas is the output of the physical process data assimilation model in the case of natural fluctuations but does not consider human activities in contrast grace directly observes terrestrial water storage changes which may be considered a combination of natural and anthropic water storage changes therefore the superimposed groundwater storage changes that include the effects of human activities and natural fluctuations gwsafe can be obtained by the difference between twsagrace and soil moistureagldas eq 1 then the human activity variable is further obtained by the difference between gwsafe and gwsagldas eq 2 these two datasets created by feature engineering are utilized as input data for model generation and data mining 1 gwsafe twsagrace soil moistureagldas 2 human activity gwsafe gwsagldas 3 3 machine learning algorithms 3 3 1 tree based algorithms 1 random forest rf the random forest rf approach is a machine learning strategy that combines classification and regression trees and bagging breiman 2001 in summary random forest is a supervised ensemble learning algorithm where the core idea is to combine multiple classification and regression trees with weak performance into a forest by certain rules the prediction is produced by averaging the outcomes of classification and regression trees formed on bootstrap samples during tree building training data are divided into bootstrap sample data and out of bag oob data with oob data utilized for cross validation furthermore variables are selected at random from all predictor variables at each node with one of them serving as the splitting criterion the capacity to rank predictors according to an internal measure of variable relevance is a key aspect of the random forest technique verikas et al 2011 chen and ishwaran 2012 the difference in prediction errors before and after permuting a certain predictor variable in the oob data is used to calculate permutation importance a commonly used variable importance metric in random forest in this study the permutation importance measure is adopted and calculated to identify important variables 2 gradient boosting regressor gbr gradient boosting is a machine learning approach that provides a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models often decision trees for regression and classification tasks the gradient boosting regressor gbr is structured into three components a loss function a weak learner used to make predictions and an additive model used to minimize the loss function gradient boosting constructs an additive model in a step by step method to optimize any differentiable loss function a regression tree is fitted on the negative gradient of the supplied loss function at each level in this study the task is defined as a regression fitting question the detailed mathematical formulation is discussed in pedregosa et al 2011 3 extreme gradient boosting xgboost extreme gradient boosting xgboost is an efficient open source implementation of the gradient boosting algorithm and consists of a scalable end to end implementation of the gradient boosting framework chen and guestrin 2016 this algorithm is suitable for sparse data such as hydrogeological problems when the observed groundwater spatiotemporal dynamics are discontinuous xgboost introduces a second order taylor expansion for the loss function to increase accuracy and allow customization of loss functions xgboost adds a regularity term to the objective function to control the complexity of the model the regularity term contains the number of leaf nodes of the tree and the l2 paradigm of leaf node weights the regularity term reduces the model variance which simplifies the learned model and helps prevent overfitting 4 light gradient boosting machine lightgbm light gradient boosting machine lightgbm is an open source distributed gradient boosting framework for machine learning that was originally developed by microsoft ke et al 2017 it is a unique gbdt gradient boosting decision tree approach that uses gradient based one side sampling goss exclusive feature bundling efb and histogram based algorithms to deal with high numbers of data instances and features it supports efficient parallel training and has the advantages of faster training speed lower memory consumption and distributed support for fast processing of large quantities of data when compared to basic decision tree algorithms via a leafwise strategy lightgbm finds the leaf with the largest splitter gain which reduces unnecessary computations lightgbm uses optimized feature parallel and data parallel methods to accelerate the computations a voting parallel strategy is also used when the data volume is very large lightgbm also optimizes the cache to increase the cache hit rate ke et al 2017 3 3 2 deep learning algorithms 1 long short term memory neural networks vanilla lstm the lstm network is a type of recurrent neural network rnn that is meant to solve the typical rnn s vanishing gradient problem schmidhuber and hochreiter 1997 lstm networks such as rnns can solve sequence problems and capture temporal dynamics however the specific design of lstm networks allows transmitting the long runtime effect from earlier dynamics lstm has been utilized to solve hydrological and hydrogeological problems in previous studies showing a significant ability for streamflow and water quality simulation chen et al 2020 kratzert et al 2018 2019 rajaee et al 2019 shen 2018 sun et al 2022 xiang et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 the lstm architecture is shown in fig 3 a the cell state and its multiple gates act as a transport bridge transferring relative information to the sequence circuit and are regarded as network memory in principle the cell state c t can carry meaningful information throughout the sequence as a result knowledge from earlier time steps can travel to later time steps lessening the impact of short term memory information is added or withdrawn from the cell state as the cell state progresses the gates are various neural networks that determine whether information about the cell state is permitted during training the gates learn which information is important to remember and which to discard the detailed mathematics equations is reported on supplementary material 2 lstm coupled with the encoder decoder framework ende lstm the encoder decoder framework is a typical lstm network topology bahdanau et al 2014 and derives from two recurrent neural networks i e encoder and decoder as shown in fig 3b the hydrological inputs are read by the encoder composed of lstm cells and hydrological information is compressed into the encoder state by the lstm encoder during this compression a well trained encoder decoder model can extract meaningful hydrological information and archive it in the encoder state the decoder reads the encoder state decompresses the hydrological information through the repeated vector layer and generates the groundwater level for each time step compared to vanilla lstm ende lstm can deal with long term dependency problems and multiple step forecasting problems starting from an input sequence the model outputs a value for each of the time steps the encoder decoder framework is essentially a back and forth mapping between input and output among the hydrological features as a result the system transforms driving factors into groundwater levels by feeding the encoder output as an input to the decoder 3 3 3 input data format to understand the data input of the lstm the input data format is described after adding the time axis the data cube at different moments with multiple features of the multi sample is shown in fig 3c and 3d fig 3c is the input shape of data into the common tb models such as xgboost lightgbm and decision tree the input data format is a samples features matrix fig 3d is the data cube after adding the time axis that is the slice on the time axis the dimension of which is samples time features the first dimension is the number of samples the second dimension is the time and the third dimension is the number of features the timestep in this study is set as 12 months by try error in contrast to the tb model s two dimensional input data matrix lstm may correlate the before and after information through the time axis and fully use the information contained in the long time series by introducing the time dimension to construct a three dimensional data matrix 3 4 hyperparameter optimization hyperparameters are various parameter values that are used to influence the learning process and have a substantial impact on machine learning model performance probst et al 2019 the number of estimators n estimators maximum depth max depth and criterion are examples of hyperparameters in the random forest algorithm gbr and lightgbm these parameters are adjustable and have a direct impact on how well the model training performs the process of determining the optimal combination of hyperparameter settings to obtain optimum performance on the data in a reasonable length of time is known as hyperparameter optimization in this study the tree of parzen estimators tpe algorithm deployed by hyperopt bergstra et al 2013 is selected to optimize all the tree based machine learning models rf gbr xgboost lightgbm to obtain the best simulation of the groundwater levels all the hyperparameters used in this study are shown in table s1 a detailed description of this method is included in the supplementary material in deep learning models the bayesian optimization algorithm provided by kerastuner o malley et al 2019 is selected for the hyperparameter tuning of the learning rate dropout rate and neuron numbers of the lstm layer this procedure can simultaneously ensure the satisfactory performance of each established deep learning groundwater level prediction model and guarantee reproducibility the detailed model structure tables s2 and s3 and optimization methodology are described in the supplementary material 3 5 feature importance analysis 3 5 1 gini coefficient based analysis for feature importance in tree based methods the gini coefficient gini is commonly employed as an assessment criterion to quantify the amount of the input features contribution to the model breiman 2001 in this study the variable contribution is investigated by using a gini coefficient based analysis for the feature importance of tb models see supplementary material 3 5 2 permutation feature importance pfi tb models have the capability of presenting feature importance breiman 2001 vanilla lstm and ende lstm do not have such benefits however the feature importance can be computed for any model using the permutation feature importance technique the advantage of permutation importance is to train one model rather than numerous models for each feature the permutation feature importance is measured by the increase in the model s prediction error when the feature s values are permuted which breaks the link between the feature and the real result a feature is important if shuffling its values increases model error because the model depends on the feature for prediction in this scenario a feature is unimportant if shuffling its values results in the same model error since the model ignores the feature for the prediction breiman 2001 presents the permutation feature importance assessment for random forests based on this concept fisher et al 2019 present model reliance a model agnostic variant of feature importance according to fisher et al 2019 the permutation feature importance algorithm is as follows i calculate the original model s error e original l y f x in this study error measure model l y f x using mean squared error where x represents the feature matrix and y represents the corresponding target sequence ii for each feature x x a permute feature x in the data x to generate a feature matrix x perm this destroys the link between feature and the true label y b estimate new error from permutated feature matrix e permutated l y f x perm based on permuted data forecasts c calculate the quotient fi x e permutated e original or difference fi x e permutated e original as the permutation feature importance of each feature x 3 6 model evaluation metrics the root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 are used to evaluate the model s accuracy between the measured and predicted values rmse demonstrates the quadratic mean of differences between the predicted and observed values the model correctly fits the data as the rmse is closer to 0 r2 measures the predictive skill of a model relative to the mean of observations ranging between 1 where for optimal model prediction an r2 close to 1 is preferred the r2 and rmse equations are defined as 8 r 2 1 i 1 n y i o i 2 i 1 n o i o i 2 9 rmse 1 n v i 1 n y i o i 2 1 2 where y i and o i are the predicted and observed values respectively o i is the mean of the observed data and n v is the number of target data used for testing the mann kendall test mann 1945 and sen s slope analysis sen 1968 are utilized to evaluate the trend in the time series dataset from the driving factors in ddms the principle of the mann kendall test can be found in the supplementary material 4 results 4 1 engineered input features based on the mann kendall test results table 2 except for precipitation all the other variables from gldas present increasing trends while the variables from grace and feature engineering show decreasing trends based on the gldas 2 0 noah 3 6 dataset the precipitation has no obvious trend over 2003 2014 fig 4 the et and soil moisture show an increasing trend at 5 6 mm y and 1 58 mm y respectively in the multiple wells used in this study the gwsa from the gldas 2 0 clsm f2 5 dataset also presents an increasing trend at 1 88 mm y however twsagrace shows a decreasing trend of 4 5 mm y in the multiple wells used as the simulation target which differs from previous studies on twsa changes across the ncp the human activity and gwsafe engineered features present decreasing trends of 7 65 mm y and 5 6 mm y respectively the results show that even though the groundwater storage due to natural processes is estimated to have increased during 2003 2014 the actual terrestrial water storage detected by grace exhibits an obvious decreasing trend the decreasing trend of human activity and gwsafe also illustrates that anthropogenic influence resulted in a shortage of groundwater storage in the ncp fig 4d 4e 4 2 model evaluation and comparison all the data driven models tb and dl in this research used the 2004 2010 dataset as the training set the 2011 2012 dataset as the validation set for model selection and hyperparameter tuning and the 2013 2014 dataset as the test set to examine the actual performance in the real groundwater level prediction case due to the data sparsity in this study each well is trained with one ml model the major evaluation and comparison metrics among the tb and dl models are based on the performance on the test set the accuracy of the tb and dl models in simulating groundwater level variations is measured using r2 and rmse fig 5 dl models show satisfactory results as the median r2 values of vanilla lstm and ende lstm are 0 47 and 0 61 respectively the gbr has the greatest median r2 0 34 among all the tb algorithms xgboost rf and lightgbm only reach r2 values of 0 30 0 30 and 0 19 respectively the rmse of dl models is less than 1 25 m whereas the median rmses of the tb models are all over 1 5 m fig 5b ende lstm has a higher r2 and lower rmse in deep learning models than vanilla lstm meaning that ende lstm has a stronger ability to reconstruct historical and future groundwater levels with sufficient accuracy than vanilla lstm the r2 and rmse in tb models are similar to each other and fail to achieve satisfactory performance which means that most tb models cannot capture the underlying groundwater dynamics based on highly nonstationary and sparse datasets as in the case of ncp even though deep learning models have a significantly better ability to simulate temporal groundwater level dynamics their performance still depends on the hydrogeological settings different wells have different behavior because of the local hydrological characteristics e g leaking water infrastructures losing rivers and streams and anthropogenic activities the groundwater level prediction results by ende lstm recorded in shallow water wells w 7 are shown in fig 6 a and w 10 in fig 6b the prediction results in confined water well w 1 are shown in fig 6c and w 11 in fig 6d results of tb and vanilla lstm at selected wells are included in the supplementary material fig s1 s5 w 7 and w 10 intercept shallow aquifers in beijing and hebei respectively while w 1 and w 11 intercept confined aquifers in beijing and hebei in shallow aquifers w 7 shows general increasing trend during last 10 years while w 10 exhibits relatively stable trend in confined aquifers w 1 and w 11 all show obvious decreasing trend in general while exhibiting different dynamic patterns w 1 shows a decreasing trend with no obvious seasonality while w 11 shows a decreasing trend with seasonal and annual variations besides different hydrological conditions between shallow and confined aquifers the human activities drive the groundwater dynamics to behave substantially differently even though four wells in shallow and confined aquifers present four different trend patterns ende lstm can still achieve satisfactory performance on both wells in shallow and confined aquifers 4 3 identification of driving factor contributions the contribution of each driving factor is quantified based on feature importance fi analysis and permutation feature importance pfi analysis of tb and dl to investigate the groundwater system dynamics in detail fig 7 shows the statistical feature importance results of tb models in random forest rf the top three features with the highest average mean fi are twsagrace gwsafe and ndvi in xgboost the top three features with the highest average mean fi are temperature twsagrace and human activity in gbr the top three features with the highest average mean fi are gwsagldas twsagrace and gwsafe in lightgbm the top three features with the highest average mean fi are twsagrace followed by human activity and temperature fig 8 shows the contributions of the driving factors detected in the ende lstm and vanilla lstm models the human activity driver median is the highest in ende lstm approximately 0 8 while the median of et is on the top in vanilla lstm approximately 0 72 in addition to the human activity factors et temperature and gwsafe are also recognized by ende lstm as top key driving factors in groundwater dynamics simulation while the median among vanilla lstm factors is more homogeneous approximately 0 5 except for et therefore the ende lstm architecture can better investigate the potential relationship between groundwater dynamics and each variable compared to the pfi results of dl models tb models cannot capture the potential connection between human activity and groundwater level dynamics in fact tb models rely on temperature and terrestrial water storage change data from grace and gldas twsagrace gwsagldas the poor simulation results of the tb models for groundwater levels also suggest that data on water storage changes in grace and gldas are not the most important elements in groundwater level dynamics when compared to human activity dl models also perform better in characterizing the different hydrogeological settings in comparison with vanilla lstm ende lstm can better represent the groundwater dynamics in both shallow and confined aquifers differentiating the driving factors fig 9 a shows the pfi of ende lstm in the shallow aquifers the median pfi of human activity and et reaches 0 87 and 0 88 respectively and the median pfi of the remaining variables fluctuates in the range of 0 78 0 82 in confined aquifers fig 9b human activity and et are still considered as the top key driving factors with the higher importance of gwsafe and gwsagldas compared to the shallow aquifers the results indicate that ende lstm can detect significant differences in groundwater dynamics in both shallow and confined aquifers the pfi performance of vanilla lstm in the shallow aquifers shows that et is considered as the key driving factor in groundwater dynamics simulation while attach less importance to human activity compared to ende lstm fig 9c the median pfi of the remaining variables in the shallow aquifers fluctuates in the range of 0 57 0 69 unfortunately in confined aquifers the pfi median of the driving factors presents similar pattern with shallow aquifers indicating poor performance of identifying different hydrological characteristics compared to ende lstm cfr fig 9b and fig 9d ende lstm outperforms vanilla lstm confirming that human activity is the most important factor to simulate the groundwater level variation according to eq 2 human activity represents the change in groundwater storage caused by human activities in the north china plain it mostly refers to groundwater pumping for agricultural industrial and domestic use because of the increase in et temperature and other climate variables the increase in human water demand directly affects the change of groundwater storage and water level caused by groundwater pumping in the confined aquifer the correlation between human activity and groundwater level is among the top three in the driving factors which is primarily due to the massive water pumping by human activities in the north china plain fig 11 after training the ende lstm recognizes groundwater recharge as an essential mechanism impacting the groundwater flow system since the soil moisture factor is identified as a relevant predictor precipitation and evapotranspiration generally play a relatively minor role except at some wells located in shallow aquifers it is important to note that the impact of commonly seen forcing variables such as precipitation and temperature are already captured in physics based models e g gldas however a driving factor with a low pfi fig 9 does not mean that it is less important in contrast a driving factor with a high pfi indicates that the physics based models may not have captured the total information embedded in the raw data the roles played by the human activity factor more than the modeled twsagrace and gwsagldas highlight the significance of combining physics based simulation with ddms additional predictors including those duplicated ones that are already used in physics based models may compensate for the model structural error and or parameter uncertainty in land surface models sun and scanlon 2019 5 discussion 5 1 impact of feature engineering to investigate the impact of engineered features human activity and gwsafe four data combination scenarios are set up table 3 each scenario is a data combination from feature engineering under different driving data features the r2 fig 10 a and rmse fig 10b of the combined scenarios are variable among the scenarios the baseline human activity gwsafe performs the best the median r2 and rmse of the baseline scenario achieve 0 61 and 1 11 m respectively while s2 exhibits the lowest values of 0 28 and 1 58 m respectively according to the multiyear monthly average groundwater level dynamics fig 10c the cycle of multiyear monthly average changes in each scenario is very similar and the groundwater level has a typical upward tendency from august to february and a downward trend from march to august this phenomenon is due to the agricultural production process in the ncp area the main grain crop in the ncp is winter wheat which is irrigated primarily in april may and november groundwater pumping is the primary source of irrigation water irrigation pumping will reduce groundwater storage in the spring and summer increased evaporation of groundwater after irrigation will occur due to higher evapotranspiration during this time pumping and irrigation in november have a lower impact on groundwater storage due to reduced evapotranspiration the dynamics of the water table and groundwater storage depend on local hydrogeological conditions and irrigation water sources however each scenario has a significant variance in the groundwater level phase indicating the impact of varied feature engineering data particularly in terms of water level differences as a result combining human activity with gwsafe can help to reduce the offset in groundwater level simulations especially when using deep learning models 5 2 correlation between input and target ende lstm has the capacity to model both shallow and confined aquifers the results in fig 7 show that ende lstm has a better ability to capture the groundwater temporal dynamics in both confined aquifers and shallow aquifers the spearman correlation coefficient between all the driving factor datasets and the groundwater level at each observation well is calculated the results show that the overall range of the spearman correlation coefficient in shallow aquifers is relatively smaller than the range in confined aquifers fig 11 instead of exploring possible correlations based only on linear relationships machine learning models especially dl use nonlinear complex algorithms to mine potential associations between the driving factors and groundwater level dynamics revealing insights that linear correlation analysis cannot fully grasp in shallow aquifers most of the driving factors have a very poor correlation with groundwater levels however ende lstm captures a large contribution from human activity and separates human activity from the contribution of other components as shown in fig 9 in confined aquifers there is some degree of correlation between each driver and groundwater levels with the three highest correlations being twsagrace at approximately 0 55 gwsafe at approximately 0 55 and human activity at approximately 0 50 fig 11 however according to fig 9 the highest pfi in the confined aquifer is human activity and the contribution of the remaining factors is more consistent which indicates that dl can dig deeper to find potential relationships beyond the linear correlation in contrast to physical process models data driven models can leverage multiple sources of data for latent relationship mining the modeling process of pbms requires a clear physical relationship and correlation between the input data and the groundwater level in contrast dl models can avoid this limitation to a certain extent and mine relationships among multiple data sources 5 3 limitations considering that ml algorithms are data driven the quantity and quality of the data has a substantial influence on model correctness due to the spatiotemporal sparsity of groundwater observation in the ncp monthly groundwater level observation data of 11 years is used to establish the ml model if more data are available for ml model training the model s robustness and generalization ability would improve and the model performance would improve in the proposed framework the data used in this study can be divided into two categories driving factors and simulation targets the driving factors in this study use processed remote sensing data twsagrace and ndvi and assimilation system data gldas hence there are fewer characteristics such as outliers and missing gaps the simulation targets use actual observed groundwater yearbook data which may have missing data and anomalies when used on a large scale problems in data quality can affect how the model mines the relationship between driving factors and simulation targets therefore when building a dl model for groundwater dynamics simulation data processing for both driving factors and simulation targets should be performed to reduce the effects of data anomalies and deficiencies impacting the model performance the groundwater dynamics simulation framework proposed in this study is based on observation field data and related driving factors the main objective is to simulate the in situ groundwater level dynamics the model can simulate the relationship between the driving factors gldas and grace and the groundwater temporal dynamics further research is still needed on how to further extend the model from the time series to the spatiotemporal dimension establishing a groundwater spatiotemporal dynamic model 6 conclusions in this study several ddms were compared to reconstruct groundwater level temporal dynamics the results show that deep learning models provide a stronger simulation effect than tree based machine learning models deep learning models can capture the most important drivers from forcing factors investigate potential interconnections and increase the simulation capabilities of groundwater systems among deep learning models ende lstm has a stronger data mining capacity achieving greater groundwater level dynamics modeling accuracy and capturing the influence of human activity among the driving factors compared with other driving factors evaluated in this study human activity which is the engineered feature from the gldas and grace datasets has a stronger underlying connection with groundwater level dynamics this finding shows that although multiple data sources can contribute to the establishment of the groundwater level dynamics model these driving factors need to be processed based on the physical meaning behind them to achieve higher accuracy the combination of human activity and gwsafe data can be added to the reconstruction of regional groundwater level simulation to eliminate part of the offset in the groundwater level simulation and improve the groundwater level reconstruction accuracy deep learning models can find deeper underlying associations with weaker correlations between the driving factors and groundwater level dynamics groundwater level forecasting using ende lstm models is a promising tool aimed at safeguarding aquifers and maintaining the sustainability of groundwater pumping model application is also suitable in remote areas where hydrogeological investigations are sparse and scarcely correlated via ddms possible correlations between groundwater levels and external parameters not directly related to the equations governing aquifer dynamics are fully utilized for groundwater level forecasting the energy market global price of agricultural products or other parameters can be implemented as driving factors to better simulate the groundwater levels and the water

2550,data driven models ddms have gained increasing popularity in groundwater hydrology in recent years due to the advancement of machine learning algorithms and the flexibility of easily accessible data for groundwater purposes the differences in deep learning dl algorithms compared with traditional tree based machine learning tb algorithms have not been fully investigated and the importance of different input features for groundwater level simulation has rarely been addressed in this study we test and validate six ddms for simulating the groundwater levels of the north china plain ncp at selected boreholes the ncp is a large alluvial aquifer system 144 000 km2 overexploited by massive water withdrawals since the 1960s in our simulations four ddms were tree based random forest xgboost gradient boosting regression lightgbm and two were deep learning algorithms vanilla lstm and encoder decoder lstm the results showed that deep learning based ddms provided a better correlation to observed data than tree based models additionally encoder decoder lstm had the best model performance among all ddms and it had the ability to generate compelling results r2 0 61 rmse 0 73 m although each individual driving factor had a low correlation to the simulation target gini coefficient analysis and permutation feature importance analysis were used to determine the ranking of different model driving factors for the interpretable results the results showed that the factors related to human activities had a much stronger impact on groundwater level variation than other factors a preprocessing procedure of the driving factors helps produce satisfactory simulations aimed at sustainable water management and aquifer restoration especially in data scarce areas keywords groundwater dynamics data driven models machine learning lstm north china plain data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is a strategic resource supporting human welfare and development however overexploitation pollution and arid climate have adversely affected its availability jasechko and perrone 2021 andrews and hennet 2022 in recent decades groundwater withdrawals have resulted in severe groundwater depletion worldwide with water levels declining at alarming rates wada et al 2010 zheng and guo 2022 to alleviate present and future water crises triggered by unsustainable pumping rates groundwater level is a critical parameter that must be monitored and if possible predicted groundwater levels from observation wells are expensive and often sparsely located the occurrence of shallow and confined aquifers with uneven groundwater levels makes the characterization of groundwater systems more challenging computer based models are developed to generate groundwater level maps to support research and decision making there are two approaches to provide computer based groundwater level simulations physically based models pbms and data driven models ddms asher et al 2015 shen 2018 the pbms accommodate physical processes that can be explained by mass and energy balance mechanisms as a result the input and output of pbms are always linked with known or approximated physical equations the ddms attempt to construct statistical regressions between the input and output data to mine the potential correlation between the driving factors and the targets without the exact physical links rajaee et al 2019 both pbms and ddms have been successfully used in predicting groundwater levels in several case studies asher et al 2015 shapiro and day lewis 2022 ddms such as artificial neural networks anns random forests and logistic regression models have been introduced and tested for hydrological purposes since the 2000s shen 2018 sun and scanlon 2019 hydrological applications of ddms are now gaining increasing popularity with the rapid advancement of machine learning ml techniques deep learning dl has gradually demonstrated its modeling capability due to the recent increase in computing power and data volume traditional tree based methods and deep learning models have both shown high accuracy in simulating groundwater levels in different areas zhang et al 2018 rajaee et al 2019 chen et al 2020 however a comparative analysis among different ml models to solve hydrogeological problems has rarely been performed deep learning algorithms may bring added value to traditional machine learning when groundwater levels vary under the strong anthropic influence compared with pbms ddms are often treated as black boxes in hydrological science shen 2018 this feature has certain advantages and disadvantages the ddm can combine data from multiple sources within a single groundwater level prediction model such as precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration data from observation stations and water utility data zhang et al 2018 sun et al 2022 river discharge data from observation sites sahu et al 2020 water storage data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace sun 2013 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and hydrological data such as soil moisture and plant canopy surface water from the global land data assimilation system gldas seyoum et al 2019 multisource data are fed into ddms after common data preprocessing procedures such as data normalization compared to pbms ddms also have the advantage of allowing the use of easily accessible datasets from remote sensing and open source databases however it is still unclear what kind of datasets and processing procedures are the most suitable to make full use of the potential of ddms for groundwater level prediction because of the black box nature ddms cannot provide a direct explanation of the model s intrinsic choices even though they yield a better prediction capability than pbms most previous studies indeed only report satisfactory results without exploring the inherent mechanism of the black box characteristics because of the ddms pure reliance on the mining relationships among inputs and targets more attention is currently focused on investigating the inherent mechanism to identify the contribution of the driving factors most examples are seen with traditional tree based machine learning methods by using feature importance fi analysis friedman and meulman 2003 seyoum et al 2019 used a boosted regression tree brt to predict the groundwater level in a glaciated area using hydrological datasets grace and the land data assimilation system datasets leveraging the feature importance fi to quantify the variable contribution of simulating groundwater dynamics in this area referring to artificial neural networks anns there are numerous measures for determining the relative relevance of driving factors among them coppola et al 2003 used backward stepwise elimination to identify the feature importance in the groundwater level prediction of ann models based on this method sun 2013 used an improved approach to quantify the feature importance in the ann based groundwater level prediction model sahu et al 2020 deployed sensitivity analysis for ann based groundwater level prediction via different combinations of feature importance recent studies have proven that deep learning models have reliable accuracy for hydrological forecasting such as rainfall runoff modeling shen 2018 kratzert et al 2019 xiang et al 2020 and groundwater level prediction zhang et al 2018 sun et al 2022 however not enough attention is given to driving factor analysis for deep learning models in groundwater level prediction especially in areas with strong withdrawals to assess the potential of the ddms for hydrogeological application the north china plain ncp is selected as a case study area fig 1 a the site is a strategic basin of china 144 000 km2 with 311 million inhabitants characterized by stressed groundwater resources striving to satisfy the increasing water demand gleeson et al 2012 in the ncp groundwater has been overpumped since the 1960 s leading to a groundwater level decline at a speed of 1 m y by the end of the 1990s liu et al 2011 since 2014 the water crisis has been mitigated by south to north water transfer snwt project an expensive water resource that provides additional surface water from catchments in southern china yang et al 2022 strong water pumping and climate change have imposed obvious nonstationarity on groundwater dynamics pbms have already been utilized to establish groundwater flow models in the ncp to investigate the groundwater flow system and water resource management strategies cao et al 2013 qin et al 2013 cao et al 2014 yang et al 2022 in the area a pioneering ddm has been deployed for groundwater level prediction sun et al 2022 however since groundwater depletion is a tangible sign of a highly complex groundwater system influenced by many factors this paper aims to 1 develop ddms for groundwater level simulation in ncp based on remote sensing and open source data 2 examine the ability of different machine learning algorithms both classic tree based and deep learning when simulating groundwater level variations under sparse and nonstationary data conditions and 3 identify the most influential forcing variables in the ddms using feature importance analysis for the interpretable results 2 study area and dataset 2 1 study area the north china plain ncp is a large alluvial multilayer aquifer located between the taihang mts yan mts and bohai bay including the beijing tianjin shandong hebei and henan provinces fig 1a the basin has a tectonic origin and consists of continental coarse deposits alternated with deltaic and lacustrine fine sediments lancia et al 2021 the ncp alluvial sequence has a variable thickness exceeding 1 000 m from the lower cenozoic to quaternary xu et al 2016 from a hydrogeological point of view a classical schematization of the stratigraphy identifies four main aquifers fig 1b interrupted by discontinuous layers of clay cao et al 2013 the first and second aquifers are shallow aquifers and represent the major water supply source the third and fourth are confined aquifers zhang et al 2009 water resources have been considered the most critical limiting factor to the development of the ncp since the aquifer system has become one of the most overexploited areas in the world kendy et al 2003 liu et al 2008 additionally the groundwater quality has experienced an increasing deterioration on average the annual precipitation is approximately 500 mm which accounts for only 335 m3 of renewable water resources per capita per year 2 2 simulation target and hydrological inputs 1 groundwater level data historical groundwater levels from the china institute of geo environmental monitoring cigem consist of 230 monthly water levels monitored from 2003 to 2014 including 178 wells and 38 multilevel wells however the majority of the wells have gaps in the time series record and cannot be implemented in the modeling only 11 observation wells with complete groundwater level records from 2003 are selected as the target labels for model training and evaluation fig 2 selected observation wells in shallow and confined aquifers are shown in fig 1a 2 gldas gldas 2 0 noah 3 6 and gldas 2 0 clsm f2 5 were utilized as the driving dataset in ddms the precipitation p evapotranspiration et storm surface runoff runoff baseflow groundwater runoff baseflow soil moisture from 0 to 200 cm soil moisture temperature t and specific humidity h taken from gldas 2 0 noah 3 6 and groundwater storage gws were used as input data in our study table 1 all these data were arranged into monthly average or accumulative forms to be consistent with groundwater level data the gws and soil moisture were transferred into gldas groundwater storage anomalies gwsagldas and soil moisture anomalies of gldas soil moistureagldas by subtracting the average value through the same time span with grace processing 2004 2009 it is worth noting that the gws in the gldas 2 0 clsm f2 5 only simulates shallow groundwater hence gwsagldas only includes shallow groundwater storage the gldas data were retrieved from https disc gsfc nasa gov hydrology data holdings 3 grace an ensemble means of the release 05 grace level 3 grace product from the center for space research at the university of texas csr the jet propulsion laboratory jpl and the geoforschungszentrum potsdam gfz were used to ensure the highest level of accuracy in accordance with landerer and swenson 2012 the grace terrestrial water storage data twsagrace were multiplied using the scaling factor given with the grace data to recover the signal weakened during filtering and truncation of twsagrace observations throughout processing table 1 grace data are available at https grace jpl nasa gov 4 ndvi the ndvi normalized difference vegetation index can represent the covering of surface vegetation spot vegetation proba v 1km products available at https www vito eodata be ten day 1km vegetation index data were utilized to create the monthly 1km vegetation index ndvi spatial distribution dataset used in this study table 1 the maximum value synthesis approach was used to create a monthly vegetation index dataset dating back to 1998 this dataset effectively reflects the geographical and temporal distribution of the vegetation throughout china which is relevant for ecological research such as vegetation monitoring the influence of human agricultural operations was used as input data in the model to replicate the groundwater dynamics as ndvi reflects crop growth 3 methodology 3 1 workflow to simulate groundwater dynamics we utilized tree based machine learning algorithms and recurrent neural network based deep learning algorithms to investigate the potentiality of ddms the comprehensive workflow is shown in fig 2 all the driving factors and simulation targets were utilized by the tree based machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms to establish the groundwater level prediction model during the data preparation all of the driving factors and simulation targets have been normalized by min max normalization during the training process the hyperparameters were automatically tuned the tree structured of parzen estimators tpe method was used for the tree based machine learning models and the bayesian optimization method was used for the deep learning models due to this workflow the training process achieved the best performance and reproducibility for all the models feature importance analysis was conducted on the established machine learning models and deep learning models to identify the driving factors contributions to groundwater level prediction 3 2 feature engineering groundwater data on large scale basins are difficult to model especially as water pumping affects water table dynamics via feature engineering a dataset that examines the influence of human activity on groundwater storage variation is built based on grace and gldas datasets gldas is the output of the physical process data assimilation model in the case of natural fluctuations but does not consider human activities in contrast grace directly observes terrestrial water storage changes which may be considered a combination of natural and anthropic water storage changes therefore the superimposed groundwater storage changes that include the effects of human activities and natural fluctuations gwsafe can be obtained by the difference between twsagrace and soil moistureagldas eq 1 then the human activity variable is further obtained by the difference between gwsafe and gwsagldas eq 2 these two datasets created by feature engineering are utilized as input data for model generation and data mining 1 gwsafe twsagrace soil moistureagldas 2 human activity gwsafe gwsagldas 3 3 machine learning algorithms 3 3 1 tree based algorithms 1 random forest rf the random forest rf approach is a machine learning strategy that combines classification and regression trees and bagging breiman 2001 in summary random forest is a supervised ensemble learning algorithm where the core idea is to combine multiple classification and regression trees with weak performance into a forest by certain rules the prediction is produced by averaging the outcomes of classification and regression trees formed on bootstrap samples during tree building training data are divided into bootstrap sample data and out of bag oob data with oob data utilized for cross validation furthermore variables are selected at random from all predictor variables at each node with one of them serving as the splitting criterion the capacity to rank predictors according to an internal measure of variable relevance is a key aspect of the random forest technique verikas et al 2011 chen and ishwaran 2012 the difference in prediction errors before and after permuting a certain predictor variable in the oob data is used to calculate permutation importance a commonly used variable importance metric in random forest in this study the permutation importance measure is adopted and calculated to identify important variables 2 gradient boosting regressor gbr gradient boosting is a machine learning approach that provides a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models often decision trees for regression and classification tasks the gradient boosting regressor gbr is structured into three components a loss function a weak learner used to make predictions and an additive model used to minimize the loss function gradient boosting constructs an additive model in a step by step method to optimize any differentiable loss function a regression tree is fitted on the negative gradient of the supplied loss function at each level in this study the task is defined as a regression fitting question the detailed mathematical formulation is discussed in pedregosa et al 2011 3 extreme gradient boosting xgboost extreme gradient boosting xgboost is an efficient open source implementation of the gradient boosting algorithm and consists of a scalable end to end implementation of the gradient boosting framework chen and guestrin 2016 this algorithm is suitable for sparse data such as hydrogeological problems when the observed groundwater spatiotemporal dynamics are discontinuous xgboost introduces a second order taylor expansion for the loss function to increase accuracy and allow customization of loss functions xgboost adds a regularity term to the objective function to control the complexity of the model the regularity term contains the number of leaf nodes of the tree and the l2 paradigm of leaf node weights the regularity term reduces the model variance which simplifies the learned model and helps prevent overfitting 4 light gradient boosting machine lightgbm light gradient boosting machine lightgbm is an open source distributed gradient boosting framework for machine learning that was originally developed by microsoft ke et al 2017 it is a unique gbdt gradient boosting decision tree approach that uses gradient based one side sampling goss exclusive feature bundling efb and histogram based algorithms to deal with high numbers of data instances and features it supports efficient parallel training and has the advantages of faster training speed lower memory consumption and distributed support for fast processing of large quantities of data when compared to basic decision tree algorithms via a leafwise strategy lightgbm finds the leaf with the largest splitter gain which reduces unnecessary computations lightgbm uses optimized feature parallel and data parallel methods to accelerate the computations a voting parallel strategy is also used when the data volume is very large lightgbm also optimizes the cache to increase the cache hit rate ke et al 2017 3 3 2 deep learning algorithms 1 long short term memory neural networks vanilla lstm the lstm network is a type of recurrent neural network rnn that is meant to solve the typical rnn s vanishing gradient problem schmidhuber and hochreiter 1997 lstm networks such as rnns can solve sequence problems and capture temporal dynamics however the specific design of lstm networks allows transmitting the long runtime effect from earlier dynamics lstm has been utilized to solve hydrological and hydrogeological problems in previous studies showing a significant ability for streamflow and water quality simulation chen et al 2020 kratzert et al 2018 2019 rajaee et al 2019 shen 2018 sun et al 2022 xiang et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 the lstm architecture is shown in fig 3 a the cell state and its multiple gates act as a transport bridge transferring relative information to the sequence circuit and are regarded as network memory in principle the cell state c t can carry meaningful information throughout the sequence as a result knowledge from earlier time steps can travel to later time steps lessening the impact of short term memory information is added or withdrawn from the cell state as the cell state progresses the gates are various neural networks that determine whether information about the cell state is permitted during training the gates learn which information is important to remember and which to discard the detailed mathematics equations is reported on supplementary material 2 lstm coupled with the encoder decoder framework ende lstm the encoder decoder framework is a typical lstm network topology bahdanau et al 2014 and derives from two recurrent neural networks i e encoder and decoder as shown in fig 3b the hydrological inputs are read by the encoder composed of lstm cells and hydrological information is compressed into the encoder state by the lstm encoder during this compression a well trained encoder decoder model can extract meaningful hydrological information and archive it in the encoder state the decoder reads the encoder state decompresses the hydrological information through the repeated vector layer and generates the groundwater level for each time step compared to vanilla lstm ende lstm can deal with long term dependency problems and multiple step forecasting problems starting from an input sequence the model outputs a value for each of the time steps the encoder decoder framework is essentially a back and forth mapping between input and output among the hydrological features as a result the system transforms driving factors into groundwater levels by feeding the encoder output as an input to the decoder 3 3 3 input data format to understand the data input of the lstm the input data format is described after adding the time axis the data cube at different moments with multiple features of the multi sample is shown in fig 3c and 3d fig 3c is the input shape of data into the common tb models such as xgboost lightgbm and decision tree the input data format is a samples features matrix fig 3d is the data cube after adding the time axis that is the slice on the time axis the dimension of which is samples time features the first dimension is the number of samples the second dimension is the time and the third dimension is the number of features the timestep in this study is set as 12 months by try error in contrast to the tb model s two dimensional input data matrix lstm may correlate the before and after information through the time axis and fully use the information contained in the long time series by introducing the time dimension to construct a three dimensional data matrix 3 4 hyperparameter optimization hyperparameters are various parameter values that are used to influence the learning process and have a substantial impact on machine learning model performance probst et al 2019 the number of estimators n estimators maximum depth max depth and criterion are examples of hyperparameters in the random forest algorithm gbr and lightgbm these parameters are adjustable and have a direct impact on how well the model training performs the process of determining the optimal combination of hyperparameter settings to obtain optimum performance on the data in a reasonable length of time is known as hyperparameter optimization in this study the tree of parzen estimators tpe algorithm deployed by hyperopt bergstra et al 2013 is selected to optimize all the tree based machine learning models rf gbr xgboost lightgbm to obtain the best simulation of the groundwater levels all the hyperparameters used in this study are shown in table s1 a detailed description of this method is included in the supplementary material in deep learning models the bayesian optimization algorithm provided by kerastuner o malley et al 2019 is selected for the hyperparameter tuning of the learning rate dropout rate and neuron numbers of the lstm layer this procedure can simultaneously ensure the satisfactory performance of each established deep learning groundwater level prediction model and guarantee reproducibility the detailed model structure tables s2 and s3 and optimization methodology are described in the supplementary material 3 5 feature importance analysis 3 5 1 gini coefficient based analysis for feature importance in tree based methods the gini coefficient gini is commonly employed as an assessment criterion to quantify the amount of the input features contribution to the model breiman 2001 in this study the variable contribution is investigated by using a gini coefficient based analysis for the feature importance of tb models see supplementary material 3 5 2 permutation feature importance pfi tb models have the capability of presenting feature importance breiman 2001 vanilla lstm and ende lstm do not have such benefits however the feature importance can be computed for any model using the permutation feature importance technique the advantage of permutation importance is to train one model rather than numerous models for each feature the permutation feature importance is measured by the increase in the model s prediction error when the feature s values are permuted which breaks the link between the feature and the real result a feature is important if shuffling its values increases model error because the model depends on the feature for prediction in this scenario a feature is unimportant if shuffling its values results in the same model error since the model ignores the feature for the prediction breiman 2001 presents the permutation feature importance assessment for random forests based on this concept fisher et al 2019 present model reliance a model agnostic variant of feature importance according to fisher et al 2019 the permutation feature importance algorithm is as follows i calculate the original model s error e original l y f x in this study error measure model l y f x using mean squared error where x represents the feature matrix and y represents the corresponding target sequence ii for each feature x x a permute feature x in the data x to generate a feature matrix x perm this destroys the link between feature and the true label y b estimate new error from permutated feature matrix e permutated l y f x perm based on permuted data forecasts c calculate the quotient fi x e permutated e original or difference fi x e permutated e original as the permutation feature importance of each feature x 3 6 model evaluation metrics the root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 are used to evaluate the model s accuracy between the measured and predicted values rmse demonstrates the quadratic mean of differences between the predicted and observed values the model correctly fits the data as the rmse is closer to 0 r2 measures the predictive skill of a model relative to the mean of observations ranging between 1 where for optimal model prediction an r2 close to 1 is preferred the r2 and rmse equations are defined as 8 r 2 1 i 1 n y i o i 2 i 1 n o i o i 2 9 rmse 1 n v i 1 n y i o i 2 1 2 where y i and o i are the predicted and observed values respectively o i is the mean of the observed data and n v is the number of target data used for testing the mann kendall test mann 1945 and sen s slope analysis sen 1968 are utilized to evaluate the trend in the time series dataset from the driving factors in ddms the principle of the mann kendall test can be found in the supplementary material 4 results 4 1 engineered input features based on the mann kendall test results table 2 except for precipitation all the other variables from gldas present increasing trends while the variables from grace and feature engineering show decreasing trends based on the gldas 2 0 noah 3 6 dataset the precipitation has no obvious trend over 2003 2014 fig 4 the et and soil moisture show an increasing trend at 5 6 mm y and 1 58 mm y respectively in the multiple wells used in this study the gwsa from the gldas 2 0 clsm f2 5 dataset also presents an increasing trend at 1 88 mm y however twsagrace shows a decreasing trend of 4 5 mm y in the multiple wells used as the simulation target which differs from previous studies on twsa changes across the ncp the human activity and gwsafe engineered features present decreasing trends of 7 65 mm y and 5 6 mm y respectively the results show that even though the groundwater storage due to natural processes is estimated to have increased during 2003 2014 the actual terrestrial water storage detected by grace exhibits an obvious decreasing trend the decreasing trend of human activity and gwsafe also illustrates that anthropogenic influence resulted in a shortage of groundwater storage in the ncp fig 4d 4e 4 2 model evaluation and comparison all the data driven models tb and dl in this research used the 2004 2010 dataset as the training set the 2011 2012 dataset as the validation set for model selection and hyperparameter tuning and the 2013 2014 dataset as the test set to examine the actual performance in the real groundwater level prediction case due to the data sparsity in this study each well is trained with one ml model the major evaluation and comparison metrics among the tb and dl models are based on the performance on the test set the accuracy of the tb and dl models in simulating groundwater level variations is measured using r2 and rmse fig 5 dl models show satisfactory results as the median r2 values of vanilla lstm and ende lstm are 0 47 and 0 61 respectively the gbr has the greatest median r2 0 34 among all the tb algorithms xgboost rf and lightgbm only reach r2 values of 0 30 0 30 and 0 19 respectively the rmse of dl models is less than 1 25 m whereas the median rmses of the tb models are all over 1 5 m fig 5b ende lstm has a higher r2 and lower rmse in deep learning models than vanilla lstm meaning that ende lstm has a stronger ability to reconstruct historical and future groundwater levels with sufficient accuracy than vanilla lstm the r2 and rmse in tb models are similar to each other and fail to achieve satisfactory performance which means that most tb models cannot capture the underlying groundwater dynamics based on highly nonstationary and sparse datasets as in the case of ncp even though deep learning models have a significantly better ability to simulate temporal groundwater level dynamics their performance still depends on the hydrogeological settings different wells have different behavior because of the local hydrological characteristics e g leaking water infrastructures losing rivers and streams and anthropogenic activities the groundwater level prediction results by ende lstm recorded in shallow water wells w 7 are shown in fig 6 a and w 10 in fig 6b the prediction results in confined water well w 1 are shown in fig 6c and w 11 in fig 6d results of tb and vanilla lstm at selected wells are included in the supplementary material fig s1 s5 w 7 and w 10 intercept shallow aquifers in beijing and hebei respectively while w 1 and w 11 intercept confined aquifers in beijing and hebei in shallow aquifers w 7 shows general increasing trend during last 10 years while w 10 exhibits relatively stable trend in confined aquifers w 1 and w 11 all show obvious decreasing trend in general while exhibiting different dynamic patterns w 1 shows a decreasing trend with no obvious seasonality while w 11 shows a decreasing trend with seasonal and annual variations besides different hydrological conditions between shallow and confined aquifers the human activities drive the groundwater dynamics to behave substantially differently even though four wells in shallow and confined aquifers present four different trend patterns ende lstm can still achieve satisfactory performance on both wells in shallow and confined aquifers 4 3 identification of driving factor contributions the contribution of each driving factor is quantified based on feature importance fi analysis and permutation feature importance pfi analysis of tb and dl to investigate the groundwater system dynamics in detail fig 7 shows the statistical feature importance results of tb models in random forest rf the top three features with the highest average mean fi are twsagrace gwsafe and ndvi in xgboost the top three features with the highest average mean fi are temperature twsagrace and human activity in gbr the top three features with the highest average mean fi are gwsagldas twsagrace and gwsafe in lightgbm the top three features with the highest average mean fi are twsagrace followed by human activity and temperature fig 8 shows the contributions of the driving factors detected in the ende lstm and vanilla lstm models the human activity driver median is the highest in ende lstm approximately 0 8 while the median of et is on the top in vanilla lstm approximately 0 72 in addition to the human activity factors et temperature and gwsafe are also recognized by ende lstm as top key driving factors in groundwater dynamics simulation while the median among vanilla lstm factors is more homogeneous approximately 0 5 except for et therefore the ende lstm architecture can better investigate the potential relationship between groundwater dynamics and each variable compared to the pfi results of dl models tb models cannot capture the potential connection between human activity and groundwater level dynamics in fact tb models rely on temperature and terrestrial water storage change data from grace and gldas twsagrace gwsagldas the poor simulation results of the tb models for groundwater levels also suggest that data on water storage changes in grace and gldas are not the most important elements in groundwater level dynamics when compared to human activity dl models also perform better in characterizing the different hydrogeological settings in comparison with vanilla lstm ende lstm can better represent the groundwater dynamics in both shallow and confined aquifers differentiating the driving factors fig 9 a shows the pfi of ende lstm in the shallow aquifers the median pfi of human activity and et reaches 0 87 and 0 88 respectively and the median pfi of the remaining variables fluctuates in the range of 0 78 0 82 in confined aquifers fig 9b human activity and et are still considered as the top key driving factors with the higher importance of gwsafe and gwsagldas compared to the shallow aquifers the results indicate that ende lstm can detect significant differences in groundwater dynamics in both shallow and confined aquifers the pfi performance of vanilla lstm in the shallow aquifers shows that et is considered as the key driving factor in groundwater dynamics simulation while attach less importance to human activity compared to ende lstm fig 9c the median pfi of the remaining variables in the shallow aquifers fluctuates in the range of 0 57 0 69 unfortunately in confined aquifers the pfi median of the driving factors presents similar pattern with shallow aquifers indicating poor performance of identifying different hydrological characteristics compared to ende lstm cfr fig 9b and fig 9d ende lstm outperforms vanilla lstm confirming that human activity is the most important factor to simulate the groundwater level variation according to eq 2 human activity represents the change in groundwater storage caused by human activities in the north china plain it mostly refers to groundwater pumping for agricultural industrial and domestic use because of the increase in et temperature and other climate variables the increase in human water demand directly affects the change of groundwater storage and water level caused by groundwater pumping in the confined aquifer the correlation between human activity and groundwater level is among the top three in the driving factors which is primarily due to the massive water pumping by human activities in the north china plain fig 11 after training the ende lstm recognizes groundwater recharge as an essential mechanism impacting the groundwater flow system since the soil moisture factor is identified as a relevant predictor precipitation and evapotranspiration generally play a relatively minor role except at some wells located in shallow aquifers it is important to note that the impact of commonly seen forcing variables such as precipitation and temperature are already captured in physics based models e g gldas however a driving factor with a low pfi fig 9 does not mean that it is less important in contrast a driving factor with a high pfi indicates that the physics based models may not have captured the total information embedded in the raw data the roles played by the human activity factor more than the modeled twsagrace and gwsagldas highlight the significance of combining physics based simulation with ddms additional predictors including those duplicated ones that are already used in physics based models may compensate for the model structural error and or parameter uncertainty in land surface models sun and scanlon 2019 5 discussion 5 1 impact of feature engineering to investigate the impact of engineered features human activity and gwsafe four data combination scenarios are set up table 3 each scenario is a data combination from feature engineering under different driving data features the r2 fig 10 a and rmse fig 10b of the combined scenarios are variable among the scenarios the baseline human activity gwsafe performs the best the median r2 and rmse of the baseline scenario achieve 0 61 and 1 11 m respectively while s2 exhibits the lowest values of 0 28 and 1 58 m respectively according to the multiyear monthly average groundwater level dynamics fig 10c the cycle of multiyear monthly average changes in each scenario is very similar and the groundwater level has a typical upward tendency from august to february and a downward trend from march to august this phenomenon is due to the agricultural production process in the ncp area the main grain crop in the ncp is winter wheat which is irrigated primarily in april may and november groundwater pumping is the primary source of irrigation water irrigation pumping will reduce groundwater storage in the spring and summer increased evaporation of groundwater after irrigation will occur due to higher evapotranspiration during this time pumping and irrigation in november have a lower impact on groundwater storage due to reduced evapotranspiration the dynamics of the water table and groundwater storage depend on local hydrogeological conditions and irrigation water sources however each scenario has a significant variance in the groundwater level phase indicating the impact of varied feature engineering data particularly in terms of water level differences as a result combining human activity with gwsafe can help to reduce the offset in groundwater level simulations especially when using deep learning models 5 2 correlation between input and target ende lstm has the capacity to model both shallow and confined aquifers the results in fig 7 show that ende lstm has a better ability to capture the groundwater temporal dynamics in both confined aquifers and shallow aquifers the spearman correlation coefficient between all the driving factor datasets and the groundwater level at each observation well is calculated the results show that the overall range of the spearman correlation coefficient in shallow aquifers is relatively smaller than the range in confined aquifers fig 11 instead of exploring possible correlations based only on linear relationships machine learning models especially dl use nonlinear complex algorithms to mine potential associations between the driving factors and groundwater level dynamics revealing insights that linear correlation analysis cannot fully grasp in shallow aquifers most of the driving factors have a very poor correlation with groundwater levels however ende lstm captures a large contribution from human activity and separates human activity from the contribution of other components as shown in fig 9 in confined aquifers there is some degree of correlation between each driver and groundwater levels with the three highest correlations being twsagrace at approximately 0 55 gwsafe at approximately 0 55 and human activity at approximately 0 50 fig 11 however according to fig 9 the highest pfi in the confined aquifer is human activity and the contribution of the remaining factors is more consistent which indicates that dl can dig deeper to find potential relationships beyond the linear correlation in contrast to physical process models data driven models can leverage multiple sources of data for latent relationship mining the modeling process of pbms requires a clear physical relationship and correlation between the input data and the groundwater level in contrast dl models can avoid this limitation to a certain extent and mine relationships among multiple data sources 5 3 limitations considering that ml algorithms are data driven the quantity and quality of the data has a substantial influence on model correctness due to the spatiotemporal sparsity of groundwater observation in the ncp monthly groundwater level observation data of 11 years is used to establish the ml model if more data are available for ml model training the model s robustness and generalization ability would improve and the model performance would improve in the proposed framework the data used in this study can be divided into two categories driving factors and simulation targets the driving factors in this study use processed remote sensing data twsagrace and ndvi and assimilation system data gldas hence there are fewer characteristics such as outliers and missing gaps the simulation targets use actual observed groundwater yearbook data which may have missing data and anomalies when used on a large scale problems in data quality can affect how the model mines the relationship between driving factors and simulation targets therefore when building a dl model for groundwater dynamics simulation data processing for both driving factors and simulation targets should be performed to reduce the effects of data anomalies and deficiencies impacting the model performance the groundwater dynamics simulation framework proposed in this study is based on observation field data and related driving factors the main objective is to simulate the in situ groundwater level dynamics the model can simulate the relationship between the driving factors gldas and grace and the groundwater temporal dynamics further research is still needed on how to further extend the model from the time series to the spatiotemporal dimension establishing a groundwater spatiotemporal dynamic model 6 conclusions in this study several ddms were compared to reconstruct groundwater level temporal dynamics the results show that deep learning models provide a stronger simulation effect than tree based machine learning models deep learning models can capture the most important drivers from forcing factors investigate potential interconnections and increase the simulation capabilities of groundwater systems among deep learning models ende lstm has a stronger data mining capacity achieving greater groundwater level dynamics modeling accuracy and capturing the influence of human activity among the driving factors compared with other driving factors evaluated in this study human activity which is the engineered feature from the gldas and grace datasets has a stronger underlying connection with groundwater level dynamics this finding shows that although multiple data sources can contribute to the establishment of the groundwater level dynamics model these driving factors need to be processed based on the physical meaning behind them to achieve higher accuracy the combination of human activity and gwsafe data can be added to the reconstruction of regional groundwater level simulation to eliminate part of the offset in the groundwater level simulation and improve the groundwater level reconstruction accuracy deep learning models can find deeper underlying associations with weaker correlations between the driving factors and groundwater level dynamics groundwater level forecasting using ende lstm models is a promising tool aimed at safeguarding aquifers and maintaining the sustainability of groundwater pumping model application is also suitable in remote areas where hydrogeological investigations are sparse and scarcely correlated via ddms possible correlations between groundwater levels and external parameters not directly related to the equations governing aquifer dynamics are fully utilized for groundwater level forecasting the energy market global price of agricultural products or other parameters can be implemented as driving factors to better simulate the groundwater levels and the water abstraction rates to improve future predictions with different social economic and climate scenarios credit authorship contribution statement hao jing methodology writing original draft software xin

2551,besides mechanical protection and sugar transport through phloem barks also transpire some amount of water bark transpiration may be a driving force to keep water flux during the leafless period among tropical deciduous trees but has been hardly investigated in the current investigation we used the sap flow data to assess the water consumption during leaf loss initiation total leaf loss period and leaf flush period in three economically important tropical deciduous timber species i e anogeissus acuminata dipterocarpus tuberculatus and tectona grandis eight trees of each species were measured using granier s heat dissipation sensors with the circumference ranging from 59 cm to 172 cm mean 59 84 cm across the three species the phenological observation for canopy leaves was also carried out on weekly basis during the completely leafless period a significant amount of water flux was detected in all three species which was correlated with vapor pressure deficit vpd and light intensity the whole tree daily mean water consumption during this leaf less flower less and fruit less period mainly due to bark transpiration was around 8 14 kg across the three species it was about 7 to 18 of the mean whole tree daily transpiration in the fully foliated canopies during a typical wet season period this water flux was supported by sufficient soil moisture as indicated by the pre dawn leaf water potential higher than 0 4 mpa in the three species further a significant and positive relationship r2 0 32 p 0 005 was found between tree circumference and whole tree water consumption during the leaf less period the total stand level water consumption during the leaf less period ranged from 13 mm to 26 8 mm on a 30 days basis across the three species such water flux mainly driven by bark transpiration could have a significant role in maintaining the hydraulic integrity of trees in the dry season although it could reduce xylem water potential to a risky level of hydraulic dysfunction during a prolonged drought or on dry sites the study is the first report on bark transpiration in intact trees scaled to the stand level which should be included in the modeling of hydraulic function of plant and ecosystem hydrology keywords bark drought leafless period water loss xylem embolism data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction trees regulate water consumption through stomatal opening and closure but during stomatal closure due to environmental stresses or the leafless durations some water loss occurs by transpiration through surfaces of branches and trunks wittmann and pfanz 2008b earles et al 2016 depending upon the species the leaf less period among tropical deciduous trees varies from two weeks to six months or more singh and kushwaha 2005 during the leaf less period plants have to keep certain water flux to hydrate the xylem and phloem and maintain adequate water in living tissues martínez vilalta et al 2019 there have been a few studies oren and pataki 2001 wittmann and pfanz 2008a 2008b wolfe 2020 from different trees species reporting water loss through bark transpiration mainly using the harvesting and gas exchange methods it has been found that branch bark of mediterranean pinus protects the xylem from cavitation by supplying water to the xylem conduits hence keeping them hydrated during a dry period when stomata are closed or leaves are shed lintunen et al 2021 however net efflux of water from stem surfaces may be significant in some ecosystems especially during the different leaf phenological stages iida et al 2016 in the seasonal tropical climates deciduous trees are important component of total cover the measurements of the whole tree water flux during the leaf less period from deciduous trees in seasonal tropical climates will allow assessment of water consumption that is mainly due to bark transpiration through lenticels though living tissues may also consume some minor amount of water transpiration during a leafless period is not only relevant to plant physiology but may also be an important element of ecosystem hydrology van stan et al 2021 water loss from the stomata and bark surfaces of trees is driven by vapor pressure deficit vpd and solar radiation but its magnitude is determined by soil water status around the root zones and the status of leaves on the canopy siddiq and cao 2016 iidaet al 2016 transpirational water consumption of trees reaches its maximum when high transpirational demand high vpd is coupled with availability of water in the soil during water stress conditions the water loss through stomata is reduced or completely halted to prevent decreasing of xylem water potential to the threshold inducing hydraulic dysfunction mcdowell etal 2013 mencuccini etal 2015 the whole tree water consumption is also dependent on tree size as it could be correlated with the leaf and bark surface areas siddiq et al 2017 siddiq and cao 2016 bark of the trunk and branches during the fully leafed canopies has less direct exposure to the solar radiations than during the dry season period of leaf loss vapor pressure deficit in the dry season can be high due to high temperature and lower air humidity such conditions probably lead to increased loss of water from stem surfaces provided sufficient water available in the soil lintunen et al 2021 for example wolfe 2020 found that the species having high bark conductance also had a high stem water deficit especially during the dry season and some species could have strong stomatal control while losing water during leaf fall iida et al 2016 therefore bark transpiration could further decrease plant water potential and even lead to catastrophic hydraulic dysfunction and tree mortality during a prolonged drought li et al 2021 the role of stem surfaces in deciduous trees may be more important than in needle and broadleaf evergreens for maintenance of a low water flux to hydrate the xylem and phloem during leafless periods further the development of the canopy with new leaves require some amount of water and mineral nutrients oren and pataki 2001 which can only be supplied if the previous xylem remain functioning a large proportion of asian tropical forests are subject to seasonal drought corlett 2016 zhang et al 2020 and the frequency and duration of drought in asian tropics is being exacerbated due to climate change and may continue in the future dai 2011 ipcc 2021 wang et al 2022 such drought episodes impact the hydrology and phenological behavior of trees and hence their productivity duan et al 2018 zhao et al 2013 the duration of leaf flushing was delayed in tectona grandis till the availability of rainwater during a drought yoshifuji et al 2006 it has been reported in the some other species that excessive prolongation of leafless period can also lead to the carbon starvation as well as severe xylem embolism adams et al 2009 adams et al 2017 the present study was planned to use the sap flow data from three economically important deciduous timber species in a northern tropical site to answer two questions 1 how much water are consumed at tree and stand levels during the leafless period for three deciduous tropical tree species which could be largely due to bark transpiration 2 is dry season sap flux density of leafless period related to environmental factors such as vapor pressure deficit and light intensity 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and species the study was carried out in the monsoon plantation stands of three tropical deciduous timber species i e anogeissus acuminata dipterocarpus tuberculatus and tectona grandis in xishuangbanna tropical botanical garden xtbg 21 54ʹ59 99 n 101 14ʹ60 00 e 580 m a s l southern yunnan province southwest china this region has a typical tropical monsoon climate with a pronounced dry season from november to april the mean annual precipitation is 1560 mm of which 80 occur during the wet season may to october the mean annual temperature of the study site is 21 7 c fig 1 cao et al 2006 the region has the mountain valley topography and the soil formation from the siliceous rocks rock substrate of sandstone and limestone zhu 2006 these plantation stands have not been subject to pruning and contain a herbaceous ground cover eight replicate trees of each species were selected for the sap flow measurement and phenological observation 2 2 phenological observations the phenological observation of each of the eight trees was made on weekly basis from february to may 2016 three canopy branches from each tree were tagged and the number of leaves on each target branch were counted to estimate the percentage of leaves remaining 2 3 water flux through bark transpiration the water flux through bark transpiration was inferred from the sap flow measurements 2015 2016 on eight trees of each of the three timber species for assessing the water flux during the leafless period the sap flow data from february to may 2016 representing the duration of leafless and new leaf appearance and a week spa flow data of september 2015 representing the fully developed canopy leaves in the wet season were used the circumference range of the sample trees are indicated in table 1 the laboratory made granier s heat dissipation granier 1987 sap flow sensors were fixed at trunks of 1 3 m height from the ground in the outer 2 cm and 4 cm of sapwood of trees each sensor consisted of a thermocouple surrounded by a heating coil and a reference sensor all sensors were connected to data loggers cr 1000 campbell connected with a multiplexer am 16 32 campbell and supplied with a constant power of 0 2 w to heat the sensors each tree was equipped with two sets of sensors installed at 90 to the stem and directionally opposite to each other the sensors were protected from mechanical damage and solar radiation using aluminum foil data were logged every 30 s and averaged over 60 min intervals for storage in the data loggers the sensors were monitored bi weekly and malfunctioning sensors were immediately replaced the sap flux density g m 2 s 1 was calculated using the baseliner program version 3 0 7 c h2o ecology group nicholas school of the environment duke university durham north carolina usa the average values from two paired sensors were used to calculate the sap flux density for each individual tree because the original granier s equation is not universal for all the species and should be calibrated as it could underestimate the sap flow taneda and sperry 2008 bush et al 2010 hultine et al 2010 we used the calibrated granier s equation developed by siddiq et al 2017 for these species to calculate their sap flux density the zero flow was established as the maximum difference between the heated and non heated sensors which was attained late mid nights as there was no biophysical driving force due to low vpd eliades et al 2018 fig s1 2 4 whole tree and stand level water consumption the daily whole tree water consumption during the leaf loss initiation leaf less period and the leafed canopy month for each species was calculated by multiplying the active sapwood area by the integral of 24 h sap flux density whole tree sap flux density was calculated by multiplying the flow per area sensed at 2 cm by the area of a ring between the outer most xylem and 2 cm similarly for the flow of the ring from 2 cm to 4 cm among all the trees the active sapwood was not 4 cm the active sapwood area of each sample tree was determined using the dye injection method a dye solution of 0 1 safranin was injected into the sapwood at 1 3 m height after 12 16 h a 5 mm and 5 8 cm long core was taken just above the injection point to measure the active sapwood area by assessing the dye color travelled on the xylem core clearwater et al 1999 the cores were taken after the sap flow measurements to avoid any damage to the trees the active sapwood areas for these species was not 4 cm the contributions of sap flow sensed at 2 cm and 4 cm were added to determine the whole tree total sap flow g h 1 which was multiplied by the sapwood area and then integrated over 24 h to estimate whole tree daily followed by weekly water consumption for comparison during this period trees were devoid of leaves or other structures external to the stems such as flowers and fruits thus the flux in this period was considered mainly due to transpiration from the stem surfaces bark as the physiological activities of living tissues could consume a minor amount of water the stand level bark transpiration was estimated based on the survey of 20 m 20 m plots in the plantation stands of three species all the trees with circumference 30 cm were measured for circumference the circumference ranges of trees were 69 116 cm 62 123 cm and 59 174 cm for a acuminata d tuberculatus and t grandis respectively the stand density and basal areas for the three species are provided in table 1 the stand level transpiration mm d 1 was estimated using the following formula wullschlegeret al 2001 kumagai et al 2008 e 1 a plot j 1 n w u j where wuj is the daily water use of tree j kg d 1 during the leaf less period and aplot is the plot area m2 the daily stand level bark transpiration was integrated to weekly or monthly basis 2 5 pre dawn leaf water potential in order to assess the soil water status around the root zones of the trees the pre dawn leaf water potential ψl was measured on site with a pressure chamber pms albany or usa during the days when only few leaves were left on the canopy for tectona the leaf water potential was measured during the last week of february while for anogeissus and dipterocarpus it was measured in mid march 2016 for each tree 5 6 complete and healthy leaves were collected at 6 00 to 7 00 am for water potential measurement 2 6 meteorological data the meteorological data temperature relative humidity and photosynthetic active radiation par were obtained from the climatic station of xtbg which is situated approximately 900 m away from the sap flow measurement site the hourly mean values of the meteorological variables were used in the analysis the vapor pressure deficit vpd was calculated from air temperature and relative humidity campbell and norman 1998 2 7 data analysis the statistical analyses and graphics were made using sigma plot version 12 5 systat software inc usa the relationships between the hourly mean vpd par and sap flux density during the leafless and leaf flushing periods were analyzed using linear regression as day time mean vpd and par during these periods were strongly correlated r2 0 45 p 0 0001 we only presented the results of the correlation between mean sap flux density and vpd 3 results 3 1 phenological observations for canopy foliage status the three species varied in the timing and duration of leaf fall but all were leafless for several weeks tectona grandis started to shed the leaves in the second week of january and completed leaf shedding at the end of february in a acuminata and d tuberculatus leaf shedding initiated in the first week of march and completed in the last week of march the duration of complete leaflessness for t grandis was 6 weeks but 4 weeks for both a acuminata and d tuberculatus all the species had their new crown of leaves by the beginning of may fig 2 a the weekly sap flux density varied across the three species and was 1096 g cm 2 week 1 even during the leafless weeks fig 2 b 3 2 diurnal pattern of vpd par and sap flux density the hourly mean diurnal pattern of vpd and par showed the similar diurnal peaks but the peaks of diurnal sap flux density for each species was significantly different during the month of march and april 2016 fig 3 in a acuminata the daily mean sap flux density in the leafless month of april and during the wet season week of september were 16 g m 2 s 1 2 02 and 30 g m 2 s 1 4 91 respectively while in d tuberculatus it was 3 2 g m 2 s 1 0 62 and 7 9 g m 2 s 1 1 45 and in t grandis it was 11 g m 2 s 1 1 81 and 5 g m 2 s 1 0 95 fig 2 b the sap flux density during the leafless month was significantly lower p 0 001 0 003 and 0 001 for a acuminata and d tuberculatus and t grandis respectively during leafless day of april as compared to the wet season day of september 3 3 meteorological variables and plant water potential in march the weekly mean vpd and par ranged from 0 83 kpa 0 071 to 1 29 kpa 0 093 and 254 72 µ m2 sec 1 45 8 to 355 71 µ m2 sec 1 33 81 respectively while in april the vpd and par ranged from 1 0 0 087 to 2 23 0 02 and 342 45 µ m2 sec 1 44 88 to 620 57 µ m2 sec 1 77 99 respectively and in may the weekly mean vpd and par ranged from 0 58 0 03 to 1 31 0 089 and 296 45 µ m2 sec 1 35 71 to 454 42 µ m2 sec 1 62 34 respectively fig 2 c d while the mean wet season vpd was 0 7 0 081 and par 595 µ m2 sec 1 59 91 the vpd was significantly higher in the dry season weeks of march and april as compared to the wet season week of september p 0 001 while par was not significantly different between the dry season weeks and wet season week p 0 05 the weekly rainfall ranged from 0 mm to 32 mm from february to april 2016 fig 2 panel e for all the species the hourly mean sap flux density in march and april were strongly correlated with hourly mean vpd r2 0 65 p 0 0001 fig 4 a i similarly a significant p 0 001 and positive relationship r2 0 41 0 76 was found between the daily sap flux density and the daytime mean par across the three species during the months of march and april fig 5 the mean pre dawn leaf water potential prior to leaf shedding for a acuminata d tuberculatus and t grandis was 0 24 mp 0 025 0 18 mpa 0 01 and 0 31 mpa 0 02 indicating good water status of the studied plants 3 4 whole tree daily water consumption in leafless and leafy states during the leaf less weeks of the months of march and april the mean daily water consumption in a acuminata d tuberculatus and t grandis was 14 kg 2 01 se 13 kg 1 98 se and 8 1 kg 2 11 se respectively fig 6 a with mean circumference 87 cm 86 cm and 99 cm for a acuminata d tuberculatus and t grandis respectively the mean wet season week whole tree water use for a acuminata d tuberculatus and t grandis was 80 kg 100 kg and 126 kg respectively during these two months in dry season the percentage daily water consumption to the whole tree daily water use the in a representative wet season weak as 7 13 and 18 for t grandis d tuberculatus and a acuminata respectively fig 6 b the total stand level water consumption on a 30 day basis during the leafless period was 26 85 mm 18 mm and 13 6 mm for a acuminata d tuberculatus and t grandis respectively fig 6 c further across species a significant r2 35 p 0 006 and positive relationship was found between the tree circumference and mean daily water consumption during the leaf less period fig 7 at comparable circumference among the three species tectona grandis consumed less water than the other two species 4 discussion on the average the whole tree water consumption of the studied species ranged from 8 kg to 14 kg during the four six leaf less weeks which was 7 18 of water consumed by these species during the wet season week of september such water flux could assist these species in the xylem functioning during these weeks the strong correlation between sap flux density and vpd in the leafless period indicates that water consumption during the leafless period mainly resulted from bark transpiration though other physiological activities such as living tissues and bud development might consume some minor amount of water this water flux could be supported by the presence of water around their root zones which enabled them to meet the evaporative demand in the hot dry period of march april even during the initial hours of night there could be a significant amount of flux due to evaporative demand but it could include both the stem refilling as well as night time transpiration during a leaf less period siddiq and cao 2018 the nocturnal water use of leaf less duration among these species is 5 16 of the day time water use which is among the range reported by fisher et al 2007 and eliades et al 2018 this amount of water use can also have adaptive significance of cooling the bark surface so that reducing night respiration the total stand level transpiration during the leaf less period varied from 13 6 mm to 26 8 mm monthly among the three species while the outcrossing the total rainfall of 14 mm during this leaf less duration to our knowledge this paper is the first report about stand level water consumption during leaf less period in the intact trees this amount of water lost mainly through bark transpiration should be considered in modeling of ecosystem hydrology it should be noted that use of thermal dissipation method for sap flow can have some error due to natural temperature gradient which could be a limitation of the present study reyes acosta and lubczynski 2014 fuchs et al 2017 flo et al 2019 but the use of calibrated equation for these species and the estimation of active sapwood area could minimize the expected errors during the leafless period of april the day time vpd averaged 1 3 kpa but had a maximum above 2 2 kpa and the maximum water flow 54 35 and 27 of mean wet season whole tree daily water flow in a acuminata d tuberculatus and t grandis respectively the mean ratio of whole tree water consumption during the leafless period to that in wet season was 0 07 0 18 among these species it remains to be determined whether water consumption during leafless period is involved in fixation of carbon in barks of twigs and small branches in these species de roo et al 2020 this water flux may also hydrate the xylem vessels and facilitate the flushing of new leaves even some water for the refilling or recharge of xylem vessels but that amount of water must be lost from the bark klein etal 2016 wolfe 2020 lintunen et al 2021 using gas exchange methods reported that bark transpiration can range from 6 to 11 to 64 78 depending upon the species and environmental conditions among the three studied species at a similar circumference teak had less bark transpiration than a acuminata and d tuberculatus which could probably be due to the bark morphology of tectona garndis such as having lower density of lenticels it could also be due to the less soil water accessibility of its roots as indicated by its more negative pre dawn leaf water potential as compared to the other two species although tectona grandis had the greater basal area and tree density as compared to the other two species it should be noted that the presence of a herbaceous a cover in forest understory can have an indirect effect on bark transpiration rates of trees as the absence of leaves allow more solar radiations reaching the ground cover which could enhance understory growth and thus relatively more soil water will be up taken by the herbaceous vegetation eliades et al 2022 however the increased soil water uptake can be counter balanced by the increase of net rainfall reaching the ground due to less rainfall interception by the leaf less canopies del campoa et al 2022 the present study plantation stands also have a herbaceous ground cover and could have the similar counter balance of water availability during a dry period when stomata are closed and leaves are shed trees must keep a low amount of water such water flux is important to avoid massive embolism formation and the refilling of embolized vessels delzon and cochard 2014 hence the water flux during leafless period is important determinant for the survival trees in a drought mcdowell etal 2013 mencuccini etal 2015 during the leafless or drought period the foliar carbon assimilation is much limited li et al 2021 the water flux driven by bark transpiration also plays an important role in tree carbon balance through bark photosynthesis providing nutrients to the living tissues in sapwood and barks de roo et al 2020 it has been reported that sapwood and bark can store a significant amount of water which can be utilized during the water stress condition siddiq et al 2017 lintunen et al 2021 however in dry sites or in a severe drought bark transpiration may result in a decrease of plant water potential to the level of catastrophic hydraulic dysfunction and death of living cells in xylem and phloem and consequently tree mortality cuneo et al 2016 as the stand level

2551,besides mechanical protection and sugar transport through phloem barks also transpire some amount of water bark transpiration may be a driving force to keep water flux during the leafless period among tropical deciduous trees but has been hardly investigated in the current investigation we used the sap flow data to assess the water consumption during leaf loss initiation total leaf loss period and leaf flush period in three economically important tropical deciduous timber species i e anogeissus acuminata dipterocarpus tuberculatus and tectona grandis eight trees of each species were measured using granier s heat dissipation sensors with the circumference ranging from 59 cm to 172 cm mean 59 84 cm across the three species the phenological observation for canopy leaves was also carried out on weekly basis during the completely leafless period a significant amount of water flux was detected in all three species which was correlated with vapor pressure deficit vpd and light intensity the whole tree daily mean water consumption during this leaf less flower less and fruit less period mainly due to bark transpiration was around 8 14 kg across the three species it was about 7 to 18 of the mean whole tree daily transpiration in the fully foliated canopies during a typical wet season period this water flux was supported by sufficient soil moisture as indicated by the pre dawn leaf water potential higher than 0 4 mpa in the three species further a significant and positive relationship r2 0 32 p 0 005 was found between tree circumference and whole tree water consumption during the leaf less period the total stand level water consumption during the leaf less period ranged from 13 mm to 26 8 mm on a 30 days basis across the three species such water flux mainly driven by bark transpiration could have a significant role in maintaining the hydraulic integrity of trees in the dry season although it could reduce xylem water potential to a risky level of hydraulic dysfunction during a prolonged drought or on dry sites the study is the first report on bark transpiration in intact trees scaled to the stand level which should be included in the modeling of hydraulic function of plant and ecosystem hydrology keywords bark drought leafless period water loss xylem embolism data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction trees regulate water consumption through stomatal opening and closure but during stomatal closure due to environmental stresses or the leafless durations some water loss occurs by transpiration through surfaces of branches and trunks wittmann and pfanz 2008b earles et al 2016 depending upon the species the leaf less period among tropical deciduous trees varies from two weeks to six months or more singh and kushwaha 2005 during the leaf less period plants have to keep certain water flux to hydrate the xylem and phloem and maintain adequate water in living tissues martínez vilalta et al 2019 there have been a few studies oren and pataki 2001 wittmann and pfanz 2008a 2008b wolfe 2020 from different trees species reporting water loss through bark transpiration mainly using the harvesting and gas exchange methods it has been found that branch bark of mediterranean pinus protects the xylem from cavitation by supplying water to the xylem conduits hence keeping them hydrated during a dry period when stomata are closed or leaves are shed lintunen et al 2021 however net efflux of water from stem surfaces may be significant in some ecosystems especially during the different leaf phenological stages iida et al 2016 in the seasonal tropical climates deciduous trees are important component of total cover the measurements of the whole tree water flux during the leaf less period from deciduous trees in seasonal tropical climates will allow assessment of water consumption that is mainly due to bark transpiration through lenticels though living tissues may also consume some minor amount of water transpiration during a leafless period is not only relevant to plant physiology but may also be an important element of ecosystem hydrology van stan et al 2021 water loss from the stomata and bark surfaces of trees is driven by vapor pressure deficit vpd and solar radiation but its magnitude is determined by soil water status around the root zones and the status of leaves on the canopy siddiq and cao 2016 iidaet al 2016 transpirational water consumption of trees reaches its maximum when high transpirational demand high vpd is coupled with availability of water in the soil during water stress conditions the water loss through stomata is reduced or completely halted to prevent decreasing of xylem water potential to the threshold inducing hydraulic dysfunction mcdowell etal 2013 mencuccini etal 2015 the whole tree water consumption is also dependent on tree size as it could be correlated with the leaf and bark surface areas siddiq et al 2017 siddiq and cao 2016 bark of the trunk and branches during the fully leafed canopies has less direct exposure to the solar radiations than during the dry season period of leaf loss vapor pressure deficit in the dry season can be high due to high temperature and lower air humidity such conditions probably lead to increased loss of water from stem surfaces provided sufficient water available in the soil lintunen et al 2021 for example wolfe 2020 found that the species having high bark conductance also had a high stem water deficit especially during the dry season and some species could have strong stomatal control while losing water during leaf fall iida et al 2016 therefore bark transpiration could further decrease plant water potential and even lead to catastrophic hydraulic dysfunction and tree mortality during a prolonged drought li et al 2021 the role of stem surfaces in deciduous trees may be more important than in needle and broadleaf evergreens for maintenance of a low water flux to hydrate the xylem and phloem during leafless periods further the development of the canopy with new leaves require some amount of water and mineral nutrients oren and pataki 2001 which can only be supplied if the previous xylem remain functioning a large proportion of asian tropical forests are subject to seasonal drought corlett 2016 zhang et al 2020 and the frequency and duration of drought in asian tropics is being exacerbated due to climate change and may continue in the future dai 2011 ipcc 2021 wang et al 2022 such drought episodes impact the hydrology and phenological behavior of trees and hence their productivity duan et al 2018 zhao et al 2013 the duration of leaf flushing was delayed in tectona grandis till the availability of rainwater during a drought yoshifuji et al 2006 it has been reported in the some other species that excessive prolongation of leafless period can also lead to the carbon starvation as well as severe xylem embolism adams et al 2009 adams et al 2017 the present study was planned to use the sap flow data from three economically important deciduous timber species in a northern tropical site to answer two questions 1 how much water are consumed at tree and stand levels during the leafless period for three deciduous tropical tree species which could be largely due to bark transpiration 2 is dry season sap flux density of leafless period related to environmental factors such as vapor pressure deficit and light intensity 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and species the study was carried out in the monsoon plantation stands of three tropical deciduous timber species i e anogeissus acuminata dipterocarpus tuberculatus and tectona grandis in xishuangbanna tropical botanical garden xtbg 21 54ʹ59 99 n 101 14ʹ60 00 e 580 m a s l southern yunnan province southwest china this region has a typical tropical monsoon climate with a pronounced dry season from november to april the mean annual precipitation is 1560 mm of which 80 occur during the wet season may to october the mean annual temperature of the study site is 21 7 c fig 1 cao et al 2006 the region has the mountain valley topography and the soil formation from the siliceous rocks rock substrate of sandstone and limestone zhu 2006 these plantation stands have not been subject to pruning and contain a herbaceous ground cover eight replicate trees of each species were selected for the sap flow measurement and phenological observation 2 2 phenological observations the phenological observation of each of the eight trees was made on weekly basis from february to may 2016 three canopy branches from each tree were tagged and the number of leaves on each target branch were counted to estimate the percentage of leaves remaining 2 3 water flux through bark transpiration the water flux through bark transpiration was inferred from the sap flow measurements 2015 2016 on eight trees of each of the three timber species for assessing the water flux during the leafless period the sap flow data from february to may 2016 representing the duration of leafless and new leaf appearance and a week spa flow data of september 2015 representing the fully developed canopy leaves in the wet season were used the circumference range of the sample trees are indicated in table 1 the laboratory made granier s heat dissipation granier 1987 sap flow sensors were fixed at trunks of 1 3 m height from the ground in the outer 2 cm and 4 cm of sapwood of trees each sensor consisted of a thermocouple surrounded by a heating coil and a reference sensor all sensors were connected to data loggers cr 1000 campbell connected with a multiplexer am 16 32 campbell and supplied with a constant power of 0 2 w to heat the sensors each tree was equipped with two sets of sensors installed at 90 to the stem and directionally opposite to each other the sensors were protected from mechanical damage and solar radiation using aluminum foil data were logged every 30 s and averaged over 60 min intervals for storage in the data loggers the sensors were monitored bi weekly and malfunctioning sensors were immediately replaced the sap flux density g m 2 s 1 was calculated using the baseliner program version 3 0 7 c h2o ecology group nicholas school of the environment duke university durham north carolina usa the average values from two paired sensors were used to calculate the sap flux density for each individual tree because the original granier s equation is not universal for all the species and should be calibrated as it could underestimate the sap flow taneda and sperry 2008 bush et al 2010 hultine et al 2010 we used the calibrated granier s equation developed by siddiq et al 2017 for these species to calculate their sap flux density the zero flow was established as the maximum difference between the heated and non heated sensors which was attained late mid nights as there was no biophysical driving force due to low vpd eliades et al 2018 fig s1 2 4 whole tree and stand level water consumption the daily whole tree water consumption during the leaf loss initiation leaf less period and the leafed canopy month for each species was calculated by multiplying the active sapwood area by the integral of 24 h sap flux density whole tree sap flux density was calculated by multiplying the flow per area sensed at 2 cm by the area of a ring between the outer most xylem and 2 cm similarly for the flow of the ring from 2 cm to 4 cm among all the trees the active sapwood was not 4 cm the active sapwood area of each sample tree was determined using the dye injection method a dye solution of 0 1 safranin was injected into the sapwood at 1 3 m height after 12 16 h a 5 mm and 5 8 cm long core was taken just above the injection point to measure the active sapwood area by assessing the dye color travelled on the xylem core clearwater et al 1999 the cores were taken after the sap flow measurements to avoid any damage to the trees the active sapwood areas for these species was not 4 cm the contributions of sap flow sensed at 2 cm and 4 cm were added to determine the whole tree total sap flow g h 1 which was multiplied by the sapwood area and then integrated over 24 h to estimate whole tree daily followed by weekly water consumption for comparison during this period trees were devoid of leaves or other structures external to the stems such as flowers and fruits thus the flux in this period was considered mainly due to transpiration from the stem surfaces bark as the physiological activities of living tissues could consume a minor amount of water the stand level bark transpiration was estimated based on the survey of 20 m 20 m plots in the plantation stands of three species all the trees with circumference 30 cm were measured for circumference the circumference ranges of trees were 69 116 cm 62 123 cm and 59 174 cm for a acuminata d tuberculatus and t grandis respectively the stand density and basal areas for the three species are provided in table 1 the stand level transpiration mm d 1 was estimated using the following formula wullschlegeret al 2001 kumagai et al 2008 e 1 a plot j 1 n w u j where wuj is the daily water use of tree j kg d 1 during the leaf less period and aplot is the plot area m2 the daily stand level bark transpiration was integrated to weekly or monthly basis 2 5 pre dawn leaf water potential in order to assess the soil water status around the root zones of the trees the pre dawn leaf water potential ψl was measured on site with a pressure chamber pms albany or usa during the days when only few leaves were left on the canopy for tectona the leaf water potential was measured during the last week of february while for anogeissus and dipterocarpus it was measured in mid march 2016 for each tree 5 6 complete and healthy leaves were collected at 6 00 to 7 00 am for water potential measurement 2 6 meteorological data the meteorological data temperature relative humidity and photosynthetic active radiation par were obtained from the climatic station of xtbg which is situated approximately 900 m away from the sap flow measurement site the hourly mean values of the meteorological variables were used in the analysis the vapor pressure deficit vpd was calculated from air temperature and relative humidity campbell and norman 1998 2 7 data analysis the statistical analyses and graphics were made using sigma plot version 12 5 systat software inc usa the relationships between the hourly mean vpd par and sap flux density during the leafless and leaf flushing periods were analyzed using linear regression as day time mean vpd and par during these periods were strongly correlated r2 0 45 p 0 0001 we only presented the results of the correlation between mean sap flux density and vpd 3 results 3 1 phenological observations for canopy foliage status the three species varied in the timing and duration of leaf fall but all were leafless for several weeks tectona grandis started to shed the leaves in the second week of january and completed leaf shedding at the end of february in a acuminata and d tuberculatus leaf shedding initiated in the first week of march and completed in the last week of march the duration of complete leaflessness for t grandis was 6 weeks but 4 weeks for both a acuminata and d tuberculatus all the species had their new crown of leaves by the beginning of may fig 2 a the weekly sap flux density varied across the three species and was 1096 g cm 2 week 1 even during the leafless weeks fig 2 b 3 2 diurnal pattern of vpd par and sap flux density the hourly mean diurnal pattern of vpd and par showed the similar diurnal peaks but the peaks of diurnal sap flux density for each species was significantly different during the month of march and april 2016 fig 3 in a acuminata the daily mean sap flux density in the leafless month of april and during the wet season week of september were 16 g m 2 s 1 2 02 and 30 g m 2 s 1 4 91 respectively while in d tuberculatus it was 3 2 g m 2 s 1 0 62 and 7 9 g m 2 s 1 1 45 and in t grandis it was 11 g m 2 s 1 1 81 and 5 g m 2 s 1 0 95 fig 2 b the sap flux density during the leafless month was significantly lower p 0 001 0 003 and 0 001 for a acuminata and d tuberculatus and t grandis respectively during leafless day of april as compared to the wet season day of september 3 3 meteorological variables and plant water potential in march the weekly mean vpd and par ranged from 0 83 kpa 0 071 to 1 29 kpa 0 093 and 254 72 µ m2 sec 1 45 8 to 355 71 µ m2 sec 1 33 81 respectively while in april the vpd and par ranged from 1 0 0 087 to 2 23 0 02 and 342 45 µ m2 sec 1 44 88 to 620 57 µ m2 sec 1 77 99 respectively and in may the weekly mean vpd and par ranged from 0 58 0 03 to 1 31 0 089 and 296 45 µ m2 sec 1 35 71 to 454 42 µ m2 sec 1 62 34 respectively fig 2 c d while the mean wet season vpd was 0 7 0 081 and par 595 µ m2 sec 1 59 91 the vpd was significantly higher in the dry season weeks of march and april as compared to the wet season week of september p 0 001 while par was not significantly different between the dry season weeks and wet season week p 0 05 the weekly rainfall ranged from 0 mm to 32 mm from february to april 2016 fig 2 panel e for all the species the hourly mean sap flux density in march and april were strongly correlated with hourly mean vpd r2 0 65 p 0 0001 fig 4 a i similarly a significant p 0 001 and positive relationship r2 0 41 0 76 was found between the daily sap flux density and the daytime mean par across the three species during the months of march and april fig 5 the mean pre dawn leaf water potential prior to leaf shedding for a acuminata d tuberculatus and t grandis was 0 24 mp 0 025 0 18 mpa 0 01 and 0 31 mpa 0 02 indicating good water status of the studied plants 3 4 whole tree daily water consumption in leafless and leafy states during the leaf less weeks of the months of march and april the mean daily water consumption in a acuminata d tuberculatus and t grandis was 14 kg 2 01 se 13 kg 1 98 se and 8 1 kg 2 11 se respectively fig 6 a with mean circumference 87 cm 86 cm and 99 cm for a acuminata d tuberculatus and t grandis respectively the mean wet season week whole tree water use for a acuminata d tuberculatus and t grandis was 80 kg 100 kg and 126 kg respectively during these two months in dry season the percentage daily water consumption to the whole tree daily water use the in a representative wet season weak as 7 13 and 18 for t grandis d tuberculatus and a acuminata respectively fig 6 b the total stand level water consumption on a 30 day basis during the leafless period was 26 85 mm 18 mm and 13 6 mm for a acuminata d tuberculatus and t grandis respectively fig 6 c further across species a significant r2 35 p 0 006 and positive relationship was found between the tree circumference and mean daily water consumption during the leaf less period fig 7 at comparable circumference among the three species tectona grandis consumed less water than the other two species 4 discussion on the average the whole tree water consumption of the studied species ranged from 8 kg to 14 kg during the four six leaf less weeks which was 7 18 of water consumed by these species during the wet season week of september such water flux could assist these species in the xylem functioning during these weeks the strong correlation between sap flux density and vpd in the leafless period indicates that water consumption during the leafless period mainly resulted from bark transpiration though other physiological activities such as living tissues and bud development might consume some minor amount of water this water flux could be supported by the presence of water around their root zones which enabled them to meet the evaporative demand in the hot dry period of march april even during the initial hours of night there could be a significant amount of flux due to evaporative demand but it could include both the stem refilling as well as night time transpiration during a leaf less period siddiq and cao 2018 the nocturnal water use of leaf less duration among these species is 5 16 of the day time water use which is among the range reported by fisher et al 2007 and eliades et al 2018 this amount of water use can also have adaptive significance of cooling the bark surface so that reducing night respiration the total stand level transpiration during the leaf less period varied from 13 6 mm to 26 8 mm monthly among the three species while the outcrossing the total rainfall of 14 mm during this leaf less duration to our knowledge this paper is the first report about stand level water consumption during leaf less period in the intact trees this amount of water lost mainly through bark transpiration should be considered in modeling of ecosystem hydrology it should be noted that use of thermal dissipation method for sap flow can have some error due to natural temperature gradient which could be a limitation of the present study reyes acosta and lubczynski 2014 fuchs et al 2017 flo et al 2019 but the use of calibrated equation for these species and the estimation of active sapwood area could minimize the expected errors during the leafless period of april the day time vpd averaged 1 3 kpa but had a maximum above 2 2 kpa and the maximum water flow 54 35 and 27 of mean wet season whole tree daily water flow in a acuminata d tuberculatus and t grandis respectively the mean ratio of whole tree water consumption during the leafless period to that in wet season was 0 07 0 18 among these species it remains to be determined whether water consumption during leafless period is involved in fixation of carbon in barks of twigs and small branches in these species de roo et al 2020 this water flux may also hydrate the xylem vessels and facilitate the flushing of new leaves even some water for the refilling or recharge of xylem vessels but that amount of water must be lost from the bark klein etal 2016 wolfe 2020 lintunen et al 2021 using gas exchange methods reported that bark transpiration can range from 6 to 11 to 64 78 depending upon the species and environmental conditions among the three studied species at a similar circumference teak had less bark transpiration than a acuminata and d tuberculatus which could probably be due to the bark morphology of tectona garndis such as having lower density of lenticels it could also be due to the less soil water accessibility of its roots as indicated by its more negative pre dawn leaf water potential as compared to the other two species although tectona grandis had the greater basal area and tree density as compared to the other two species it should be noted that the presence of a herbaceous a cover in forest understory can have an indirect effect on bark transpiration rates of trees as the absence of leaves allow more solar radiations reaching the ground cover which could enhance understory growth and thus relatively more soil water will be up taken by the herbaceous vegetation eliades et al 2022 however the increased soil water uptake can be counter balanced by the increase of net rainfall reaching the ground due to less rainfall interception by the leaf less canopies del campoa et al 2022 the present study plantation stands also have a herbaceous ground cover and could have the similar counter balance of water availability during a dry period when stomata are closed and leaves are shed trees must keep a low amount of water such water flux is important to avoid massive embolism formation and the refilling of embolized vessels delzon and cochard 2014 hence the water flux during leafless period is important determinant for the survival trees in a drought mcdowell etal 2013 mencuccini etal 2015 during the leafless or drought period the foliar carbon assimilation is much limited li et al 2021 the water flux driven by bark transpiration also plays an important role in tree carbon balance through bark photosynthesis providing nutrients to the living tissues in sapwood and barks de roo et al 2020 it has been reported that sapwood and bark can store a significant amount of water which can be utilized during the water stress condition siddiq et al 2017 lintunen et al 2021 however in dry sites or in a severe drought bark transpiration may result in a decrease of plant water potential to the level of catastrophic hydraulic dysfunction and death of living cells in xylem and phloem and consequently tree mortality cuneo et al 2016 as the stand level water consumption mainly through bark transpiration during the leafless period was more than the rainfall during the leaf less duration it can substantially impact the ecosystem water cycle especially with the increasing drought linked with climate change 5 conclusion the three deciduous species consumed considerable amount of water mainly through bark transpiration during the leafless period which was correlated with the evaporative demand light intensity and also tree size the water flux during the leafless period could be important in hydrating the sapwood and thus maintain hydraulic function but could result in xylem water potential decrease to the risky level of hydraulic dysfunction during a prolonged drought this amount of water consumption should be included in the whole tree water

2552,warming induced shifts in vegetation phenology affect ecosystem functions and the hydrological cycle research has so far focused on phenological trends drivers and feedback across temperate and

investigated the net effects of phenological change on carbon and water fluxes the simulation results indicated that for our study site the correlation between sos and summer et would transform from positive to negative once sos had advanced to around 129 days of the year doy and 125 doy for summer gpp summer et and gpp increased as sos advanced and gsl extended until the sos reached the turning points and decreased if the sos and gsl advanced beyond the turning points the mechanism of variations in water and carbon fluxes responding to phenology dynamics could be more complex than we

exploring data from numerous references while interference from inter annual climatic variation is likely inevitable a combination of process based eco hydrological models is better for studying both historical and future trends in vegetation phenology and its role in regulating ecological and hydrological processes from regional to global scales liu et al 2018 wang et al 2018 zeng et al 2017 most models for simulating carbon water processes in terrestrial ecosystems were developed and operated under the assumption of hydrological stationarity milly et al 2008 an explanation for the hydrological instability caused by seasonal and decadal phenological change is lacking few studies have taken phenological dynamics into account when applying ecohydrological models hwang et al 2018 kim et al 2018 even though doing so could improve the simulation accuracy of critical carbon and water fluxes geng et al 2020 kim et al 2012 the regional hydro ecologic simulation system rhessys is a hydro ecological model based on physical processes rhessys simulates water carbon and nutrient nitrogen fluxes at small to moderate watershed scales and consider the limiting effects of climate and nutrients on vegetation carbon and water cycles tague and band 2004 there are relatively few watershed scale hydro ecological models that do include all these key components fatichi et al 2016 rhessys has been applied widely in various hydro ecological studies during the last few decades for example peng et al 2016 used it to evaluate the effects of converting farmlands to forests on the loess plateau china and hwang et al 2018 investigated the response of forest ecosystems and watershed hydrological processes to climate change son and tague 2018 explored the hydrological response of long term snow and seasonal snow basins to climate warming while barnhart et al 2020 assessed the relative importance of the snowmelt rate and timing to snowmelt season runoff bell et al 2019 operated rhessys to simulate impervious land surfaces and the impact of rainwater control connectivity on runoff and nitrogen loading overall rhessys holds potential for estimating hydro ecological processes and is a good tool for studying the corresponding mechanisms of the net effect of phenological change on water and carbon fluxes here we applied rhessys to investigate how vegetation phenology affects gpp and et in a semi arid grassland watershed of the loess plateau first phenological data including sos eos and gsl for the study area was derived from moderate resolution image spectroradiometer modis normalized difference vegetation index ndvi datasets mod13a1 any correlation between the phenological dates and remotely sensed annual gpp mod17a2hgf and et mod16a2gf were then detected ndvi derived sos and eos data were then implemented as phenological scenarios to force rhessys to simulate gpp and et at the watershed scale the net effects of phenology on gpp and et were then examined within the model framework 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the loess plateau located in the upper and middle reaches of the yellow river is one of the most severely eroded areas in china covering an area of approximately 650 000 km2 of which 70 is dominated by hills and gullies fu et al 2017 this study was carried out in a typical hilly region the chabagou watershed 109 5 110 1 e 37 5 37 8 n in shaanxi province fig 1 the chabagou river with a drainage area of 205 km2 and an elevation ranging from 901 to 1 272 m is wuding river s second tributary the study basin experiences a semi arid temperate continental monsoon climate the average annual precipitation in the region is about 450 mm 60 70 of which falls in the summer months from june to september the dominant rainfall type is short duration rainstorms the temperature ranges from 27 to 38 with an annual average of 8 the frost free period is about 180 days the mean potential et is 1 500 mm yr 1 and the average actual et is about 380 mm yr 1 the dominant soil type loess is derived from loess parent material the soil texture is mainly silt which is very erodible soil particles 0 05 mm represent about 25 8 of the soil particles between 0 01 and 0 05 mm represent about 57 7 and particles smaller than 0 01 mm represent about 16 5 guo et al 2019 the land cover types in the site mainly consist of cropland 57 3 grassland 39 3 and forest 3 4 the plant species encompass cyperaceae artemisia and leguminosae rain fed maize is the dominant crop type the caoping hydrological station located at the downstream of the chabagou watershed is a control gauging station with a monitoring area of 187 km2 the river channel length above the caoping station is 24 1 km the average width of the riverbed is 7 22 km and the density of the channel is 1 05 km km 2 qi et al 2011 we ran the rhessys model in the measurement range of the caoping station to eliminate systematic errors between the observed and simulated runoff caused by spatial dis match between the actual chabagou watershed 207 km2 and the monitoring area of the caoping site 187 km2 see fig s1 2 2 data sets 2 2 1 in situ observation datasets meteorological data including daily precipitation and daily maximum minimum temperatures from 1960 to 2019 as recorded by the nearest national weather station suide station were downloaded from the china meteorological data service center https data cma cn in addition daily precipitation from 12 rain gauges and streamflow from the caoping hydrology station see fig 1 during 2011 2016 were collected from the hydrologic yearbook released by the chinese yellow river conservancy commission to calibrate key variables of rhessys and validate the overall performance of rhessys 2 2 2 remote sensing data a digital elevation model dem of the chabagou watershed at a resolution of 30 m 30 m was derived from the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of science resdc https www resdc cn a land use map of the study area 1 10 000 scale was downloaded from the environmental and ecological science data center for west china national natural science foundation of china https westdc westgis ac cn zh hans modis products employed in this study include leaf area index lai mod15a2h 006 ndvi mod13a1 006 et mod16a2gf 061 and gpp mod17a2hgf 006 https modis gsfc nasa gov the spatial and temporal resolutions of these modis datasets are 500 m and 8 days excepted for ndvi which is 16 days respectively the modis reprojection tool mrt and arcgis were then applied to preprocess the remote sensing images including format conversion splicing clipping and reprojection 2 3 phenology extraction the timesat3 3 platform developed by delong university jönsson and eklundh 2004 was implemented to reconstruct the ndvi time series by an asymmetric gaussian function fitting method and to derive phenological information by dynamic threshold method peng et al 2019 pixels with ndvi values 0 05 were removed to avoid false vegetation index values the dynamic threshold method determines the range of change in ndvi based on the maximum and minimum values for ndvi in a particular year the start and end of the vegetation growing season for a particular year are defined as when the rise and fall in the annual change in ndvi reach a fixed percentage or a threshold of the maximum amplitude respectively the duration between these two represents the length of the growing season in addition as an indicator of peak greenness timing of middle of the season mos was also estimated in this study the threshold i e ndviratio can be quantified as 1 ndvi ratio ndvi t ndvi min ndvi max ndvi min where ndvimax and ndvimin are the maximum and minimum ndvi values for the year respectively ndvit represents the ndvi value at time t referring to some previous studies deng 2021 peng et al 2019 zeng et al 2021 and field investigation see table s1 in supplementary we determined the sos and eos of our study site to be the date when ndviratio reached 0 2 in the spring and 0 5 in the autumn respectively 2 4 a hydro ecological model 2 4 1 description rhessys is a gis geographical information system based and physical based hydro ecological model developed to simulate the tempo spatial distribution of water carbon and nutrient fluxes at daily monthly and yearly time steps it can track integrated biogeochemical cycling including dynamic feedback between hydrological and ecosystem processes influenced by land use land cover and climatic changes tague and band 2004 rhessys was designed to explicitly couple several well known models specifically the terrestrial ecosystem process model biome bgc running 1993 was combined with the spatially explicit meteorological information from mt clim running et al 1987 and a hydrological route modeled using dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 the representation of soil organic matter decomposition in rhessys is based mainly on the century model parton et al 1987 the centuryngas parton et al 1996 approach is also used in rhessys to model nitrogen cycling processes such as nitrification and denitrification more details of rhessys can be found elsewhere garcia et al 2016 lin et al 2019 tague and band 2004 and on the rhessys website https fiesta bren ucsb edu rhessys the version of rhessys conducted in this paper is rhessys 7 4 and the source code is available from the github https github com rhessys rhessys wiki 2 4 2 model spin up initializing the carbon and nitrogen pools at a stable state is a prerequisite for the model to simulate the ecological processes correctly however these pools are highly sensitive to long term disturbance history and thus do not attain stability easily law et al 2001 law et al 2004 before applying rhessys preliminary modelling i e spin up is essential to build up an organic soil layer and reach a state of equilibrium for plant and soil carbon and nitrogen storage a stable state is reached when the annual carbon and nitrogen variables for plants and soils do not have a significant i e p 0 05 upward or downward trend excluding small seasonal and annual fluctuations i e when the inter annual fluctuation range was below 5 the time it takes for the model to reach equilibrium varies depending on the characteristics of the landscape being used i e climatic zone vegetation type and soil type in general because of the slow development of the soil organic matter pool the spin up can represent hundreds of years in this study we spun up rhessys for 500 years the results of our spin up 500 years show that the soil carbon of the study area reached about 3 3 kg m 2 which is within a reasonable range according to liu et al 2011 2 9 4 2 kg m 2 additionally the interannual variation of the soil carbon was below 5 fig s2 2 4 3 model calibration and validation rhessys employs many parameters to describe soil land use and vegetation characteristics most of these parameters can stay constant through a model run while several parameters require calibration in general calibration of these parameters is usually based on estimating the fit between the simulated and observed streamflow referred to https github com rhessys rhessys wiki in this study we calibrated nine parameters including six soil parameters the lateral and vertical decay of saturation hydraulic conductivity with depth m and m v lateral and vertical surface saturated soil hydraulic conductivity k and k v soil pore size index po soil air entry pressure pa two groundwater parameters gw1 the proportion of infiltrated water that bypasses soil to a deeper groundwater table via macropores and fractures and gw2 the rate of lateral flow from the upslope groundwater table to the downslope stream channel and a vegetation parameter specified leaf area sla monte carlo simulation a commonly used method for rhessys calibration e g tague and band 2004 hwang et al 2018 is implemented to generate 3000 parameter sets based on the uniform distributions within prescribed ranges of these nine calibrated parameters i e m k m v k v po pa gw1 gw2 sla the set of parameter values with the optimal correspondence between simulated and observed streamflow was selected for future model running tague and band 2004 the monthly streamflow during 2011 2013 and 2014 2016 were collected to calibrate and validate the rhessys model respectively the coefficient of determination r2 percent bias pbias and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse were applied to evaluate the model gupta et al 1999 moriasi et al 2015 model performance can be categorized as satisfactory good or very good based on values of these three indicators according to moriasi et al 2015 table s2 2 4 4 simulation scenario settings to test the net effect of dynamic phenology on rhessys accuracy and on some critical water and carbon fluxes within the modelling framework we ran the model under different phenological scenarios while keeping other hydrological and eco physiological parameters unchanged to eliminate the interference of inter annual climatic variations on the simulation results the same climate forcing data daily p tmax and tmin from 2001 to 2020 were used for all the scenarios ndvi derived sos and eos data for the study area from 2001 to 2020 were applied as phenological inputs in summary we set 21 phenological scenarios 20 static scenarios and one dynamic scenario for the static scenarios we set the sos and eos of a year as a static scenario without any interannual phenological changes during each run therefore 20 static phenological scenarios could be generated from 20 groups of phenological dates for 2001 to 2020 for the dynamic scenario the actual dates of sos and eos for each year were used i e the phenology changed year to year within one simulation process 2 5 statistical analysis the slopes for the sos mos eos gsl annual gpp and et time series were tested using sen s slope estimator sen 1968 the rank based non parametric manna kendall m k statistical test kendall 1975 mann 1945 was then applied to assess significance of these slopes the sen s slope estimator and m k test have been widely applied to quantify the magnitude of trends and their significance in hydro meteorological time series tabari et al 2011 yue et al 2002 both were conducted using the program r the pearson correlation coefficient r was calculated for the sos mos eos gsl time series and annual gpp et and wue to evaluate the impact of a shift in phenology on vegetation carbon sequestration and watershed hydrology r can be used as a measure of monotonic association for ordinal data non normally distributed continuous data or data with relevant outliers r values range from 1 to 1 with 0 representing no monotonic association the relationship grows stronger and ultimately presents a constantly increasing or decreasing curve as r approaches 1 or 1 linear and polynomial regression analyses were also applied to establish fitting relationships r 2 i e square of r indicates the goodness of fit with values ranging from 0 to 1 the closer r 2 is to 1 the better the fit is the regression analysis was implemented in the program r which was also used to plot the figures 3 results 3 1 changes in vegetation phenology gpp and et 3 1 1 phenological dynamics fig 2 shows the temporal variations in sos mos eos and gsl as estimated using modis ndvi for the chabagou watershed from 2001 to 2020 the julian dates for sos mos eos and gsl varied widely from 97 to 163 doy 217 to 245 doy 266 to 287 doy and 120 to 176 days respectively other studies have reported similar results listed in table s3 in addition trend analysis sen s slope m k test showed significant p 0 05 long term trends in both sos and gsl with a 1 47 day earlier sos per year and a 1 60 day longer gsl per year unlike sos mos did not advance obviously 0 45 days yr 1 p 0 05 implicating the enlarged spring window i e the period from sos to mos over the study area eos over the last two decades delayed slightly at a mean rate of 0 04 days yr 1 p 0 05 which was less than the trend seen across china s temperate biomes 0 12 days yr 1 by liu et al 2016a correlation among these four phenological timings were then estimated fig 3 there was a significant negative correlation p 0 01 between sos and gsl with a coefficient of determination r 2 equal to 0 89 indicating that changes in sos could explain 89 of the variation in gsl however no evidence suggested that the impact of eos mos on gsl was significant p 0 1 the relationship between sos and eos mos also showed a high degree of discretization p 0 1 while eos closely positively related to mos r 0 726 p 0 01 overall an earlier sos slightly later eos and consequently longer gsl were detected over the study period although eos in the autumn was becoming somewhat later it was primarily an earlier spring sos that drove the extended gsl in the chabagou watershed however an earlier sos did not mean an advanced mos although it seems it should be the earlier the sos the earlier the mos 3 1 2 trends in et and gpp based on modis datasets et and gpp as critical ecosystem water and carbon fluxes were analyzed to highlight any spatial and temporal variations see fig 4 during the study period 2001 2020 the mean rate of increase in annual et calculated by sen s slope ranged from 5 93 to 10 75 mm yr 1 with the rate for 80 of the study area falling within 6 50 8 50 mm yr 1 the 20 year averaged trend for gpp varied spatially from 9 71 to 21 06 gc m 2 yr 1 and between 12 00 and 16 00 gc m 2 yr 1 in most regions for the temporal distributions illustrated in fig 4e and 4f inter annual trends in both et 7 53 mm yr 1 and gpp 14 00 mm yr 1 are noticeable with a 0 99 confidence level indicted by the m k test to a large extent the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of et and gpp in the chabagou watershed from 2001 to 2020 showed consistent trends indicating a close positive correlation between gpp and et furthermore the annual ecosystem wue equal to gpp et increased on average by 0 013 gc mm 1 m 2 per year fig s3 the trend in wue for the study area spatially varied between 0 0058 and 0 021 gc mm 1 m 2 yr 1 and fell in the range of 0 010 0 017 gc mm 1 m 2 yr 1 for most regions 3 2 correlation between phenology and et and gpp pearson correlation coefficient r was conducted to identify any correlation between phenological onset dates sos mos eos and gsl and two key ecosystem fluxes i e et and gpp all the data came from modis products the results are shown in fig 3 both annual total et and gpp were significantly p 0 05 correlated with sos mos and gsl while neither et nor gpp was statistically related to eos the r for sos and the annual et gpp and ndvi were 0 62 p 0 05 0 61 p 0 05 and 0 58 p 0 05 respectively negative r values for sos as well as mos indicated that annual et gpp as well as ndvi values could fall with a later sos mos in other words plants could consume more water take up more carbon and thus grow better with an earlier onset of the growing season there was however a slightly different performance in the relationship between phenology timings and wue compared with sos and gsl mos and eos contributed more to the variations of wue 3 3 rhessys model performance during the calibration period 2011 2013 the monthly streamflow fitted well with the observed one with r2 pbias and nse being 0 88 p 0 05 5 63 and 0 75 respectively fig 5 according to statistical performance measures recommended by moriasi et al 2015 table s2 rhessys performed good in estimating streamflow from 2011 to 2013 such desirable performance was kept over the following validation period 2014 2016 r2 0 94 pbias 5 78 nse 0 87 the model performed well during the validation period except for 2015 fig 5 note that the observed streamflow data in 2015 showed less consistency with precipitation changes than rhessys estimates it might be attributed to human activities such as water resources management overall rhessys reached an average good performance for monthly streamflow estimates in the chabagou watershed rhessys simulated monthly gpp and et from the dynamic phenology scenario i e using the actual dates for sos and eos each year during 2001 2020 were also closely correlated to the modis dataset with both r2 approximated 0 88 p 0 05 fig 6 noted that the modelled et and gpp appeared slightly higher than the remote sensed values given the slight underestimation of modis et and gpp across northwestern china we suggested that the calibrated rhessys performed satisfactorily when simulating monthly gpp and et for the chabagou watershed 3 4 implications of the phenological dynamic for et and gpp based on the correlation between phenology sos mos eos and gsl and et and gpp fig 3 we concluded that both annual water loss through et and vegetation carbon uptake quantified by gpp were related to vegetation phenology i e sos mos and gsl in this study however it is difficult to determine how when and to what extent phenology affects vegetation dynamics and water balance only through data based analysis phenological scenarios were therefore used to investigate the net implications of phenological events on seasonal et and gpp fig 7 illustrates the relationships between two main phenological variables sos and gsl and the multi year averaged seasonal et and gpp values derived from our model framework for 2001 to 2020 noticeably poor r2 for the linear fits between sos gsl and summer et gpp table 1 might imply that they were not simply linear correlated as expected instead the parabola looks more suitable for both the sos gsl et and the sos gsl gpp fittings for the summer ones with r2 being 0 83 0 70 and 0 72 0 72 respectively the parabolic fitting means that there is a turning point on the regression curve i e the thresholds existed for the contribution rate of phenology to changes in et and gpp as shown in fig 7a the peak in summer gpp at this turning point occurred when sos was about 125 doy when the sos was 125 doy the catchment gpp increased as sos delayed but began to decline if the sos continued to rise beyond 125 doy a similar relationship occurred between sos and summer et the turning point for the sos summer et curve occurred when sos was about 129 doy which was four days later than the turning point for gpp we also found turning points for gsl et 149 days and gsl gpp 155 days during the summer months fig 7b and 7b the parabola also caught a good fit in analyzing the correlation between sos and spring gpp et the turning point occurred at 155 doy for sos gpp and 160 doy for sos et in spring however transforming the fits from a line r2 0 94 for the sos gpp and 0 97 for the sos et to a parabola r2 0 98 for both the sos gpp and the sos et did not improve the result furthermore we did not detect any inflection point when applying regression analyses on sos gsl et or gpp in autumn and also on gsl and spring gpp or et the dominant phenological factor regulating autumn vegetation dynamics could be eos rather than sos or gsl see fig s4 spring gpp and et decreased as sos advanced gsl extended autumn gpp and et inclined as eos delayed the spring and summer wue also increased with an advanced sos extended gsl autumn wue increased with a delayed eos as expected fig s5 and table s4 4 discussion 4 1 causes of phenological changes earlier sos 1 47 days yr 1 and mos 0 45 days yr 1 slightly later eos 0 04 days yr 1 and consequently longer gsl 1 60 days yr 1 were obtained for the chabagou watershed throughout 2001 2020 when the climate tended to be warm and wet fig s6 the temperature is generally regarded to be a dominant factor affecting vegetation phenology chuine et al 2010 cleland et al 2006 fu et al 2018 peñuelas et al 2009 zhang et al 2022 followed by water availability kang et al 2018 peng et al 2021 wang et al 2022 zeng et al 2021 responses of phenology to varying temperatures and precipitation seem to differ at the seasonal scale our findings suggest that precipitation is the main climatic factor affecting sos while temperature plays a relatively important role in eos delay for semi arid grasslands fig s7 commonly spring warming could lead to an earlier green up zhang et al 2022 here we also detected a negative but non significant p 0 05 correlation between sos and mean spring temperature instead limited precipitation could significantly p 0 05 restrict spring vegetation growth in the study area in line with an earlier study which reported that spring drought could delay sos in semi arid regions of northern china kang et al 2018 zhou and jia 2016 however the influence of temperature on photosynthesis becomes relative significant p 0 05 during autumn days fig s7 the warmer the autumn is the longer the leaf could live it can also be inferred that autumn leaf senescence has a higher temperature sensitivity than spring leaf sprout at the study site in addition to temperature and precipitation other environmental and biotic factors such as nutrients and photoperiod could also affect vegetation phenology piao et al 2019a photoperiod may play a key role in regulating autumn phenological timings cooke et al 2012 the elevated temperature could stimulate plant photosynthetic activity during the withering months still low photoperiod i e below the threshold required for growth could induce bud set and leaf senescence spring and autumn phenology are also positively inter correlated keenan and richardson 2015 liu et al 2016b for example the advancement of spring phenology may increase soil moisture loss throughout the early spring and subsequently intensify summer droughts which usually contributes to reducing delays in eos buermann et al 2013 piao et al 2019a xie et al 2015 earlier eos caused by earlier sos can partly offset the warming induced eos delay here we do not describe the influencing factors of vegetation phenology in detail because it is out of the scope of this study overall phenological trends are site and species specific grassland phenology generally depends on the combined impact of precipitation and temperature chuai et al 2013 geng et al 2020 for regions similar to our study area where the vegetation type is mainly dry grassland ignoring the impact of precipitation on phenology may limit our understanding of phenological dynamics we therefore recommend investigating the drivers and mechanisms of changes in vegetation phenology in different environments and for various plant species 4 2 net effects of phenology shifting 4 2 1 effects on vegetation carbon uptake the positive negative r between gsl sos and gpp fig 3 implies that phenological changes are also crucial to the recent increase in vegetative activity and carbon uptake keeling et al 1996 piao et al 2007 piao et al 2017 it is necessary to clarify the link between phenology and the terrestrial carbon cycle in determining the underlying mechanisms of the increased vegetative activity and carbon sinks seen in the northern hemisphere over the past few decades piao et al 2018 piao et al 2019b zhu et al 2016 piao et al 2007 suggested that the main factor is a prolonged gsl similar to previous studies in temperate areas geng et al 2020 zeng et al 2021 at our study site the advancement of sos and extension of gsl promoted vegetation growth and thus enhanced carbon uptake represented by an increase in annual total gpp interestingly by applying multiple groups of phenological dates in a hydro ecological model to remove interferences of other environmental variables such as temperature and precipitation we found non linear relationships between sos and summer gpp turning points existed in the net impact of change in the timing of greenness on vegetative carbon assimilations regardless of the absolute magnitude the trends in the curves should still be meaningful on the right side of the regression curves fig 7a summer gpp increased as sos advanced or gsl extended which is a generally accepted trend randerson et al 1999 richardson et al 2010 on the other side of the curves however the earlier the sos the lower the summer gpp the slope of the relationship gradually decreased with the prolongation of gsl corresponding to a continued advance in sos indicating the promotional effect of gsl extension sos advancement on the decreased vegetation carbon absorption during the summer months the right side of the regression curves corresponds to a slope with values below zero and an earlier sos or longer gsl reduced photosynthesis i e less gpp in summer the water and energy conditions when the plants begin to turn green may be unfavorable to vegetation growth eventually vegetation greening up too early or too late cannot promote vegetative activity and carbon uptake it might be attributable to water availability although early green up is conducive to vegetation carbon absorption in spring a rise in transpiration caused by enhanced vegetative growth in spring indirectly leads to a soil water deficit throughout late spring and summer deteriorating soil moisture conditions restrict vegetative growth xu et al 2012 and summer plant productivity xie et al 2015 resulting in a decreased sensitivity of annual gpp to sos buermann et al 2013 wolf et al 2016 the trade off between the opposite effects of sos on vegetative growth in spring positive and summer negative zeng et al 2021 may explain this unexpected phenomenon however neither remote sensed nor modal simulated results demonstrate any distinct response of autumn vegetation carbon sequestration to changes in eos autumnal extension of gsl could explain fewer photosynthetic activity variations than photoperiod barichivich et al 2013 bauerle et al 2012 urbanski et al 2007 photoperiod is commonly recognized as a dominant factor controlling the decrease of autumn photosynthetic capacity kong et al 2020 piao et al 2019a 4 2 2 effects on et and wue our modelling results showed that like gpp the responses of et to earlier sos varied seasonally spring et could rise if the start of green up moved to an earlier date while the summer et was closely related to sos gsl in a non linear fashion when sos was later than a certain threshold i e the turning point the advance of sos had a promoting effect on et in spring and summer such a consistent negative correlation at seasonal scales could amplify the influence of sos advance on total et however if sos had been earlier than the threshold and continued to advance the opposite impact directions that sos conducted in spring and summer would weaken the overall impact of sos on et the offset between plant transpiration and soil evaporation affected by temperature and daylight determines the increase or decrease in et jin et al 2017 phenology affects et in many ways on the one hand warming induced earlier sprouting and leaf unfolding can increase leaf area in the spring thus increasing leaf transpiration and canopy interception evaporation zha et al 2010 warmer temperatures in spring can also increase soil evaporation during the early growing season kljun et al 2006 as a result spring et can increase with warmer temperatures and earlier spring phenology on the other hand increased spring et resulting from the earlier green up can lead to more evaporative losses from the soil during the spring and summer months thus aggravating summer drought kim et al 2018 lian et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 such water depletion can further reduce land surface evaporative cooling causing increased summer heatwaves and exacerbated soil water deficits buermann et al 2013 lian et al 2020 peñuelas et al 2009 for ecosystems with arid climates and sensitivity to the summer water supply a deterioration in soil moisture conditions means less surface incident sunlight can be converted into water evaporation because of the limited water availability as a critical indicator for understanding ecological functions and water carbon cycle processes wue was also affected by seasonal canopy greenness dynamics especially by sos and gsl fig s5 shifting the sprout timing to an earlier date could lead to higher spring and summer wue indicating vegetation strive to survive under a drought environment caused by warming induced earlier green up via improving wue however the decreasing trend in the growth rate of wue related to earlier sos might imply vegetation that live in arid regions have a limited ability to utilize water it could be further inferred that vegetation in those water limited regions might face a worse situation if the spring leaf onset kept advancing with ongoing global warming in summary the impact of phenological shifting on the hydrological cycle may be more complex than just changing soil moisture et and wue earlier spring greening can alter atmospheric circulation patterns by accelerating the exchange rates of water and energy between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems swann et al 2012 zeng et al 2017 studies have demonstrated that faster spring soil moisture loss could increase atmospheric humidity promotes cloud formation and triggers additional precipitation li et al 2018 van der ent et al 2010 zeng et al 2018 however a soil water deficit causes less incoming sunlight to evaporate from the surface i e lower latent heat loss and associated higher sensible heat from the land may inhibit cloud development and subsequent precipitation berg et al 2016 quesada et al 2012 moreover large scale atmospheric circulation redistributes recycled water vapor across the earth s surface and produces additional precipitation in downwind areas swann et al 2012 van der ent et al 2010 these complex interactions between vegetation hydrology and climate hamper the improvement of models that predict the interaction between vegetation growth and water use with ongoing climate change although clarifying such complex interaction mechanisms is beyond the scope of this study we highlighted the importance of understanding ecosystem responses to persistent climate change in predicting future water and carbon cycles we therefore recommend that comprehensive vegetation dynamics including vegetation phenology and long term growth should be incorporated into models otherwise long term hydrological non stationarity hwang et al 2018 cannot be simulated accurately 4 3 limitations in this study we calibrated the rhessys model using the observed monthly streamflow rather than the daily records from the caoping station the simulated daily streamflow of the study site showed an acceptable correlation r2 0 60 with the observed one but the nse was relatively poor 0 5 fig 5 a likely explanation for this confusing result is that the daily streamflow of the caoping station is upscaled from the datasets measured at a series of selected dates i e the measuring dates are chosen based on rainfall events from 1st may 31st oct and are fixed during nov apr of the following year i e 5th 15th 25th rather than being directly gathered at daily scale via automatic continuous monitoring the yellow river basin hydrological yearbook admitted that this method of deriving daily streamflow has an average error of about 4 5 in the chabagou watershed it is difficult to confirm that the inconsistency between daily simulated and observed streamflow means the poor performance of rhessys therefore we only evaluated rhessys at the monthly time scale additionally we chose the modis ndvi derived phenology data rather than the simulated phenology from a dynamic phenology model to force rhessys and thus the study period was limited by the modis data availability due to farmland management and the lack of long term phenology measures it would be unable to calibrate phenology models at the study site in future work new solutions are necessary 5 conclusion in this study we examined the net impact of phenological changes on catchment scale long term vegetation carbon uptake gpp and water use et and wue fluxes over the last two decades in a small semi arid watershed of the loess plateau in china based mainly on modis products and a hydro ecological model rhessys earlier sos 1 47 days yr 1 and mos 0 45 days yr 1 slightly later eos 0 04 days yr 1 and consequently longer gsl 1 60 days yr 1 were obtained for the chabagou watershed throughout 2001 2020 our results demonstrated that long term increasing trends in annual et and gpp might be partly attributable to changes in the timing of phenological events sos eos mos and gsl during 2001 2020 the modelling results further suggest that earlier sos and consequently longer gsl have complicated effects on seasonal scaled vegetative photosynthetic carbon fixation and water loss in spring gpp et and wue tended to increase as the sos advanced however there were turning points in the response of vegetation growth in summer to the timing of these phenological events the sos threshold was 129 doy for summer et and 125 doy for summer gpp at summer et and gpp increased with delaying sos until the turning points reached and then decreased if the sos continued to delay above the thresholds the opposite impact directions that sos conducted in spring and summer gpp et would weaken the overall impact of sos on gpp et similar relationships were discernible between gsl and these fluxes because of the inherent causality between sos and gsl no significant long term trend was detected for eos at the study site over the last two decades possibly because of the complexity of the combined effects of temperature water availability photoperiod and spring phenology changes in plant phenology are a critical response of terrestrial ecosystems to climatic change menzel et al 2006 the timings of phenological events significantly affect the water carbon and nutrient cycles however the mechanism of plant phenological responses to climate change is still unclear various factors confound our evaluation and prediction of phenological dynamics to our knowledge this study is the first to detect the double sided impact of phenology on carbon and water fluxes within a process based hydro ecological modelling framework whereupon we stress the importance of combining a hydro ecological model with dynamic vegetation phenology to improve model performance in predicting ecosystem carbon sinks sources and water cycles under future climate change scenarios we also suggest improving the dynamic phenologic models for better predicting trends of ecosystem carbon gain and

2552,warming induced shifts in vegetation phenology affect ecosystem functions and the hydrological cycle research has so far focused on phenological trends drivers and feedback across temperate and tropical forests while their impacts on carbon assimilation and hydrological processes in temperate semi arid grasslands remain poorly understood based on remote sensing datasets from the moderate resolution image spectroradiometer modis we examined the trends in vegetation phenology gross primary productivity gpp and evapotranspiration et in the chabagou watershed of the loess plateau china for 2001 2020 the results revealed that the start of the growing season sos had advanced significantly between 2001 and 2020 at an average rate of 1 47 days yr 1 p 0 05 while the end of the growing season eos had delayed non significantly by about 0 04 days yr 1 sos robustly regulated growing season length gsl which was extended by an average rate of 1 60 days yr 1 regression analysis between phenology and two main climatic factors temperature and precipitation reveals that precipitation is the main climatic factor affecting sos while temperature plays a relatively important role in eos delay in the study area consistent with the phenological trend annual et and gpp increased steadily from 2001 to 2020 based on the regional hydro ecological simulation system rhessys we further investigated the net effects of phenological change on carbon and water fluxes the simulation results indicated that for our study site the correlation between sos and summer et would transform from positive to negative once sos had advanced to around 129 days of the year doy and 125 doy for summer gpp summer et and gpp increased as sos advanced and gsl extended until the sos reached the turning points and decreased if the sos and gsl advanced beyond the turning points the mechanism of variations in water and carbon fluxes responding to phenology dynamics could be more complex than we acknowledged to date because the climate is now approaching turning points we therefore suggest improving the dynamic phenologic models for better predicting trends of ecosystem carbon gain and water

field observations and remote sensing data have consistently shown that plant phenology has been changing rapidly during the past 30 years in association with global warming earlier springs later autumns and longer growing season lengths gsl are widely recognized phenological trends fu et al 2015 garonna et al 2016 liu et al 2016b piao et al 2015 schwartz et al 2006 for eurasia it appears that an extension in gsl is caused mainly by an earlier start of the growing season sos rather than a delay of end of the growing season eos barichivich et al 2013 park et al 2016 numerous studies have reported seasonal canopy greenness dynamics are the primary driver of increased water consumption kim et al 2018 and carbon uptake of terrestrial ecosystems in the northern hemisphere keeling et al

gpp to et is also significantly correlated with phenology jin et al 2017 besides phenology induced changes in bio geophysical processes such as evaporative cooling may help alleviate the consequences of global warming piao et al 2019b earlier green up could lead to a soil water deficit in late spring and aggravate summer drought due to increased spring transpiration after leaf out angert et al

ecosystem carbon sequestration can be envisioned sippel et al 2017 wolf et al 2016 zeng et al 2021 especially in arid and semi arid regions where water availability controls canopy development however detailed knowledge of phenological impacts on water limited ecosystems is still far from complete semi arid grassland ecosystems are highly sensitive to climate change li et al 2022 wang et al 2013 china s loess plateau lp which accounts for 40 of northwestern china is dominated by desert grassland yue et al 2018 yue et al 2019 due to limited precipitation and erodible loess soil the lp is known for water scarcity severe soil erosion shi and shao 2000 as well as ecological vulnerability huang and shao 2019 researchers have pointed out that ongoing climate change could be harmful to the grassland ecosystem of the lp guo et al 2017 huang et al 2016 besides zhou et al 2020 have highlighted that spring phenology rather than climatic factors determines the spring vegetation growth of grasslands in northern china given the particular characteristics of the lp regions and temperature warming decoupling the effects of biotic and abiotic forces on water and carbon fluxes is critical for assessing ecosystem stability and taking suitable measures for the sustainable management of water resources of the lp with the development of phenological theory large numbers of phenological monitoring sites have been constructed globally chmielewski et al 2013 such as the pan european phenology project pep725 https www pep725 eu the chinese phenological observation network cpon https www

et al 2019 verhegghen et al 2014 zeng et al 2020 due to the sensitivity to changes in chlorophyll content ndvi can reflect vegetation dynamics therefore ndvi has been applied widely to estimate phenological dates for various environments cheng et al 2021 fu et al 2014 walker et al 2014 many studies have documented phenological effects on various terrestrial ecosystems using vegetation phenology data sets ge et al 2015 lian et al 2020 piao et al 2017 richardson et al 2010 however evaluating the impact of phenology using only in situ observed and or remote sensed data could have some limitations for example ground sites are quite scarce up to now remote sensing data may spatiotemporally mismatch with the in situ one meta data analysis ge et al 2015 is an effective tool for exploring data from numerous references while interference from inter annual climatic variation is likely inevitable a combination of process based eco hydrological models is better for studying both historical and future trends in vegetation phenology and its role in regulating ecological and hydrological processes from regional to global scales liu et al 2018 wang et al 2018 zeng et al 2017 most models for simulating carbon water processes in terrestrial ecosystems were developed and operated under the assumption of hydrological stationarity milly et al 2008 an explanation for the hydrological instability caused by seasonal and decadal phenological change is lacking few studies have taken phenological dynamics into account when applying ecohydrological models hwang et al 2018 kim et al 2018 even though doing so could improve the simulation accuracy of critical carbon and water fluxes geng et al 2020 kim et al 2012 the regional hydro ecologic simulation system rhessys is a hydro ecological model based on physical processes rhessys simulates water carbon and nutrient nitrogen fluxes at small to moderate watershed scales and consider the limiting effects of climate and nutrients on vegetation carbon and water cycles tague and band 2004 there are relatively few watershed scale hydro ecological models that do include all these key components fatichi et al 2016 rhessys has been applied widely in various hydro ecological studies during the last few decades for example peng et al 2016 used it to evaluate the effects of converting farmlands to forests on the loess plateau china and hwang et al 2018 investigated the response of forest ecosystems and watershed hydrological processes to climate change son and tague 2018 explored the hydrological response of long term snow and seasonal snow basins to climate warming while barnhart et al 2020 assessed the relative importance of the snowmelt rate and timing to snowmelt season runoff bell et al 2019 operated rhessys to simulate impervious land surfaces and the impact of rainwater control connectivity on runoff and nitrogen loading overall rhessys holds potential for estimating hydro ecological processes and is a good tool for studying the corresponding mechanisms of the net effect of phenological change on water and carbon fluxes here we applied rhessys to investigate how vegetation phenology affects gpp and et in a semi arid grassland watershed of the loess plateau first phenological data including sos eos and gsl for the study area was derived from moderate resolution image spectroradiometer modis normalized difference vegetation index ndvi datasets mod13a1 any correlation between the phenological dates and remotely sensed annual gpp mod17a2hgf and et mod16a2gf were then detected ndvi derived sos and eos data were then implemented as phenological scenarios to force rhessys to simulate gpp and et at the watershed scale the net effects of phenology on gpp and et were then examined within the model framework 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the loess plateau located in the upper and middle reaches of the yellow river is one of the most severely eroded areas in china covering an area of approximately 650 000 km2 of which 70 is dominated by hills and gullies fu et al 2017 this study was carried out in a typical hilly region the chabagou watershed 109 5 110 1 e 37 5 37 8 n in shaanxi province fig 1 the chabagou river with a drainage area of 205 km2 and an elevation ranging from 901 to 1 272 m is wuding river s second tributary the study basin experiences a semi arid temperate continental monsoon climate the average annual precipitation in the region is about 450 mm 60 70 of which falls in the summer months from june to september the dominant rainfall type is short duration rainstorms the temperature ranges from 27 to 38 with an annual average of 8 the frost free period is about 180 days the mean potential et is 1 500 mm yr 1 and the average actual et is about 380 mm yr 1 the dominant soil type loess is derived from loess parent material the soil texture is mainly silt which is very erodible soil particles 0 05 mm represent about 25 8 of the soil particles between 0 01 and 0 05 mm represent about 57 7 and particles smaller than 0 01 mm represent about 16 5 guo et al 2019 the land cover types in the site mainly consist of cropland 57 3 grassland 39 3 and forest 3 4 the plant species encompass cyperaceae artemisia and leguminosae rain fed maize is the dominant crop type the caoping hydrological station located at the downstream of the chabagou watershed is a control gauging station with a monitoring area of 187 km2 the river channel length above the caoping station is 24 1 km the average width of the riverbed is 7 22 km and the density of the channel is 1 05 km km 2 qi et al 2011 we ran the rhessys model in the measurement range of the caoping station to eliminate systematic errors between the observed and simulated runoff caused by spatial dis match between the actual chabagou watershed 207 km2 and the monitoring area of the caoping site 187 km2 see fig s1 2 2 data sets 2 2 1 in situ observation datasets meteorological data including daily precipitation and daily maximum minimum temperatures from 1960 to 2019 as recorded by the nearest national weather station suide station were downloaded from the china meteorological data service center https data cma cn in addition daily precipitation from 12 rain gauges and streamflow from the caoping hydrology station see fig 1 during 2011 2016 were collected from the hydrologic yearbook released by the chinese yellow river conservancy commission to calibrate key variables of rhessys and validate the overall performance of rhessys 2 2 2 remote sensing data a digital elevation model dem of the chabagou watershed at a resolution of 30 m 30 m was derived from the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of science resdc https

spatial and temporal resolutions of these modis datasets are 500 m and 8 days excepted for ndvi which is 16 days respectively the modis reprojection tool mrt and arcgis were then applied to preprocess the remote sensing images including format conversion splicing clipping and reprojection 2 3 phenology extraction the timesat3 3 platform developed by delong university jönsson and eklundh 2004 was implemented to reconstruct the ndvi time series by an asymmetric gaussian function fitting method and to derive phenological information by dynamic threshold method peng et al 2019 pixels with ndvi values 0 05 were removed to avoid false vegetation index values the dynamic threshold method determines the range of change in ndvi based on the maximum and minimum values for ndvi in a particular year the start and end of the vegetation growing season for a particular year are defined as when the rise and fall in the annual change in ndvi reach a fixed percentage or a threshold of the maximum amplitude respectively the duration between these two represents the length of the growing season in addition as an indicator of peak greenness timing of middle of the season mos was also estimated in this study the threshold i e ndviratio can be quantified as 1 ndvi ratio ndvi t ndvi min ndvi max ndvi min where ndvimax and ndvimin are the maximum and minimum ndvi values for the year respectively ndvit represents the ndvi value at time t referring to some previous studies deng 2021 peng et al 2019 zeng et al 2021 and field investigation see table s1 in supplementary we determined the sos and eos of our study site to be the date when ndviratio reached 0 2 in the spring and 0 5 in the autumn respectively 2 4 a hydro ecological model 2 4 1 description rhessys is a gis geographical information system based and physical based hydro ecological model developed to simulate the tempo spatial distribution of water carbon and nutrient fluxes at daily monthly and yearly time steps it can track integrated biogeochemical cycling including dynamic feedback between hydrological and ecosystem processes influenced by land use land cover and climatic changes tague and band 2004 rhessys was designed to explicitly couple several well known models specifically the terrestrial ecosystem process model biome bgc running 1993 was combined with the spatially explicit meteorological information from mt clim running et al 1987 and a hydrological route modeled using dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 the representation of soil organic matter decomposition in rhessys is based mainly on the century model parton et al 1987 the centuryngas parton et al 1996 approach is also used in rhessys to model nitrogen cycling processes such as nitrification and denitrification more details of rhessys can be found elsewhere garcia et al 2016 lin et al 2019 tague and band 2004 and on the rhessys website https fiesta bren ucsb edu rhessys the version of rhessys conducted in this paper is rhessys 7 4 and the source code is available from the github https github com rhessys rhessys wiki 2 4 2 model spin up initializing the carbon and nitrogen pools at a stable state is a prerequisite for the model to simulate the ecological processes correctly however these pools are highly sensitive to long term disturbance history and thus do not attain stability easily law et al 2001 law et al 2004 before applying rhessys preliminary modelling i e spin up is essential to build up an organic soil layer and reach a state of equilibrium for plant and soil carbon and nitrogen storage a stable state is reached when the annual carbon and nitrogen variables for plants and soils do not have a significant i e p 0 05 upward or downward trend excluding small seasonal and annual fluctuations i e when the inter annual fluctuation range was below 5 the time it takes for the model to reach equilibrium varies depending on the characteristics of the landscape being used i e climatic zone vegetation type and soil type in general because of the slow development of the soil organic matter pool the spin up can represent hundreds of years in this study we spun up rhessys for 500 years the results of our spin up 500 years show that the soil carbon of the study area reached about 3 3 kg m 2 which is within a reasonable range according to liu et al 2011 2 9 4 2 kg m 2 additionally the interannual variation of the soil carbon was below 5 fig s2 2 4 3 model calibration and validation rhessys employs many parameters to describe soil land use and vegetation characteristics most of these parameters can stay constant through a model run while several parameters require calibration in general calibration of these parameters is usually based on estimating the fit between the simulated and observed streamflow referred to https github com rhessys rhessys wiki in this study we calibrated nine parameters including six soil parameters the lateral and vertical decay of saturation hydraulic conductivity with depth m and m v lateral and vertical surface saturated soil hydraulic conductivity k and k v soil pore size index po soil air entry pressure pa two groundwater parameters gw1 the proportion of infiltrated water that bypasses soil to a deeper groundwater table via macropores and fractures and gw2 the rate of lateral flow from the upslope groundwater table to the downslope stream channel and a vegetation parameter specified leaf area sla monte carlo simulation a commonly used method for rhessys calibration e g tague and band 2004 hwang et al 2018 is implemented to generate 3000 parameter sets based on the uniform distributions within prescribed ranges of these nine calibrated parameters i e m k m v k v po pa gw1 gw2 sla the set of parameter values with the optimal correspondence between simulated and observed streamflow was selected for future model running tague and band 2004 the monthly streamflow during 2011 2013 and 2014 2016 were collected to calibrate and validate the rhessys model respectively the coefficient of determination r2 percent bias pbias and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse were applied to evaluate the model gupta et al 1999 moriasi et al 2015 model performance can be categorized as satisfactory good or very good based on values of these three indicators according to moriasi et al 2015 table s2 2 4 4 simulation scenario settings to test the net effect of dynamic phenology on rhessys accuracy and on some critical water and carbon fluxes within the modelling framework we ran the model under different phenological scenarios while keeping other hydrological and eco physiological parameters unchanged to eliminate the interference of inter annual climatic variations on the simulation results the same climate forcing data daily p tmax and tmin from 2001 to 2020 were used for all the scenarios ndvi derived sos and eos data for the study area from 2001 to 2020 were applied as phenological inputs in summary we set 21 phenological scenarios 20 static scenarios and one dynamic scenario for the static scenarios we set the sos and eos of a year as a static scenario without any interannual phenological changes during each run therefore 20 static phenological scenarios could be generated from 20 groups of phenological dates for 2001 to 2020 for the dynamic scenario the actual dates of sos and eos for each year were used i e the phenology changed year to year within one simulation process 2 5 statistical analysis the slopes for the sos mos eos gsl annual gpp and et time series were tested using sen s slope estimator sen 1968 the rank based non parametric manna kendall m k statistical test kendall 1975 mann 1945 was then applied to assess significance of these slopes the sen s slope estimator and m k test have been widely applied to quantify the magnitude of trends and their significance in hydro meteorological time series tabari et al 2011 yue et al 2002 both were conducted using the program r the pearson correlation coefficient r was calculated for the sos mos eos gsl time series and annual gpp et and wue to evaluate the impact of a shift in phenology on vegetation carbon sequestration and watershed hydrology r can be used as a measure of monotonic association for ordinal data non normally distributed continuous data or data with relevant outliers r values range from 1 to 1 with 0 representing no monotonic association the relationship grows stronger and ultimately presents a constantly increasing or decreasing curve as r approaches 1 or 1 linear and polynomial regression analyses were also applied to establish fitting relationships r 2 i e square of r indicates the goodness of fit with values ranging from 0 to 1 the closer r 2 is to 1 the better the fit is the regression analysis was implemented in the program r which was also used to plot the figures 3 results 3 1 changes in vegetation phenology gpp and et 3 1 1 phenological dynamics fig 2 shows the temporal variations in sos mos eos and gsl as estimated using modis ndvi for the chabagou watershed from 2001 to 2020 the julian dates for sos mos eos and gsl varied widely from 97 to 163 doy 217 to 245 doy 266 to 287 doy and 120 to 176 days respectively other studies have reported similar results listed in table s3 in addition trend analysis sen s slope m k test showed significant p 0 05 long term trends in both sos and gsl with a 1 47 day earlier sos per year and a 1 60 day longer gsl per year unlike sos mos did not advance obviously 0 45 days yr 1 p 0 05 implicating the enlarged spring window i e the period from sos to mos over the study area eos over the last two decades delayed slightly at a mean rate of 0 04 days yr 1 p 0 05 which was less than the trend seen across china s temperate biomes 0 12 days yr 1 by liu et al 2016a correlation among these four phenological timings were then estimated fig 3 there was a significant negative correlation p 0 01 between sos and gsl with a coefficient of determination r 2 equal to 0 89 indicating that changes in sos could explain 89 of the variation in gsl however no evidence suggested that the impact of eos mos on gsl was significant p 0 1 the relationship between sos and eos mos also showed a high degree of discretization p 0 1 while eos closely positively related to mos r 0 726 p 0 01 overall an earlier sos slightly later eos and consequently longer gsl were detected over the study period although eos in the autumn was becoming somewhat later it was primarily an earlier spring sos that drove the extended gsl in the chabagou watershed however an earlier sos did not mean an advanced mos although it seems it should be the earlier the sos the earlier the mos 3 1 2 trends in et and gpp based on modis datasets et and gpp as critical ecosystem water and carbon fluxes were analyzed to highlight any spatial and temporal variations see fig 4 during the study period 2001 2020 the mean rate of increase in annual et calculated by sen s slope ranged from 5 93 to 10 75 mm yr 1 with the rate for 80 of the study area falling within 6 50 8 50 mm yr 1 the 20 year averaged trend for gpp varied spatially from 9 71 to 21 06 gc m 2 yr 1 and between 12 00 and 16 00 gc m 2 yr 1 in most regions for the temporal distributions illustrated in fig 4e and 4f inter annual trends in both et 7 53 mm yr 1 and gpp 14 00 mm yr 1 are noticeable with a 0 99 confidence level indicted by the m k test to a large extent the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of et and gpp in the chabagou watershed from 2001 to 2020 showed consistent trends indicating a close positive correlation between gpp and et furthermore the annual ecosystem wue equal to gpp et increased on average by 0 013 gc mm 1 m 2 per year fig s3 the trend in wue for the study area spatially varied between 0 0058 and 0 021 gc mm 1 m 2 yr 1 and fell in the range of 0 010 0 017 gc mm 1 m 2 yr 1 for most regions 3 2 correlation between phenology and et and gpp pearson correlation coefficient r was conducted to identify any correlation between phenological onset dates sos mos eos and gsl and two key ecosystem fluxes i e et and gpp all the data came from modis products the results are shown in fig 3 both annual total et and gpp were significantly p 0 05 correlated with sos mos and gsl while neither et nor gpp was statistically related to eos the r for sos and the annual et gpp and ndvi were 0 62 p 0 05 0 61 p 0 05 and 0 58 p 0 05 respectively negative r values for sos as well as mos indicated that annual et gpp as well as ndvi values could fall with a later sos mos in other words plants could consume more water take up more carbon and thus grow better with an earlier onset of the growing season there was however a slightly different performance in the relationship between phenology timings and wue compared with sos and gsl mos and eos contributed more to the variations of wue 3 3 rhessys model performance during the calibration period 2011 2013 the monthly streamflow fitted well with the observed one with r2 pbias and nse being 0 88 p 0 05 5 63 and 0 75 respectively fig 5 according to statistical performance measures recommended by moriasi et al 2015 table s2 rhessys performed good in estimating streamflow from 2011 to 2013 such desirable performance was kept over the following validation period 2014 2016 r2 0 94 pbias 5 78 nse 0 87 the model performed well during the validation period except for 2015 fig 5 note that the observed streamflow data in 2015 showed less consistency with precipitation changes than rhessys estimates it might be attributed to human activities such as water resources management overall rhessys reached an average good performance for monthly streamflow estimates in the chabagou watershed rhessys simulated monthly gpp and et from the dynamic phenology scenario i e using the actual dates for sos and eos each year during 2001 2020 were also closely correlated to the modis dataset with both r2 approximated 0 88 p 0 05 fig 6 noted that the modelled et and gpp appeared slightly higher than the remote sensed values given the slight underestimation of modis et and gpp across northwestern china we suggested that the calibrated rhessys performed satisfactorily when simulating monthly gpp and et for the chabagou watershed 3 4 implications of the phenological dynamic for et and gpp based on the correlation between phenology sos mos eos and gsl and et and gpp fig 3 we concluded that both annual water loss through et and vegetation carbon uptake quantified by gpp were related to vegetation phenology i e sos mos and gsl in this study however it is difficult to determine how when and to what extent phenology affects vegetation dynamics and water balance only through data based analysis phenological scenarios were therefore used to investigate the net implications of phenological events on seasonal et and gpp fig 7 illustrates the relationships between two main phenological variables sos and gsl and the multi year averaged seasonal et and gpp values derived from our model framework for 2001 to 2020 noticeably poor r2 for the linear fits between sos gsl and summer et gpp table 1 might imply that they were not simply linear correlated as expected instead the parabola looks more suitable for both the sos gsl et and the sos gsl gpp fittings for the summer ones with r2 being 0 83 0 70 and 0 72 0 72 respectively the parabolic fitting means that there is a turning point on the regression curve i e the thresholds existed for the contribution rate of phenology to changes in et and gpp as shown in fig 7a the peak in summer gpp at this turning point occurred when sos was about 125 doy when the sos was 125 doy the catchment gpp increased as sos delayed but began to decline if the sos continued to rise beyond 125 doy a similar relationship occurred between sos and summer et the turning point for the sos summer et curve occurred when sos was about 129 doy which was four days later than the turning point for gpp we also found turning points for gsl et 149 days and gsl gpp 155 days during the summer months fig 7b and 7b the parabola also caught a good fit in analyzing the correlation between sos and spring gpp et the turning point occurred at 155 doy for sos gpp and 160 doy for sos et in spring however transforming the fits from a line r2 0 94 for the sos gpp and 0 97 for the sos et to a parabola r2 0 98 for both the sos gpp and the sos et did not improve the result furthermore we did not detect any inflection point when applying regression analyses on sos gsl et or gpp in autumn and also on gsl and spring gpp or et the dominant phenological factor regulating autumn vegetation dynamics could be eos rather than sos or gsl see fig s4 spring gpp and et decreased as sos advanced gsl extended autumn gpp and et inclined as eos delayed the spring and summer wue also increased with an advanced sos extended gsl autumn wue increased with a delayed eos as expected fig s5 and table s4 4 discussion 4 1 causes of phenological changes earlier sos 1 47 days yr 1 and mos 0 45 days yr 1 slightly later eos 0 04 days yr 1 and consequently longer gsl 1 60 days yr 1 were obtained for the chabagou watershed throughout 2001 2020 when the climate tended to be warm and wet fig s6 the temperature is generally regarded to be a dominant factor affecting vegetation phenology chuine et al 2010 cleland et al 2006 fu et al 2018 peñuelas et al 2009 zhang et al 2022 followed by water availability kang et al 2018 peng et al 2021 wang et al 2022 zeng et al 2021 responses of phenology to varying temperatures and precipitation seem to differ at the seasonal scale our findings suggest that precipitation is the main climatic factor affecting sos while temperature plays a relatively important role in eos delay for semi arid grasslands fig s7 commonly spring warming could lead to an earlier green up zhang et al 2022 here we also detected a negative but non significant p 0 05 correlation between sos and mean spring temperature instead limited precipitation could significantly p 0 05 restrict spring vegetation growth in the study area in line with an earlier study which reported that spring drought could delay sos in semi arid regions of northern china kang et al 2018 zhou and jia 2016 however the influence of temperature on photosynthesis becomes relative significant p 0 05 during autumn days fig s7 the warmer the autumn is the longer the leaf could live it can also be inferred that autumn leaf senescence has a higher temperature sensitivity than spring leaf sprout at the study site in addition to temperature and precipitation other environmental and biotic factors such as nutrients and photoperiod could also affect vegetation phenology piao et al 2019a photoperiod may play a key role in regulating autumn phenological timings cooke et al 2012 the elevated temperature could stimulate plant photosynthetic activity during the withering months still low photoperiod i e below the threshold required for growth could induce bud set and leaf senescence spring and autumn phenology are also positively inter correlated keenan and richardson 2015 liu et al 2016b for example the advancement of spring phenology may increase soil moisture loss throughout the early spring and subsequently intensify summer droughts which usually contributes to reducing delays in eos buermann et al 2013 piao et al 2019a xie et al 2015 earlier eos caused by earlier sos can partly offset the warming induced eos delay here we do not describe the influencing factors of vegetation phenology in detail because it is out of the scope of this study overall phenological trends are site and species specific grassland phenology generally depends on the combined impact of precipitation and temperature chuai et al 2013 geng et al 2020 for regions similar to our study area where the vegetation type is mainly dry grassland ignoring the impact of precipitation on phenology may limit our understanding of phenological dynamics we therefore recommend investigating the drivers and mechanisms of changes in vegetation phenology in different environments and for various plant species 4 2 net effects of phenology shifting 4 2 1 effects on vegetation carbon uptake the positive negative r between gsl sos and gpp fig 3 implies that phenological changes are also crucial to the recent increase in vegetative activity and carbon uptake keeling et al 1996 piao et al 2007 piao et al 2017 it is necessary to clarify the link between phenology and the terrestrial carbon cycle in determining the underlying mechanisms of the increased vegetative activity and carbon sinks seen in the northern hemisphere over the past few decades piao et al 2018 piao et al 2019b zhu et al 2016 piao et al 2007 suggested that the main factor is a prolonged gsl similar to previous studies in temperate areas geng et al 2020 zeng et al 2021 at our study site the advancement of sos and extension of gsl promoted vegetation growth and thus enhanced carbon uptake represented by an increase in annual total gpp interestingly by applying multiple groups of phenological dates in a hydro ecological model to remove interferences of other environmental variables such as temperature and precipitation we found non linear relationships between sos and summer gpp turning points existed in the net impact of change in the timing of greenness on vegetative carbon assimilations regardless of the absolute magnitude the trends in the curves should still be meaningful on the right side of the regression curves fig 7a summer gpp increased as sos advanced or gsl extended which is a generally accepted trend randerson et al 1999 richardson et al 2010 on the other side of the curves however the earlier the sos the lower the summer gpp the slope of the relationship gradually decreased with the prolongation of gsl corresponding to a continued advance in sos indicating the promotional effect of gsl extension sos advancement on the decreased vegetation carbon absorption during the summer months the right side of the regression curves corresponds to a slope with values below zero and an earlier sos or longer gsl reduced photosynthesis i e less gpp in summer the water and energy conditions when the plants begin to turn green may be unfavorable to vegetation growth eventually vegetation greening up too early or too late cannot promote vegetative activity and carbon uptake it might be attributable to water availability although early green up is conducive to vegetation carbon absorption in spring a rise in transpiration caused by enhanced vegetative growth in spring indirectly leads to a soil water deficit throughout late spring and summer deteriorating soil moisture conditions restrict vegetative growth xu et al 2012 and summer plant productivity xie et al 2015 resulting in a decreased sensitivity of annual gpp to sos buermann et al 2013 wolf et al 2016 the trade off between the opposite effects of sos on vegetative growth in spring positive and summer negative zeng et al 2021 may explain this unexpected phenomenon however neither remote sensed nor modal simulated results demonstrate any distinct response of autumn vegetation carbon sequestration to changes in eos autumnal extension of gsl could explain fewer photosynthetic activity variations than photoperiod barichivich et al 2013 bauerle et al 2012 urbanski et al 2007 photoperiod is commonly recognized as a dominant factor controlling the decrease of autumn photosynthetic capacity kong et al 2020 piao et al 2019a 4 2 2 effects on et and wue our modelling results showed that like gpp the responses of et to earlier sos varied seasonally spring et could rise if the start of green up moved to an earlier date while the summer et was closely related to sos gsl in a non linear fashion when sos was later than a certain threshold i e the turning point the advance of sos had a promoting effect on et in spring and summer such a consistent negative correlation at seasonal scales could amplify the influence of sos advance on total et however if sos had been earlier than the threshold and continued to advance the opposite impact directions that sos conducted in spring and summer would weaken the overall impact of sos on et the offset between plant transpiration and soil evaporation affected by temperature and daylight determines the increase or decrease in et jin et al 2017 phenology affects et in many ways on the one hand warming induced earlier sprouting and leaf unfolding can increase leaf area in the spring thus increasing leaf transpiration and canopy interception evaporation zha et al 2010 warmer temperatures in spring can also increase soil evaporation during the early growing season kljun et al 2006 as a result spring et can increase with warmer temperatures and earlier spring phenology on the other hand increased spring et resulting from the earlier green up can lead to more evaporative losses from the soil during the spring and summer months thus aggravating summer drought kim et al 2018 lian et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 such water depletion can further reduce land surface evaporative cooling causing increased summer heatwaves and exacerbated soil water deficits buermann et al 2013 lian et al 2020 peñuelas et al 2009 for ecosystems with arid climates and sensitivity to the summer water supply a deterioration in soil moisture conditions means less surface incident sunlight can be converted into water evaporation because of the limited water availability as a critical indicator for understanding ecological functions and water carbon cycle processes wue was also affected by seasonal canopy greenness dynamics especially by sos and gsl fig s5 shifting the sprout timing to an earlier date could lead to higher spring and summer wue indicating vegetation strive to survive under a drought environment caused by warming induced earlier green up via improving wue however the decreasing trend in the growth rate of wue related to earlier sos might imply vegetation that live in arid regions have a limited ability to utilize water it could be further inferred that vegetation in those water limited regions might face a worse situation if the spring leaf onset kept advancing with ongoing global warming in summary the impact of phenological shifting on the hydrological cycle may be more complex than just changing soil moisture et and wue earlier spring greening can alter atmospheric circulation patterns by accelerating the exchange rates of water and energy between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems swann et al 2012 zeng et al 2017 studies have demonstrated that faster spring soil moisture loss could increase atmospheric humidity promotes cloud formation and triggers additional precipitation li et al 2018 van der ent et al 2010 zeng et al 2018 however a soil water deficit causes less incoming sunlight to evaporate from the surface i e lower latent heat loss and associated higher sensible heat from the land may inhibit cloud development and subsequent precipitation berg et al 2016 quesada et al 2012 moreover large scale atmospheric circulation redistributes recycled water vapor across the earth s surface and produces additional precipitation in downwind areas swann et al 2012 van der ent et al 2010 these complex interactions between vegetation hydrology and climate hamper the improvement of models that predict the interaction between vegetation growth and water use with ongoing climate change although clarifying such complex interaction mechanisms is beyond the scope of this study we highlighted the importance of understanding ecosystem responses to persistent climate change in predicting future water and carbon cycles we therefore recommend that comprehensive vegetation dynamics including vegetation phenology and long term growth should be incorporated into models otherwise long term hydrological non stationarity hwang et al 2018 cannot be simulated accurately 4 3 limitations in this study we calibrated the rhessys model using the observed monthly streamflow rather than the daily records from the caoping station the simulated daily streamflow of the study site showed an acceptable correlation r2 0 60 with the observed one but the nse was relatively poor 0 5 fig 5 a likely explanation for this confusing result is that the daily streamflow of the caoping station is upscaled from the datasets measured at a series of selected dates i e the measuring dates are chosen based on rainfall events from 1st may 31st oct and are fixed during nov apr of the following year i e 5th 15th 25th rather than being directly gathered at daily scale via automatic continuous monitoring the yellow river basin hydrological yearbook admitted that this method of deriving daily streamflow has an average error of about 4 5 in the chabagou watershed it is difficult to confirm that the inconsistency between daily simulated and observed streamflow means the poor performance of rhessys therefore we only evaluated rhessys at the monthly time scale additionally we chose the modis ndvi derived phenology data rather than the simulated phenology from a dynamic phenology model to force rhessys and thus the study period was limited by the modis data availability due to farmland management and the lack of long term phenology measures it would be unable to calibrate phenology models at the study site in future work new solutions are necessary 5 conclusion in this study we examined the net impact of phenological changes on catchment scale long term vegetation carbon uptake gpp and water use et and wue fluxes over the last two decades in a small semi arid watershed of the loess plateau in china based mainly on modis products and a hydro ecological model rhessys earlier sos 1 47 days yr 1 and mos 0 45 days yr 1 slightly later eos 0 04 days yr 1 and consequently longer gsl 1 60 days yr 1 were obtained for the chabagou watershed throughout 2001 2020 our results demonstrated that long term increasing trends in annual et and gpp might be partly attributable to changes in the timing of phenological events sos eos mos and gsl during 2001 2020 the modelling results further suggest that earlier sos and consequently longer gsl have complicated effects on seasonal scaled vegetative photosynthetic carbon fixation and water loss in spring gpp et and wue tended to increase as the sos advanced however there were turning points in the response of vegetation growth in summer to the timing of these phenological events the sos threshold was 129 doy for summer et and 125 doy for summer gpp at summer et and gpp increased with delaying sos until the turning points reached and then decreased if the sos continued to delay above the thresholds the opposite impact directions that sos conducted in spring and summer gpp et would weaken the overall impact of sos on gpp et similar relationships were discernible between gsl and these fluxes because of the inherent causality between sos and gsl no significant long term trend was detected for eos at the study site over the last two decades possibly because of the complexity of the combined effects of temperature water availability photoperiod and spring phenology changes in plant phenology are a critical response of terrestrial ecosystems to climatic change menzel et al 2006 the timings of phenological events significantly affect the water carbon and nutrient cycles however the mechanism of plant phenological responses to climate change is still unclear various factors confound our evaluation and prediction of phenological dynamics to our knowledge this study is the first to detect the double sided impact of phenology on carbon and water fluxes within a process based hydro ecological modelling framework whereupon we stress the importance of combining a hydro ecological model with dynamic vegetation phenology to improve model performance in predicting ecosystem carbon sinks sources and water cycles under future climate change scenarios we also suggest improving the dynamic phenologic models for better predicting trends of ecosystem carbon gain and

2553,rapid prediction of spatially distributed hydrological variables such as water depths in rivers is an important but challenging task this study proposes a novel matrix based deep learning approach for predicting spatial distribution of water depths in rivers the proposed approach was constructed based on a two dimensional 2d convolutional neural network cnn with a new architecture that was specifically designed for providing spatial distribution maps a numerical dataset was established based on a field cruise and two dimensional hydraulic modeling for different scenarios and numerical experiments were designed to predict spatial distribution of water depths for different scenarios using the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis support vector machine svm genetic programming gp multi gene genetic programming mggp one dimensional cnn 1d cnn and the proposed cnn algorithms the results showed that the proposed cnn approach captured both the large scale and small scale spatial patterns remarkably well and it outperformed the other approaches this study shows that the 2d cnn algorithm is better than the classical machine learning ml algorithms for inundation modeling the proposed approach is thus a promising tool for providing rapid predictions of spatial distribution of water depths in river systems and can potentially be leveraged to predict other spatially distributed hydrological variables keywords deep learning convolutional neural network water depth spatial distribution surrogate modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction predicting complex hydrological processes is a challenging task and requires extensive measurements recent advances in remote sensing technology along with increasing utilization of embedded sensors have made it possible to obtain detailed data which in turn has provided a better understanding of hydrological systems kabir et al 2020 however some important spatially distributed variables such as spatial distribution of water depths in rivers are still difficult to measure and predict mathematical models can provide complete datasets with relatively low costs but they are subject to disadvantages inaccuracy high computational demand and large disk storage space bhola et al 2018 the practice of hydrological forecasts can be improved by developing mathematical representations that can better describe the underlying physical mechanics and by proposing novel technologies that can readily produce accurate predictions and transfer the information to the real world as stated by kreyenberg et al 2019 the advances in modern artificial intelligence especially deep learning dl algorithms along with the increasing amount of good quality data provide a new avenue of achieving these purposes to propose and evaluate the performance of novel approaches we focus on a relatively simple test case water depth modeling in a regulated river system where a field cruise has been taken and detailed data of water depth distribution have been collected water depth forecasting in regulated river systems is an important component in traditional water management e g flood management practice and is also a key process for developing automatic flood control technologies delgoda et al 2013 floods often lead to serious social economic and environmental issues and thus reservoirs and hydraulic infrastructures have been widely constructed to control floods chu et al 2020 previous flow control decisions were primarily made by river managers based on engineering experience and comparably simple hydrological methods however automatic control is becoming popular nowadays and has been widely utilized for managing hydro power river navigation and water quality ming et al 2020 li et al 2020 it is necessary to provide accurate and rapid predictions of resultant flow characteristics for different control strategies to optimize automatic flow control schemes it has been demonstrated that better water depth predictions can significantly improve the performance of automatic flood control which can achieve a lower peak volume level a shorter period for emptying excess water and less waste of storage water resources burn et al 2016 water depth forecasting can be performed using various approaches river flow characteristics are only sparsely monitored in most regions and thus it is a common practice to employ hydrological or hydraulic models to forecast spatial distribution of water depths de paiva et al 2013 hydrological models such as those based on the flood connected domain algorithm and those based on the bulk approach largely rely on extensive calibrations rather than strict physical representations therefore their performance is often unacceptable for extreme flows in ungauged catchments and in areas with steep elevation gradients unduche et al 2018 ming et al 2020 li et al 2020 hydraulic modeling which maintains strict momentum conservation is another choice for investigating hydrological processes yan et al 2020a b two dimensional 2d hydraulic models are physically based models and are very suitable for shallow water conditions e g rivers so they have been widely employed to study flow dynamics in rivers teng et al 2017 ming et al 2021 however 2d hydraulics simulations are computationally expensive limiting their applications in relatively large areas and real time forecasting kabir et al 2020 recent advances in parallel computing techniques and graphics processing units gpus can significantly reduce the computational time for a single model run neal et al 2016 wang et al 2021 bai et al 2021 but using 2d hydraulic models to simulate different scenarios is still not practical for real time forecasting applications the offline approach which prepares pre run inundation maps for different flowrates is commonly utilized for flood forecasting leedal et al 2010 bhola et al 2018 however this approach requires a large disk storage space and is impractical for water depth forecasting in regulated river systems because the hydrodynamics in these systems are also affected by the water control strategies in addition to the discharges a promising alternative method for predicting sophisticated hydrological processes is to use machine learning ml algorithms especially deep learning algorithms hu et al 2018 xie et al 2021 hou et al 2021 these algorithms have been demonstrated to be capable of learning the underlying physical processes figuring out deeply hidden relationships between features and output variables and developing surrogate models for physically based models yan et al 2021a advances in ml have made a significant contribution to the field of hydrology and water resources research examples of successful applications include evapotranspiration estimation climate downscaling and flowrate forecasting wang et al 2021 bai et al 2021 ferreira et al 2022 however the applications of ml in water depth forecasting are still in their infancy several researchers have developed ml models for water depth forecasting for example chang et al 2014 proposed a hybrid self organizing map and recurrent nonlinear autoregressive exogenous som r narx approach for nowcasting regional flood inundation maps using extensive data in a 270 km2 region and the study demonstrated that the proposed methodology was promising in forecasting 2d inundation maps however there is a lack of sufficient measured data in most regions so hybrid hydraulic ml approaches have been proposed in recent years for flood inundation predictions in these approaches ml based models are trained using the outputs of a hydraulic model and ml based models are then employed as surrogate models to make predictions bermúdez et al 2019 employed the support vector machine svm algorithm to develop a surrogate of the 2d shallow water equations and their study demonstrated that the model is accurate and computationally efficient in computing flood inundation hosseiny et al 2020 trained a random forest rf model and an artificial neural networks ann model using the outputs of a calibrated hydraulic model iric for a segment of the green river the study demonstrated that the ml models can accurately emulate the outcomes of the hydraulic model and provide rapid predictions hou et al 2021 established ml based urban flood inundation models for a part of fengxi new town using hydrodynamic results and the study showed that combining the rf and k nearest neighbor knn algorithms can effectively improve the performance of the standalone algorithms yan et al 2021b coupled the personal computer storm water management model pcswmm and neural networks for flood inundation in a drainage area in tianjin municipality china the study showed that the proposed approach can provide flood inundation predictions in high risk areas in cities in a fast and accurate manner the majority of the existing studies that adopted traditional machine learning techniques for river depth forecasting trained an individual model for each of the cells or nodes which was not practical for a relatively large region e g bermúdez et al 2019 hosseiny et al 2020 recently kabir et al 2020 proposed a method for predicting fluvial flood inundation using a one dimensional convolutional neural network 1d cnn algorithm in their study a 1d cnn model for the urbanized area of carlisle was trained using the outputs of a hydraulic model i e flood fp and the research showed that the proposed approach can provide fast and accurate predictions for the entire domain at one time yan et al 2021c proposed a new approach that combined a hydraulic model telemac and multi gene genetic programming mggp for predicting the spatial distribution of flow depths in their study the coordinates of the cells were incorporated as additional input variables for the ml model and the approach was shown to be capable of directly providing accurate inundation maps however we should bear in mind that the existing studies did not consider the influence of water control while many rivers are regulated and the river operators need information on the consequences of different control strategies to make proper decisions to take this influence into account it is necessary to consider more scenarios which in turn leads to a higher efficiency requirement for the employed approach in summary a review of the above studies highlights the following gaps in the literature 1 most of the existing studies on the prediction of spatial distribution of water depths utilized or focused on classical observational hydrological and hydraulic approaches leedal et al 2010 de paiva et al 2013 neal et al 2018 bhola et al 2018 unduche et al 2018 ming et al 2020 li et al 2020 yan et al 2020a 2020b bai et al 2021 wang et al 2021 and applications of ml in water depth forecasting are still in their infancy and require further investigation 2 the majority of the existing ml based studies trained an individual model for each of the cells or nodes chang et al 2014 bermúdez et al 2019 hosseiny et al 2020 kabir et al 2020 hou et al 2021 yan et al 2021b yan et al 2021c and to the best of the authors knowledge no one has published the use of a 2d cnn for surrogate modeling of spatial distributions of river depths and 3 the performance of a 2d cnn based model compared with classical ml algorithms in water depth forecasting has not been assessed in the literature the present study is aimed at exploring the predictions of spatially distributed hydrological variables using simulated image like data and modern image based deep learning algorithms to achieve successful predictions we need to 1 ensure that the physically based model and thus the hydraulic data can accurately represent the underlying hydrological processes and 2 convert all the data into the same image like structure in this study we focused on water depth forecasting in regulated river systems as an example so a hydraulic model was adopted as the physically based model and 2d matrices of spatially distributed water depths were employed as the image like data the influence of river operation was represented by the downstream water level condition firstly we generated a comprehensive dataset containing water depth data for different scenarios through 2d numerical experiments and the dataset was randomly split into training validation and test datasets in the next step we trained a 2d cnn that can directly predict water depth fields using the training data the trained cnn was then utilized to provide the water depth fields for the testing cases and an additional case with field measurements to evaluate the generalization capability of the approach we have also compared the performance of the proposed 2d cnn and traditional ml algorithms including adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis svm genetic programming gp mggp and 1d cnn the proposed approach enables the cnn to learn the physical processes from the hydraulic image like data and to predict spatially distributed hydrological variables it provides an alternative avenue for rapid water depth forecasting unlike traditional offline methods the proposed approach represents the numerical data using mathematical models that can provide outputs in seconds therefore it eliminates the requirement of a large database and is able to make predictions for arbitrary scenarios unlike the previous studies that attempted water depth forecasting using ml algorithms chu et al 2020 lei et al 2021 xie et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 the present study employed the 2d cnn algorithm that can directly learn from 2d data and provide predictions of the entire fields of water depths in this way the proposed approach takes full advantage of cnn algorithms in dealing with image like data with traditional ml algorithms incorporating an additional feature variable e g downstream water level would significantly increase the required amount of data which in turn leads to high cost and low efficiency however the 2d cnn algorithm which is one of the best ml algorithms in image processing eltner et al 2021 pan et al 2019 wang et al 2021 can effectively reduce the dataset size while retaining the original image features eltner et al 2021 pan et al 2019 wang et al 2021 therefore the proposed approach is expected to provide better performance 2 methodology fig 1 presents the technical flowchart to refine the realization process of the research and the main technical steps involved in this study 2 1 study area cruise surveys and field data in this work a segment of the ottawa river was selected as the study area and the field data were collected during a field cruise conducted by the research group at the university of ottawa the ottawa river which extends from east of the dozois reservoir to the st laurence river is 1 271 km long with a drainage area of 146 300 km2 approximately 35 of its length is located in the province of ontario and the rest in the province of quebec canada the river is regulated by the mississippi valley conservation authority rideau valley conservation authority and south nation conservation in this study an approximately 3 2 km segment of the ottawa river fig 2 was used as the case study the left bank of the study domain is entirely within the boundary of the city of gatineau quebec and the right bank is within the city of ottawa ontario it is immediately downstream of the island île kettle and upstream of mclaurin bay there are numerous dams in the watershed and preliminary studies showed that the flow characteristics in the study domain are primarily governed by the pointe fortune dam which is in the vicinity of voyageur provincial park a field cruise was conducted by the research group at the university of ottawa in the study domain on july 24 2012 the water depths were measured using an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp the digital elevation model dem was established using the samples provided by the city of ottawa based on the canadian hydrographic services chart and hydrographic surveys with knudsen echosounder 320b and garmin gpsmap76 series the raw collected data were in the geographic coordinate system and we transformed them into the projected coordinate system wgs 1984 web mercator auxiliary sphere 2 2 physical representation fluid flow in shallow water bodies is governed by the shallow water equations also known as the saint venant s equations which can be expressed as hervouet 2007 yan et al 2021 continuity 1 h t u h h d i v u s h momentum along x 2 u t u v g z x s x 1 h d i v h ν t u momentum

and y horizontal space coordinates sh source or sink of fluid sx and sy momentum source terms including bottom friction surface wind shear and source sink of momentum in the domain 2 3 numerical experiments to model the flow characteristics represented by the governing equations we employed the open source numerical model telemac mascaret telemac mascaret was initially developed by the national hydraulics and environment laboratory of the french electricity board and its 2d version solves the depth averaged free surface flow equations the computational domain was configured to be larger than the actual area of interest which was a good practice to avoid the impacts of boundary condition imperfections the computational domain was discretized by a 2d finite element triangular unstructured mesh and the grid resolution was determined based on a mesh sensitivity analysis number of elements 56 580 for boundary conditions the flowrates q were specified at the upstream boundary cross section and the water levels wl were given at the downstream boundary cross section unlike previous water depth simulations in which the water levels at the downstream boundary were calculated or modelled the present study directly assigned certain values to the downstream boundary to model the influence of river regulations e g regulations using inverted siphons weirs and sluice gates the roughness coefficient manning coefficient was 0 03 which was initially estimated from aerial photos and field inspections and confirmed by model calibrations the numerical model was employed to generate a comprehensive training validation data set and a test data set to ensure the accuracy of the hydraulic dataset the numerical model was validated against the field cruise data before being used to carry out the numerical computations the comparisons between the measured data and numerical predictions demonstrated the satisfactory performance of the numerical model which in turn ensured the accuracy of the dataset more details with respect to the confidence in the accuracy of the results will be discussed in more detail in section 4 each data set contains a number of csv files indicating the spatial distributions of water depths for different scenarios the numerical experiments were performed using the windows 10 operating system on a desktop with a 3 80 ghz amd ryzen 7 5800x 8 core processor the dl approach does not require the consideration of many different scenarios this study will demonstrate that the proposed approach can provide reasonable predictions with only 5 samples but it is better to prepare a large dataset for detailed evaluations and method comparisons the data sets were generated considering 500 different scenarios 50 different q values and 10 different wl values for each q value the q values were approximately equally spaced ranging from 300 m3 s to 800 m3 s assuring that the median q close to the baseline case measured by the field cruise q 554 5 m3 s the wl values ranged from 35 1 m in the case q 300 m3 s to 44 73 m in the case q 800 m3 s the wl values for each q were generally designed to provide some values higher than the corresponding normal depths as well as some other values lower than the corresponding normal depths these scenarios were modelled by individual simulations the outputs of these simulations were post processed to generate 2d matrices that show the spatial distributions of water depths the post processing was primarily performed using the software bluekenue and matlab these matrices were further utilized to train validate and test dl based models the train validation data set contains 90 of the samples and the validation split factor was set as 0 1 namely 10 of the cases in this data set were employed for model validation the remaining 10 of the cases were selected and used as unseen data to test the performance of the dl based model there were 50 cases named as t01 t50 used for generating the test dataset and one wl was randomly selected for each q fig 3 the selected dataset size was believed appropriate for the current exploratory case a smaller dataset would not provide satisfactory performance and a larger dataset would require more computational resources 2 4 convolutional neural networks cnns the cnn we designed for water depth modeling is illustrated in fig 4 the designed architecture is quite different from existing architectures primarily because water depth mapping is not a typical image analysis task and the current network is believed to be more suitable and convenient for water depth mapping the model used q and wl as inputs and water depth matrices as output it first reads the nondimensionalized q and wl values with an initial data length of 2 and converts them into an image like matrix through a few dense activation and reshape layers then two branches were designed one performs upsampling using a convolutional layer and the other one uses activation and convolutional layers for upsampling the network then employs an add layer to produce a single tensor with dimension of 64 128 16 and generates a 128 256 16 tensor using an activation and upsampling layer four similar blocks with this two branch structure were stacked to create a tensor with dimensions of 256 512 64 a convolutional layer was finally utilized to provide an output matrix with a size of 256 512 the inputs were the q and wl values and the output was a matrix corresponding to the spatial distribution of water depths the filters and kernel sizes were set as 3 or 1 depending on the shape of the data and the padding type was set to be same for model training the adam optimization algorithm kingma ba 2014 was utilized a value of 0 001 was used as the default learning rate for the first 100 epochs and a value of 0 0001 was used for the last 500 epochs but the early stopping algorithm was enabled to save computational time the loss function was set to be the mean squared error and the batch size was set as 4 these hyperparameters were tuned using the validation data set the cnn model was built using python 3 9 software and the gpu version of the tensorflow package on a nvidia geforce rtx 3060 device 2 5 performance evaluation statistics the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and coefficient of correlation r2 were used as the primary performance indicators in this study to evaluate the performance of the models the equations for mae rmse and r2 can be written as 4 mae 1 n i 1 n h p h g 5 rmse 1 n σ i 1 n h p h g 2 6 r 2 n i 1 n h g h p i 1 n h g i 1 n h p i 1 n h g 2 i 1 n h g 2 i 1 n h p 2 i 1 n h p 2 2 where hg is the ground truth data here water depth hp is the predicted data and n is the number of data pairs 3 results 3 1 overall agreement the hydraulic model was employed to conduct 500 simulations in addition to the baseline case and 50 of them were used to establish the test dataset which served as an unseen dataset for testing the performance of the trained and validated model as mentioned earlier the comparably large dataset was prepared for detailed evaluations and method comparisons and the dl algorithm actually does not require such a large dataset the snapshots of the inundation maps in the test dataset are presented in fig 5 the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and determination coefficient r2 were employed to quantify the overall agreement between the ground truths and predictions the performance of the cnn approach was dependent on the dataset size a sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate how the dataset size influence the performance and the results are presented in fig 6 in the tests different numbers of samples among the 450 train validation samples were randomly selected to train and validate the model and the remaining 50 cases in the test data set were employed to quantify the performance in the first test only 5 maps were utilized as train and validation samples and the mae and rmse values were 0 795 m and 1 071 m respectively while the r2 value was 0 925 this is very impressive because it implies that the algorithm can provide reasonable predictions with only 5 train and validation samples a r2 value of 0 925 is also regarded as satisfactory in many practical applications in the second test the dataset size was increased to 10 and the model performance was significantly improved mae 0 438 m rmse 0 607 m and r2 0 969 generally an increase in dataset size tended to significantly improve the model performance until the number of train validation cases reached 30 when 30 cases were employed as train validation samples the mae rmse and r2 values were 0 058 m 0 106 m and 0 996 respectively indicating that the model performance was satisfactory exceeding this number the sensitivity of the results on the dataset size was less significant when the number of train validation cases exceeded 50 the overall performance of the model became nearly stable with very minor oscillations which were partially attributed to uncertainties the mae rmse and r2 values for the final model which was trained and validated by 450 cases were 0 048 m 0 090 m and 0 997 some other popular ml algorithms have also been tested including anfis svm gp mggp and 1d cnn it is expected that any of these ml algorithms could provide accurate predictions of water depths for a single cell using individual models especially when there are sufficient training data however the desired size of water depth matrix was 512 256 and it is impractical to develop 131 072 individual models therefore we attempted a new approach of using these ml technologies to study image like data and making predictions using single models to achieve this we first reshaped the matrix as a vector with only one column we then added the q wl and index for each water depth value and created a new matrix the ml algorithms used q wl and index as input variables and water depth as the output variable the developed model could predict the water depth corresponding to each index value for different cases and inundation maps can be reconstructed based on the index and water depth values table 1 summarized the error indices for each ml algorithm which were calculated based on the train and validation data points the epoch value in anfis was set as 200 the efficiency was very low as it took more than 48 h to complete the training and validation processes when the number of samples was set as 20 the svm algorithm kernel rbf from scikit learn in python was employed to develop svm based models an initial test failed to finish the training process in 24 h so finally the maximum number of iterations was set as 50 000 for gp two termination conditions were used either the generation number reaches 1000 or the time reaches 7200 s for each run the configuration for mggp was similar to gp but multiple genes were utilized and the process was also terminated when the time reached 7200 s for each run the performance indicators for anfis gp mggp and 1d cnn were similar while the svm algorithm exhibited the worst performance finally the proposed approach which was based on 2d cnn provided the best performance among all the tested ml algorithms compared to 1d cnn the proposed approach performed operations e g convolutional and downsampling in 2d and is thus advantageous in dealing with image like data we then performed tests with different numbers of cases respectively and the results reconfirmed that the proposed 2d cnn outperformed the other ml approaches it should be noted that the anfis algorithms failed to complete the training process in 48 h when the number of cases exceeded 20 so they were not further evaluated the reference ml algorithms all became unaffordable in terms of computational costs when the number of sample scenarios was large so they were not further tested with more samples 3 2 spatial patterns and bias fig 7 presents the water depth maps for a randomly selected scenario q 433 m3 s and wl 39 9 m hereafter referred to as q433wl39 9 provided by the cnn models trained with different numbers of cases generally the degree of distinction in the figures is not very obvious indicating that all of the cnn models reproduced the large scale spatial patterns of the maps very well and the algorithm was not very sensitive to the number of training samples however the model corresponding to the dataset size of 5 failed to capture some minor features such as the comparably deeper region along the southern edge of the study area with 15 train validation samples the two deeper regions near the left bank were much better reproduced but the thalweg located close to the right bank was still not well predicted both visual comparisons of the maps and the error indices indicated that the cnn model trained and validated by 25 images exhibited a good overall agreement the model was continuously improved with larger dataset sizes and the predicted results became satisfactory with a dataset size of 50 the final model which was trained and validated by 450 samples accurately predicted both the large scale and small scale spatial patterns showing excellent performance therefore the model can provide reasonable predictions with only 5 samples but can be further improved with the increase in the dataset size fig 8 presents the spatial distributions of flow depths for six sample cases both the ground truths and predictions made by the cnn trained and validated by 450 cases are shown in the figure the results show that the cnn almost perfectly reproduced the spatial patterns of flow inundation for different cases to evaluate the systematic errors we computed the bias between the predicted water depth and ground truth at each pixel location a matrix of bias for each case was calculated as the difference between the predicted matrix and the counterpart actual matrix fig 9 presents the mean of the bias for the spatial distribution of water depths as can be seen high errors primarily appeared at wet dry edges where there are sharp gradients however the cells with high errors were relatively few and even unnoticeable in the final maps therefore overall the cnn model consistently showed small values for mean of bias showing that the approach reproduced the spatial distribution of water depths very well 4 discussion 4 1 the field cruise case the proposed approach for rapid prediction of water depths in river systems based on cnns is believed promising the water depths measured by the field cruise were illustrated in fig 10 a the field data were not included in the train validation nor the test datasets and thus they were additional data that can be used to further evaluate the proposed approach fig 10 b and fig 10 e presents the spatial distribution of water depths provided by the hydraulic model which showed that the hydraulic model reproduced the spatial patterns observed in fig 10 a very well fig 10 c presents the measurements and predictions obtained by the hydraulic model the hydraulic model did not capture some extreme values or local anomalies in the field dataset partially because the dem data was not fine enough to incorporate some minor bathymetry features the length of the field data is 38 621 which is very long so fig 10 c cannot clearly indicate how the hydraulic model captured the major features as some oscillating data points significantly expanded the width of the plots therefore a moving average analysis which is typically used for time series time but has also been used for other types of data haining 1978 ver peterson 2010 was performed to quantify the performance of the hydraulic model in reproducing the overall data trend the moving average is believed to be capable of indicating how the hydraulic model captured the major features because it can filter out the high frequency noise corresponding to the local peaks valleys and scarps fig 10 c shows the results of a moving average analysis with a period of 20 and the mae rmse and r2 values were 0 189 m 0 260 m and 0 973 respectively therefore in general the agreement between measured and hydraulic data was satisfactory these comparisons demonstrated the satisfactory performance of the hydraulic model which in turn ensured the accuracy of the comprehensive hydraulic dataset however the computational time for the hydraulic model to complete a simulation on a single cpu computer was more than 50 min and thus it was not practical to directly employ the hydraulic model in real time water depth forecasting applications fig 10 f shows the inundation maps provided by the proposed cnn model which looked almost identical to that provided by the hydraulic model fig 10 e although it took effort to obtain such a model the obtained model can make accurate predictions in a few seconds therefore the proposed approach can effectively develop surrogate models for hydraulic models enabling feasible and rapid prediction of spatial distributions of water depths 4 2 comparison of different methods it is acknowledged that the traditional offline method was also possible with the availability of a comprehensive dataset however the proposed approach was significantly advantageous over the offline method for the following reasons 1 the proposed dl approach can provide predictions for arbitrary scenarios while the offline approach can only read the outcome of existing studies 2 the size of the files for the developed model and scripts in this study was only approximately 150 mb while the storage disk requirement of the offline method was nearly 28 gb 3 the transferability of the proposed approach could be continuously improved with more data from different river reaches while the outcome of an offline method is typically nontransferable to other reaches the anfis svm gp mggp and 1d cnn approaches may provide satisfactory predictions of water depths at control points using individual models however it is not practical to train a model at each of the cells and then merge the individual predictions to provide a spatial distribution map hosseiny et al 2020 employed an rf classification model to identify wet or dry nodes and then used a multi layer perceptron algorithm to predict the river depth in wet nodes the current study focuses on methods that can directly reproduce the water depth field without the necessity of determining if a node is wet or dry so it does not require an rf classification model it is believed that the current approach makes the practice of water depth prediction more convenient than that proposed by hosseiny et al 2020 because it can eliminate the process of determining if a node is wet or dry and it can directly provide the complete water depth field the comparisons with classical ml algorithms were made when different numbers of samples were utilized for training and validating models the anfis and algorithm failed to finalize the model training in 48 h two days when 20 cases were considered which was regarded as unacceptable so this algorithm was not considered further the termination condition for the mggp and gp programs were set to stop the evolutions when the training time reached 7200 s for each run the comparisons summarized in table 1 confirmed that the proposed approach outperformed the classical methods the computational time for different ml algorithms trained and validated using different numbers of samples was summarized in table 2 showing that none of the reference algorithms can outperform the proposed approach in accuracy and efficiency at the same time the reference ml algorithms became unaffordable in terms of computational costs when the number of sample scenarios exceeded 50 so they were not further tested with more samples the performance assessment of the different single model approaches may not be absolutely fair as each algorithm had their special configurations which could not be equally considered in other algorithms however it was quite obvious based on the assessment results that cnns outperformed anfis svm gp mggp and 1d cnn in terms of both computational costs and accuracy a primary reason for this outcome is that the convolution layers can better extract local patterns and the downsampling layers can better reduce the data resolution while maintaining the major features this study converted the image like data into 1d data when evaluating the performance of the benchmark methods this operation was adopted for the following two reasons 1 the benchmark ml algorithms cannot directly read image like data and thus it is necessary to convert the data into the data format of vectorized arrays and 2 the conversion did not add or delete any data of water depth i e only changed their shape so the risk of uncertainty during the conversion has been well eliminated 4 3 limitations and future studies the cnn based models can provide efficient predictions of spatial distributions of water depths based on the knowledge learned from the hydraulic data a potential error source is the architecture and parameters of the dl algorithm it is commonly known that the dl technique is developing very quickly and an advance in the technique can significantly improve the performance of the approach although the results shown in this study have demonstrated the remarkable performance of the proposed algorithm it deserves further study to check if recent variants of dl techniques can provide better performance a downside of the proposed approach is that the training of cnn models requires expertise in both numerical modeling and ml technologies however after the model has been developed it can be readily utilized and provide rapid predictions for water depth forecasting application the sample scenarios considered in this study were selected primarily because they are close to the baseline case and thus the developed dl model is expected to be valid only in this range this study focuses on proposing and evaluating the approaches and developing the baseline models and future studies can be done to further extend the surrogate model with data in broader ranges of flood conditions similar to previous studies on rapid modeling of water depths in rivers hosseiny et al 2020 kabir et al 2020 the present work did not consider the other influencing factors such as the wind speed evaporation and air temperature it is acknowledged that future studies should be conducted to incorporate these factors to further improve the predictions for future studies it is also suggested to extend the training dataset and increase the transfer capability of the model for modeling the water depth fields in more reaches 5 conclusions the present study proposed a novel dl approach for rapid prediction of spatial distributions of water depths using 2d cnn a comprehensive dataset was established based on a field cruise and 2d hydraulic simulations for different scenarios the hydraulic dataset was split into different datasets to train validate and test the models the proposed approach has been demonstrated to be capable of predicting spatial distribution of water depths with high accuracies it was impressive that the cnn model trained and validated by only a few images could provide reasonable predictions compared to other classic ml algorithms such as anfis svm gp mggp and 1d cnn the proposed cnn exhibited better performance primarily because the cnn utilized convolutional and downsampling operations to better extract the major patterns in an image and eliminate unnecessary computational costs the final cnn based model can predict both large scale and small scale spatial patterns of the spatial distributions of water depths fairly well the major bias mainly showed at wet dry edges but the cells with high errors were relatively few and even unnoticeable in the final maps overall cnns trained with a numerical dataset can be employed to provide water depth maps for various scenarios in the future the dataset could be further extended to incorporate more data primarily for different river reaches to increase the generalization capability of the models this study utilized numerical results obtained from a 2d hydraulic model as the data for developing and evaluating dl models and it is suggested to train models using field data when spatiotemporally dense measurements are available furthermore it deserves further study to check if recent variants of dl techniques can provide better performance and to extend the training dataset and increase the transfer capability of the model for modeling the

2553,rapid prediction of spatially distributed hydrological variables such as water depths in rivers is an important but challenging task this study proposes a novel matrix based deep learning approach for predicting spatial distribution of water depths in rivers the proposed approach was constructed based on a two dimensional 2d convolutional neural network cnn with a new architecture that was specifically designed for providing spatial distribution maps a numerical dataset was established based on a field cruise and two dimensional hydraulic modeling for different scenarios and numerical experiments were designed to predict spatial distribution of water depths for different scenarios using the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis support vector machine svm genetic programming gp multi gene genetic programming mggp one dimensional cnn 1d cnn and the proposed cnn algorithms the results showed that the proposed cnn approach captured both the large scale and small scale spatial patterns remarkably well and it outperformed the other approaches this study shows that the 2d cnn algorithm is better than the classical machine learning ml algorithms for inundation modeling the proposed approach is thus a promising tool for providing rapid predictions of spatial distribution of water depths in river systems and can potentially be leveraged to predict other spatially distributed hydrological variables keywords deep learning convolutional neural network water depth spatial distribution surrogate modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction predicting complex hydrological processes is a challenging task and requires extensive measurements recent advances in remote sensing technology along with increasing utilization of embedded sensors have made it possible to obtain detailed data which in turn has provided a better understanding of hydrological systems kabir et al 2020 however some important spatially distributed variables such as spatial distribution of water depths in rivers are still difficult to measure and predict mathematical models can provide complete datasets with relatively low costs but they are subject to disadvantages inaccuracy high computational demand and large disk storage space bhola et al 2018 the practice of hydrological forecasts can be improved by developing mathematical representations that can better describe the underlying physical mechanics and by proposing novel technologies that can readily produce accurate predictions and transfer the information to the real world as stated by kreyenberg et al 2019 the advances in modern artificial intelligence especially deep learning dl algorithms along with the increasing amount of good quality data provide a new avenue of achieving these purposes to propose and evaluate the performance of novel approaches we focus on a relatively simple test case water depth modeling in a regulated river system where a field cruise has been taken and detailed data of water depth distribution have been collected water depth forecasting in regulated river systems is an important component in traditional water management e g flood management practice and is also a key process for developing automatic flood control technologies delgoda et al 2013 floods often lead to serious social economic and environmental issues and thus reservoirs and hydraulic infrastructures have been widely constructed to control floods chu et al 2020 previous flow control decisions were primarily made by river managers based on engineering experience and comparably simple hydrological methods however automatic control is becoming popular nowadays and has been widely utilized for managing hydro power river navigation and water quality ming et al 2020 li et al 2020 it is necessary to provide accurate and rapid predictions of resultant flow characteristics for different control strategies to optimize automatic flow control schemes it has been demonstrated that better water depth predictions can significantly improve the performance of automatic flood control which can achieve a lower peak volume level a shorter period for emptying excess water and less waste of storage water resources burn et al 2016 water depth forecasting can be performed using various approaches river flow characteristics are only sparsely monitored in most regions and thus it is a common practice to employ hydrological or hydraulic models to forecast spatial distribution of water depths de paiva et al 2013 hydrological models such as those based on the flood connected domain algorithm and those based on the bulk approach largely rely on extensive calibrations rather than strict physical representations therefore their performance is often unacceptable for extreme flows in ungauged catchments and in areas with steep elevation gradients unduche et al 2018 ming et al 2020 li et al 2020 hydraulic modeling which maintains strict momentum conservation is another choice for investigating hydrological processes yan et al 2020a b two dimensional 2d hydraulic models are physically based models and are very suitable for shallow water conditions e g rivers so they have been widely employed to study flow dynamics in rivers teng et al 2017 ming et al 2021 however 2d hydraulics simulations are computationally expensive limiting their applications in relatively large areas and real time forecasting kabir et al 2020 recent advances in parallel computing techniques and graphics processing units gpus can significantly reduce the computational time for a single model run neal et al 2016 wang et al 2021 bai et al 2021 but using 2d hydraulic models to simulate different scenarios is still not practical for real time forecasting applications the offline approach which prepares pre run inundation maps for different flowrates is commonly utilized for flood forecasting leedal et al 2010 bhola et al 2018 however this approach requires a large disk storage space and is impractical for water depth forecasting in regulated river systems because the hydrodynamics in these systems are also affected by the water control strategies in addition to the discharges a promising alternative method for predicting sophisticated hydrological processes is to use machine learning ml algorithms especially deep learning algorithms hu et al 2018 xie et al 2021 hou et al 2021 these algorithms have been demonstrated to be capable of learning the underlying physical processes figuring out deeply hidden relationships between features and output variables and developing surrogate models for physically based models yan et al 2021a advances in ml have made a significant contribution to the field of hydrology and water resources research examples of successful applications include evapotranspiration estimation climate downscaling and flowrate forecasting wang et al 2021 bai et al 2021 ferreira et al 2022 however the applications of ml in water depth forecasting are still in their infancy several researchers have developed ml models for water depth forecasting for example chang et al 2014 proposed a hybrid self organizing map and recurrent nonlinear autoregressive exogenous som r narx approach for nowcasting regional flood inundation maps using extensive data in a 270 km2 region and the study demonstrated that the proposed methodology was promising in forecasting 2d inundation maps however there is a lack of sufficient measured data in most regions so hybrid hydraulic ml approaches have been proposed in recent years for flood inundation predictions in these approaches ml based models are trained using the outputs of a hydraulic model and ml based models are then employed as surrogate models to make predictions bermúdez et al 2019 employed the support vector machine svm algorithm to develop a surrogate of the 2d shallow water equations and their study demonstrated that the model is accurate and computationally efficient in computing flood inundation hosseiny et al 2020 trained a random forest rf model and an artificial neural networks ann model using the outputs of a calibrated hydraulic model iric for a segment of the green river the study demonstrated that the ml models can accurately emulate the outcomes of the hydraulic model and provide rapid predictions hou et al 2021 established ml based urban flood inundation models for a part of fengxi new town using hydrodynamic results and the study showed that combining the rf and k nearest neighbor knn algorithms can effectively improve the performance of the standalone algorithms yan et al 2021b coupled the personal computer storm water management model pcswmm and neural networks for flood inundation in a drainage area in tianjin municipality china the study showed that the proposed approach can provide flood inundation predictions in high risk areas in cities in a fast and accurate manner the majority of the existing studies that adopted traditional machine learning techniques for river depth forecasting trained an individual model for each of the cells or nodes which was not practical for a relatively large region e g bermúdez et al 2019 hosseiny et al 2020 recently kabir et al 2020 proposed a method for predicting fluvial flood inundation using a one dimensional convolutional neural network 1d cnn algorithm in their study a 1d cnn model for the urbanized area of carlisle was trained using the outputs of a hydraulic model i e flood fp and the research showed that the proposed approach can provide fast and accurate predictions for the entire domain at one time yan et al 2021c proposed a new approach that combined a hydraulic model telemac and multi gene genetic programming mggp for predicting the spatial distribution of flow depths in their study the coordinates of the cells were incorporated as additional input variables for the ml model and the approach was shown to be capable of directly providing accurate inundation maps however we should bear in mind that the existing studies did not consider the influence of water control while many rivers are regulated and the river operators need information on the consequences of different control strategies to make proper decisions to take this influence into account it is necessary to consider more scenarios which in turn leads to a higher efficiency requirement for the employed approach in summary a review of the above studies highlights the following gaps in the literature 1 most of the existing studies on the prediction of spatial distribution of water depths utilized or focused on classical observational hydrological and hydraulic approaches leedal et al 2010 de paiva et al 2013 neal et al 2018 bhola et al 2018 unduche et al 2018 ming et al 2020 li et al 2020 yan et al 2020a 2020b bai et al 2021 wang et al 2021 and applications of ml in water depth forecasting are still in their infancy and require further investigation 2 the majority of the existing ml based studies trained an individual model for each of the cells or nodes chang et al 2014 bermúdez et al 2019 hosseiny et al 2020 kabir et al 2020 hou et al 2021 yan et al 2021b yan et al 2021c and to the best of the authors knowledge no one has published the use of a 2d cnn for surrogate modeling of spatial distributions of river depths and 3 the performance of a 2d cnn based model compared with classical ml algorithms in water depth forecasting has not been assessed in the literature the present study is aimed at exploring the predictions of spatially distributed hydrological variables using simulated image like data and modern image based deep learning algorithms to achieve successful predictions we need to 1 ensure that the physically based model and thus the hydraulic data can accurately represent the underlying hydrological processes and 2 convert all the data into the same image like structure in this study we focused on water depth forecasting in regulated river systems as an example so a hydraulic model was adopted as the physically based model and 2d matrices of spatially distributed water depths were employed as the image like data the influence of river operation was represented by the downstream water level condition firstly we generated a comprehensive dataset containing water depth data for different scenarios through 2d numerical experiments and the dataset was randomly split into training validation and test datasets in the next step we trained a 2d cnn that can directly predict water depth fields using the training data the trained cnn was then utilized to provide the water depth fields for the testing cases and an additional case with field measurements to evaluate the generalization capability of the approach we have also compared the performance of the proposed 2d cnn and traditional ml algorithms including adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis svm genetic programming gp mggp and 1d cnn the proposed approach enables the cnn to learn the physical processes from the hydraulic image like data and to predict spatially distributed hydrological variables it provides an alternative avenue for rapid water depth forecasting unlike traditional offline methods the proposed approach represents the numerical data using mathematical models that can provide outputs in seconds therefore it eliminates the requirement of a large database and is able to make predictions for arbitrary scenarios unlike the previous studies that attempted water depth forecasting using ml algorithms chu et al 2020 lei et al 2021 xie et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 the present study employed the 2d cnn algorithm that can directly learn from 2d data and provide predictions of the entire fields of water depths in this way the proposed approach takes full advantage of cnn algorithms in dealing with image like data with traditional ml algorithms incorporating an additional feature variable e g downstream water level would significantly increase the required amount of data which in turn leads to high cost and low efficiency however the 2d cnn algorithm which is one of the best ml algorithms in image processing eltner et al 2021 pan et al 2019 wang et al 2021 can effectively reduce the dataset size while retaining the original image features eltner et al 2021 pan et al 2019 wang et al 2021 therefore the proposed approach is expected to provide better performance 2 methodology fig 1 presents the technical flowchart to refine the realization process of the research and the main technical steps involved in this study 2 1 study area cruise surveys and field data in this work a segment of the ottawa river was selected as the study area and the field data were collected during a field cruise conducted by the research group at the university of ottawa the ottawa river which extends from east of the dozois reservoir to the st laurence river is 1 271 km long with a drainage area of 146 300 km2 approximately 35 of its length is located in the province of ontario and the rest in the province of quebec canada the river is regulated by the mississippi valley conservation authority rideau valley conservation authority and south nation conservation in this study an approximately 3 2 km segment of the ottawa river fig 2 was used as the case study the left bank of the study domain is entirely within the boundary of the city of gatineau quebec and the right bank is within the city of ottawa ontario it is immediately downstream of the island île kettle and upstream of mclaurin bay there are numerous dams in the watershed and preliminary studies showed that the flow characteristics in the study domain are primarily governed by the pointe fortune dam which is in the vicinity of voyageur provincial park a field cruise was conducted by the research group at the university of ottawa in the study domain on july 24 2012 the water depths were measured using an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp the digital elevation model dem was established using the samples provided by the city of ottawa based on the canadian hydrographic services chart and hydrographic surveys with knudsen echosounder 320b and garmin gpsmap76 series the raw collected data were in the geographic coordinate system and we transformed them into the projected coordinate system wgs 1984 web mercator auxiliary sphere 2 2 physical representation fluid flow in shallow water bodies is governed by the shallow water equations also known as the saint venant s equations which can be expressed as hervouet 2007 yan et al 2021 continuity 1 h t u h h d i v u s h momentum along x 2 u t u v g z x s x 1 h d i v h ν t u momentum

and y horizontal space coordinates sh source or sink of fluid sx and sy momentum source terms including bottom friction surface wind shear and source sink of momentum in the domain 2 3 numerical experiments to model the flow characteristics represented by the governing equations we employed the open source numerical model telemac mascaret telemac mascaret was initially developed by the national hydraulics and environment laboratory of the french electricity board and its 2d version solves the depth averaged free surface flow equations the computational domain was configured to be larger than the actual area of interest which was a good practice to avoid the impacts of boundary condition imperfections the computational domain was discretized by a 2d finite element triangular unstructured mesh and the grid resolution was determined based on a mesh sensitivity analysis number of elements 56 580 for boundary conditions the flowrates q were specified at the upstream boundary cross section and the water levels wl were given at the downstream boundary cross section unlike previous water depth simulations in which the water levels at the downstream boundary were calculated or modelled the present study directly assigned certain values to the downstream boundary to model the influence of river regulations e g regulations using inverted siphons weirs and sluice gates the roughness coefficient manning coefficient was 0 03 which was initially estimated from aerial photos and field inspections and confirmed by model calibrations the numerical model was employed to generate a comprehensive training validation data set and a test data set to ensure the accuracy of the hydraulic dataset the numerical model was validated against the field cruise data before being used to carry out the numerical computations the comparisons between the measured data and numerical predictions demonstrated the satisfactory performance of the numerical model which in turn ensured the accuracy of the dataset more details with respect to the confidence in the accuracy of the results will be discussed in more detail in section 4 each data set contains a number of csv files indicating the spatial distributions of water depths for different scenarios the numerical experiments were performed using the windows 10 operating system on a desktop with a 3 80 ghz amd ryzen 7 5800x 8 core processor the dl approach does not require the consideration of many different scenarios this study will demonstrate that the proposed approach can provide reasonable predictions with only 5 samples but it is better to prepare a large dataset for detailed evaluations and method comparisons the data sets were generated considering 500 different scenarios 50 different q values and 10 different wl values for each q value the q values were approximately equally spaced ranging from 300 m3 s to 800 m3 s assuring that the median q close to the baseline case measured by the field cruise q 554 5 m3 s the wl values ranged from 35 1 m in the case q 300 m3 s to 44 73 m in the case q 800 m3 s the wl values for each q were generally designed to provide some values higher than the corresponding normal depths as well as some other values lower than the corresponding normal depths these scenarios were modelled by individual simulations the outputs of these simulations were post processed to generate 2d matrices that show the spatial distributions of water depths the post processing was primarily performed using the software bluekenue and matlab these matrices were further utilized to train validate and test dl based models the train validation data set contains 90 of the samples and the validation split factor was set as 0 1 namely 10 of the cases in this data set were employed for model validation the remaining 10 of the cases were selected and used as unseen data to test the performance of the dl based model there were 50 cases named as t01 t50 used for generating the test dataset and one wl was randomly selected for each q fig 3 the selected dataset size was believed appropriate for the current exploratory case a smaller dataset would not provide satisfactory performance and a larger dataset would require more computational resources 2 4 convolutional neural networks cnns the cnn we designed for water depth modeling is illustrated in fig 4 the designed architecture is quite different from existing architectures primarily because water depth mapping is not a typical image analysis task and the current network is believed to be more suitable and convenient for water depth mapping the model used q and wl as inputs and water depth matrices as output it first reads the nondimensionalized q and wl values with an initial data length of 2 and converts them into an image like matrix through a few dense activation and reshape layers then two branches were designed one performs upsampling using a convolutional layer and the other one uses activation and convolutional layers for upsampling the network then employs an add layer to produce a single tensor with dimension of 64 128 16 and generates a 128 256 16 tensor using an activation and upsampling layer four similar blocks with this two branch structure were stacked to create a tensor with dimensions of 256 512 64 a convolutional layer was finally utilized to provide an output matrix with a size of 256 512 the inputs were the q and wl values and the output was a matrix corresponding to the spatial distribution of water depths the filters and kernel sizes were set as 3 or 1 depending on the shape of the data and the padding type was set to be same for model training the adam optimization algorithm kingma ba 2014 was utilized a value of 0 001 was used as the default learning rate for the first 100 epochs and a value of 0 0001 was used for the last 500 epochs but the early stopping algorithm was enabled to save computational time the loss function was set to be the mean squared error and the batch size was set as 4 these hyperparameters were tuned using the validation data set the cnn model was built using python 3 9 software and the gpu version of the tensorflow package on a nvidia geforce rtx 3060 device 2 5 performance evaluation statistics the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and coefficient of correlation r2 were used as the primary performance indicators in this study to evaluate the performance of the models the equations for mae rmse and r2 can be written as 4 mae 1 n i 1 n h p h g 5 rmse 1 n σ i 1 n h p h g 2 6 r 2 n i 1 n h g h p i 1 n h g i 1 n h p i 1 n h g 2 i 1 n h g 2 i 1 n h p 2 i 1 n h p 2 2 where hg is the ground truth data here water depth hp is the predicted data and n is the number of data pairs 3 results 3 1 overall agreement the hydraulic model was employed to conduct 500 simulations in addition to the baseline case and 50 of them were used to establish the test dataset which served as an unseen dataset for testing the performance of the trained and validated model as mentioned earlier the comparably large dataset was prepared for detailed evaluations and method comparisons and the dl algorithm actually does not require such a large dataset the snapshots of the inundation maps in the test dataset are presented in fig 5 the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and determination coefficient r2 were employed to quantify the overall agreement between the ground truths and predictions the performance of the cnn approach was dependent on the dataset size a sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate how the dataset size influence the performance and the results are presented in fig 6 in the tests different numbers of samples among the 450 train validation samples were randomly selected to train and validate the model and the remaining 50 cases in the test data set were employed to quantify the performance in the first test only 5 maps were utilized as train and validation samples and the mae and rmse values were 0 795 m and 1 071 m respectively while the r2 value was 0 925 this is very impressive because it implies that the algorithm can provide reasonable predictions with only 5 train and validation samples a r2 value of 0 925 is also regarded as satisfactory in many practical applications in the second test the dataset size was increased to 10 and the model performance was significantly improved mae 0 438 m rmse 0 607 m and r2 0 969 generally an increase in dataset size tended to significantly improve the model performance until the number of train validation cases reached 30 when 30 cases were employed as train validation samples the mae rmse and r2 values were 0 058 m 0 106 m and 0 996 respectively indicating that the model performance was satisfactory exceeding this number the sensitivity of the results on the dataset size was less significant when the number of train validation cases exceeded 50 the overall performance of the model became nearly stable with very minor oscillations which were partially attributed to uncertainties the mae rmse and r2 values for the final model which was trained and validated by 450 cases were 0 048 m 0 090 m and 0 997 some other popular ml algorithms have also been tested including anfis svm gp mggp and 1d cnn it is expected that any of these ml algorithms could provide accurate predictions of water depths for a single cell using individual models especially when there are sufficient training data however the desired size of water depth matrix was 512 256 and it is impractical to develop 131 072 individual models therefore we attempted a new approach of using these ml technologies to study image like data and making predictions using single models to achieve this we first reshaped the matrix as a vector with only one column we then added the q wl and index for each water depth value and created a new matrix the ml algorithms used q wl and index as input variables and water depth as the output variable the developed model could predict the water depth corresponding to each index value for different cases and inundation maps can be reconstructed based on the index and water depth values table 1 summarized the error indices for each ml algorithm which were calculated based on the train and validation data points the epoch value in anfis was set as 200 the efficiency was very low as it took more than 48 h to complete the training and validation processes when the number of samples was set as 20 the svm algorithm kernel rbf from scikit learn in python was employed to develop svm based models an initial test failed to finish the training process in 24 h so finally the maximum number of iterations was set as 50 000 for gp two termination conditions were used either the generation number reaches 1000 or the time reaches 7200 s for each run the configuration for mggp was similar to gp but multiple genes were utilized and the process was also terminated when the time reached 7200 s for each run the performance indicators for anfis gp mggp and 1d cnn were similar while the svm algorithm exhibited the worst performance finally the proposed approach which was based on 2d cnn provided the best performance among all the tested ml algorithms compared to 1d cnn the proposed approach performed operations e g convolutional and downsampling in 2d and is thus advantageous in dealing with image like data we then performed tests with different numbers of cases respectively and the results reconfirmed that the proposed 2d cnn outperformed the other ml approaches it should be noted that the anfis algorithms failed to complete the training process in 48 h when the number of cases exceeded 20 so they were not further evaluated the reference ml algorithms all became unaffordable in terms of computational costs when the number of sample scenarios was large so they were not further tested with more samples 3 2 spatial patterns and bias fig 7 presents the water depth maps for a randomly selected scenario q 433 m3 s and wl 39 9 m hereafter referred to as q433wl39 9 provided by the cnn models trained with different numbers of cases generally the degree of distinction in the figures is not very obvious indicating that all of the cnn models reproduced the large scale spatial patterns of the maps very well and the algorithm was not very sensitive to the number of training samples however the model corresponding to the dataset size of 5 failed to capture some minor features such as the comparably deeper region along the southern edge of the study area with 15 train validation samples the two deeper regions near the left bank were much better reproduced but the thalweg located close to the right bank was still not well predicted both visual comparisons of the maps and the error indices indicated that the cnn model trained and validated by 25 images exhibited a good overall agreement the model was continuously improved with larger dataset sizes and the predicted results became satisfactory with a dataset size of 50 the final model which was trained and validated by 450 samples accurately predicted both the large scale and small scale spatial patterns showing excellent performance therefore the model can provide reasonable predictions with only 5 samples but can be further improved with the increase in the dataset size fig 8 presents the spatial distributions of flow depths for six sample cases both the ground truths and predictions made by the cnn trained and validated by 450 cases are shown in the figure the results show that the cnn almost perfectly reproduced the spatial patterns of flow inundation for different cases to evaluate the systematic errors we computed the bias between the predicted water depth and ground truth at each pixel location a matrix of bias for each case was calculated as the difference between the predicted matrix and the counterpart actual matrix fig 9 presents the mean of the bias for the spatial distribution of water depths as can be seen high errors primarily appeared at wet dry edges where there are sharp gradients however the cells with high errors were relatively few and even unnoticeable in the final maps therefore overall the cnn model consistently showed small values for mean of bias showing that the approach reproduced the spatial distribution of water depths very well 4 discussion 4 1 the field cruise case the proposed approach for rapid prediction of water depths in river systems based on cnns is believed promising the water depths measured by the field cruise were illustrated in fig 10 a the field data were not included in the train validation nor the test datasets and thus they were additional data that can be used to further evaluate the proposed approach fig 10 b and fig 10 e presents the spatial distribution of water depths provided by the hydraulic model which showed that the hydraulic model reproduced the spatial patterns observed in fig 10 a very well fig 10 c presents the measurements and predictions obtained by the hydraulic model the hydraulic model did not capture some extreme values or local anomalies in the field dataset partially because the dem data was not fine enough to incorporate some minor bathymetry features the length of the field data is 38 621 which is very long so fig 10 c cannot clearly indicate how the hydraulic model captured the major features as some oscillating data points significantly expanded the width of the plots therefore a moving average analysis which is typically used for time series time but has also been used for other types of data haining 1978 ver peterson 2010 was performed to quantify the performance of the hydraulic model in reproducing the overall data trend the moving average is believed to be capable of indicating how the hydraulic model captured the major features because it can filter out the high frequency noise corresponding to the local peaks valleys and scarps fig 10 c shows the results of a moving average analysis with a period of 20 and the mae rmse and r2 values were 0 189 m 0 260 m and 0 973 respectively therefore in general the agreement between measured and hydraulic data was satisfactory these comparisons demonstrated the satisfactory performance of the hydraulic model which in turn ensured the accuracy of the comprehensive hydraulic dataset however the computational time for the hydraulic model to complete a simulation on a single cpu computer was more than 50 min and thus it was not practical to directly employ the hydraulic model in real time water depth forecasting applications fig 10 f shows the inundation maps provided by the proposed cnn model which looked almost identical to that provided by the hydraulic model fig 10 e although it took effort to obtain such a model the obtained model can make accurate predictions in a few seconds therefore the proposed approach can effectively develop surrogate models for hydraulic models enabling feasible and rapid prediction of spatial distributions of water depths 4 2 comparison of different methods it is acknowledged that the traditional offline method was also possible with the availability of a comprehensive dataset however the proposed approach was significantly advantageous over the offline method for the following reasons 1 the proposed dl approach can provide predictions for arbitrary scenarios while the offline approach can only read the outcome of existing studies 2 the size of the files for the developed model and scripts in this study was only approximately 150 mb while the storage disk requirement of the offline method was nearly 28 gb 3 the transferability of the proposed approach could be continuously improved with more data from different river reaches while the outcome of an offline method is typically nontransferable to other reaches the anfis svm gp mggp and 1d cnn approaches may provide satisfactory predictions of water depths at control points using individual models however it is not practical to train a model at each of the cells and then merge the individual predictions to provide a spatial distribution map hosseiny et al 2020 employed an rf classification model to identify wet or dry nodes and then used a multi layer perceptron algorithm to predict the river depth in wet nodes the current study focuses on methods that can directly reproduce the water depth field without the necessity of determining if a node is wet or dry so it does not require an rf classification model it is believed that the current approach makes the practice of water depth prediction more convenient than that proposed by hosseiny et al 2020 because it can eliminate the process of determining if a node is wet or dry and it can directly provide the complete water depth field the comparisons with classical ml algorithms were made when different numbers of samples were utilized for training and validating models the anfis and algorithm failed to finalize the model training in 48 h two days when 20 cases were considered which was regarded as unacceptable so this algorithm was not considered further the termination condition for the mggp and gp programs were set to stop the evolutions when the training time reached 7200 s for each run the comparisons summarized in table 1 confirmed that the proposed approach outperformed the classical methods the computational time for different ml algorithms trained and validated using different numbers of samples was summarized in table 2 showing that none of the reference algorithms can outperform the proposed approach in accuracy and efficiency at the same time the reference ml algorithms became unaffordable in terms of computational costs when the number of sample scenarios exceeded 50 so they were not further tested with more samples the performance assessment of the different single model approaches may not be absolutely fair as each algorithm had their special configurations which could not be equally considered in other algorithms however it was quite obvious based on the assessment results that cnns outperformed anfis svm gp mggp and 1d cnn in terms of both computational costs and accuracy a primary reason for this outcome is that the convolution layers can better extract local patterns and the downsampling layers can better reduce the data resolution while maintaining the major features this study converted the image like data into 1d data when evaluating the performance of the benchmark methods this operation was adopted for the following two reasons 1 the benchmark ml algorithms cannot directly read image like data and thus it is necessary to convert the data into the data format of vectorized arrays and 2 the conversion did not add or delete any data of water depth i e only changed their shape so the risk of uncertainty during the conversion has been well eliminated 4 3 limitations and future studies the cnn based models can provide efficient predictions of spatial distributions of water depths based on the knowledge learned from the hydraulic data a potential error source is the architecture and parameters of the dl algorithm it is commonly known that the dl technique is developing very quickly and an advance in the technique can significantly improve the performance of the approach although the results shown in this study have demonstrated the remarkable performance of the proposed algorithm it deserves further study to check if recent variants of dl techniques can provide better performance a downside of the proposed approach is that the training of cnn models requires expertise in both numerical modeling and ml technologies however after the model has been developed it can be readily utilized and provide rapid predictions for water depth forecasting application the sample scenarios considered in this study were selected primarily because they are close to the baseline case and thus the developed dl model is expected to be valid only in this range this study focuses on proposing and evaluating the approaches and developing the baseline models and future studies can be done to further extend the surrogate model with data in broader ranges of flood conditions similar to previous studies on rapid modeling of water depths in rivers hosseiny et al 2020 kabir et al 2020 the present work did not consider the other influencing factors such as the wind speed evaporation and air temperature it is acknowledged that future studies should be conducted to incorporate these factors to further improve the predictions for future studies it is also suggested to extend the training dataset and increase the transfer capability of the model for modeling the water depth fields in more reaches 5 conclusions the present study proposed a novel dl approach for rapid prediction of spatial distributions of water depths using 2d cnn a comprehensive dataset was established based on a field cruise and 2d hydraulic simulations for different scenarios the hydraulic dataset was split into different datasets to train validate and test the models the proposed approach has been demonstrated to be capable of predicting spatial distribution of water depths with high accuracies it was impressive that the cnn model trained and validated by only a few images could provide reasonable predictions compared to other classic ml algorithms such as anfis svm gp mggp and 1d cnn the proposed cnn exhibited better performance primarily because the cnn utilized convolutional and downsampling operations to better extract the major patterns in an image and eliminate unnecessary computational costs the final cnn based model can predict both large scale and small scale spatial patterns of the spatial distributions of water depths fairly well the major bias mainly showed at wet dry edges but the cells with high errors were relatively few and even unnoticeable in the final maps overall cnns trained with a numerical dataset can be employed to provide water depth maps for various scenarios in the future the dataset could be further extended to incorporate more data primarily for different river reaches to increase the generalization capability of the models this study utilized numerical results obtained from a 2d hydraulic model as the data for developing and evaluating dl models and it is suggested to train models using field data when spatiotemporally dense measurements are available furthermore it deserves further study to check if recent variants of dl techniques can provide better performance and to extend the training dataset and increase the transfer capability of the model for modeling the

2554,seasonal rainfall locally known as plum rain is a potentially important driver of greenhouse gas dynamics in saltmarshes but no studies of its effects have been reported we quantified porewater exchange and related greenhouse gas fluxes in a saltmarsh over a spring neap spring tidal cycle 30 tidal cycles during the plum rain season radon traced porewater exchange rates were found to be 15 5 pre rain and 24 8 plum rain cm day 1 which released co2 and ch4 to surface waters with the fluxes mmol m 2 day 1 of 77 7 and 0 28 during the pre rain period and 132 3 and 0 63 over the plum rain period respectively the large amounts of soil co2 export through porewater exchange during the plum rain significantly increased the co2 inventory and reduced the ph from 8 06 to 7 86 median in saltmarsh surface water the result suggests that plum rain derived porewater exchange with lower ph values may contribute to coastal acidification keywords porewater exchange rainfall tidal pumping blue carbon greenhouse gas emissions coastal acidification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction saltmarshes are global hotspots for climate change mitigation because they sequester large amounts of atmospheric co2 in sediments mcleod et al 2011 serrano et al 2019 wang et al 2021 as an important blue carbon system saltmarshes have high rates of net primary production and carbon burial which can export particulate and dissolved carbon to the coastal ocean and release greenhouse gases e g co2 and ch4 to the atmosphere chen et al 2022 xin et al 2022 zhu et al 2022 the carbon export from coastal wetlands is largely driven by tidal pumping xin et al 2009 chen et al 2021a xiao et al 2021 yau et al 2022 despite the increasing interest in saltmarsh carbon assessments in the context of global climate change and blue carbon e g ouyang et al 2017 alongi 2020 liu et al 2021 there are still great uncertainties in determining saltmarsh greenhouse gas pathways especially the greenhouse gas fluxes through porewater exchange which is difficult to measure and estimate due to high heterogeneity and dynamic drivers in saltmarshes yet the patterns and drivers of greenhouse gas effluxes are important for understanding how porewater exchange affects greenhouse gas emissions in saltmarshes santos et al 2019 trifunovic et al 2020 previous studies related to drivers of greenhouse gas effluxes in saltmarshes have focused on tidal flushing and bioturbation such as crab burrowing e g santos et al 2019 xiao et al 2021 chen et al 2022 in addition to tidal pumping rainfall may also be an important driver of greenhouse gas dynamics in coastal wetlands as it can increase groundwater flow and related large co2 flux call et al 2019a chen et al 2021a rainfall events can modify carbon biogeochemistry and mixing and alter their fluxes to the coastal ocean in mangroves reithmaier et al 2021 the middle lower reaches of yangtze river have a continuously rainy weather from late spring to early summer which is called the plum rain season however to our knowledge no studies on porewater exchange and greenhouse gas fluxes in saltmarshes driven by rainfall have been reported plum rain presents an ideal opportunity to study the effects of rainfall thus it is imperative to quantify the porewater exchange and greenhouse gas fluxes under the influence of plum rain here we hypothesize that seasonal rainfall can strongly influence porewater exchange and related greenhouse gas fluxes in saltmarshes we conducted high resolution time series measurements over 30 semi diurnal tidal cycles during the plum rain season to analyze the 222rn a natural porewater tracer co2 and ch4 concentrations in surface water from a chinese saltmarsh creek the study aims to 1 characterize the temporal distributions of co2 and ch4 under the combined influence of tidal oscillations and plum rain 2 quantify the major co2 and ch4 pathways i e porewater exchange water atmosphere exchange and outwelling using detailed time series measurements of 222rn co2 and ch4 during the plum rain season 3 examine the relative importance of plum rain in affecting porewater exchange and associated co2 and ch4 effluxes and 4 evaluate the effect of plum rain on the buffer potential of coastal acidification in saltmarshes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area field investigations were carried out in a tidal creek surrounded by saltmarsh vegetation spartina alterniflora in yancheng city jiangsu province china fig 1a the coastal wetland of yancheng is a typical muddy tidal flat in china with low permeability sediments and high crab burrow density it hosts well developed saltmarsh vegetations and abundant animal resources gao et al 2014 the location has a subtropical and warm temperate climate with a mean annual air temperature of 14 4 c and a mean annual precipitation of 1067 mm http www chinaports com the precipitation during the plum rain period is relatively concentrated accounting for 40 50 of the total precipitation in the wet season fig 1b tides are regular and semidiurnal with a mean tidal range of 3 6 m and a maximum of 5 5 m http www chinaports com earlier investigation in our study site focused on porewater exchange at different tidal scales i e semidiurnal and spring neap time scales to explain the carbon outwelling to the ocean chen et al 2022 here we build on the earlier investigation by performing high resolution time series measurements over 30 semi diurnal tidal cycles during the plum rain season focusing on how continuous rainfall drives greenhouse gas dynamics 2 2 field sampling and measurements surface water sampling was performed from june 24 to july 10 2021 at downstream site which is located at the creek mouth fig 1a water samples 2 l water n 385 were collected for 222rn and greenhouse gas co2 and ch4 measurements using a peristaltic pump at 1 h interval for 16 days 30 tidal cycles covering the pre rain and plum rain periods fig 2 and analyzed immediately using a headspace equilibration technique gatland et al 2014 222rn and greenhouse gases were measured by a rad7 detector durridge and a greenhouse gas analyzer picarro g4301 respectively an automated datalogger exo3 multiparameter sonde was deployed to measure temperature salinity dissolved oxygen do and water depth at 2 min intervals current speed and direction were measured at 1 min intervals using a current meter infinity em aem usb wind speed and rainfall data were measured at 5 min intervals with a weather station atmos 41 to capture spatial and temporal variability porewater samples 2 l water n 24 were collected along the intertidal sections fig s1 in three different sites downstream mid creek and upstream fig 2 during the pre rain and plum rain periods respectively to ensure that the porewater samples are representative the depths of porewater bores were about 1 1 5 m which were matched with the root zone of saltmarsh vegetation the carbon and greenhouse gas exports through porewater exchange in saltmarshes mainly come from the root zone of saltmarsh vegetation santos et al 2019 chen et al 2022 yau et al 2022 zhu et al 2022 porewater 222rn and greenhouse gas samples were analyzed as described above for surface waters because the solubility difference makes the gas equilibrium response time different we used 222rn co2 and ch4 with time lags of 30 10 and 30 min respectively webb et al 2016 a digital multi parameter meter multi 3430 wtw was used for in situ measurements of temperature salinity do and ph of porewater samples 2 3 porewater exchange greenhouse gas emissions and outwelling fluxes a 222rn mass balance model was applied to estimate the porewater exchange rate and then combined with porewater greenhouse gas concentrations to obtain related greenhouse gas fluxes santos et al 2019 chen et al 2021a porewater exchange rate and related greenhouse gas fluxes were reported in units of volume per area per time cm3 cm 2 day 1 cm day 1 and mmol per area per time mmol m 2 day 1 respectively note that the area here is the inundated saltmarsh area the digital elevation model combined with water depths to estimate the inundated saltmarsh area chen et al 2022 co2 and ch4 fluxes from water to atmosphere i e gas emissions or outgassing fluxes were determined based on gas transfer velocity and water air concentration gradients wanninkhof et al 2009 detailed calculations of porewater exchange rate are provided in the supporting information hourly greenhouse gas outwelling fluxes were calculated by multiplying greenhouse gas concentrations by related water flows water flow was estimated from changes of water volume over 5 min maher et al 2013 call et al 2015 santos et al 2019 greenhouse gas emissions were estimated using three different gas transfer velocity models of borges et al 2004 ho et al 2016 and rosentreter et al 2017 based on wind speed current velocity and water depth these gas transfer models have been widely applied to mangrove or saltmarsh ecosystems e g taillardat et al 2018 call et al 2019b santos et al 2019 chen et al 2021a 3 results and discussion 3 1 drivers of greenhouse gas dynamics and patterns time series observations were characterized by tidal including semi diurnal tides and spring neap tides and rainy i e plum rain conditions fig 2 surface water sampling and measurements spanned from a spring neap tidal cycle june 24 to july 1 2021 to the subsequent neap spring tidal cycle july 1 to july 10 2021 with a total of 30 tidal cycles five heavy rainfall events were captured during the plum rain period after july 3 2021 in particular the second rainfall event a heavy rainstorm event started at 20 00 on july 4 and lasted until 10 00 on july 5 delivering 135 mm rainfall over the semi diurnal cycles salinity do and ph showed tidal trends with highest values at high tides and lowest values at low tides while temperature varied in response to diurnal and tidal trends fig 2 222rn and greenhouse gas concentrations started to increase during the ebb tides and dropped sharply during the flood tide indicating significantly tidally driven porewater exchange and associated greenhouse gas exports santos et al 2019 chen et al 2021a although fine grained sediments in saltmarshes commonly have low permeability the sediment matrix of crab burrows significantly facilitates porewater exchange through tidal fluctuations xin et al 2009 guimond et al 2020 xiao et al 2021 therefore tidally driven flow through the sediment water interface area mainly comes from crab burrowing rather than saltmarsh sediments the semi diurnal flushing has been described in previous studies on mangroves e g stieglitz et al 2013 chen et al 2018 taillardat et al 2018 and saltmarshes e g chen et al 2021b 2022 in connection to the secondary sediment permeability created by crab burrows xin et al 2009 santos et al 2021 over the spring neap tidal cycle salinity do and ph decreased gradually from spring tide to neap tide while 222rn and greenhouse gas concentrations increased gradually with the decrease of tidal amplitude fig 2 call et al 2015 put forward a hypothesis that in addition to crab burrowing delayed seepage of surface water infiltrating sediments during the spring tide releases 222rn and greenhouse gases to mangrove creek during the neap tide chen et al 2022 further developed the groundwater surface water exchange mechanisms in saltmarshes under different tidal conditions on the basis of call et al 2015 they found that both semi diurnal and spring neap exchange mechanisms occur in the groundwater surface water exchange of saltmarshes therefore the increases of 222rn and greenhouse gas concentrations from spring to neap tide were attributed to the fact that older groundwater enriched in gas concentrations seeps into the creek as the tidal amplitude decreases however the delayed seepage from spring to neap tide would not explain the drop in salinity during the neap tide this may be because less seawater enters the saltmarsh soil during the neap tide which allows porewater salinity to decline high rainfall has the potential to strongly alter the forces driving groundwater flow in saltmarshes wilson et al 2011 but information about how and to what extent the groundwater flow in saltmarshes is driven by plum rain is quite limited our results indicate that both hydrological e g salinity do and ph and chemical parameters e g 222rn and greenhouse gases were greatly influenced by plum rain fig 2 table 1 and table 2 based on a one way anova test all these parameters had a significant difference at p 0 0001 222rn p 0 01 co2 p 0 07 between the pre rain and plum rain periods fig 3 median salinity do and ph during the pre rain period salinity 25 5 do 89 0 ph 8 06 were significantly higher than those during the plum rain period salinity 16 8 do 76 0 ph 7 86 while the median concentrations of 222rn bq m 3 pco2 μatm and ch4 nmol l 1 during the pre rain period 222rn 47 6 pco2 1530 ch4 137 were significantly lower than those during the plum rain period 222rn 98 5 pco2 1740 ch4 183 the surface water ph showed temporarily high values maximum 8 6 during the heavy rainfall probably because after the spring tide some alkalis were left on the sediment surface due to the influence of evapotranspiration and then flushed to the tidal creek by rainfall our results showed that the concentrations of 222rn and greenhouse gases decreased rapidly usually lasting for several hours after heavy rainfall especially after the second heavy rainfall and then rose to the maximum quickly fig 2 this is because after rainfall a portion of the rainwater directly entered the saltmarsh creek to dilute the surface water and the rest of the rainwater slowly infiltrated into the saltmarsh soils and then gradually exited to the surface water as part of porewater exchange at the same time 222rn and greenhouse gases were also released to the surface water with the groundwater flow 3 2 greenhouse gas fluxes through porewater exchange driven by plum rain tidal flushing semi diurnal spring neap exchange and plum rain are important drivers of greenhouse gas dynamics and patterns in saltmarshes a few previous studies have quantified the greenhouse gas fluxes via porewater exchange under the semi diurnal and spring neap exchange mechanisms in mangroves e g call et al 2015 chen et al 2021a and saltmarshes e g correa et al 2021 chen et al 2022 222rn and greenhouse gases had significant negative correlations with water depth fig 4a and greenhouse gases displayed significant positive correlations with 222rn fig 4b these results provided evidence that the major source of greenhouse gases in saltmarsh creek was porewater exchange rather than rainwater or surface water large amounts of co2 were released from the saltmarsh soil via porewater exchange thus reducing the ph value of surface water to determine the greenhouse gas flux that was attributable to porewater exchange a 222rn mass balance model table 3 was applied to quantify porewater exchange rates 15 5 4 7 cm day 1 for the pre rain period and 24 8 6 1 cm day 1 for the plum rain period for the 222rn mass balance in this study porewater exchange was the largest 222rn source 356 571 bq m 2 day 1 accounting for 87 96 of the total 222rn sources and atmospheric evasion i e 222rn emission was the largest 222rn sink 387 441 bq m 2 day 1 accounting for 74 94 of the total 222rn sinks table 3 the co2 and ch4 fluxes through porewater exchange were subsequently estimated to be 77 7 and 0 28 mmol m 2 day 1 during the pre rain period and 132 3 and 0 63 mmol m 2 day 1 during the plum rain period respectively table 4 the results were further analyzed using the one way anova test results obtained showed that porewater exchange fluxes and related co2 and ch4 fluxes had a significant difference at p 0 0001 or p 0 01 between the pre rain and plum rain periods fig 5 the co2 and ch4 fluxes through porewater exchange during the plum rain period were 1 7 and 2 3 times those during the pre rain period respectively indicating that plum rain is another important driver of greenhouse gas dynamics in saltmarshes in addition to tides porewater exchange and related greenhouse gas fluxes over each individual tidal cycle had significant correlations with tidal amplitude during the pre rain period fig 6 consistent with previous findings of tidal dominance in driving greenhouse gases fluxes over the diurnal time scales and spring neap tidal cycles e g call et al 2015 chen et al 2021a however porewater exchange and related greenhouse gas fluxes under the same tidal amplitude during the plum rain period were significantly higher than those during pre rain period fig 6 indicating that porewater derived greenhouse gases were influenced by not only tidal pumping including semi diurnal and spring neap time scales chen et al 2022 but also rainy weather conditions i e plum rain the plum rain significantly changed the salinity of creek water during the rainfall events fig 2 for example the second heavy rainfall caused the salinity of creek water to drop sharply from 23 7 to 1 8 to account for such a dilution effect associated with plum rain we calculated the salinity difference between the maximum and minimum values over each tidal cycle the results showed that porewater derived greenhouse gases in each individual tidal cycle had significant correlations with this salinity difference for the entire sampling period fig 6 providing further evidence that porewater exchange and related greenhouse gas fluxes were significantly controlled by plum rain the salinity difference in each individual tidal cycle appeared to describe the combined effects of tide and rainfall on the porewater derived greenhouse gas fluxes fig 6 previous investigations on the driving forces of greenhouse gases in coastal wetlands mostly focus on tides e g taillardat et al 2018 call et al 2019b santos et al 2019 chen et al 2022 our study revealed different levels of porewater exchange and related greenhouse gas fluxes at the same tidal amplitude during the pre rain and plum rain periods therefore integrating climatic conditions i e temperature zone or rainfall conditions is required to obtain reasonable estimates of porewater exchange and related greenhouse gas fluxes in addition to considering tidal factors other time scales of variability such as global warming sea level rise and shoreline aggradation or expansion may also modify the saltmarsh greenhouse gas fluxes which requires long term observations to guide the impact of climate change or human activities on greenhouse gas patterns in saltmarshes 3 3 control mechanisms of greenhouse gas dynamics and their impacts on coastal acidification the global annual total precipitation has been increasing continuously since the 1950s due to anthropogenic climate change trenberth 2011 ipcc 2013 and this increase has potential negative effects on the economy human activities and ecological systems wu and qian 2017 as a typical and important weather system in east asia plum rain can produce heavy rainfall and flooding furthermore plum rain is an important driving force of saltmarsh porewater exchange and greenhouse gas emissions therefore it is necessary to understand the control mechanisms of plum rain on the greenhouse gas dynamics in saltmarshes in our study 222rn traced porewater exchange rate during the plum rain period 24 8 6 1 cm day 1 was significantly higher than that during the pre rain period 15 5 4 7 cm day 1 fig 7 table 3 this is because part of the rainfall infiltrates the saltmarsh soil and subsequently enters the tidal creek through groundwater flow generally increased precipitation could prevent oxygen to penetrate waterlogged sediments thereby inhibiting co2 emissions from aerobic respiration emery et al 2019 however our results showed that porewater derived co2 and ch4 fluxes during the plum rain period were 1 7 and 2 3 times higher than those during the pre rain period fig 7 table 4 previous study revealed that the soil atmosphere co2 emission 212 mmol m 2 day 1 xu et al 2017 due to soil respiration was higher than that from porewater exchange 7 5 41 4 mmol m 2 day 1 chen et al 2022 in the study area plum rain makes the co2 discharged directly through the soil atmosphere interface dissolve in the rainwater and seep into the soil and then enter the saltmarsh creek through groundwater flow thus increasing the co2 flux via porewater exchange saltmarsh ch4 mainly depends on the relative balance between its production e g anaerobic methanogenesis and oxidation processes e g aerobic methanotrophs chen et al 2021c plum rain promotes anaerobic methanogenesis and inhibits aerobic methanotrophs by preventing oxygen to penetrate waterlogged sediments thus promoting ch4 production and release to the saltmarsh creek through porewater exchange large amounts of dissolved co2 and ch4 entered the saltmarsh creek through porewater exchange during the plum rain period which increased the co2 and ch4 concentrations i e inventories of the creek surface water fig 7 table 4 table 5 the porewater with high concentration of dissolved co2 entered the saltmarsh creek during the plum rain period resulting in significantly lower ph of creek surface water median ph 7 86 with the lowest ph value of 7 56 than that during the pre rain period median ph 8 06 over the past 250 years the ph of the surface ocean water has decreased by 0 1 and is projected to decrease by 0 4 by 2100 which means that the proton h concentration will increase by 150 and may exacerbate the potential of ocean acidification cao and caldeira 2008 coastal wetlands may partially counteract on coastal acidification in adjacent waters during the dry period sippo et al 2016 based on the ph time series data 0 01 ph resolution the rough h flux driven by porewater exchange was 13 3 μmol m 2 day 1 during the plum rain period 1 6 times higher than that during the pre rain period 8 36 μmol m 2 day 1 the porewater derived h flux during the plum rain period resulted in a decrease of ph by 0 2 compared with that during the pre rain period therefore large co2 or h flux via porewater exchange during the plum rain period may reduce the potential of buffering acidification in saltmarsh ecosystems further work tracking the long time scale process in affecting saltmarsh greenhouse gases is very important to address the duration of low ph and related potential acidification caused by plum rain 4 conclusions our detailed measurements revealed that plum rain was an important driver of greenhouse gas dynamics in saltmarshes porewater derived co2 and ch4 fluxes were estimated to be 77 7 and 0 28 mmol m 2 day 1 during the pre rain period and 132 3 and 0 63 mmol m 2 day 1 during the plum rain period respectively indicating significant response of porewater exchange and related greenhouse gas fluxes to the plum rain compared with pre rain period large amounts of co2 and h fluxes through porewater exchange during the plum rain period did not significantly increase the co2 fluxes through outgassing and outwelling from saltmarshes but led to the significant increase of co2 inventory in the surface water of saltmarsh creek suggesting that large amounts of co2 flux driven by plum rain may offset the potential of buffering saltmarsh acidification data availability

2554,seasonal rainfall locally known as plum rain is a potentially important driver of greenhouse gas dynamics in saltmarshes but no studies of its effects have been reported we quantified porewater exchange and related greenhouse gas fluxes in a saltmarsh over a spring neap spring tidal cycle 30 tidal cycles during the plum rain season radon traced porewater exchange rates were found to be 15 5 pre rain and 24 8 plum rain cm day 1 which released co2 and ch4 to surface waters with the fluxes mmol m 2 day 1 of 77 7 and 0 28 during the pre rain period and 132 3 and 0 63 over the plum rain period respectively the large amounts of soil co2 export through porewater exchange during the plum rain significantly increased the co2 inventory and reduced the ph from 8 06 to 7 86 median in saltmarsh surface water the result suggests that plum rain derived porewater exchange with lower ph values may contribute to coastal acidification keywords porewater exchange rainfall tidal pumping blue carbon greenhouse gas emissions coastal acidification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction saltmarshes are global hotspots for climate change mitigation because they sequester large amounts of atmospheric co2 in sediments mcleod et al 2011 serrano et al 2019 wang et al 2021 as an important blue carbon system saltmarshes have high rates of net primary production and carbon burial which can export particulate and dissolved carbon to the coastal ocean and release greenhouse gases e g co2 and ch4 to the atmosphere chen et al 2022 xin et al 2022 zhu et al 2022 the carbon export from coastal wetlands is largely driven by tidal pumping xin et al 2009 chen et al 2021a xiao et al 2021 yau et al 2022 despite the increasing interest in saltmarsh carbon assessments in the context of global climate change and blue carbon e g ouyang et al 2017 alongi 2020 liu et al 2021 there are still great uncertainties in determining saltmarsh greenhouse gas pathways especially the greenhouse gas fluxes through porewater exchange which is difficult to measure and estimate due to high heterogeneity and dynamic drivers in saltmarshes yet the patterns and drivers of greenhouse gas effluxes are important for understanding how porewater exchange affects greenhouse gas emissions in saltmarshes santos et al 2019 trifunovic et al 2020 previous studies related to drivers of greenhouse gas effluxes in saltmarshes have focused on tidal flushing and bioturbation such as crab burrowing e g santos et al 2019 xiao et al 2021 chen et al 2022 in addition to tidal pumping rainfall may also be an important driver of greenhouse gas dynamics in coastal wetlands as it can increase groundwater flow and related large co2 flux call et al 2019a chen et al 2021a rainfall events can modify carbon biogeochemistry and mixing and alter their fluxes to the coastal ocean in mangroves reithmaier et al 2021 the middle lower reaches of yangtze river have a continuously rainy weather from late spring to early summer which is called the plum rain season however to our knowledge no studies on porewater exchange and greenhouse gas fluxes in saltmarshes driven by rainfall have been reported plum rain presents an ideal opportunity to study the effects of rainfall thus it is imperative to quantify the porewater exchange and greenhouse gas fluxes under the influence of plum rain here we hypothesize that seasonal rainfall can strongly influence porewater exchange and related greenhouse gas fluxes in saltmarshes we conducted high resolution time series measurements over 30 semi diurnal tidal cycles during the plum rain season to analyze the 222rn a natural porewater tracer co2 and ch4 concentrations in surface water from a chinese saltmarsh creek the study aims to 1 characterize the temporal distributions of co2 and ch4 under the combined influence of tidal oscillations and plum rain 2 quantify the major co2 and ch4 pathways i e porewater exchange water atmosphere exchange and outwelling using detailed time series measurements of 222rn co2 and ch4 during the plum rain season 3 examine the relative importance of plum rain in affecting porewater exchange and associated co2 and ch4 effluxes and 4 evaluate the effect of plum rain on the buffer potential of coastal acidification in saltmarshes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area field investigations were carried out in a tidal creek surrounded by saltmarsh vegetation spartina alterniflora in yancheng city jiangsu province china fig 1a the coastal wetland of yancheng is a typical muddy tidal flat in china with low permeability sediments and high crab burrow density it hosts well developed saltmarsh vegetations and abundant animal resources gao et al 2014 the location has a subtropical and warm temperate climate with a mean annual air temperature of 14 4 c and a mean annual precipitation of 1067 mm http www chinaports com the precipitation during the plum rain period is relatively concentrated accounting for 40 50 of the total precipitation in the wet season fig 1b tides are regular and semidiurnal with a mean tidal range of 3 6 m and a maximum of 5 5 m http www chinaports com earlier investigation in our study site focused on porewater exchange at different tidal scales i e semidiurnal and spring neap time scales to explain the carbon outwelling to the ocean chen et al 2022 here we build on the earlier investigation by performing high resolution time series measurements over 30 semi diurnal tidal cycles during the plum rain season focusing on how continuous rainfall drives greenhouse gas dynamics 2 2 field sampling and measurements surface water sampling was performed from june 24 to july 10 2021 at downstream site which is located at the creek mouth fig 1a water samples 2 l water n 385 were collected for 222rn and greenhouse gas co2 and ch4 measurements using a peristaltic pump at 1 h interval for 16 days 30 tidal cycles covering the pre rain and plum rain periods fig 2 and analyzed immediately using a headspace equilibration technique gatland et al 2014 222rn and greenhouse gases were measured by a rad7 detector durridge and a greenhouse gas analyzer picarro g4301 respectively an automated datalogger exo3 multiparameter sonde was deployed to measure temperature salinity dissolved oxygen do and water depth at 2 min intervals current speed and direction were measured at 1 min intervals using a current meter infinity em aem usb wind speed and rainfall data were measured at 5 min intervals with a weather station atmos 41 to capture spatial and temporal variability porewater samples 2 l water n 24 were collected along the intertidal sections fig s1 in three different sites downstream mid creek and upstream fig 2 during the pre rain and plum rain periods respectively to ensure that the porewater samples are representative the depths of porewater bores were about 1 1 5 m which were matched with the root zone of saltmarsh vegetation the carbon and greenhouse gas exports through porewater exchange in saltmarshes mainly come from the root zone of saltmarsh vegetation santos et al 2019 chen et al 2022 yau et al 2022 zhu et al 2022 porewater 222rn and greenhouse gas samples were analyzed as described above for surface waters because the solubility difference makes the gas equilibrium response time different we used 222rn co2 and ch4 with time lags of 30 10 and 30 min respectively webb et al 2016 a digital multi parameter meter multi 3430 wtw was used for in situ measurements of temperature salinity do and ph of porewater samples 2 3 porewater exchange greenhouse gas emissions and outwelling fluxes a 222rn mass balance model was applied to estimate the porewater exchange rate and then combined with porewater greenhouse gas concentrations to obtain related greenhouse gas fluxes santos et al 2019 chen et al 2021a porewater exchange rate and related greenhouse gas fluxes were reported in units of volume per area per time cm3 cm 2 day 1 cm day 1 and mmol per area per time mmol m 2 day 1 respectively note that the area here is the inundated saltmarsh area the digital elevation model combined with water depths to estimate the inundated saltmarsh area chen et al 2022 co2 and ch4 fluxes from water to atmosphere i e gas emissions or outgassing fluxes were determined based on gas transfer velocity and water air concentration gradients wanninkhof et al 2009 detailed calculations of porewater exchange rate are provided in the supporting information hourly greenhouse gas outwelling fluxes were calculated by multiplying greenhouse gas concentrations by related water flows water flow was estimated from changes of water volume over 5 min maher et al 2013 call et al 2015 santos et al 2019 greenhouse gas emissions were estimated using three different gas transfer velocity models of borges et al 2004 ho et al 2016 and rosentreter et al 2017 based on wind speed current velocity and water depth these gas transfer models have been widely applied to mangrove or saltmarsh ecosystems e g taillardat et al 2018 call et al 2019b santos et al 2019 chen et al 2021a 3 results and discussion 3 1 drivers of greenhouse gas dynamics and patterns time series observations were characterized by tidal including semi diurnal tides and spring neap tides and rainy i e plum rain conditions fig 2 surface water sampling and measurements spanned from a spring neap tidal cycle june 24 to july 1 2021 to the subsequent neap spring tidal cycle july 1 to july 10 2021 with a total of 30 tidal cycles five heavy rainfall events were captured during the plum rain period after july 3 2021 in particular the second rainfall event a heavy rainstorm event started at 20 00 on july 4 and lasted until 10 00 on july 5 delivering 135 mm rainfall over the semi diurnal cycles salinity do and ph showed tidal trends with highest values at high tides and lowest values at low tides while temperature varied in response to diurnal and tidal trends fig 2 222rn and greenhouse gas concentrations started to increase during the ebb tides and dropped sharply during the flood tide indicating significantly tidally driven porewater exchange and associated greenhouse gas exports santos et al 2019 chen et al 2021a although fine grained sediments in saltmarshes commonly have low permeability the sediment matrix of crab burrows significantly facilitates porewater exchange through tidal fluctuations xin et al 2009 guimond et al 2020 xiao et al 2021 therefore tidally driven flow through the sediment water interface area mainly comes from crab burrowing rather than saltmarsh sediments the semi diurnal flushing has been described in previous studies on mangroves e g stieglitz et al 2013 chen et al 2018 taillardat et al 2018 and saltmarshes e g chen et al 2021b 2022 in connection to the secondary sediment permeability created by crab burrows xin et al 2009 santos et al 2021 over the spring neap tidal cycle salinity do and ph decreased gradually from spring tide to neap tide while 222rn and greenhouse gas concentrations increased gradually with the decrease of tidal amplitude fig 2 call et al 2015 put forward a hypothesis that in addition to crab burrowing delayed seepage of surface water infiltrating sediments during the spring tide releases 222rn and greenhouse gases to mangrove creek during the neap tide chen et al 2022 further developed the groundwater surface water exchange mechanisms in saltmarshes under different tidal conditions on the basis of call et al 2015 they found that both semi diurnal and spring neap exchange mechanisms occur in the groundwater surface water exchange of saltmarshes therefore the increases of 222rn and greenhouse gas concentrations from spring to neap tide were attributed to the fact that older groundwater enriched in gas concentrations seeps into the creek as the tidal amplitude decreases however the delayed seepage from spring to neap tide would not explain the drop in salinity during the neap tide this may be because less seawater enters the saltmarsh soil during the neap tide which allows porewater salinity to decline high rainfall has the potential to strongly alter the forces driving groundwater flow in saltmarshes wilson et al 2011 but information about how and to what extent the groundwater flow in saltmarshes is driven by plum rain is quite limited our results indicate that both hydrological e g salinity do and ph and chemical parameters e g 222rn and greenhouse gases were greatly influenced by plum rain fig 2 table 1 and table 2 based on a one way anova test all these parameters had a significant difference at p 0 0001 222rn p 0 01 co2 p 0 07 between the pre rain and plum rain periods fig 3 median salinity do and ph during the pre rain period salinity 25 5 do 89 0 ph 8 06 were significantly higher than those during the plum rain period salinity 16 8 do 76 0 ph 7 86 while the median concentrations of 222rn bq m 3 pco2 μatm and ch4 nmol l 1 during the pre rain period 222rn 47 6 pco2 1530 ch4 137 were significantly lower than those during the plum rain period 222rn 98 5 pco2 1740 ch4 183 the surface water ph showed temporarily high values maximum 8 6 during the heavy rainfall probably because after the spring tide some alkalis were left on the sediment surface due to the influence of evapotranspiration and then flushed to the tidal creek by rainfall our results showed that the concentrations of 222rn and greenhouse gases decreased rapidly usually lasting for several hours after heavy rainfall especially after the second heavy rainfall and then rose to the maximum quickly fig 2 this is because after rainfall a portion of the rainwater directly entered the saltmarsh creek to dilute the surface water and the rest of the rainwater slowly infiltrated into the saltmarsh soils and then gradually exited to the surface water as part of porewater exchange at the same time 222rn and greenhouse gases were also released to the surface water with the groundwater flow 3 2 greenhouse gas fluxes through porewater exchange driven by plum rain tidal flushing semi diurnal spring neap exchange and plum rain are important drivers of greenhouse gas dynamics and patterns in saltmarshes a few previous studies have quantified the greenhouse gas fluxes via porewater exchange under the semi diurnal and spring neap exchange mechanisms in mangroves e g call et al 2015 chen et al 2021a and saltmarshes e g correa et al 2021 chen et al 2022 222rn and greenhouse gases had significant negative correlations with water depth fig 4a and greenhouse gases displayed significant positive correlations with 222rn fig 4b these results provided evidence that the major source of greenhouse gases in saltmarsh creek was porewater exchange rather than rainwater or surface water large amounts of co2 were released from the saltmarsh soil via porewater exchange thus reducing the ph value of surface water to determine the greenhouse gas flux that was attributable to porewater exchange a 222rn mass balance model table 3 was applied to quantify porewater exchange rates 15 5 4 7 cm day 1 for the pre rain period and 24 8 6 1 cm day 1 for the plum rain period for the 222rn mass balance in this study porewater exchange was the largest 222rn source 356 571 bq m 2 day 1 accounting for 87 96 of the total 222rn sources and atmospheric evasion i e 222rn emission was the largest 222rn sink 387 441 bq m 2 day 1 accounting for 74 94 of the total 222rn sinks table 3 the co2 and ch4 fluxes through porewater exchange were subsequently estimated to be 77 7 and 0 28 mmol m 2 day 1 during the pre rain period and 132 3 and 0 63 mmol m 2 day 1 during the plum rain period respectively table 4 the results were further analyzed using the one way anova test results obtained showed that porewater exchange fluxes and related co2 and ch4 fluxes had a significant difference at p 0 0001 or p 0 01 between the pre rain and plum rain periods fig 5 the co2 and ch4 fluxes through porewater exchange during the plum rain period were 1 7 and 2 3 times those during the pre rain period
