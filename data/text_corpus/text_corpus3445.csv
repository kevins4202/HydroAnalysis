efforts here our goal was to determine if freshwater salinization as well as different salt types driving salinization affect e coli survival rates in two laboratory stream water mesocosm experiments

e coli was added and viable concentrations were measured over time using standard methods for e coli detection we quantified e coli survival rates by determining the amount of time required for e coli concentrations to decrease by 90 t90 2 materials and methods 2 1 mesocosm design and water sampling for this study we used natural water from a first order stream draining a 100 forested watershed located in the jefferson national forest of southwestern virginia this source water was selected specifically for the absence of upland anthropogenic influence and naturally low background salt concentrations the chemistry of the stream was monitored weekly for one year as part of early regional study and known to have very low base cation concentrations mean ca 2 9 mg l 1 k 0 92 mg l 1 mg 1 72 mg l 1 and na 1 01 mg l 1 and mean sc 52 µs cm 1 badgley et al 2019 to adjust for seasonal fluctuations in ca mg k and sc just prior to experimentation we collected multiple water samples over a four month period and measured sc using an orion star a223 portable meter thermo fisher scientific concentrations of ca mg and k were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to confirm the concentrations and ratios of base cations and consistency of background sc table 1 water for laboratory incubations was collected directly in sterilized mesocosms from the stream after filling mesocosms were immediately returned to the lab and incubations were started the day of water collection due to the number of mesocosms needed and space constraints we used 1 l bottle mesocosms for the conductivity gradient experiment and 15 l bucket mesocosms for the constant conductivity experiment note we did not compare t90 values between the conductivity gradient and constant conductivity experiments so differences in volume do not confound results all mesocosms were constructed from hdpe containers equipped with an aeration system to maintain oxygen levels and homogeneously mix the water throughout the incubation period water from this stream contains very low levels of carbon and nutrients badgley et al 2019 and similar to most natural aquatic systems lacks sufficient nutrients to meet nutritional requirements for e coli growth jang et al 2017 given that our goal was to mimic survival in environmental surface water other than the salt treatments no additions e g nutrients carbon or alterations e g ph were made to the chemistry of the mesocosms 2 2 experimental design to determine the effects of increasing salt concentrations on e coli survival in freshwater two salt treatments were tested 1 nacl and 2 a mix of ca mg and k chloride salts at a ca mg k ratio of 2 4 1 3 1 based on ion ratios measured from the source stream table 1 these salt treatments were chosen because their base cation compositions are characteristic of two major types of salinization 1 deicing and sea water na and 2 surface mining agriculture and accelerated weathering ca mg k salts for each treatment were added to triplicate 1 l stream water mesocosms to target scs of 125 350 800 and 1500 µs cm 1 which span the range of freshwater scs commonly observed in the united states griffith 2014b a no salt reference containing only ambient stream water with a sc of 15 µs cm 1 was also tested in triplicate resulting in a total of 27 individual mesocosms 2 salt treatments 4 scs and the reference because evaporation during the experiment caused small increases sc cv 16 fig 1 c and table 1s the average of the initial and final sc in each mesocosm were used in analyses however for clarity sc treatments are hereafter referred to by the target values i e 125 350 800 1500 µs cm 1 to test the effects of individual base cations on e coli survival a second set of experiments with four treatments including ca mg k na and a no salt control were tested in triplicate using chloride salts new mesocosms were constructed as described previously but using 15 l hdpe buckets and each was spiked with a single cation to a constant sc of 350 µs cm 1 fresh stream water was collected from the same stream as the conductivity gradient experiment and ambient sc at the time of collection was 30 µs cm 1 this strategy was designed to isolate differential effects of individual base cations while keeping sc constant evaporation caused sc to increase over time but average sc did not differ significantly among base cation treatments table 3s a sc of 350 µs cm 1 was selected because it is within the critical range of biological effect concentrations of other stream health metrics including benthic macroinvertebrate indices bernhardt et al 2012 timpano et al 2015 2 3 e coli culturing and inoculation methods for e coli culturing inoculation and sampling were consistent between the two experiments e coli k12 was grown from laboratory cultures in lb broth at 37 c for 16 h and gently pelleted via centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min pelleted cells were resuspended and washed with stream water then directly added at the beginning of the experiment to aerated mesocosms using a pipette at a final concentration of 105 cells ml 1 assuming a concentration of 109 cells ml 1 in a pure e coli culture after e coli inoculation we collected a time series of samples directly from mesocosms using a pipette or syringe depending on required water volume e coli concentrations were estimated using the colilert defined substrate test reagents in quanti tray 2000 idexx laboratories inc maine usa epa method 9223 b 2004 colilert e coli concentrations are reported as most probable number mpn 100 ml 1 mesocosms were sampled seven times over 16 17 days however sampling times varied based on e coli concentrations from the previous timepoint in order to capture the decay rate sc and ph were monitored throughout the experiment using an orion star a223 portable meter thermo fisher scientific tables 1s and 3s 2 4 data processing and statistical analyses decay constants k were calculated assuming first order decay kinetics using the equation c c0e kt where c t is the log10 transformed e coli concentration at any given sampling time c0 is the log10 transformed initial e coli concentration and k is the decay constant therefore k was determined as the slope of log10 transformed e coli concentrations at each sampling time point the amount of time it takes for 90 of e coli to decay t90 was derived by taking the inverse of k 1 k t90 is one of three commonly reported fib decay metrics 1 survival 2 decay constant k d 1 and 3 t90 d of the three t90 is the most intuitive and easily understandable value and is commonly used by engineers to model bacterial reduction guillaud et al al 1997 and in studies of e coli decay in environmental waters riou et al 2007 barcina et al 1986 ahmed et al 2014 decay rates t90 across the sc gradient for nacl and ca mg k treatments were fit to a logarithmic model to determine the relationship between sc and e coli survival an ancova test was used to determine significant differences between treatments model statistics are in table 2s for the constant sc experiment a one way anova and tukey s hsd test were used to determine significant differences in e coli survival t90 among different base cations at a constant sc summary statistics are in table 2s statistical significance is reported at p 0 05 for all pairwise comparisons because the two separate experiments used different volumes of water direct comparisons of t90 values between the conductivity gradient and constant conductivity experiments were not made statistical analyses were performed in r version 1 2 5042 r core team 2019 2 5 selection of previous studies for comparison of decay rates we searched for previous published studies on the effects of brackish and marine salinities on e coli survival for comparison with our results in order to insure the most direct comparison possible only studies that 1 experimentally manipulated salt concentrations in controlled laboratory settings and 2 used e coli as the test organism were used where needed we converted percent survival or decay constant values to t90 values combined t90 data from other studies presented in fig 3 were fit with a loess regression to highlight the subsidy stress response across the freshwater marine continuum 3 results 3 1 effects of increased salinity of e coli survival rates we found that higher concentrations of e coli persisted in the water as salinity increased for both the nacl and ca mg k treatments indicating salinity prolonged e coli survival fig 1 a and b e coli survival rates quantified via t90 increased logarithmically along the freshwater salinity gradient for both salt treatments the largest increases in e coli survival rates occurred across the lowest sc range of 15 to 350 µs cm 1 fig 1c and table 2s model statistics in table 3s for nacl t90 increased from 9 1 1 2 d in reference minimal salinity stream water to 24 3 10 0 d at 1500 µs cm 1 an increase of 167 the increase was similarly dramatic for the ca mg k treatment with a t90 of 28 2 9 5 d at 1500 µs cm 1 indicative of an increase of 210 relative to reference stream water there was no significant difference in the relationship between salinity and t90 between the nacl and ca mg k treatments ancova f1 27 0 683 p 0 308 in sum e coli survival in water increased along the freshwater salinization gradient regardless of the salt composition 3 2 effects of salt type on e coli survival rates e coli survival rates also varied among chloride salts containing different base cations at a constant salinity anova f3 8 5 761 p 0 0213 specifically e coli in mesocosms with mg2 survived significantly longer than e coli in mesocosms with ca2 or na tukey s hsd test both p 0 05 fig 2 a and b table 3s when exposed to elevated concentrations of mg2 t90 was 14 1 3 4 d whereas t90 was 6 3 2 8 d 9 5 1 9 d and 7 1 1 4 d for ca2 k and na respectively table 4s in sum we observed e coli persistence in water depends on salt type 4 discussion 4 1 revising the salinity e coli paradigm in contrast to the prevailing paradigm we observed increased e coli survival rates along a salinity gradient within the freshwater range 1500 µs cm 1 previously increased salinity was assumed to decrease e coli survival rates in aquatic ecosystems though this assumption was solely the result of studies targeting the effects of brackish and marine salinities 15 000 75 000 µs cm 1 on e coli survival anderson et al 1979 carlucci and pramer 1960 faust et al 1975 hanes and fragala 1967 roper and marshall 2009 observations along the freshwater salinity range reveal a subsidy stress response odum et al 1979 such a response suggests that dissolved salts within the freshwater range as seen during freshwater salinization constitute a usable resource for e coli the subsidy stress model is commonly observed in the natural environment but had not been demonstrated between e coli and salinity biggs et al 2002 king and richardson 2007 niyogi et al 2007 based on the combined data from this and previous studies once salinity reaches brackish concentrations 1500 to 15 000 µs cm 1 additional increases in salinity would result in an exponential decrease in e coli survival rates keeping with previous work in marine waters fig 3 there is a gap in data for the brackish range fig 3 therefore we cannot determine with more precision where the transition threshold may be regardless the potential implications of this revised understanding are significant for water quality managers tasked with addressing water quality impairments due to elevated levels of indicator bacteria the largest increase in e coli survival occurred at the lowest sc range 350 µs cm 1 suggesting small salinity increases can dramatically affect bacterial water quality salinization of streams with very low background sc e g headwater streams are therefore likely the most susceptible to increased fib impairments median and mean sc of wadeable streams in the united states were found to be 132 7 µs cm 1 and 312 4 µs cm 1 respectively griffith 2014b suggesting that freshwater salinization might be increasing violations of water quality standards designed to protect public health in addition to the length of time e coli survives in the stream loading and residence time are also critical factors affecting the concentration of e coli or pathogens in streams and other water bodies typical water residence times for streams and rivers range from 12 20 days wetzel 1992 in our study e coli t90 values increased from 9 1 1 2 to 28 2 9 5 d as sc increased from 15 to 1500 µs cm 1 and exceeded 20 d at a sc as low as 350 µs cm 1 this suggests that at sc as low as 350 µs cm 1 e coli persistence would exceed water residence times in many streams resulting in accumulating concentrations over time even with no increases in loading in addition to total salinity increased e coli survival rates from exposure to mg2 may be important at regional or continental scales differences in land cover usage and geology result in markedly different compositions of base cations in surface waters corsi et al 2010 fitzpatrick et al 2007 griffith 2014a kaushal and belt 2012 kaushal et al 2018 steele and aitkenhead peterson 2012 while previous research has linked other base cations including ca2 and k to bacterial ecology in freshwater ecosystems less is known about mg2 effects in aquatic systems or their microbial communities verhougstraete et al 2015 yet our results suggest mg2 concentrations may be a key constituent of water chemistry that causes freshwaters to be more susceptible to salinity induced fib impairments relative to regions with similar increases in other ions therefore the particular upland land uses present and their associated salts are critical when predicting the impacts on downstream water quality 4 2 potential mechanisms a subsidy stress relationship between e coli and salinization is congruent with knowledge of the underlying biological mechanisms of how e coli tolerates salts the effects of hypo and hyper osmotic stress on e coli are well documented and cause cell death or the stress response for example under conditions of low osmolarity several mechanosensitive ms channels rapidly release cytoplasmic solutes to reduce turgor pressure and prevent bursting of the cell envelope berrier et al 1992 levina et al 1999 however the effectiveness of these mechanisms depends on the rate of change in salinity when salinity decreases rapidly e g when enteric microbes are excreted into the environment and flushed into streams the protective ability of ms channels decreases and cells cannot adjust their internal osmolarity fast enough to prevent lysis and death bialecka fornal et al 2015 increased salinity in the freshwater range appears to alleviate osmotic stress supporting increased survival and the subsidy response however once salinity reaches brackish or marine concentrations degradation of cellular energy charge can inactivate nutrient transport across the cell membrane resulting in a viable but not culturable state troussellier et al 1998 these processes are highly dependent on the transport of k and are linked to specific genes including rpos prop and prou which code for the transport of osmoprotectants such as glycine betaine and glutamate csonka 1989 munro et al 1989 rozen and belkin 2005 when compared at identical sc levels mg2 increased e coli survival rates by as much as seven days relative to other base cations fig 2b mg2 is an important micronutrient and cofactor for numerous bacterial cellular processes and mg2 starvation can permanently impact membrane permeability fiil and branton 1969 divalent cations stabilize the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria by binding and neutralizing repulsive forces of negatively charged lipopolysaccharide molecules raetz et al 2007 the presence of excess mg2 can assist in the maintenance of membrane stability in the presence of outer membrane disorganizing agents including weak acids and antibiotics leive 1974 sahalan et al 2013 elevated mg2 concentrations in the environment may therefore increase the ability of e coli to adapt to changes in salinity through maintenance of proper membrane permeability providing an effective barrier to solutes and preventing cell leakage additionally the stringent response in e coli which is a protective response to stress conditions that diverts resources away from nonessential processes is mg2 dependent and limited at low extracellular mg2 concentrations chochran and byrne 1974 shyp et al 2012 therefore it is also possible that elevated mg2 enables e coli to endure unfavorable environmental conditions like osmotic stress by facilitating the stringent response 4 3 implications for water quality and salt management effective use of fib in water quality monitoring is based upon a paradigm that assumes parity of survival between the indicator e coli and human pathogens in the environment bonde 1966 this study did not assess the effects of freshwater salinization on survival rates of pathogens but suggests two possible scenarios if rising salinity also increases survival rates of pathogenic bacteria then freshwater salinization could be increasing concentrations of pathogens and human health risks conversely if pathogen survival rates decrease or are not impacted by freshwater salinization then the effectiveness of e coli as an indicator of human health risk would decrease with salinization erroneous bacterial impairments resulting from overestimates of public health risks would lead to needless restrictions to stream access and use as well as potentially wasted mitigation costs already billions of dollars are spent annually in the united states on water infrastructure improvements and nonpoint source pollution mitigation to improve bacterial water quality usepa 2016b vedachalam and geddes 2017 therefore assessing the effects of freshwater salinization on pathogenic bacteria is critical to fully understanding the relationships between salt use freshwater salinization and bacterial water quality development of more nuanced salt management strategies that consider salt type in addition to concentration alone could offer additional benefits for improving water quality salt management plans and deicing practices could have particularly significant ramifications for bacterial water quality at northern latitudes replacement of traditional na based deicing salts with mg salts such as mgcl2 and mg ca acetate is increasingly widespread as these salts melt ice at lower temperatures however this may actually exacerbate the effects of salinization on e coli survival which almost doubled in our study compared to e coli exposed to ca2 or na chloride salts fig 2b table 3s given that less mgcl2 8 11 g m2 is required per de icing application than nacl 13 68 g m2 further examination of the potential offset in decreasing overall sc but increasing e coli survival is warranted zhang et al 2009 this is particularly true for urban landscapes that tend to experience both salinization and bacterial water quality issues kaushal and belt 2012 young and thackston 1999 5 conclusion increasing salt concentrations in the freshwater range can increase survival rates of e coli the epa recommended fib for freshwater thus freshwater salinization may reduce our ability to effectively predict human health risks from exposure to waterborne pathogens further regions prone to elevated mg2 concentrations may be more susceptible to e coli impairments effective salt management strategies could reduce fib impairments by decreasing survival rates of e coli conversely in the absence of salt management reductions in fib loading to surface waters may fail to meet water quality goals if increased fib survival and subsequent accumulation negate the reduced loads declaration of competing interest the authors have no conflict of interest acknowledgments funding for this work was

for the conductivity gradient experiment and 15 l bucket mesocosms for the constant conductivity experiment note we did not compare t90 values between the conductivity gradient and constant conductivity experiments so differences in volume do not confound results all mesocosms were constructed from hdpe containers equipped with an aeration system to maintain oxygen levels and homogeneously mix the water throughout the incubation period water from this stream contains very low levels of carbon and nutrients badgley et al 2019 and similar to most natural aquatic systems lacks sufficient nutrients to meet nutritional requirements for e coli growth jang et al 2017 given that our goal was to mimic survival in environmental surface water other than the salt treatments no additions e g nutrients carbon or alterations e g ph were made to the chemistry of the mesocosms 2 2 experimental design to determine the effects of increasing salt concentrations on e coli survival in freshwater two salt treatments were tested 1 nacl and 2 a mix of ca mg and k chloride salts at a ca mg k ratio of 2 4 1 3 1 based on ion ratios measured from the source stream table 1 these salt treatments were chosen because their base cation compositions are characteristic of two major types of salinization 1 deicing and sea water na and 2 surface mining agriculture and accelerated weathering ca mg k salts for each treatment were added to triplicate 1 l stream water mesocosms to target scs of 125 350 800 and 1500 µs cm 1 which span the range of freshwater scs commonly observed in the united states griffith 2014b a no salt reference containing only ambient stream water with a sc of 15 µs cm 1 was also tested in triplicate resulting in a total of 27 individual mesocosms 2 salt treatments 4 scs and the reference because evaporation during the experiment caused small increases sc cv 16 fig 1 c and table 1s the average of the initial and final sc in each mesocosm were used in analyses however for clarity sc treatments are hereafter referred to by the target values i e 125 350 800 1500 µs cm 1 to test the effects of individual base cations on e coli survival a second set of experiments with four treatments including ca mg k na and a no salt control were tested in triplicate using chloride salts new mesocosms were constructed as described previously but using 15 l hdpe buckets and each was spiked with a single cation to a constant sc of 350 µs cm 1 fresh stream water was collected from the same stream as the conductivity gradient experiment and ambient sc at the time of collection was 30 µs cm 1 this strategy was designed to isolate differential effects of individual base cations while keeping sc constant evaporation caused sc to increase over time but average sc did not differ significantly among base cation treatments table 3s a sc of 350 µs cm 1 was selected because it is within the critical range of biological effect concentrations of other stream health metrics including benthic macroinvertebrate indices bernhardt et al 2012 timpano et al 2015 2 3 e coli culturing and inoculation methods for e coli culturing inoculation and sampling were consistent between the two experiments e coli k12 was grown from laboratory cultures in lb broth at 37 c for 16 h and gently pelleted via centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min pelleted cells were resuspended and washed with stream water then directly added at the beginning of the experiment to aerated mesocosms using a pipette at a final concentration of 105 cells ml 1 assuming a concentration of 109 cells ml 1 in a pure e coli culture after e coli inoculation we collected a time series of samples directly from mesocosms using a pipette or syringe depending on required water volume e coli concentrations were estimated using the colilert defined substrate test reagents in quanti tray 2000 idexx laboratories inc maine usa epa method 9223 b 2004 colilert e coli concentrations are reported as most probable number mpn 100 ml 1 mesocosms were sampled seven times over 16 17 days however sampling times varied based on e coli concentrations from the previous timepoint in order to capture the decay rate sc and ph were monitored throughout the experiment using an orion star a223 portable meter thermo fisher scientific tables 1s and 3s 2 4 data processing and statistical analyses decay constants k were calculated assuming first order decay kinetics using the equation c c0e kt where c t is the log10 transformed e coli concentration at any given sampling time c0 is the log10 transformed initial e coli concentration and k is the decay constant therefore k was determined as the slope of log10 transformed e coli concentrations at each sampling time point the amount of time it takes for 90 of e coli to decay t90 was derived by taking the inverse of k 1 k t90 is one of three commonly reported fib decay metrics 1 survival 2 decay constant k d 1 and 3 t90 d of the three t90 is the most intuitive and easily understandable value and is commonly used by engineers to model bacterial reduction guillaud et al al 1997 and in studies of e coli decay in environmental waters riou et al 2007 barcina et al 1986 ahmed et al 2014 decay rates t90 across the sc gradient for nacl and ca mg k treatments were fit to a logarithmic model to determine the relationship between sc and e coli survival an ancova test was used to determine significant differences between treatments model statistics are in table 2s for the constant sc experiment a one way anova and tukey s hsd test were used to determine significant differences in e coli survival t90 among different base cations at a constant sc summary statistics are in table 2s statistical significance is reported at p 0 05 for all pairwise comparisons because the two separate experiments used different volumes of water direct comparisons of t90 values between the conductivity gradient and constant conductivity experiments were not made statistical analyses were performed in r version 1 2 5042 r core team 2019 2 5 selection of previous studies for comparison of decay rates we searched for previous published studies on the effects of brackish and marine salinities on e coli survival for comparison with our results in order to insure the most direct comparison possible only studies that 1 experimentally manipulated salt concentrations in controlled laboratory settings and 2 used e coli as the test organism were used where needed we converted percent survival or decay constant values to t90 values combined t90 data from other studies presented in fig 3 were fit with a loess regression to highlight the subsidy stress response across the freshwater marine continuum 3 results 3 1 effects of increased salinity of e coli survival rates we found that higher concentrations of e coli persisted in the water as salinity increased for both the nacl and ca mg k treatments indicating salinity prolonged e coli survival fig 1 a and b e coli survival rates quantified via t90 increased logarithmically along the freshwater salinity gradient for both salt treatments the largest increases in e coli survival rates occurred across the lowest sc range of 15 to 350 µs cm 1 fig 1c and table 2s model statistics in table 3s for nacl t90 increased from 9 1 1 2 d in reference minimal salinity stream water to 24 3 10 0 d at 1500 µs cm 1 an increase of 167 the increase was similarly dramatic for the ca mg k treatment with a t90 of 28 2 9 5 d at 1500 µs cm 1 indicative of an increase of 210 relative to reference stream water there was no significant difference in the relationship between salinity and t90 between the nacl and ca mg k treatments ancova f1 27 0 683 p 0 308 in sum e coli survival in water increased along the freshwater salinization gradient regardless of the salt composition 3 2 effects of salt type on e coli survival rates e coli survival rates also varied among chloride salts containing different base cations at a constant salinity anova f3 8 5 761 p 0 0213 specifically e coli in mesocosms with mg2 survived significantly longer than e coli in mesocosms with ca2 or na tukey s hsd test both p 0 05 fig 2 a and b table 3s when exposed to elevated concentrations of mg2 t90 was 14 1 3 4 d whereas t90 was 6 3 2 8 d 9 5 1 9 d and 7 1 1 4 d for ca2 k and na respectively table 4s in sum we observed e coli persistence in water depends on salt type 4 discussion 4 1 revising the salinity e coli paradigm in contrast to the prevailing paradigm we observed increased e coli survival rates along a salinity gradient within the freshwater range 1500 µs cm 1 previously increased salinity was assumed to decrease e coli survival rates in aquatic ecosystems though this assumption was solely the result of studies targeting the effects of brackish and marine salinities 15 000 75 000 µs cm 1 on e coli survival anderson et al 1979 carlucci and pramer 1960 faust et al 1975 hanes and fragala 1967 roper and marshall 2009 observations along the freshwater salinity range reveal a subsidy stress response odum et al 1979 such a response suggests that dissolved salts within the freshwater range as seen during freshwater salinization constitute a usable resource for e coli the subsidy stress model is commonly observed in the natural environment but had not been demonstrated between e coli and salinity biggs et al 2002 king and richardson 2007 niyogi et al 2007 based on the combined data from this and previous studies once salinity reaches brackish concentrations 1500 to 15 000 µs cm 1 additional increases in salinity would result in an exponential decrease in e coli survival rates keeping with previous work in marine waters fig 3 there is a gap in data for the brackish range fig 3 therefore we cannot determine with more precision where the transition threshold may be regardless the potential implications of this revised understanding are significant for water quality managers tasked with addressing water quality impairments due to elevated levels of indicator bacteria the largest increase in e coli survival occurred at the lowest sc range 350 µs cm 1 suggesting small salinity increases can dramatically affect bacterial water quality salinization of streams with very low background sc e g headwater streams are therefore likely the most susceptible to increased fib impairments median and mean sc of wadeable streams in the united states were found to be 132 7 µs cm 1 and 312 4 µs cm 1 respectively griffith 2014b suggesting that freshwater salinization might be increasing violations of water quality standards designed to protect public health in addition to the length of time e coli survives in the stream loading and residence time are also critical factors affecting the concentration of e coli or pathogens in streams and other water bodies typical water residence times for streams and rivers range from 12 20 days wetzel 1992 in our study e coli t90 values increased from 9 1 1 2 to 28 2 9 5 d as sc increased from 15 to 1500 µs cm 1 and exceeded 20 d at a sc as low as 350 µs cm 1 this suggests that at sc as low as 350 µs cm 1 e coli persistence would exceed water residence times in many streams resulting in accumulating concentrations over time even with no increases in loading in addition to total salinity increased e coli survival rates from exposure to mg2 may be important at regional or continental scales differences in land cover usage and geology result in markedly different compositions of base cations in surface waters corsi et al 2010 fitzpatrick et al 2007 griffith 2014a kaushal and belt 2012 kaushal et al 2018 steele and aitkenhead peterson 2012 while previous research has linked other base cations including ca2 and k to bacterial ecology in freshwater ecosystems less is known about mg2 effects in aquatic systems or their microbial communities verhougstraete et al 2015 yet our results suggest mg2 concentrations may be a key constituent of water chemistry that causes freshwaters to be more susceptible to salinity induced fib impairments relative to regions with similar increases in other ions therefore the particular upland land uses present and their associated salts are critical when predicting the impacts on downstream water quality 4 2 potential mechanisms a subsidy stress relationship between e coli and salinization is congruent with knowledge of the underlying biological mechanisms of how e coli tolerates salts the effects of hypo and hyper osmotic stress on e coli are well documented and cause cell death or the stress response for example under conditions of low osmolarity several mechanosensitive ms channels rapidly release cytoplasmic solutes to reduce turgor pressure and prevent bursting of the cell envelope berrier et al 1992 levina et al 1999 however the effectiveness of these mechanisms depends on the rate of change in salinity when salinity decreases rapidly e g when enteric microbes are excreted into the environment and flushed into streams the protective ability of ms channels decreases and cells cannot adjust their internal osmolarity fast enough to prevent lysis and death bialecka fornal et al 2015 increased salinity in the freshwater range appears to alleviate osmotic stress supporting increased survival and the subsidy response however once salinity reaches brackish or marine concentrations degradation of cellular energy charge can inactivate nutrient transport across the cell membrane resulting in a viable but not culturable state troussellier et al 1998 these processes are highly dependent on the transport of k and are linked to specific genes including rpos prop and prou which code for the transport of osmoprotectants such as glycine betaine and glutamate csonka 1989 munro et al 1989 rozen and belkin 2005 when compared at identical sc levels mg2 increased e coli survival rates by as much as seven days relative to other base cations fig 2b mg2 is an important micronutrient and cofactor for numerous bacterial cellular processes and mg2 starvation can permanently impact membrane permeability fiil and branton 1969 divalent cations stabilize the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria by binding and neutralizing repulsive forces of negatively charged lipopolysaccharide molecules raetz et al 2007 the presence of excess mg2 can assist in the maintenance of membrane stability in the presence of outer membrane disorganizing agents including weak acids and antibiotics leive 1974 sahalan et al 2013 elevated mg2 concentrations in the environment may therefore increase the ability of e coli to adapt to changes in salinity through maintenance of proper membrane permeability providing an effective barrier to solutes and preventing cell leakage additionally the stringent response in e coli which is a protective response to stress conditions that diverts resources away from nonessential processes is mg2 dependent and limited at low extracellular mg2 concentrations chochran and byrne 1974 shyp et al 2012 therefore it is also possible that elevated mg2 enables e coli to endure unfavorable environmental conditions like osmotic stress by facilitating the stringent response 4 3 implications for water quality and salt management effective use of fib in water quality monitoring is based upon a paradigm that assumes parity of survival between the indicator e coli and human pathogens in the environment bonde 1966 this study did not assess the effects of freshwater salinization on survival rates of pathogens but suggests two possible scenarios if rising salinity also increases survival rates of pathogenic bacteria then freshwater salinization could be increasing concentrations of pathogens and human health risks conversely if pathogen survival rates decrease or are not impacted by freshwater salinization then the effectiveness of e coli as an indicator of human health risk would decrease with salinization erroneous bacterial impairments resulting from overestimates of public health risks would lead to needless restrictions to stream access and use as well as potentially wasted mitigation costs already billions of dollars are spent annually in the united states on water infrastructure improvements and nonpoint source pollution mitigation to improve bacterial water quality usepa 2016b vedachalam and geddes 2017 therefore assessing the effects of freshwater salinization on pathogenic bacteria is critical to fully understanding the relationships between salt use freshwater salinization and bacterial water quality development of more nuanced salt management strategies that consider salt type in addition to concentration alone could offer additional benefits for improving water quality salt management plans and deicing practices could have particularly significant ramifications for bacterial water quality at northern latitudes replacement of traditional na based deicing salts with mg salts such as mgcl2 and mg ca acetate is increasingly widespread as these salts melt ice at lower temperatures however this may actually exacerbate the effects of salinization on e coli survival which almost doubled in our study compared to e coli exposed to ca2 or na chloride salts fig 2b table 3s given that less mgcl2 8 11 g m2 is required per de icing application than nacl 13 68 g m2 further examination of the potential offset in decreasing overall sc but increasing e coli survival is warranted zhang et al 2009 this is particularly true for urban landscapes that tend to experience both salinization and bacterial water quality issues kaushal and belt 2012 young and thackston 1999 5 conclusion increasing salt concentrations in the freshwater range can increase survival rates of e coli the epa recommended fib for freshwater thus freshwater salinization may reduce our ability to effectively predict human health risks from exposure to waterborne pathogens further regions prone to elevated mg2 concentrations may be more susceptible to e coli impairments effective salt management strategies could reduce fib impairments by decreasing survival rates of e coli conversely in the absence of salt management reductions in fib loading to surface waters may fail to meet water quality goals if increased fib survival and subsequent accumulation negate the reduced loads declaration of competing interest the authors have no conflict of interest acknowledgments funding for this work was

17226,the purpose of this study is to determine the potential for an attached algae flow way system to efficiently produce algal biomass in estuarine surface waters by utilizing dilute non point source nutrients from local urban industrial and agricultural discharges into the upper laguna madre corpus christi texas the study was conducted over the course of two years to establish seasonal base line biomass productivity and composition for bioproducts applications and to identify key environmental factors and flow way cohorts impacting biomass production for the entire cultivation period continuous ash free biomass production at 4 to 10 g m2 day corresponding to nutrient recovery at 300 to 500 mg of nitrogen m2 day and 15 to 30 mg of phosphorus m2 day was successfully achieved without system restart upon start up a latency period was observed which indicates roles for species succession from relatively low productivity high ash content pioneer periphytic culture composed primarily of benthic diatoms from the source waters to higher productivity reduced ash content and more resilient culture mainly composed of filamentous chlorophyta ulva lactuca principal component analysis pca was used to identify environmental factors driving biomass production and machine learning ml models were constructed to assess the predictive capability of the data set for system performance using the local multi season environmental variations environmental datasets were segregated for ml training validation and testing using three methods regression tree ensemble regression and gaussian process regression gpr the predicted ash free biomass productivity using ml models resulted in root squared mean errors rsme from 1 78 to 1 86 g m2 day and r2 values from 0 67 to 0 75 using different methods the greatest contributor to net productivity was total solar irradiation followed by air temperature salinity and ph the results of the study should be useful as a decision making tool to application of attached algae flow ways for biomass production while preventing algal blooms in the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords attached algae flow way long term biomass production machine learning principal component analysis nutrient recovery algal turf scrubber 1 introduction as global agricultural output continues to rise in support of growing human population the associated increase in major nutrient pollution nitrogen and phosphorus is increasingly stressing key planetary boundaries and has had observable impacts on global biogeochemical cycles howarth et al 2000 increased nutrient loading in aquatic ecosystems can have a variety of negative impacts most notably an increased risk of harmful algae bloom hab events glibert 2017 glibert et al 2005 while the web of factors that cause habs is complex there is a growing consensus that increased nutrient loading broadly leads to increased phytoplankton productivity and increased risk of hab events and subsequent eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems anderson et al 2002 glibert et al 2006 kudela et al 2008 visser et al 2016 in particular non point source emissions from agricultural runoff which contain much lower and more inconsistent concentrations of nutrients continue to be difficult problems to address arita et al 2015 force 2017 mueller and spahr 2005 these challenges are amplified by the effects of climate change which generally result in warmer water temperatures and higher frequency of severe rainfall events in agricultural regions thereby increasing the runoff potential melillo et al 2014 wells et al 2015 to address these challenges there is a clear need for cost effective and scalable technologies that can minimize habs and eutrophication one such technology that has emerged in recent years is attached algae flow way systems also known as algal turf scrubbers ats this technology uses a gently angled flow way channel or flume to cultivate a diverse cohort of periphytic algae to intercept and accumulate nutrient contaminants n p trace metals in surface waters adey us4333263a the algae flow way systems utilize compromised surface waters with nutrient concentrations much lower than those required for recirculating algal raceway pond and have been investigated for application to a range of contaminated surface waters such as effluent from secondary wastewater dairy farms aquaculture and many others craggs et al 1996 d aiuto et al 2015 liu et al 2016 mulbry et al 2008 ray et al 2015 these surface waters generally have adequate levels of co2 and or carbonate which is also otherwise required for recirculating algal raceway pond pizarro et al 2006 the shallow medium contributes to the capability of an attached periphytic culture to achieve relatively high productivities despite lower nutrient concentrations these include high exposed surface to volume ratio s v of cultivation turbulence induced rapid light dark cycles which improves photon utilization efficiency and improved nutrient and gaseous exchange and breakup of boundary layer gradient limitations that otherwise exist among the algal cellular matrix water and atmosphere apel et al 2017 kim et al 2018 in all investigations to date attached algae flow way systems were able to effectively and reliably remove contaminants from the source water although the rates of removal can vary drastically based on environmental factors and engineering parameters of the system which makes it difficult to accurately scale systems and determine total costs and potential return on investment timeframes derose et al 2019 to address these gaps in the research we investigated the potential for the algae flow way technology to bioaccumulate nitrogen phosphorus and carbon in depleted nutrient runoff originating non point source waters in the gulf coast region the algae flow way units were deployed for a two year campaign sourcing water from the upper laguna madre in corpus christi tx to determine expected biomass productivities in this environment additionally we assessed the environmental drivers of biomass productivity in the flow ways using principal component analysis pca and tested the predictive capability of the data using state of the art computational modeling tools with publicly available environmental datasets recent mechanistic approaches have largely been successful in predicting biomass productivity of suspended algae monoculture cultivation systems by incorporating experimentally derived parameters for microbial kinetics inhibiting factors metabolism flow and thermal characteristics in a physics based modeling context cheng et al 2019 gardner et al 2019 quiroz arita et al 2020 2019 quiroz arita et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 however these mechanistic approaches require a more detailed fundamental understanding of the system which is limited for periphytic polycultures in attached algae flow ways based on the complexities in the biological cohort and surface water chemistry machine learning ml approaches on the other hand have gained the attention of many authors to predict water quantity metrics and quality parameters using correlated variables from environmental datasets arnon et al 2019 castrillo and garcía 2020 chen et al 2020 fan et al 2020 hill et al 2020 jouanneau et al 2019 li et al 2020 lu et al 2019 pyo et al 2020 xia et al 2020 xu et al 2020 application of ml approaches using the experimental data gathered in the attached algae flow way trial provided the opportunity to identify intrinsic correlations between the environment and polycultures to predict biomass production that could otherwise contribute to undesired algal blooms to surface waters therefore this work should as succinctly as currently possible encapsulate the results from the two year campaign for understanding the potential for scaled up deployment of the attached algae flow way technology in the upper laguna madre corpus christi tx region 2 materials and methods 2 1 attached algae flow ways and operations deployment of the attached algae flow ways took place at the texas a m agrilife research mariculture laboratory in corpus christi texas figure s1 the facility has direct access to estuarine water from upper laguna madre the entire experiment was carried out using three algae flow way units unit 1 was 0 61 m wide 24 38 m long with a 2 slop and constructed of fiberglass the algae flow way was covered with a 3 d matrix composed of dacron fibers

6 10 m long section the algae flow way was covered with a 3 d matrix material composed of dacron fibers interfaceflor la grange ga and total covered surface area was 9 86 m2 all units featured a single pass flow through design estuarine water from a channel connected to the upper laguna madre was pumped to a head tank then pumped to each flow way at a rate of approximately 189 l min 50 gpm with a dump bucket pulse repetition rate of approximately 20 s 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 biomass productivity and compositional analyses on a weekly basis biomass was mechanically removed from the substrate of each lane using a squeegee mallory ws1524a black window washer and squeegee 15 and a vacuum rigid wet dry shop vacuum 16 gal water flow was halted on the system for the duration of harvests 1 5 h a felt lined fish harvest basket pentair aquatic ecosystems fbk3 was placed at the end of each lane where biomass was collected biomass was allowed to de water in the felt lined fish harvest basket for approximately six hours before being transferred to a tray and dried in an oven model binder ed720 tuttlingen de at 75 c until constant weight was achieved dried samples were ground into a fine powder using a hammer mill model cf198 chippewa falls wi and mixed to ensure that samples were homogeneous ash content was measured by conducting the standard measurement method of ash

contents was calculated from nitrogen content by multiplying by 6 25 and crude carbohydrate content was calculated by subtracting everything from 100 phosphorus contents of biomass was estimated using phosphorus contents of periphyton reported from other similar studies adey et al 2013 d aiuto et al 2015 kangas and mulbry 2014 kangas et al 2017 mulbry et al 2010 ray et al 2015 2 2 2 weather and water quality data daily total and maximum global horizontal solar irradiation tgh and max gh respectively data in corpus christi texas during the entire period of experiment were collected from a station at university of texas panamerican solar radiation lab through nrel s measurement and instrumentation data center ramos and andreas 2011 data for daily minimum maximum and average air temperature and precipitation in corpus christi tx for the entire period of experiment were obtained from the website weather underground www wunderground com water quality data were collected from two different sources salinity ph do saturation and turbidity were collected from conrad blucher institute for surveying and science cbi a research institute within texas a m university corpus christi the average total nitrogen tn and phosphorus tp content of the source water pumped from upper laguna madre during the entire period of experiment was collected from the surface water quality web reporting tool provided by texas commission on environmental quality tceq 2 3 data analysis and predictive modeling approach to analyze the data obtained from the attached algae flow ways we identified the variables with the highest variance through pca and applied a predictive ml modeling tool of the system the early phase of the cultivation showed a lag phase which did not properly reflect any environmental effect on biomass productivity and was thus neglected for further statistical analyses to investigate correlation between biomass productivity and environmental factors data from 1 4 2017 to 6 25 2018 which resulted in total of 183 observations 61 harvesting points from 3 flow ways were used for further statistical analyses and ml training validation and testing 2 3 1 non linear regression model sinusoidal model the oscillating trend of the measured biomass productivity data was modeled using non linear regression and represented as a sinusoidal curve sinusoidal bp the sinusoidal biomass productivity was developed using eq 1 shown as follow 1 s i n u s o i d a l b p pr 1 pr 2 sin pr 3 dates pr 4 parameters including pr1 pr2 pr3 and pr4 represent the baseline amplitude frequency and an offset of the developed sinusoidal bp model respectively the values for each parameter were 6 804 2 987 0 017 and 42 784 respectively the model parameters were developed to have the minimum residual sum of square value and the maximum coefficient of determination value which were 1398 03 and 0 3719 respectively 2 3 2 principal component analysis pca statistical interpretation of data was conducted using an add on microsoft excel based software addinsoft xlstat statistical and data analysis solution boston usa pca was conducted on datasets of environmental factors including weather data such as total and maximum global horizontal solar irradiation tgh and max gh respectively average daily air temperature air temp daily precipitation precip and water quality data such as dissolved oxygen do saturation ph turbidity and salinity for the observations measured biomass productivity meas bp was used daily biomass productivity within each cultivation period was calculated as the average biomass productivity during corresponding cultivation period the pca type used was the pearson correlation coefficient biomass productivities of all 541 days from january 1st 2017 to jun 25th 2018 were used for the total observations to correspond to all daily environmental factors total observation points were also categorized by seasons winter spring summer and fall with respective data points of 149 184 117 and 91 biomass productivity of days between two harvesting points were assumed to be the same as the average biomass productivity obtained on the following harvesting day a biplot was created as a result and was consist of principal components 1 and 2 pc1 and pc2 explaining about 65 5 of the total variance pc1 has an eigenvalue of 3 793 and accounted for the highest portion of the total variance around 42 1 while pc2 has an eigenvalue of 2 106 and accounted for the second most portion around 23 4 of the total variance 2 3 3 machine learning methods to provide a forecasting tool able to predict the expected bioresource productivity and algal bloom prevention potential we assessed multiple ml models predictive capability using the data from the attached algae flow ways we segregated 75 of the dataset gathered in this study for model training and validation to prevent overfitting during the training process we used 2 fold cross validation to estimate accuracy at each fold to evaluate whether the model generalizes different conditions we used the remaining 25 dataset for testing we selected the features with the highest variance as identified using the pca as the predictors to train the model including i salinity ii total global horizontal radiation iii air temperature iv maximum global horizontal radiation and v ph we used the mean ash free biomass productivity as the response variable of the ml models the performance metrics we present to evaluate the ml models include the root mean square error rmse and r2 1 r

ml response s s t is the sum of squares total and s s e is the sum of squared error we trained machine learning models under three environmental variables predictors scenarios i harvest day environmental factors ii average environmental factors and iii average and standard deviation environmental factors harvest day environmental factors present the same frequency used to harvest biomass which varied weekly bi weekly and monthly for the case of average environmental factors we computed each variable s mean values e g radiation temperature salinity for the harvesting period lastly average and standard deviation environmental factors assumed the same harvesting periods as the previous scenario including the predictor s standard deviation as additional variables the specific ml models applied in this study are a regression tree ensemble of trees and gaussian process regression methods in matlab the models hyperparameters and optimization options are described in the next sections 2 3 3 1 regression tree regression trees are binaries decision algorithms that guide the response variable at each step by inspecting the predictor s value breiman et al 1984 to improve ml model s accuracy we tuned the hyperparameter minimum leaf size within a searching range from 1 to 23 a lower minimum leaf size results in fine trees with more branches to guide the decisions and a higher minimum leaf size results in coarse trees with fewer branches that result in lower computational cost we used a bayesian optimization method and 100 iterations obtaining the best regression metrics during the training and cross validation process using a minimum leaf size of four the prediction speed was approximately 4000 observations per second and the training time 160 24 s the resulted regression tree diagram is included in the supplementary information fig a 1 and the validation and testing results are presented in section 3 3 2 3 3 2 ensemble of trees the ensemble of trees using the bagging predictors method can provide accuracy improvement using multiple tree versions learners to obtain aggregated predictors and averaged outcomes breiman 1996 we tuned the hyperparameters minimum leaf size number of learners and number of predictors to sample for this method the searching ranges for these hyperparameters were 1 to 23 10 to 500 and 1 to 5 we used a bayesian optimization method and 100 iterations obtaining the best regression metrics during the training and cross validation process using four minimum leaf size 15 number of learners and 5 number of predictors to sample the prediction speed was 3700 observations per second and the training time 438 75 s the resulted 15 regression tree learners are included in the supplementary information fig

candela et al 2007 rasmussen and williams 2006 the signal standard deviation was 2 38 and we tuned the basis function e g constant zero and linear kernel function e g non isotropic isotropic kernel

speed was approximately 13 000 observations per second and the training time 256 83 s the validation and testing results are presented in section 3 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 multi year biomass productivity and compositional variation algae biomass production using attached algae flow ways was assessed over a two year period at corpus christ tx sourcing water from the upper laguna madre triplicate measurements of ash free biomass productivity values meas bp along with their average avg meas bp across the duration of the experiment represented as afdw are shown on a weekly basis in fig 1 a the weekly productivity values are quite dynamic indicating periods of high and low productivity and often doubling or halving from one week to the next however biomass productivity on the flow ways throughout the years showed a seasonal oscillating trend with the highest peak in summer and the lowest peak in winter as anticipated the oscillating trend of biomass productivity without minor variances between each data point was developed through the non linear regression and shown as a sinusoidal biomass productivity sinusoidal bp in fig 1a the reduced model successfully represents the oscillating biomass productivity with the highest productivity of around 10 g m2 day in summer and the lowest productivity of around 4 g m2 day in winter to investigate the seasonal variation of biomass productivities data were grouped into eight total seasons 3 months for each season march to may for spring june to august for summer september to november for fall and december to february for winter and box plots represent productivities for the algae flow ways in those seasons as shown in fig 1b in this study both weather and water quality data were considered as environmental driving factors for biomass production specifically included weather and water quality data were air temperature precipitation and total and maximum global horizontal solar irradiation tgh and max gh as weather data fig 2 a and b respectively and ph salinity dissolved oxygen do and its saturation level and turbidity as water quality data fig 2c d e and f respectively in agreement with results from previous ats trials biomass productivity generally followed the trend of oscillating solar irradiation and ambient air temperature throughout the year d aiuto et al 2015 interestingly initial biomass productivity was low despite the favorable summer conditions but gradually increased until the following summer 2017 this initial lag phase may have been due to the presence of benthic diatoms that initially populated the flow way gradually however green alga became predominant over the diatoms resulting in higher productivities that followed a more normal oscillating trend throughout the year fig 3 in addition to productivity biomass composition is an important variable that determines the possible applications for the biomass collected from ats systems derose et al 2019 kim et al 2019 fig 4 a and b show the change in biomass composition across the cultivation period initially the ash content of the harvested dry biomass was high approximately 70 of the dry weight and later reduced to an average around 60 w w after a noticeable decline throughout the cultivation higher ash content in early cultivation is presumably due to the predominance of benthic diatom pioneer species consistent with the lag phase associated with the initial 1 week average biomass productivities aston et al 2018 the result of the compositional analysis showed similar trends as that of ash content analysis crude carbohydrate content was high across the duration of the experiment 70 w w and increased further to around 80 in later months of the experiment over the same period protein content gradually decreased from around 30 to 20 while the lipid content remained low 1 this phenomenon can be explained in two possible reasons 1 a shift in the major ecological community from diatoms to carbohydrate rich green algae such as ulva species 2 and a result of the production and accumulation of extracellular polymeric substance eps which mainly consists of polysaccharides due to the maturation of biofilm over time flemming and wingender 2010 ge and champagne 2017 klein et al 2014 despite the significant gradual change no correlative variation in ash content or biomass composition with respect to environmental change was observed thus biomass composition was not considered as a dependent variable for further regression analysis and modeling however further investigation is suggested for a more accurate understanding of impact environmental conditions will have on ash content and biomass composition furthermore nutrient recovery rate was evaluated based on the nitrogen and phosphorus content of biomass table s1 provides important metrics for evaluating the potential nutrient recovery efficiency of the system as well as a list of other studies conducted on nutrient recovery from rivers or other surface waters located in the united states over the last decade for more detailed comparison one of the key advantages of the attached algae flow way system is its capability of utilizing both major nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus simultaneously at an appropriate ratio which is essential to control eutrophication without causing any downstream harm to ecosystems conley et al 2009 in this study approximately 300 500 mg m2 day of total nitrogen and 15 30 mg m2 day of total phosphorus recovery rate was obtained although it is difficult to make direct comparisons with other studies estimated nutrient recovery rates were generally favorable and correlated with comparably higher biomass productivity however other surveyed studies have not shown any meaningful correlation between biomass productivity or nutrient recovery rates with nutrient concentration of the source water which is presumably due to one of the key advantage of attached algae flow way system i e it s capability to stably utilize nutrients from the source water and produce biomass with minimal impact from variation in nutrient concentration so long as they are not limiting adey et al 2013 kangas et al 2017 3 2 effect of environmental factors on biomass productivity algal biomass production depends on various environmental factors thus understanding the relationship between factors by employing various multivariate techniques has been conducted previously for various algal biomass cultivation scenarios however to our knowledge application of these techniques has not been detailed in the literature for attached algae systems wallace et al 2016 in this study pca was employed to understand correlations between various environmental factors and biomass productivity a biplot showing the corresponding pca decomposition result is depicted in fig 5 the biplot is composed of the first two principle components obtained from the analysis pc1 and pc2 which explain 65 54 of the variance of the full data set contributions from each variable to each principal component were determined based on their eigenvalues and squared cosines table s2 major contributors for pc1 were tgh max gh air temperature salinity and ph and those for pc2 were do and saturation among pc1 contributors tgh max gh and air temperature were closely correlated to each other while salinity and ph as well as do and saturation in pc2 were less likely to be correlated to each other precipitation and turbidity were not included in either of the major principal components the result of the pca indicates that pc1 is positively correlated with both measured and sinusoidal fits of biomass productivities as a part of the biplot we observed that biomass productivities in summer which is higher than in any other seasons are clustered around the positive side of horizontal pc1 axis while those in winter which have low biomass productivities were clustered around the negative side of pc1 axis biomass productivities in june 2018 which were the highest observed during the trial were clustered around the negative side of vertical pc2 axis possibly due to the significant drop of do and saturation values in june 2018 these clusters of biomass productivities are also expressed as vectors in the biplot due to the high productivities in june 2018 a vector of the measured biomass productivity skews toward the pc2 axis in the correlation circle plot for photoautotrophs like algae positive correlations with solar energy and temperature are due to the enhancement of photosynthetic activity and metabolic activity up to a threshold gross and wen 2014 kim et al 2020 mazzelli et al 2020 schultze et al 2015 toninelli et al 2016 positive relationships between biomass productivity and those environmental factors contributed to pc1 in this study have been widely reported regardless of cultivation methods adey et al 2013 gross and wen 2014 mazzelli et al 2020 the other two pc1 contributors ph and salinity are also very critical water quality factors in algal growth solubility and availability of co2 and nutrients are dependent on the ph of the source water thus ph is critical particularly to photoautotrophs qiu et al 2017 salinity is also important especially for estuarine algal species conley et al 2009 kamer and fong 2000 kamer k et al reported that the impact of salinity level on growth of estuarine algal species enteromorpha intestinalis was significant and reduced salinity level negatively affected its growth kamer and fong 2000 salinity level not only has a direct impact on algae but also has an impact on dissolved phosphorus of estuaries which supports algal growth conley et al 2009 in general salinity was high in summer while low in winter of both years 2017 and 2018 in this context general trends of increased salinity were presumably due to increased evaporation from the warm ambient air while small drops in salinity might be caused by rainfall events alternatively two other important environmental factors dissolved oxygen do and its saturation value resulted in the least relevant to biomass productivity among other factors increase in do often indicates an increment of aerobic respiration due to high photoautotrophic activity in the water rincon et al 2017 saturation value generally follows the value of dissolved oxygen but also depends on other environmental factors such as temperature and ph thus do and saturation appeared to be not closely correlated in typical suspended cultivation system maintaining low do and saturation level is a key in algal cultivation to avoid algal growth inhibition removing dissolved oxygen is often considered a bigger constraint than supplying carbon dioxide jiménez et al 2003 molina et al 2001 sierra et al 2008 however in the case of an attached algae flow way the shallow turbulent medium provides vigorous gas exchange with ambient air to constantly maintain low level of dissolved oxygen and sufficient level of carbon dioxide in the water in this study do and saturation level during cultivation period were within tolerable range well below the inhibitory level which made them less impactful on biomass productivity than other pc1 contributors the rest of the environmental factors precipitation and turbidity showed no correlation with any other factors in fact they were major contributors of pc3 and pc4 data not shown precipitation was expected to be one of the highest influential factors for biomass productivity under the hypothesis that in an agricultural area a rainfall event would cause an influx of nutrients from runoff into the local surface water the lack of association between precipitation and biomass productivity is presumably due to the lack of important information such as detailed geographical information around the cultivation site and the difficulty in quantifying the runoff associated with each precipitation event kleinman et al 2006 liu et al 2014 3 3 machine learning predictive capability for biomass productivity this section presents the training validation and testing results of three ml methods to investigate their predictive capabilities of recovered biomass at corpus christi tx including the regression tree ensemble of trees and gpr based on the pca s results contributors of pc1 tgh max gh air temperature ph and salinity were considered to have a more significant impact on biomass productivity than other factors therefore were used to train and cross validate ml models to maximize their accuracy fig 6 illustrates the regression tree ensemble of tree and gpr models predicted values against the flow ways measured biomass productivity meas bp to assess whether ml models generalize regression metrics under different weather and water quality conditions we used the training datasets cross validation and testing dataset not used for training we used rmse as it emphasizes errors and outliers during training and validation and present the same units of the response variable the gpr model showed the highest rmse 2 17 g m2 day using the training and validation dataset relative to other ml methods and resulted in the lowest rmse 1 78 g m2 day and highest r2 0 74 when comparing against testing data one can intuitively perceive this regression metric improvement as an advantage of this ml approach however differences in the regression metrics against different training and testing datasets suggest the model has lower predictive capability than other methods and could increase the error when exposed to a third dataset the regression tree and ensemble of tree models on the other hand presented more consistent regression metrics when comparing the predictive biomass productivity against the experimental datasets suggesting they can generalize results under different operating conditions the supplementary information shows that harvest day environmental factors in the training and cross validation process when applying the ensemble of trees method resulted in the most consistent regression metrics compared to other datasets not seen before by the model fig s4 fig s5 and table s3 the regression tree and ensemble of tree diagrams in the supplementary information illustrate the predictors used throughout binary decisions fig s2 and fig s3 in these diagrams the predictors with higher frequency in such decisions are considered essential to predicting the model s response variable for instance in the regression tree tgh contributes to 67 of decisions air temperature contributes to 13 of decisions salinity contributes to 11 of decisions and ph contributed to 9 of decisions likewise in the ensemble of tree tgh contributed to most decisions 51 followed by air temperature 18 salinity 17 max gh 8 and ph 6 quiroz arita et al 2020 presented similar results from mechanistic thermal and algae growth dynamical systems in open channel raceways where incident radiation and water temperature drive photo respiration and biomass productivity quiroz arita et al 2020 however we have a limited understanding of inhibiting and growth limiting conditions in attached algae flow ways using non point source nutrients fig 7 illustrates the regression tree ensemble of tree and gpr models predicted values against the triplicated measured biomass productivity datasets from attached algae flow ways in general ml models capture the seasonal pattern of the system using the complete datasets and comparing the predicted biomass productivity against mean measured biomass productivity resulted in rmse values of 1 94 1 93 and 2 08 g m2 day and r2 values of 0 66 0 66 and 0 64 for the regression tree ensemble of tree and gpr models respectively as anticipated the gpr presented differences in its regression metrics when using different variations of datasets the regression tree and ensemble of tree are more consistent in their metrics and appear to have more predictive capability of biomass productivity in the algae flow way 4 conclusion long term operation of attached algae flow ways was successfully achieved with continuous multi year biomass production and recovery of non point source nutrients from estuarine surface water this study investigated environmental impacts on biomass productivity and demonstrated the predictive capability of ml at the production site using regression tree and ensemble of tree methods these data and analyses are provided to inform local farmers and policymakers to quantify potential biomass production as a bioresource and a means to prevent algal blooms the results discussed in this study establish the potential of algae flow ways compared to other existing and emerging technologies to alleviate the growing impacts of nutrient pollution around the globe while sustainably providing biomass as a renewable source of energy and other valuable products it is suggested that the biomass productivity model be validated through harmonized field studies to be applicable for accurate prediction of the nutrient interception and biomass productivity performance of attached algae flow ways at various scales lastly an in depth understanding of the microbial ecology of the algae flow way system and its impact on biomass productivity and

17226,the purpose of this study is to determine the potential for an attached algae flow way system to efficiently produce algal biomass in estuarine surface waters by utilizing dilute non point source nutrients from local urban industrial and agricultural discharges into the upper laguna madre corpus christi texas the study was conducted over the course of two years to establish seasonal base line biomass productivity and composition for bioproducts applications and to identify key environmental factors and flow way cohorts impacting biomass production for the entire cultivation period continuous ash free biomass production at 4 to 10 g m2 day corresponding to nutrient recovery at 300 to 500 mg of nitrogen m2 day and 15 to 30 mg of phosphorus m2 day was successfully achieved without system restart upon start up a latency period was observed which indicates roles for species succession from relatively low productivity high ash content pioneer periphytic culture composed primarily of benthic diatoms from the source waters to higher productivity reduced ash content and more resilient culture mainly composed of filamentous chlorophyta ulva lactuca principal component analysis pca was used to identify environmental factors driving biomass production and machine learning ml models were constructed to assess the predictive capability of the data set for system performance using the local multi season environmental variations environmental datasets were segregated for ml training validation and testing using three methods regression tree ensemble regression and gaussian process regression gpr the predicted ash free biomass productivity using ml models resulted in root squared mean errors rsme from 1 78 to 1 86 g m2 day and r2 values from 0 67 to 0 75 using different methods the greatest contributor to net productivity was total solar irradiation followed by air temperature salinity and ph the results of the study should be useful as a decision making tool to application of attached algae flow ways for biomass production while preventing algal blooms in the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords attached algae flow way long term biomass production machine learning principal component analysis nutrient recovery algal turf scrubber 1 introduction as global agricultural output continues to rise in support of growing human population the associated increase in major nutrient pollution nitrogen and phosphorus is increasingly stressing key planetary boundaries and has had observable impacts on global biogeochemical cycles howarth et al 2000 increased nutrient loading in aquatic ecosystems can have a variety of negative impacts most notably an increased risk of harmful algae bloom hab events glibert 2017 glibert et al 2005 while the web of factors that cause habs is complex there is a growing consensus that increased nutrient loading broadly leads to increased phytoplankton productivity and increased risk of hab events and subsequent eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems anderson et al 2002 glibert et al 2006 kudela et al 2008 visser et al 2016 in particular non point source emissions from agricultural runoff which contain much lower and more inconsistent concentrations of nutrients continue to be difficult problems to address arita et al 2015 force 2017 mueller and spahr 2005 these challenges are amplified by the effects of climate change which generally result in warmer water temperatures and higher frequency of severe rainfall events in agricultural regions thereby increasing the runoff potential melillo et al 2014 wells et al 2015 to address these challenges there is a clear need for cost effective and scalable technologies that can minimize habs and eutrophication one such technology that has emerged in recent years is attached algae flow way systems also known as algal turf scrubbers ats this technology uses a gently angled flow way channel or flume to cultivate a diverse cohort of periphytic algae to intercept and accumulate nutrient contaminants n p trace metals in surface waters adey us4333263a the algae flow way systems utilize compromised surface waters with nutrient concentrations much lower than those required for recirculating algal raceway pond and have been investigated for application to a range of contaminated surface waters such as effluent from secondary wastewater dairy farms aquaculture and many others craggs et al 1996 d aiuto et al 2015 liu et al 2016 mulbry et al 2008 ray et al 2015 these surface waters generally have adequate levels of co2 and or carbonate which is also otherwise required for recirculating algal raceway pond pizarro et al 2006 the shallow medium contributes to the capability of an attached periphytic culture to achieve relatively high productivities despite lower nutrient concentrations these include high exposed surface to volume ratio s v of cultivation turbulence induced rapid light dark cycles which improves photon utilization efficiency and improved nutrient and gaseous exchange and breakup of boundary layer gradient limitations that otherwise exist among the algal cellular matrix water and atmosphere apel et al 2017 kim et al 2018 in all investigations to date attached algae flow way systems were able to effectively and reliably remove contaminants from the source water although the rates of removal can vary drastically based on environmental factors and engineering parameters of the system which makes it difficult to accurately scale systems and determine total costs and potential return on investment timeframes derose et al 2019 to address these gaps in the research we investigated the potential for the algae flow way technology to bioaccumulate nitrogen phosphorus and carbon in depleted nutrient runoff originating non point source waters in the gulf coast region the algae flow way units were deployed for a two year campaign sourcing water from the upper laguna madre in corpus christi tx to determine expected biomass productivities in this environment additionally we assessed the environmental drivers of biomass productivity in the flow ways using principal component analysis pca and tested the predictive capability of the data using state of the art computational modeling tools with publicly available environmental datasets recent mechanistic approaches have largely been successful in predicting biomass productivity of suspended algae monoculture cultivation systems by incorporating experimentally derived parameters for microbial kinetics inhibiting factors metabolism flow and thermal characteristics in a physics based modeling context cheng et al 2019 gardner et al 2019 quiroz arita et al 2020 2019 quiroz arita et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 however these mechanistic approaches require a more detailed fundamental understanding of the system which is limited for periphytic polycultures in attached algae flow ways based on the complexities in the biological cohort and surface water chemistry machine learning ml approaches on the other hand have gained the attention of many authors to predict water quantity metrics and quality parameters using correlated variables from environmental datasets arnon et al 2019 castrillo and garcía 2020 chen et al 2020 fan et al 2020 hill et al 2020 jouanneau et al 2019 li et al 2020 lu et al 2019 pyo et al 2020 xia et al 2020 xu et al 2020 application of ml approaches using the experimental data gathered in the attached algae flow way trial provided the opportunity to identify intrinsic correlations between the environment and polycultures to predict biomass production that could otherwise contribute to undesired algal blooms to surface waters therefore this work should as succinctly as currently possible encapsulate the results from the two year campaign for understanding the potential for scaled up deployment of the attached algae flow way technology in the upper laguna madre corpus christi tx region 2 materials and methods 2 1 attached algae flow ways and operations deployment of the attached algae flow ways took place at the texas a m agrilife research mariculture laboratory in corpus christi texas figure s1 the facility has direct access to estuarine water from upper laguna madre the entire experiment was carried out using three algae flow way units unit 1 was 0 61 m wide 24 38 m long with a 2 slop and constructed of fiberglass the algae flow way was covered with a 3 d matrix composed of dacron fibers

6 10 m long section the algae flow way was covered with a 3 d matrix material composed of dacron fibers interfaceflor la grange ga and total covered surface area was 9 86 m2 all units featured a single pass flow through design estuarine water from a channel connected to the upper laguna madre was pumped to a head tank then pumped to each flow way at a rate of approximately 189 l min 50 gpm with a dump bucket pulse repetition rate of approximately 20 s 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 biomass productivity and compositional analyses on a weekly basis biomass was mechanically removed from the substrate of each lane using a squeegee mallory ws1524a black window washer and squeegee 15 and a vacuum rigid wet dry shop vacuum 16 gal water flow was halted on the system for the duration of harvests 1 5 h a felt lined fish harvest basket pentair aquatic ecosystems fbk3 was placed at the end of each lane where biomass was collected biomass was allowed to de water in the felt lined fish harvest basket for approximately six hours before being transferred to a tray and dried in an oven model binder ed720 tuttlingen de at 75 c until constant weight was achieved dried samples were ground into a fine powder using a hammer mill model cf198 chippewa falls wi and mixed to ensure that samples were homogeneous ash content was measured by conducting the standard measurement method of ash content in biomass reported by nrel sluiter et al 2005 ash free dry weight of biomass afdw was calculated by subtracting the weight of ash from corresponding dry weight of harvested biomass all the biomass productivity bp used in this study are referred to ash free biomass productivity nitrogen fat and fiber contents were analyzed from new jersey feed lab 1686 5th st ewing township nj protein contents was calculated from nitrogen content by multiplying by 6 25 and crude carbohydrate content was calculated by subtracting everything from 100 phosphorus contents of biomass was estimated using phosphorus contents of periphyton reported from other similar studies adey et al 2013 d aiuto et al 2015 kangas and mulbry 2014 kangas et al 2017 mulbry et al 2010 ray et al 2015 2 2 2 weather and water quality data daily total and maximum global horizontal solar irradiation tgh and max gh respectively data in corpus christi texas during the entire period of experiment were collected from a station at university of texas panamerican solar radiation lab through nrel s measurement and instrumentation data center ramos and andreas 2011 data for daily minimum maximum and average air

the average total nitrogen tn and phosphorus tp content of the source water pumped from upper laguna madre during the entire period of experiment was collected from the surface water quality web reporting tool provided by texas commission on environmental quality tceq 2 3 data analysis and predictive modeling approach to analyze the data obtained from the attached algae flow ways we identified the variables with the highest variance through pca and applied a predictive ml modeling tool of the system the early phase of the cultivation showed a lag phase which did not properly reflect any environmental effect on biomass productivity and was thus neglected for further statistical analyses to investigate correlation between biomass productivity and environmental factors data from 1 4 2017 to 6 25 2018 which resulted in total of 183 observations 61 harvesting points from 3 flow ways were used for further statistical analyses and ml training validation and testing 2 3 1 non linear regression model sinusoidal model the oscillating trend of the measured biomass productivity data was modeled using non linear regression and represented as a sinusoidal curve sinusoidal bp the sinusoidal biomass productivity was developed using eq 1 shown as follow 1 s i n u s o i d a l b p pr 1 pr 2 sin pr 3 dates pr 4 parameters including pr1 pr2 pr3 and pr4 represent the baseline amplitude frequency and an offset of the developed sinusoidal bp model respectively the values for each parameter were 6 804 2 987 0 017 and 42 784 respectively the model parameters were developed to have the minimum residual sum of square value and the maximum coefficient of determination value which were 1398 03 and 0 3719 respectively 2 3 2 principal component analysis pca statistical interpretation of data was conducted using an add on microsoft excel based software addinsoft xlstat statistical and data analysis solution boston usa pca was conducted on datasets of environmental factors including weather data such as total and maximum global horizontal solar irradiation tgh and max gh respectively average daily air temperature air temp daily precipitation precip and water quality data such as dissolved oxygen do saturation ph turbidity and salinity for the observations measured biomass productivity meas bp was used daily biomass productivity within each cultivation period was calculated as the average biomass productivity during corresponding cultivation period the pca type used was the pearson correlation coefficient biomass productivities of all 541 days from january 1st 2017 to jun 25th 2018 were used for the total observations to correspond to all daily environmental factors total observation points were also categorized by seasons winter spring summer and fall with respective data points of 149 184 117 and 91 biomass productivity of days between two harvesting points were assumed to be the same as the average biomass productivity obtained on the following harvesting day a biplot was created as a result and was consist of principal components 1 and 2 pc1 and pc2 explaining about 65 5 of the total variance pc1 has an eigenvalue of 3 793 and accounted for the highest portion of the total variance around 42 1 while pc2 has an eigenvalue of 2 106 and accounted for the second most portion around 23 4 of the total variance 2 3 3 machine learning methods to provide a forecasting tool able to predict the expected bioresource productivity and algal bloom prevention potential we assessed multiple ml models predictive capability using the data from the attached algae flow ways we segregated 75 of the dataset gathered in this study for model training and validation to prevent overfitting during the training process we used 2 fold cross validation to estimate accuracy at each fold to evaluate whether the model generalizes different conditions we used the remaining 25 dataset for testing we selected the features with the highest variance as identified using the pca as the predictors to train the model including i salinity ii total global horizontal radiation iii air temperature iv maximum global horizontal radiation and v ph we used the mean ash free biomass productivity as the response variable of the ml models the performance metrics we present to evaluate the ml models include the root mean square error rmse and r2 1 r

which varied weekly bi weekly and monthly for the case of average environmental factors we computed each variable s mean values e g radiation temperature salinity for the harvesting period lastly average and standard deviation environmental factors assumed the same harvesting periods as the previous scenario including the predictor s standard deviation as additional variables the specific ml models applied in this study are a regression tree ensemble of trees and gaussian process regression methods in matlab the models hyperparameters and optimization options are described in the next sections 2 3 3 1 regression tree regression trees are binaries decision algorithms that guide the response variable at each step by inspecting the predictor s value breiman et al 1984 to improve ml model s accuracy we tuned the hyperparameter minimum leaf size within a searching range from 1 to 23 a lower minimum leaf size results in fine trees with more branches to guide the decisions and a higher minimum leaf size results in coarse trees with fewer branches that result in lower computational cost we used a bayesian optimization method and 100 iterations obtaining the best regression metrics during the training and cross validation process using a minimum leaf size of four the prediction speed was approximately 4000 observations per second and the training time 160 24 s the resulted regression tree diagram is included in the supplementary information fig a 1 and the validation and testing results are presented in section 3 3 2 3 3 2 ensemble of trees the ensemble of trees using the bagging predictors method can provide accuracy improvement using multiple tree versions learners to obtain aggregated predictors and averaged outcomes breiman 1996 we tuned the hyperparameters minimum leaf size number of learners and number of predictors to sample for this method the searching ranges for these hyperparameters were 1 to 23 10 to 500 and 1 to 5 we used a bayesian optimization method and 100 iterations obtaining the best regression metrics during the training and cross validation process using four minimum leaf size 15 number of learners and 5 number

triplicate measurements of ash free biomass productivity values meas bp along with their average avg meas bp across the duration of the experiment represented as afdw are shown on a weekly basis in fig 1 a the weekly productivity values are quite dynamic indicating periods of high and low productivity and often doubling or halving from one week to the next however biomass productivity on the flow ways throughout the years showed a seasonal oscillating trend with the highest peak in summer and the lowest peak in winter as anticipated the oscillating trend of biomass productivity without minor variances between each data point was developed through the non linear regression and shown as a sinusoidal biomass productivity sinusoidal bp in fig 1a the reduced model successfully represents the oscillating biomass productivity with the highest productivity of around 10 g m2 day in summer and the lowest productivity of around 4 g m2 day in winter to investigate the seasonal variation of biomass productivities data were grouped into eight total seasons 3 months for each season march to may for spring june to august for summer september to november for fall and december to february for winter and box plots represent productivities for the algae flow ways in those seasons as shown in fig 1b in this study both weather and water quality data were considered as environmental driving factors for biomass production specifically included weather and water quality data were air temperature precipitation and total and maximum global horizontal solar irradiation tgh and max gh as weather data fig 2 a and b respectively and ph salinity dissolved oxygen do and its saturation level and turbidity as water quality data fig 2c d e and f respectively in agreement with results from previous ats trials biomass productivity generally followed the trend of oscillating solar irradiation and ambient air temperature throughout the year d aiuto et al 2015 interestingly initial biomass productivity was low despite the favorable summer conditions but gradually increased until the following summer 2017 this initial lag phase may have been due to the presence of benthic diatoms that initially populated the flow way gradually however green alga became predominant over the diatoms resulting in higher productivities that followed a more normal oscillating trend throughout the year fig 3 in addition to productivity biomass composition is an important variable that determines the possible applications for the biomass collected from ats systems derose et al 2019 kim et al 2019 fig 4 a and b show the change in biomass composition across the cultivation period initially the ash content of the harvested dry biomass was high approximately 70 of the dry weight and later reduced to an average around 60 w w after a noticeable decline throughout the cultivation higher ash content in early cultivation is presumably due to the predominance of benthic diatom pioneer species consistent with the lag phase associated with the initial 1 week average biomass productivities aston et al 2018 the result of the compositional analysis showed similar trends as that of ash content analysis crude carbohydrate content was high across the duration of the experiment 70 w w and increased further to around 80 in later months of the experiment over the same period protein content gradually decreased from around 30 to 20 while the lipid content remained low 1 this phenomenon can be explained in two possible reasons 1 a shift in the major ecological community from diatoms to carbohydrate rich green algae such as ulva species 2 and a result of the production and accumulation of extracellular polymeric substance eps which mainly consists of polysaccharides due to the maturation of biofilm over time flemming and wingender 2010 ge and champagne 2017 klein et al 2014 despite the significant gradual change no correlative variation in ash content or biomass composition with respect to environmental change was observed thus biomass composition was not considered as a dependent variable for further regression analysis and modeling however further investigation is suggested for a more accurate understanding of impact environmental conditions will have on ash content and biomass composition furthermore nutrient recovery rate was evaluated based on the nitrogen and phosphorus content of biomass table s1 provides important metrics for evaluating the potential nutrient recovery efficiency of the system as well as a list of other studies conducted on nutrient recovery from rivers or other surface waters located in the united states over the last decade for more detailed comparison one of the key advantages of the attached algae flow way system is its capability of utilizing both major nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus simultaneously at an appropriate ratio which is essential to control eutrophication without causing any downstream harm to ecosystems conley et al 2009 in this study approximately 300 500 mg m2 day of total nitrogen and 15 30 mg m2 day of total phosphorus recovery rate was obtained although it is difficult to make direct comparisons with other studies estimated nutrient recovery rates were generally favorable and correlated with comparably higher biomass productivity however other surveyed studies have not shown any meaningful correlation between biomass productivity or nutrient recovery rates with nutrient concentration of the source water which is presumably due to one of the key advantage of attached algae flow way system i e it s capability to stably utilize nutrients from the source water and produce biomass with minimal impact from variation in nutrient concentration so long as they are not limiting adey et al 2013 kangas et al 2017 3 2 effect of environmental factors on biomass productivity algal biomass production depends on various environmental factors thus understanding the relationship between factors by employing various multivariate techniques has been conducted previously for various algal biomass cultivation scenarios however to our knowledge application of these techniques has not been detailed in the literature for attached algae systems wallace et al 2016 in this study pca was employed to understand correlations between various environmental factors and biomass productivity a biplot showing the corresponding pca decomposition result is depicted in fig 5 the biplot is composed of the first two principle components obtained from the analysis pc1 and pc2 which explain 65 54 of the variance of the full data set contributions from each variable to each principal component were determined based on their eigenvalues and squared cosines table s2 major contributors for pc1 were tgh max gh air temperature salinity and ph and those for pc2 were do and saturation among pc1 contributors tgh max gh and air temperature were closely correlated to each other while salinity and ph as well as do and saturation in pc2 were less likely to be correlated to each other precipitation and turbidity were not included in either of the major principal components the result of the pca indicates that pc1 is positively correlated with both measured and sinusoidal fits of biomass productivities as a part of the biplot we observed that biomass productivities in summer which is higher than in any other seasons are clustered around the positive side of horizontal pc1 axis while those in winter which have low biomass productivities were clustered around the negative side of pc1 axis biomass productivities in june 2018 which were the highest observed during the trial were clustered around the negative side of vertical pc2 axis possibly due to the significant drop of do and saturation values in june 2018 these clusters of biomass productivities are also expressed as vectors in the biplot due to the high productivities in june 2018 a vector of the measured biomass productivity skews toward the pc2 axis in the correlation circle plot for photoautotrophs like algae positive correlations with solar energy and temperature are due to the enhancement of photosynthetic activity and metabolic activity up to a threshold gross and wen 2014 kim et al 2020 mazzelli et al 2020 schultze et al 2015 toninelli et al 2016 positive relationships between biomass productivity and those environmental factors contributed to pc1 in this study have been widely reported regardless of cultivation methods adey et al 2013 gross and wen 2014 mazzelli et al 2020 the other two pc1 contributors ph and salinity are also very critical water quality factors in algal growth solubility and availability of co2 and nutrients are dependent on the ph of the source water thus ph is critical particularly to photoautotrophs qiu et al 2017 salinity is also important especially for estuarine algal species conley et al 2009 kamer and fong 2000 kamer k et al reported that the impact of salinity level on growth of estuarine algal species enteromorpha intestinalis was significant and reduced salinity level negatively affected its growth kamer and fong 2000 salinity level not only has a direct impact on algae but also has an impact on dissolved phosphorus of estuaries which supports algal growth conley et al 2009 in general salinity was high in summer while low in winter of both years 2017 and 2018 in this context general trends of increased salinity were presumably due to increased evaporation from the warm ambient air while small drops in salinity might be caused by rainfall events alternatively two other important environmental factors dissolved oxygen do and its saturation value resulted in the least relevant to biomass productivity among other factors increase in do often indicates an increment of aerobic respiration due to high photoautotrophic activity in the water rincon et al 2017 saturation value generally follows the value of dissolved oxygen but also depends on other environmental factors such as temperature and ph thus do and saturation appeared to be not closely correlated in typical suspended cultivation system maintaining low do and saturation level is a key in algal cultivation to avoid algal growth inhibition removing dissolved oxygen is often considered a bigger constraint than supplying carbon dioxide jiménez et al 2003 molina et al 2001 sierra et al 2008 however in the case of an attached algae flow way the shallow turbulent medium provides vigorous gas exchange with ambient air to constantly maintain low level of dissolved oxygen and sufficient level of carbon dioxide in the water in this study do and saturation level during cultivation period were within tolerable range well below the inhibitory level which made them less impactful on biomass productivity than other pc1 contributors the rest of the environmental factors precipitation and turbidity showed no correlation with any other factors in fact they were major contributors of pc3 and pc4 data not shown precipitation was expected to be one of the highest influential factors for biomass productivity under the hypothesis that in an agricultural area a rainfall event would cause an influx of nutrients from runoff into the local surface water the lack of association between precipitation and biomass productivity is presumably due to the lack of important information such as detailed geographical information around the cultivation site and the difficulty in quantifying the runoff associated with each precipitation event kleinman et al 2006 liu et al 2014 3 3 machine learning predictive capability for biomass productivity this section presents the training validation and testing results of three ml methods to investigate their predictive capabilities of recovered biomass at corpus christi tx including the regression tree ensemble of trees and gpr based on the pca s results contributors of pc1 tgh max gh air temperature ph and salinity were considered to have a more significant impact on biomass productivity than other factors therefore were used to train and cross validate ml models to maximize their accuracy fig 6 illustrates the regression tree ensemble of tree and gpr models predicted values against the flow ways measured biomass productivity meas bp to assess whether ml models generalize regression metrics under different weather and water quality conditions we used the training datasets cross validation and testing dataset not used for training we used rmse as it emphasizes errors and outliers during training and validation and present the same units of the response variable the gpr model showed the highest rmse 2 17 g m2 day using the training and validation dataset relative to other ml methods and resulted in the lowest rmse 1 78 g m2 day and highest r2 0 74 when comparing against testing data one can intuitively perceive this regression metric improvement as an advantage of this ml approach however differences in the regression metrics against different training and testing datasets suggest the model has lower predictive capability than other methods and could increase the error when exposed to a third dataset the regression tree and ensemble of tree models on the other hand presented more consistent regression metrics when comparing the predictive biomass productivity against the experimental datasets suggesting they can generalize results under different operating conditions the supplementary information shows that harvest day environmental factors in the training and cross validation process when applying the ensemble of trees method resulted in the most consistent regression metrics compared to other datasets not seen before by the model fig s4 fig s5 and table s3 the regression tree and ensemble of tree diagrams in the supplementary information illustrate the predictors used throughout binary decisions fig s2 and fig s3 in these diagrams the predictors with higher frequency in such decisions are considered essential to predicting the model s response variable for instance in the regression tree tgh contributes to 67 of decisions air temperature contributes to 13 of decisions salinity contributes to 11 of decisions and ph contributed to 9 of decisions likewise in the ensemble of tree tgh contributed to most decisions 51 followed by air temperature 18 salinity 17 max gh 8 and ph 6 quiroz arita et al 2020 presented similar results from mechanistic thermal and algae growth dynamical systems in open channel raceways where incident radiation and water temperature drive photo respiration and biomass productivity quiroz arita et al 2020 however we have a limited understanding of inhibiting and growth limiting conditions in attached algae flow ways using non point source nutrients fig 7 illustrates the regression tree ensemble of tree and gpr models predicted values against the triplicated measured biomass productivity datasets from attached algae flow ways in general ml models capture the seasonal pattern of the system using the complete datasets and comparing the predicted biomass productivity against mean measured biomass productivity resulted in rmse values of 1 94 1 93 and 2 08 g m2 day and r2 values of 0 66 0 66 and 0 64 for the regression tree ensemble of tree and gpr models respectively as anticipated the gpr presented differences in its regression metrics when using different variations of datasets the regression tree and ensemble of tree are more consistent in their metrics and appear to have more predictive capability of biomass productivity in the algae flow way 4 conclusion long term operation of attached algae flow ways was successfully achieved with continuous multi year biomass production and recovery of non point source nutrients from estuarine surface water this study investigated environmental impacts on biomass productivity and demonstrated the predictive capability of ml at the production site using regression tree and ensemble of tree methods these data and analyses are provided to inform local farmers and policymakers to quantify potential biomass production as a bioresource and a means to prevent algal blooms the results discussed in this study establish the potential of algae flow ways compared to other existing and emerging technologies to alleviate the growing impacts of nutrient pollution around the globe while sustainably providing biomass as a renewable source of energy and other valuable products it is suggested that the biomass productivity model be validated through harmonized field studies to be applicable for accurate prediction of the nutrient interception and biomass productivity performance of attached algae flow ways at various scales lastly an in depth understanding of the microbial ecology of the algae flow way system and its impact on biomass productivity and nutrient recovery rate will be crucial to improve the overall performance of attached algae systems and should be a focus of future work declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

17227,physiography and land use patterns influence streams water quality by affecting non point source nps pollution process however each landscape factor may affect the nps pollution process differently with the variations of the spatial scale and season thus quantitative analysis of each landscape metrics scale effect and determination of the abrupt change point in the relationship between stream water quality and the metrics is very helpful for landscape planning of water quality protection based on water quality monitoring data for four years in 12 sub watersheds of a typical headwater watershed in eastern china we adopted regular and partial redundancy methods to quantify the spatial scale effects and seasonal dependence of various landscape metrics impact on stream water quality and then to identify the abrupt change point of the water quality along the gradient of landscape metrics results revealed that the pure effects of different categories of landscape metrics on stream water quality were in the following order landscape configuration metrics 20 5 31 6 physiographic metrics 4 0 15 9 landscape composition metrics 3 2 7 5 the spatial scale effect of physiography impact on stream water quality was the most significant while the impact of landscape configuration on water quality had the highest seasonal sensitivity the overall water quality variation was better explained by buffer zone scale than by catchment scale landscape characteristics and this phenomenon was more obvious during the wet season than during the dry season in the studied watershed we identified the largest patch index of farmland lpi far and the landscape shape index of forest lsi for as the key landscape metrics at sub watershed scale and buffer zone scale respectively the lpi far 7 0 at the sub watershed scale and lsi for 5 5 at the buffer zone scale were suggested as the preferred landscape planning parameters to protect the stream water quality efficiently results indicated that to protect water quality landscape regulation should follow the scale adaptability measures and consider the landscape thresholds which cause abrupt changes in water quality keywords stream water quality landscape metrics spatial scales effects seasonal sensitivity analysis partial redundancy analysis nonparametric change point analysis 1 introduction water quality degradation is a global environmental problem which can be attributed to the interaction of natural and anthropogenic factors such as climate change vegetation characteristics land use and pollutant discharge ai et al 2015 rutledge and chow fraser 2019 due to many influence factors and complex processes involved water quality variation over a range of temporal and spatial scales depending on which factors are the most dominant ones kändler et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a identifying such factors within the watershed and understanding the water quality responses will help managers prioritize landscape measures and achieve a positive outcome faster bere et al 2016 de mello et al 2018 the influences of land use pattern including landscape composition the ratio of various land uses and landscape configuration the spatial structure of different land uses on water quality are well studied mello et al 2017 shibata et al 2018 xu et al 2019a 2019b however the differences in the physiographic features of watersheds are often neglected in most studies dedicated to land use and the corresponding water quality bere et al 2016 zhang et al 2019a few studies identified the pure effects of land cover on water quality defined here as water quality variation alone explained by land use and exclude the shared influence of land use and the other factors the effects of the differences in physiographic features could often be misinterpreted as those caused by land use changes therefore the physiographic metrics landscape composition and configuration metrics need to be considered together and the relevant pure effects of these three categories of landscape metrics on stream water quality also need to be quantified the impacts of landscape characteristics on water quality are complex and depend on seasons and spatial scales shi et al 2017 li et al 2018 zorzal almeida et al 2018 the spatial scale referring to the different areal extent such as buffer and sub watershed scales is often used to correlate the landscape patterns to the stream water quality shi et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a there is however no consensus on which spatial scale landscape characteristics affect water quality the most shi et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a some studies shown that the whole watershed plays a crucial role in determining the impact of anthropogenic activity on water quality ding et al 2016 zhang et al 2019a yet others reported that the landscape characteristics at riparian buffer zones better explain the water quality variability liu et al 2017 shi et al 2017 these inconsistent conclusions might be related to the unique physiographic features of each watershed and different human activities ding et al 2016 li et al 2018 however there is still a lot of data lacking to support these assumptions very few studies quantified the relative efficacy of physical setting and land use patterns in affecting the scale differences in the impact of overall landscape characteristics on water quality in addition the spatial scale effects and seasonal variations of the influences of physiographic metrics landscape composition and configuration metrics on water quality are also not clear the relationships between water quality and landscape metrics might be nonlinear and abruptly changing clément et al 2017 wu and lu 2019 abrupt change points often called abrupt thresholds are defined as the points or zones at which sudden water quality changes occur in response to changing landscape metric values shen et al 2015 these points provide important information needed to design appropriate landscape patterns to protect water quality choosing suitable statistical model is critical to estimate the location of abrupt changepoints different statistical models can lead to varying interpretations of the abrupt changepoint locations or abrupt thresholds king and baker 2010 huo et al 2015 the nonparametric changepoint analysis ncpa is very effective in evaluating the positions of abrupt change points relevant to the water quality parameters and landscape metrics shen et al 2015 wu and lu 2019 the knowledge of the abrupt changepoints is critical because if their corresponding values are surpassed more pollutants entering the river might put the water quality at risk and in some circumstances cause non reversible consequences clément et al 2017 however very little is known about the landscape threshold values causing abrupt changes in water quality thus the land use managers cannot focus their management efforts on these key points the water quality and aquatic ecosystem of rivers in the economically developed and densely populated areas of eastern china have deteriorated seriously wu et al 2018 ma et al 2019 in recent years the water quality of headwater streams which provided clean water to this region has also sharply deteriorated because of the intensified anthropogenic activities zhang et al 2019b this further aggravates downstream water pollution the present study was carried out in the hengxi watershed which is a typical headwater watershed of eastern china the main objectives of this study were to quantify the relative importance as well as the spatial scale effects and seasonal differences in the influence of physiographic metrics landscape composition and configuration on water quality of hengxi headwater watershed we also aimed to identify the abrupt changepoints in water quality as a function of the changing landscape metric based on the previous studies we hypothesized that 1 the landscape configuration metrics would emerge as being dominant factors controlling water quality 2 the influence of these three categories of landscape metrics on water quality would vary with spatial scales and seasons and that their sensitivities to this changes would be different 3 an abrupt change in water quality would occurs along the gradient of landscape metric 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the hengxi watershed 29 2 km2 a tributary headwater of the yongjiang river basin is located in the zhejiang province in eastern china fig 1 the mainstream of the hengxi watershed is 7 3 km long the physiography in the watershed is characterized by saddle shape which is high in the east and west and low in the middle and the elevation ranges from 35 to 624 m this watershed has a typical subtropical monsoon climate the mean annual air temperature and precipitation are 16 2 c and 1564 mm respectively over 60 of precipitation occurs during the monsoon season may to september therefore the whole year could be divided into dry october april and wet may september seasons the major soil types are red earths and paddy soils chinese national soil survey office 1998 the major land use types in this watershed are forest land followed by farmland the human population averaged over the last three years is 8600 the farmland and residential lands in the watershed are concentrated in flat areas near rivers 2 2 data collection and processing 2 2 1 stream water quality monitoring we established twelve sampling sites located in the mainstream and tributaries of the hengxi headwater watershed each sampling site belonged to an outlet of the independent catchment fig 1 monthly samples were taken at all 12 locations from october 2016 to october 2019 each sampling took one day to represent the contribution of the nps pollution of stormwater runoff the sample collection on a monthly basis occurred a day after a rain event that produced surface runoff water samples were collected using a small bucket from the middle of the stream 0 5 m below the water surface six water quality parameters major nps pollutants and important indicators of anthropogenic water pollutants were chosen for measurement during and after sampling zhang et al 2019a dissolved oxygen do content was measured in situ by a handheld multiparameter analyzer fabricated by merck co germany the other five water physio chemical parameters including the total nitrogen tn nitrate and ammonia nitrogen no3 n and nh4 n respectively chemical oxygen demand codmn and total phosphorus tp were measured in the laboratory water samples collected from the streams were transferred to a 250 ml polythene bottle and immediately preserved with sulfuric acid until ph 2 the samples were stored at 4 c until analysis which was conducted within 24 h the tn was analyzed using the potassium persulfate digestion method combined with uv spectrophotometry performed by the double beam uv visible instrument g 9 the nh4 n analysis was performed using the indophenol blue colorimetry the no3 n content was measured using uv spectrophotometry the codmn content was determined using the acidic potassium permanganate method the amount of tp was measured using ammonium molybdate spectrophotometry 2 2 2 spatial scale groping and landscape metrics to quantify the scale effects of landscape metrics impact on the stream water quality the watershed was divided into two scale groups sub watershed scale group and the 100 m buffer zone scale group which was a 100 m wide section of each side along the entire upstream above the sample site the boundaries of the hydrological unit were outlined first by the arcswat software using digital elevation model dem with a 10 10 m grid resolution a digital stream network of the watershed and sampling sites fig 1 then the watershed was divided into 12 sub watersheds based on the connections of the hydrological units six of the sub watersheds comprised of individual hydrological unit sub watershed s4 s5 s7 s10 s11 and s12 while the rest was composed of two or more individual hydrological units sub watershed s1 s2 s3 s6 s8 and s9 see fig 2 the 100 m wide buffer zones on both stream sides were extracted by arcgis 10 2 software esri co usa the buffer width was designated based on field investigation and previous studies sliva and williams 2001 navalopez et al 2016 the landscape characteristic metrics were measured from the aspects of physiography landscape composition and landscape configuration the detailed description in table 1 the physiographic metrics including slope gradient slope basin relief hd hypsometric integral hi topographic wetness index twi and flow path length fpl were calculated based on the dem data using the spatial analysis tools of the arcgis 10 2 software the 1 40 000 land use land cover map for 2016 was derived from the ningbo academy of agricultural sciences and then manually digitized by the arcgis 10 2 software six land uses and land cover types were classified as forest land garden plot waterbody farmland residential land and road fig 1 because the road percentage was less than 2 the road category was not included in further analysis the calculated landscape composition metrics were shown as the percentages of the different land uses the landscape configuration metrics including patch density pd landscape shape index lsi largest patch index lpi as well as interspersion and juxtaposition index iji were calculated at the class level using the fragstat 4 0 software mcgarigal et al 2012 these landscape configuration metrics were applied to quantify land use spatial structure from the different aspects of land use types such as density shape dominance and distribution ding et al 2016 zhang et al 2019a all the landscape characteristic metrics were extracted at both the buffer and the sub watershed scales 2 3 statistical analysis we used the kolmogorov smirnov test to examine the normality of water quality data collected for each sampling site we also used the independent sample t test to compare the seasonal differences in nutrient concentrations shi et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a we determined variance in water quality parameters at different sites by one way anova p 0 05 detrended correspondence analysis dca was first used to analyze water quality data to determine whether linear or unimodal models were adopted the dca results showed that the longest gradient length of the four ordination axes was 3 thus the redundancy analysis rda was adopted to determine the positive negative relationship between landscape metrics and water quality parameters li et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a to remove collinearity among the landscape metrics the rda was performed two times first all the landscape characteristic metrics were used as explanatory variables during which the variables were selected based on the significance test their importance and the outcome of the variance inflation factors inspection vip 20 the second rda was performed using the landscape metrics obtained after the first rda a monte carlo permutation test n 499 was used during rda analysis to test for significance braak and smilauer 2012 partial rda prda was further applied to clarify and determine the relative importance and pure effects of the physiography landscape composition and landscape configuration on water quality the prda can quantify the unique and shared contributions of different categories of the landscape metrics to the total variance dalu et al 2017 the shared variation was obtained by subtracting the unique variations of each group of explanatory variables from the total variation explained by all explanatory variables bere et al 2016 the rda and prda were performed using the canoco 4 5 software microcomputer power co usa the nonparametric change point analysis ncpa is very useful for determining the abrupt changepoints of dependent variables cao et al 2017 the ncpa can be used to calculate the values of abrupt changepoints possessing bivariate nonlinear nutrient landscape metric relationships we applied ncpa to assess the specific points along the landscape metrics gradient responsible for the abrupt changes of water quality parameter concentrations the deviance reduction method was used for the ncpa to identify the abrupt changepoints huo et al 2015 the ncpa computations were performed as follows first the y 1 y 2 y n were assumed to be the water quality parameter values observed along the ordered landscape metric gradient x 1 x 2 x n then the response variable y1 y2 yn was divided into two groups y1 y2 yi and yi 1 yn 1 i n by the interval points i 1 i n the deviance value of each group was calculated using the formula 1 1 d k 1 m y k μ where d is the deviance m is the sample size and μ is the average of the m observations y k next the deviance redundancy i of ith interval point between the two groups was calculated using eq 2 the i of each probable changepoint t 1 t n was always greater than or equal to 0 finally the ith value at which maximum i was achieved was identified as the abrupt change point t 2 δ i d d i d i where d d i and d i are the deviance of the data y1 y2 yn y1 y2 yi and yi 1 yn respectively the actual observation data is usually very limited therefore the ncpa was combined with the bootstrap method to calculate the probability of the positions at which the abrupt changes occurred qian et al 2003 huo et al 2015 we extracted 1000 random samples from the raw water quality parameter landscape metric data set using the bootstrap simulation method the ncpa combined with bootstrap method was performed using the matlab r2014 software released by mathworks co usa 3 results 3 1 spatial and seasonal variation of water quality the t test analysis of the independent samples showed that most water quality parameters except nh4 n and tp had noticeable seasonal variations p 0 05 table 2 the concentrations of tn nh4 n no3 n tp and cod were generally higher during the wet season while do concentration was higher during the dry season fig 3 the one way anona showed that all selected water quality parameters except do had noticeable spatial changes in the wet season p 0 05 no significant spatial variations of no3 n and do were observed in the dry season fig 3 the spatial variability of water quality parameters varied with seasons the highest median concentration of tn no3 n and tp appeared at site 8 characterized by intense human activities the lowest median concentrations of tn no3 n nh4 n and cod appeared at site 4 which is the vast forest area and possesses the highest vegetation cover rate 3 2 differences in landscape metrics within different scales the landscape changes at the sub watershed scale and buffer scale were analyzed as shown in table 3 the average values of slope hd and fpl were higher at the watershed scale while twi values were higher at the buffer zone scale forest and farmlands were the dominant landscape types at the two spatial scales the percentage of forest within the buffer zones declined compared to the value at sub watershed scale whereas the percentage of farmland increased the average values of each landscape configuration metrics except pd of various land uses and lpi of farmland and water were generally higher at the sub watershed than at the buffer scale for example the average value of lpi of forest lpi for reached 51 at the sub watershed scale and the average value was 13 1 at the buffer zone scale however the average value of pd of forest reached 68 6 at the buffer zone scale while the average value was only 12 9 at the sub watershed scale 3 3 effects of landscape metrics on the water quality the rda results demonstrated the seasonal and spatial differences in the impact of overall landscape characteristics on water quality table 4 and fig 4 the selected landscape metrics explained over 61 6 of water quality variations during the wet season the total explanatory power decreased by 4 4 5 2 during the dry season table 4 the landscape metrics at the sub watershed scale explained over 57 2 of the water quality variation which increased by 7 8 8 6 at the buffer scale at the sub watershed scale the most significant explanatory variable was the lpi of the farmland lpi far it explained 22 8 and 37 3 of the water quality variations during dry and wet seasons respectively the lpi far negatively correlated with many water quality parameters e g tn and no3 n during both dry and wet seasons fig 4 at the buffer scale the most important explanatory variable was the lsi of forest lsi for which explained 21 2 and 32 3 of the water quality variations occurring during the dry and wet seasons respectively the lsi for positively correlated with tn and no3 n and do the prda results revealed that the highest contribution to overall water quality variation could be attributed to the landscape configuration which total explained 46 2 51 6 of water quality variations fig 5 the individual contribution of each group to the water quality was in the following order landscape configuration 20 5 31 6 physiographic metrics 4 0 15 9 landscape composition 3 2 7 5 the impact of these three categories of landscape metrics on water quality varied with seasons the seasonal difference in the explanatory ability of landscape configuration for overall water quality variation was the most significant 7 1 11 1 followed by physiography 6 7 7 8 and landscape composition 2 3 2 8 the impact of these three categories of landscape metrics on water quality also varied with spatial scale among which the contribution of physiographic metrics to the overall water quality variation changes the most 4 1 5 2 3 4 abrupt change analysis for the key landscape metrics at different scales since the main objective of water quality management in this headwater watershed is to reduce streams tn concentration we mainly focused on the abrupt changepoints of the relationship between tn concentration and landscape metrics the rda results showed that the lpi far at the sub watershed scale and lsi for at the buffer scale were the key landscape metrics affecting water quality thus we chose these metrics to explore the abrupt changepoints of the tn concentration as lpi far and lsi for increased the tn changepoints distribution along the lpi far and lsi for gradients obtained by 1000 bootstrap simulation using the ncpa method are shown in fig 6 we obtained the probability of an abrupt change in the water quality parameter directly from the cumulative distribution frequency curve in fig 6 the key interval value of lpifar for the abrupt change in the tn concentration during the dry season was 6 0 7 0 fig 6a although tn concentration changed with seasons as lpi far increased the cumulative probability of the sharp decrease in the tn concentration reached to 95 percent at lpi far 7 0 across the seasons fig 6a and 6b the abrupt change interval value of the lsi for ranging between 4 5 and 5 5 was observed for the tn concentration if the value of lsi for exceeded 5 5 the cumulative probability of a sudden increase in the tn concentration would exceed 80 and 90 during the dry and wet seasons respectively fig 6c and 6d respectively there was a 100 probability that tn concentration during both seasons would sharply increase at lsi for 6 6 4 discussion 4 1 water quality variation in relation to the physiographic landscape composition and configuration metrics we used prda to quantify the contribution of different categories of landscape metrics to the overall water quality variation as far as we know no studies provided a comprehensive analysis of the pure effects of physiography landscape composition and configuration on water quality variation most of the previous studies focused on developing multiple regression models of water quality variables response to the landscape metrics without quantifying the relative importance and pure effects of different groups of landscape metrics on water quality li et al 2018 mainali and chang 2018 for example li et al 2018 only reported the ability of the landscape composition and configuration metrics together to explain water quality variation our results further showed that the pure effect of the landscape configuration on water quality variation was 15 8 26 9 and 4 6 26 1 higher than the pure effect of landscape composition and physiography in this headwater watershed respectively fig 5 although observational studies like our limit the mechanism assessment the total water quality variation explained by the landscape composition landscape configuration and physiographic metrics provided us with insights into factors determining overall water quality in headwater streams as we hypothesized in our first hypothesis our results showed that landscape configuration has the most significant contribution to overall water quality variation the consideration of physiographic metrics in this study was important because it strengthened our understanding of the association between land use and water quality general knowledge of which is still limited yu et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 our results showed that the water quality variation was partially attributed to the shared influence of physiography and landscape composition 7 4 14 0 as well as landscape configuration 12 7 31 1 this could be explained by the fact that the physiography can affect water quality by constraining the composition and spatial distribution of land use i e the quantity of pollutants and distribution of pollution source mitsuda and ito 2011 in addition the physiographic characteristics can also affect the impact of land use on stream water quality by determining the pollutants flow paths from non point sources to the river yu et al 2016 our results also showed that the physiographic factors alone explained 4 0 15 9 of the water quality variation in this region physiographic characteristics can affect the total amount of pollutants entering streams by changing surface runoff flow rates and the erosion zhou et al 2017 li et al 2020 thus we should consider the potential role of the physical setting of watersheds in determining the land use pattern impact on water quality yu et al 2016 clément et al 2017 4 2 the influence of seasons and spatial scales the impact of landscape metrics on water quality varies sea sonally yu et al 2016 mainali and chang 2018 our results showed that the impact of landscape metrics on water quality was more evident during the wet season although this conclusion was supported by many previous studies ai et al 2015 shi et al 2017 controversies still exist yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2019a very likely because of seasonal rainfall variations and surface runoff as well as of the difference in dominant landscape metrics shi et al 2017 wu and lu 2019 we further distinguished the seasonal differences in the influence of different categories of landscape metrics on water quality as we second hypothesis states that the impact of these three categories of landscape metrics on water quality varies seasonally and their sensitives to this change are different the effect of landscape configuration on water quality has the most significant seasonal difference fig 5 very likely because the surface runoff flow rate is relatively slow during the dry season this made the impact of the landscape configuration on the surface runoff interception and pollutants absorption significant shi et al 2017 yirigui et al 2019 however large surface runoff produced by frequent heavy rains weakens the regulatory effect of landscape configuration on pollutants during the wet season which enhanced the influence of physiographic features on water quality yu et al 2016 the impact of landscape metrics on water quality also depends on the spatial scale hurley and mazumder 2013 mainali and chang 2018 our results showed that the buffer scale landscape better explained the water quality variation than the sub watershed scale landscape table 4 which agrees with previous research liu et al 2017 li et al 2018 the reason for this phenomenon may be that the riparian zone played a more substantial role in reducing surface runoff and controlling nutrients transportation and retention than the sub watershed scale fernandes et al 2014 casson et al 2019 however some studies made the opposite conclusion the disagreement is very likely related to the spatial resolution of digital maps the unique landscape characteristics of each watershed or the selected water quality variables ding et al 2016 zhang et al 2019a we further distinguished the spatial scale effects of different categories of landscape metrics impact on water quality variation our results were consistent with our second hypothesis that the effects of these three categories of landscape metrics on water quality vary with the spatial scales and that their sensitivities to this change are different the spatial scale effect of the physiographic metrics impact on water quality was the most obvious additionally the spatial scale differences of the impacts of the overall landscape characteristics on water quality were mainly attributed to changes in the influence of physiographic metrics on water quality although the effect of landscape composition and configuration metrics on water quality also varied with the spatial scales this change was not significant considering that the key landscape metrics affecting water quality at different spatial scales were different table 3 and fig 4 we suggested that the landscape planning with the water quality in mind should be considered from a multi scale perspective in hilly headwater watersheds 4 3 abrupt changepoints of the key landscape metrics for landscape planning stream water quality almost invariably responds nonlinearly to the increase of landscape metrics and exhibits threshold responses caused by the landscape pattern shifts shen et al 2015 thus identifying abrupt changepoints where rapid water quality responds to relatively small changes of the environmental driver force is essential for understanding nonlinear dynamics and land use planning in this study the abrupt change threshold in tn concentration as a function of the landscape metric changes was obtained using the cumulative distribution of the changepoints this approach results in reliable assumptions about abrupt thresholds francesco ficetola and denoël 2009 wu and lu 2019 the key threshold of the landscape metrics for the stream water quality improvement obtained in this work supported our third hypothesis numerous studies showed that streams water quality declines as the farmland expands shi et al 2017 de mello et al 2018 some researchers reported that when the farmland exceeds 50 of the corresponding watershed area the deterioration of water quality caused by farming is even worse wang et al 2003 allan 2004 we further studied the abrupt changepoints of the spatial configuration of the farmland landscape since the lpi far negatively correlated with tn concentrations fig 4 increasing the values of lpi far would imply that fewer nutrients migrate to rivers our ncpa results suggest that the lpi far value should be above 7 at the sub watershed scale to reduce tn concentrations in the rivers some scholars studied the thresholds of the spatial configuration of forest land at the watershed scale related to abrupt change in water quality for instance clément et al 2017 concluded that the forest edge density above 36 m ha was beneficial for high water quality wu and lu 2019 reported that the lpi of the forest above 35 could improve the water quality of agricultural watersheds however vegetation cover at the buffer scale is more critical for maintaining and improving river water quality than at the watershed scale de souza et al 2013 shi et al 2017 our results agree with this opinion thus we explored the abrupt changepoints of the lsi for with the most significant contribution to water quality variation at the buffer scale the result showed the value of lsi for should be less than 5 5 which served as the safe range of values at the buffer scale in this watershed if the lsi for is over this value vegetation patches would be more fragmented such forest landscape might not intercept sufficient surface runoff and or absorb nutrients ding et al 2016 yirigui et al 2019 in this case the probability of water quality deterioration will increase rapidly therefore we suggest that the land use managers should consider the abrupt changepoints of landscape metrics during land use and environmental protection goal planning 5 conclusion the impact of landscape characteristics on stream water quality usually has significant spatial scale effects and seasonal differences the accumulated explanatory ability of the selected landscape metrics on overall water quality was better at the buffer scale than at the sub watershed scale and these metrics had a slightly higher correlation with water quality during the wet season than during the wet season such spatially varying were mainly caused by the change in the impact of physiographic metrics on water quality simultaneously the seasonal difference was driven primarily by the impact change of the landscape configuration in this headwater watershed the lpi far and lsi for were the most essential landscape metrics at the sub watershed and the buffer scales respectively when lpi far is below 7 0 at sub watershed scale and or the lsi for is above 5 5 at the buffer scale the stream water quality degradation would significantly accelerate we concluded that it is necessary to analyze the spatial scale effect and seasonal dependence of various landscape characteristics impact on the river water quality to identify the key landscape metrics impacting the river water quality under different spatiotemporal conditions application of the abrupt changepoints of the key landscape metrics matching with the spatiotemporal scale can we achieve the goal of

17227,physiography and land use patterns influence streams water quality by affecting non point source nps pollution process however each landscape factor may affect the nps pollution process differently with the variations of the spatial scale and season thus quantitative analysis of each landscape metrics scale effect and determination of the abrupt change point in the relationship between stream water quality and the metrics is very helpful for landscape planning of water quality protection based on water quality monitoring data for four years in 12 sub watersheds of a typical headwater watershed in eastern china we adopted regular and partial redundancy methods to quantify the spatial scale effects and seasonal dependence of various landscape metrics impact on stream water quality and then to identify the abrupt change point of the water quality along the gradient of landscape metrics results revealed that the pure effects of different categories of landscape metrics on stream water quality were in the following order landscape configuration metrics 20 5 31 6 physiographic metrics 4 0 15 9 landscape composition metrics 3 2 7 5 the spatial scale effect of physiography impact on stream water quality was the most significant while the impact of landscape configuration on water quality had the highest seasonal sensitivity the overall water quality variation was better explained by buffer zone scale than by catchment scale landscape characteristics and this phenomenon was more obvious during the wet season than during the dry season in the studied watershed we identified the largest patch index of farmland lpi far and the landscape shape index of forest lsi for as the key landscape metrics at sub watershed scale and buffer zone scale respectively the lpi far 7 0 at the sub watershed scale and lsi for 5 5 at the buffer zone scale were suggested as the preferred landscape planning parameters to protect the stream water quality efficiently results indicated that to protect water quality landscape regulation should follow the scale adaptability measures and consider the landscape thresholds which cause abrupt changes in water quality keywords stream water quality landscape metrics spatial scales effects seasonal sensitivity analysis partial redundancy analysis nonparametric change point analysis 1 introduction water quality degradation is a global environmental problem which can be attributed to the interaction of natural and anthropogenic factors such as climate change vegetation characteristics land use and pollutant discharge ai et al 2015 rutledge and chow fraser 2019 due to many influence factors and complex processes involved water quality variation over a range of temporal and spatial scales depending on which factors are the most dominant ones kändler et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a identifying such factors within the watershed and understanding the water quality responses will help managers prioritize landscape measures and achieve a positive outcome faster bere et al 2016 de mello et al 2018 the influences of land use pattern including landscape composition the ratio of various land uses and landscape configuration the spatial structure of different land uses on water quality are well studied mello et al 2017 shibata et al 2018 xu et al 2019a 2019b however the differences in the physiographic features of watersheds are often neglected in most studies dedicated to land use and the corresponding water quality bere et al 2016 zhang et al 2019a few studies identified the pure effects of land cover on water quality defined here as water quality variation alone explained by land use and exclude the shared influence of land use and the other factors the effects of the differences in physiographic features could often be misinterpreted as those caused by land use changes therefore the physiographic metrics landscape composition and configuration metrics need to be considered together and the relevant pure effects of these three categories of landscape metrics on stream water quality also need to be quantified the impacts of landscape characteristics on water quality are complex and depend on seasons and spatial scales shi et al 2017 li et al 2018 zorzal almeida et al 2018 the spatial scale referring to the different areal extent such as buffer and sub watershed scales is often used to correlate the landscape patterns to the stream water quality shi et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a there is however no consensus on which spatial scale landscape characteristics affect water quality the most shi et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a some studies shown that the whole watershed plays a crucial role in determining the impact of anthropogenic activity on water quality ding et al 2016 zhang et al 2019a yet others reported that the landscape characteristics at riparian buffer zones better explain the water quality variability liu et al 2017 shi et al 2017 these inconsistent conclusions might be related to the unique physiographic features of each watershed and different human activities ding et al 2016 li et al 2018 however there is still a lot of data lacking to support these assumptions very few studies quantified the relative efficacy of physical setting and land use patterns in affecting the scale differences in the impact of overall landscape characteristics on water quality in addition the spatial scale effects and seasonal variations of the influences of physiographic metrics landscape composition and configuration metrics on water quality are also not clear the relationships between water quality and landscape metrics might be nonlinear and abruptly changing clément et al 2017 wu and lu 2019 abrupt change points often called abrupt thresholds are defined as the points or zones at which sudden water quality changes occur in response to changing landscape metric values shen et al 2015 these points provide important information needed to design appropriate landscape patterns to protect water quality choosing suitable statistical model is critical to estimate the location of abrupt changepoints different statistical models can lead to varying interpretations of the abrupt changepoint locations or abrupt thresholds king and baker 2010 huo et al 2015 the nonparametric changepoint analysis ncpa is very effective in evaluating the positions of abrupt change points relevant to the water quality parameters and landscape metrics shen et al 2015 wu and lu 2019 the knowledge of the abrupt changepoints is critical because if their corresponding values are surpassed more pollutants entering the river might put the water quality at risk and in some circumstances cause non reversible consequences clément et al 2017 however very little is known about the landscape threshold values causing abrupt changes in water quality thus the land use managers cannot focus their management efforts on these key points the water quality and aquatic ecosystem of rivers in the economically developed and densely populated areas of eastern china have deteriorated seriously wu et al 2018 ma et al 2019 in recent years the water quality of headwater streams which provided clean water to this region has also sharply deteriorated because of the intensified anthropogenic activities zhang et al 2019b this further aggravates downstream water pollution the present study was carried out in the hengxi watershed which is a typical headwater watershed of eastern china the main objectives of this study were to quantify the relative importance as well as the spatial scale effects and seasonal differences in the influence of physiographic metrics landscape composition and configuration on water quality of hengxi headwater watershed we also aimed to identify the abrupt changepoints in water quality as a function of the changing landscape metric based on the previous studies we hypothesized that 1 the landscape configuration metrics would emerge as being dominant factors controlling water quality 2 the influence of these three categories of landscape metrics on water quality would vary with spatial scales and seasons and that their sensitivities to this changes would be different 3 an abrupt change in water quality would occurs along the gradient of landscape metric 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the hengxi watershed 29 2 km2 a tributary headwater of the yongjiang river basin is located in the zhejiang province in eastern china fig 1 the mainstream of the hengxi watershed is 7 3 km long the physiography in the watershed is characterized by saddle shape which is high in the east and west and low in the middle and the elevation ranges from 35 to 624 m this watershed has a typical subtropical monsoon climate the mean annual air temperature and precipitation are 16 2 c and 1564 mm respectively over 60 of precipitation occurs during the monsoon season may to september therefore the whole year could be divided into dry october april and wet may september seasons the major soil types are red earths and paddy soils chinese national soil survey office 1998 the major land use types in this watershed are forest land followed by farmland the human population averaged over the last three years is 8600 the farmland and residential lands in the watershed are concentrated in flat areas near rivers 2 2 data collection and processing 2 2 1 stream water quality monitoring we established twelve sampling sites located in the mainstream and tributaries of the hengxi headwater watershed each sampling site belonged to an outlet of the independent catchment fig 1 monthly samples were taken at all 12 locations from october 2016 to october 2019 each sampling took one day to represent the contribution of the nps pollution of stormwater runoff the sample collection on a monthly basis occurred a day after a rain event that produced surface runoff water samples were collected using a small bucket from the middle of the stream 0 5 m below the water surface six water quality parameters major nps pollutants and important indicators of anthropogenic water pollutants were chosen for measurement during and after sampling zhang et al 2019a dissolved oxygen do content was measured in situ by a handheld multiparameter analyzer fabricated by merck co germany the other five water physio chemical parameters including the total nitrogen tn nitrate and ammonia nitrogen no3 n and nh4 n respectively chemical oxygen demand codmn and total phosphorus tp were measured in the laboratory water samples collected from the streams were transferred to a 250 ml polythene bottle and immediately preserved with sulfuric acid until ph 2 the samples were stored at 4 c until analysis which was conducted within 24 h the tn was analyzed using the potassium persulfate digestion method combined with uv spectrophotometry performed by the double beam uv visible instrument g 9 the nh4 n analysis was performed using the indophenol blue colorimetry the no3 n content was measured using uv spectrophotometry the codmn content was determined using the acidic potassium permanganate method the amount of tp was measured using ammonium molybdate spectrophotometry 2 2 2 spatial scale groping and landscape metrics to quantify the scale effects of landscape metrics impact on the stream water quality the watershed was divided into two scale groups sub watershed scale group and the 100 m buffer zone scale group which was a 100 m wide section of each side along the entire upstream above the sample site the boundaries of the hydrological unit were outlined first by the arcswat software using digital elevation model dem with a 10 10 m grid resolution a digital stream network of the watershed and sampling sites fig 1 then the watershed was divided into 12 sub watersheds based on the connections of the hydrological units six of the sub watersheds comprised of individual hydrological unit sub watershed s4 s5 s7 s10 s11 and s12 while the rest was composed of two or more individual hydrological units sub watershed s1 s2 s3 s6 s8 and s9 see fig 2 the 100 m wide buffer zones on both stream sides were extracted by arcgis 10 2 software esri co usa the buffer width was designated based on field investigation and previous studies sliva and williams 2001 navalopez et al 2016 the landscape characteristic metrics were measured from the aspects of physiography landscape composition and landscape configuration the detailed description in table 1 the physiographic metrics including slope gradient slope basin relief hd hypsometric integral hi topographic wetness index twi and flow path length fpl were calculated based on the dem data using the spatial analysis tools of the arcgis 10 2 software the 1 40 000 land use land cover map for 2016 was derived from the ningbo academy of agricultural sciences and then manually digitized by the arcgis 10 2 software six land uses and land cover types were classified as forest land garden plot waterbody farmland residential land and road fig 1 because the road percentage was less than 2 the road category was not included in further analysis the calculated landscape composition metrics were shown as the percentages of the different land uses the landscape configuration metrics including patch density pd landscape shape index lsi largest patch index lpi as well as interspersion and juxtaposition index iji were calculated at the class level using the fragstat 4 0 software mcgarigal et al 2012 these landscape configuration metrics were applied to quantify land use spatial structure from the different aspects of land use types such as density shape dominance and distribution ding et al 2016 zhang et al 2019a all the landscape characteristic metrics were extracted at both the buffer and the sub watershed scales 2 3 statistical analysis we used the kolmogorov smirnov test to examine the normality of water quality data collected for each sampling site we also used the independent sample t test to compare the seasonal differences in nutrient concentrations shi et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a we determined variance in water quality parameters at different sites by one way anova p 0 05 detrended correspondence analysis dca was first used to analyze water quality data to determine whether linear or unimodal models were adopted the dca results showed that the longest gradient length of the four ordination axes was 3 thus the redundancy analysis rda was adopted to determine the positive negative relationship between landscape metrics and water quality parameters li et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a to remove collinearity among the landscape metrics the rda was performed two times first all the landscape characteristic metrics were used as explanatory variables during which the variables were selected based on the significance test their importance and the outcome of the variance inflation factors inspection vip 20 the second rda was performed using the landscape metrics obtained after the first rda a monte carlo permutation test n 499 was used during rda analysis to test for significance braak and smilauer 2012 partial rda prda was further applied to clarify and determine the relative importance and pure effects of the physiography landscape composition and landscape configuration on water quality the prda can quantify the unique and shared contributions of different categories of the landscape metrics to the total variance dalu et al 2017 the shared variation was obtained by subtracting the unique variations of each group of explanatory variables from the total variation explained by all explanatory variables bere et al 2016 the rda and prda were performed using the canoco 4 5 software microcomputer power co usa the nonparametric change point analysis ncpa is very useful for determining the abrupt changepoints of dependent variables cao et al 2017 the ncpa can be used to calculate the values of abrupt changepoints possessing bivariate nonlinear nutrient landscape metric relationships we applied ncpa to assess the specific points along the landscape metrics gradient responsible for the abrupt changes of water quality parameter concentrations the deviance reduction method was used for the ncpa to identify the abrupt changepoints huo et al 2015 the ncpa computations were performed as follows first the y 1 y 2 y n were assumed to be the water quality parameter values observed along the ordered landscape metric gradient x 1 x 2 x n then the response variable y1 y2 yn was divided into two groups y1 y2 yi and yi 1 yn 1 i n by the interval points i 1 i n the deviance value of each group was calculated using the formula 1 1 d k 1 m y k μ where d is the deviance m is the sample size and μ is the average of the m observations y k next the deviance redundancy i of ith interval point between the two groups was calculated using eq 2 the i of each probable changepoint t 1 t n was always greater than or equal to 0 finally the ith value at which maximum i was achieved was identified as the abrupt change point t 2 δ i d d i d i where d d i and d i are the deviance of the data y1 y2 yn y1 y2 yi and yi 1 yn respectively the actual observation data is usually very limited therefore the ncpa was combined with the bootstrap method to calculate the probability of the positions at which the abrupt changes occurred qian et al 2003 huo et al 2015 we extracted 1000 random samples from the raw water quality parameter landscape metric data set using the bootstrap simulation method the ncpa combined with bootstrap method was performed using the matlab r2014 software released by mathworks co usa 3 results 3 1 spatial and seasonal variation of water quality the t test analysis of the independent samples showed that most water quality parameters except nh4 n and tp had noticeable seasonal variations p 0 05 table 2 the concentrations of tn nh4 n no3 n tp and cod were generally higher during the wet season while do concentration was higher during the dry season fig 3 the one way anona showed that all selected water quality parameters except do had noticeable spatial changes in the wet season p 0 05 no significant spatial variations of no3 n and do were observed in the dry season fig 3 the spatial variability of water quality parameters varied with seasons the highest median concentration of tn no3 n and tp appeared at site 8 characterized by intense human activities the lowest median concentrations of tn no3 n nh4 n and cod appeared at site 4 which is the vast forest area and possesses the highest vegetation cover rate 3 2 differences in landscape metrics within different scales the landscape changes at the sub watershed scale and buffer scale were analyzed as shown in table 3 the average values of slope hd and fpl were higher at the watershed scale while twi values were higher at the buffer zone scale forest and farmlands were the dominant landscape types at the two spatial scales the percentage of forest within the buffer zones declined compared to the value at sub watershed scale whereas the percentage of farmland increased the average values of each landscape configuration metrics except pd of various land uses and lpi of farmland and water were generally higher at the sub watershed than at the buffer scale for example the average value of lpi of forest lpi for reached 51 at the sub watershed scale and the average value was 13 1 at the buffer zone scale however the average value of pd of forest reached 68 6 at the buffer zone scale while the average value was only 12 9 at the sub watershed scale 3 3 effects of landscape metrics on the water quality the rda results demonstrated the seasonal and spatial differences in the impact of overall landscape characteristics on water quality table 4 and fig 4 the selected landscape metrics explained over 61 6 of water quality variations during the wet season the total explanatory power decreased by 4 4 5 2 during the dry season table 4 the landscape metrics at the sub watershed scale explained over 57 2 of the water quality variation which increased by 7 8 8 6 at the buffer scale at the sub watershed scale the most significant explanatory variable was the lpi of the farmland lpi far it explained 22 8 and 37 3 of the water quality variations during dry and wet seasons respectively the lpi far negatively correlated with many water quality parameters e g tn and no3 n during both dry and wet seasons fig 4 at the buffer scale the most important explanatory variable was the lsi of forest lsi for which explained 21 2 and 32 3 of the water quality variations occurring during the dry and wet seasons respectively the lsi for positively correlated with tn and no3 n and do the prda results revealed that the highest contribution to overall water quality variation could be attributed to the landscape configuration which total explained 46 2 51 6 of water quality variations fig 5 the individual contribution of each group to the water quality was in the following order landscape configuration 20 5 31 6 physiographic metrics 4 0 15 9 landscape composition 3 2 7 5 the impact of these three categories of landscape metrics on water quality varied with seasons the seasonal difference in the explanatory ability of landscape configuration for overall water quality variation was the most significant 7 1 11 1 followed by physiography 6 7 7 8 and landscape composition 2 3 2 8 the impact of these three categories of landscape metrics on water quality also varied with spatial scale among which the contribution of physiographic metrics to the overall water quality variation changes the most 4 1 5 2 3 4 abrupt change analysis for the key landscape metrics at different scales since the main objective of water quality management in this headwater watershed is to reduce streams tn concentration we mainly focused on the abrupt changepoints of the relationship between tn concentration and landscape metrics the rda results showed that the lpi far at the sub watershed scale and lsi for at the buffer scale were the key landscape metrics affecting water quality thus we chose these metrics to explore the abrupt changepoints of the tn concentration as lpi far and lsi for increased the tn changepoints distribution along the lpi far and lsi for gradients obtained by 1000 bootstrap simulation using the ncpa method are shown in fig 6 we obtained the probability of an abrupt change in the water quality parameter directly from the cumulative distribution frequency curve in fig 6 the key interval value of lpifar for the abrupt change in the tn concentration during the dry season was 6 0 7 0 fig 6a although tn concentration changed with seasons as lpi far increased the cumulative probability of the sharp decrease in the tn concentration reached to 95 percent at lpi far 7 0 across the seasons fig 6a and 6b the abrupt change interval value of the lsi for ranging between 4 5 and 5 5 was observed for the tn concentration if the value of lsi for exceeded 5 5 the cumulative probability of a sudden increase in the tn concentration would exceed 80 and 90 during the dry and wet seasons respectively fig 6c and 6d respectively there was a 100 probability that tn concentration during both seasons would sharply increase at lsi for 6 6 4 discussion 4 1 water quality variation in relation to the physiographic landscape composition and configuration metrics we used prda to quantify the contribution of different categories of landscape metrics to the overall water quality variation as far as we know no studies provided a comprehensive analysis of the pure effects of physiography landscape composition and configuration on water quality variation most of the previous studies focused on developing multiple regression models of water quality variables response to the landscape metrics without quantifying the relative importance and pure effects of different groups of landscape metrics on water quality li et al 2018 mainali and chang 2018 for example li et al 2018 only reported the ability of the landscape composition and configuration metrics together to explain water quality variation our results further showed that the pure effect of the landscape configuration on water quality variation was 15 8 26 9 and 4 6 26 1 higher than the pure effect of landscape composition and physiography in this headwater watershed respectively fig 5 although observational studies like our limit the mechanism assessment the total water quality variation explained by the landscape composition landscape configuration and physiographic metrics provided us with insights into factors determining overall water quality in headwater streams as we hypothesized in our first hypothesis our results showed that landscape configuration has the most significant contribution to overall water quality variation the consideration of physiographic metrics in this study was important because it strengthened our understanding of the association between land use and water quality general knowledge of which is still limited yu et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 our results showed that the water quality variation was partially attributed to the shared influence of physiography and landscape composition 7 4 14 0 as well as landscape configuration 12 7 31 1 this could be explained by the fact that the physiography can affect water quality by constraining the composition and spatial distribution of land use i e the quantity of pollutants and distribution of pollution source mitsuda and ito 2011 in addition the physiographic characteristics can also affect the impact of land use on stream water quality by determining the pollutants flow paths from non point sources to the river yu et al 2016 our results also showed that the physiographic factors alone explained 4 0 15 9 of the water quality variation in this region physiographic characteristics can affect the total amount of pollutants entering streams by changing surface runoff flow rates and the erosion zhou et al 2017 li et al 2020 thus we should consider the potential role of the physical setting of watersheds in determining the land use pattern impact on water quality yu et al 2016 clément et al 2017 4 2 the influence of seasons and spatial scales the impact of landscape metrics on water quality varies sea sonally yu et al 2016 mainali and chang 2018 our results showed that the impact of landscape metrics on water quality was more evident during the wet season although this conclusion was supported by many previous studies ai et al 2015 shi et al 2017 controversies still exist yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2019a very likely because of seasonal rainfall variations and surface runoff as well as of the difference in dominant landscape metrics shi et al 2017 wu and lu 2019 we further distinguished the seasonal differences in the influence of different categories of landscape metrics on water quality as we second hypothesis states that the impact of these three categories of landscape metrics on water quality varies seasonally and their sensitives to this change are different the effect of landscape configuration on water quality has the most significant seasonal difference fig 5 very likely because the surface runoff flow rate is relatively slow during the dry season this made the impact of the landscape configuration on the surface runoff interception and pollutants absorption significant shi et al 2017 yirigui et al 2019 however large surface runoff produced by frequent heavy rains weakens the regulatory effect of landscape configuration on pollutants during the wet season which enhanced the influence of physiographic features on water quality yu et al 2016 the impact of landscape metrics on water quality also depends on the spatial scale hurley and mazumder 2013 mainali and chang 2018 our results showed that the buffer scale landscape better explained the water quality variation than the sub watershed scale landscape table 4 which agrees with previous research liu et al 2017 li et al 2018 the reason for this phenomenon may be that the riparian zone played a more substantial role in reducing surface runoff and controlling nutrients transportation and retention than the sub watershed scale fernandes et al 2014 casson et al 2019 however some studies made the opposite conclusion the disagreement is very likely related to the spatial resolution of digital maps the unique landscape characteristics of each watershed or the selected water quality variables ding et al 2016 zhang et al 2019a we further distinguished the spatial scale effects of different categories of landscape metrics impact on water quality variation our results were consistent with our second hypothesis that the effects of these three categories of landscape metrics on water quality vary with the spatial scales and that their sensitivities to this change are different the spatial scale effect of the physiographic metrics impact on water quality was the most obvious additionally the spatial scale differences of the impacts of the overall landscape characteristics on water quality were mainly attributed to changes in the influence of physiographic metrics on water quality although the effect of landscape composition and configuration metrics on water quality also varied with the spatial scales this change was not significant considering that the key landscape metrics affecting water quality at different spatial scales were different table 3 and fig 4 we suggested that the landscape planning with the water quality in mind should be considered from a multi scale perspective in hilly headwater watersheds 4 3 abrupt changepoints of the key landscape metrics for landscape planning stream water quality almost invariably responds nonlinearly to the increase of landscape metrics and exhibits threshold responses caused by the landscape pattern shifts shen et al 2015 thus identifying abrupt changepoints where rapid water quality responds to relatively small changes of the environmental driver force is essential for understanding nonlinear dynamics and land use planning in this study the abrupt change threshold in tn concentration as a function of the landscape metric changes was obtained using the cumulative distribution of the changepoints this approach results in reliable assumptions about abrupt thresholds francesco ficetola and denoël 2009 wu and lu 2019 the key threshold of the landscape metrics for the stream water quality improvement obtained in this work supported our third hypothesis numerous studies showed that streams water quality declines as the farmland expands shi et al 2017 de mello et al 2018 some researchers reported that when the farmland exceeds 50 of the corresponding watershed area the deterioration of water quality caused by farming is even worse wang et al 2003 allan 2004 we further studied the abrupt changepoints of the spatial configuration of the farmland landscape since the lpi far negatively correlated with tn concentrations fig 4 increasing the values of lpi far would imply that fewer nutrients migrate to rivers our ncpa results suggest that the lpi far value should be above 7 at the sub watershed scale to reduce tn concentrations in the rivers some scholars studied the thresholds of the spatial configuration of forest land at the watershed scale related to abrupt change in water quality for instance clément et al 2017 concluded that the forest edge density above 36 m ha was beneficial for high water quality wu and lu 2019 reported that the lpi of the forest above 35 could improve the water quality of agricultural watersheds however vegetation cover at the buffer scale is more critical for maintaining and improving river water quality than at the watershed scale de souza et al 2013 shi et al 2017 our results agree with this opinion thus we explored the abrupt changepoints of the lsi for with the most significant contribution to water quality variation at the buffer scale the result showed the value of lsi for should be less than 5 5 which served as the safe range of values at the buffer scale in this watershed if the lsi for is over this value vegetation patches would be more fragmented such forest landscape might not intercept sufficient surface runoff and or absorb nutrients ding et al 2016 yirigui et al 2019 in this case the probability of water quality deterioration will increase rapidly therefore we suggest that the land use managers should consider the abrupt changepoints of landscape metrics during land use and environmental protection goal planning 5 conclusion the impact of landscape characteristics on stream water quality usually has significant spatial scale effects and seasonal differences the accumulated explanatory ability of the selected landscape metrics on overall water quality was better at the buffer scale than at the sub watershed scale and these metrics had a slightly higher correlation with water quality during the wet season than during the wet season such spatially varying were mainly caused by the change in the impact of physiographic metrics on water quality simultaneously the seasonal difference was driven primarily by the impact change of the landscape configuration in this headwater watershed the lpi far and lsi for were the most essential landscape metrics at the sub watershed and the buffer scales respectively when lpi far is below 7 0 at sub watershed scale and or the lsi for is above 5 5 at the buffer scale the stream water quality degradation would significantly accelerate we concluded that it is necessary to analyze the spatial scale effect and seasonal dependence of various landscape characteristics impact on the river water quality to identify the key landscape metrics impacting the river water quality under different spatiotemporal conditions application of the abrupt changepoints of the key landscape metrics matching with the spatiotemporal scale can we achieve the goal of

17228,this work proposes a tube in tube membrane photoreactor operated in a continuous mode to boost the efficiency of peroxydisulfate pds through the photolytic uv c radiation and photocatalytic tio2 p25 processes this new technology can efficiently facilitate the transportation of pds to the catalyst surface and water to be treated the ultrafiltration tubular ceramic membrane was used as support for the tio2 p25 and oxidant catalyst water contactor tests were performed using a synthetic solution and a municipal secondary effluent both spiked with a pharmaceutical mix solution paracetamol pct

predictions 1 introduction conventional municipal wastewater treatment plants mwwtps are not able to fully degrade contaminants of emerging concern cecs resulting in the significant and continuous release of such compounds to the anthroposphere which constitutes a stress factor for water resources loos et al 2013 reducing cecs risks is globally urgent and new mitigation technologies are needed towards a water protection approach one health initiative 2020 us water alliance 2020 in recent years sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes sr aops are gaining attention as a potential technology for removal of cecs from municipal wastewaters cvetnić et al 2019 ike et al 2018 wacławek et al 2017 sulfate radicals can be generated from peroxydisulfate pds which has high stability high solubility 730 g l 1 at 25 c high molar extinction coefficient 21 1 m 1 cm 1 high quantum efficiency 1 8 mol einstein 1 at 254 nm and comparable price 0 18 usd mol 1 when compared to other oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide he et al 2014 ike et al 2018 wacławek et al 2017 the activation of pds involves the homolytic cleavage of the o o bond that leads to the generation of so4 which has a high redox potential 2 5 3 1 v vs nhe neta et al 1988 the main activators of the pds are energy in different forms e g heat sonochemical photochemical transition metals carbonaceous materials alkaline conditions electrochemical and through its combination with other oxidants e g ozone hydrogen peroxide and calcium peroxide duan et al 2020 there are several limitations in sr aops systems i the recovery of catalysts or metal ions which requires more steps for separation ii catalytic performance is highly dependent on solution ph and iii in real wastewater the existence of a large number of organic compounds can bind to the catalyst which also reduces the generation of radicals duan et al 2020 a possible approach to overcome such barrier is the combination of two or more different activation methods hybrid systems such as photochemical and photocatalytic able to produce different reactive species synergistic effects such as sulfate hydroxyl and superoxide radicals boosting the process performance of sr aops the combination of photochemical and photocatalytic processes involves i direct oxidation by s2o8 2 ii photolysis of s2o8 2 into so4 in the presence of uvc light iii photo oxidation of h2o s2o8 2 into oh s2o8 by holes hvb of semiconductor valence band vb under uv light iv photo reduction of s2o8 2 o2 into so4 o2 by electrons ecd of semiconductor conduction band cb under uv light yang et al 2019a the addition of persulfate to the photocatalytic system i minimizes e h recombination since ecd are captured by s2o8 2 more easily than by h2o2 and o2 due to the higher electron affinity of s2o8 2 2 1 against 1 77 and 0 44 ev respectively guerra rodríguez et al 2018 huling and pivetz 2006 and ii increases the ratio of radicals product electron hole pairs consumption for s2o8 2 pathway compared to that for o2 pathway monteagudo et al 2019 schneider et al 2014 another possible strategy is to develop new oxidant dosing methods able to reduce the dosage of pds required and minimize the quenching reactions between radicals decreasing the sulfate post contamination vilar and co workers proposed a low footprint tube in tube membrane reactor castellanos et al 2020 to drive in a smart way the oxidant into the catalyst surface and water to be treated through virtually unlimited number of oxidant dosing points across the membrane and further dispersed to the annular reaction zone where the oxidant is activated by uvc light reducing its consumption improving the contact with the pollutants and avoiding catalyst deactivation therefore this paper investigates for the first time the use of a tube in tube membrane reactor to boost the efficiency of uv s2o8 2 and uv s2o8 2 tio2 for the treatment of pharmaceutical compounds in municipal secondary effluent additional objectives are i to identify the main pharmaceuticals transformation products tps with proposed pathways and ii to assess the potential toxicity and biodegradability of the tps generated during the treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials analytical grade purity 98 99 nimesulide nmd furosemide frs paracetamol pct and diazepam dzp were used in this work as target pollutants see table s 1 these pharmaceuticals are frequently detected in hospital and urban wastewaters becker et al 2019 papageorgiou et al 2016 sodium persulfate merck 98 was used as

mg l 1 in methanol acetonitrile 1 2 v v in demineralized water panice reverse osmosis system municipal wastewater mww sample was collected downstream the secondary settling tank of a mwwtp located in the north of portugal and kept refrigerated until use the main physicochemical characteristics of the real mww table s2 were assessed according to the procedures already described moreira et al 2016 taking into consideration that typical pharmaceutical concentrations in the wastewater are in the 0 1 200 µg l 1 range it was decided to fortify a synthetic pharmaceutical solution sps in demineralized water and mww with 200 µg l 1 of each pharmaceutical compound which is related to i a concentration high enough to study kinetics using conventional analytical techniques and ii low enough to simulate real conditions the ph of the mww was adjusted to 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 when required using sulfuric acid pronalab purity 96 1 84 g cm3 sps and mww matrices were used as inlet streams of the tube in tube membrane reactor 2 2 tube in tube membrane reactor set up the full description of the experimental set up can be seen elsewhere castellanos et al 2020 vilar et al 2020 summarizing the reactor comprises an inner ceramic tubular ultrafiltration membrane γ al2o3 membrane from inopor gmbh and an outer quartz tube fixed vertically and sealed by mobile polypropylene flanges four uv lamps located externally to the quartz tube allows for a uniform illumination of the annular reaction zone arz and membrane surface the ceramic membrane shell side was coated with a tio2 p25 thin film 9 layers by dip coating more information about the experimental set up and catalyst deposition procedure over the membrane shell side can be seen in section s 3 supporting information 2 3 experimental procedure firstly the inner space of the ceramic membrane was filled with s2o8 2 stock solution 52 1 mm ph 4 27 182 2 mm ph 4 15 364 4 mm ph 4 06 or 728 7 mm ph 4 01 using a syringe pump back pressure

ph 6 4 was pumped q inlet pharm 40 l h 1 re 2056 optimum hydrodynamics conditions according to vilar et al 2020 through the arz while the syringe pump forced the s2o8 2 solution through the membrane pores and uvc or uva lamps were turned on the system was surrounded by an aluminum shell to protect direct eye contact from the radiation samples were collected at reactor outlet at different time intervals until a steady state condition was reached for quantification of pharmaceuticals ethanol 100 μl was added to quench s2o8 2 immediately after collection of samples 1 ml oxidant permeation tests were carried out for the membranes with and without tio2 after pharmaceutical oxidation tests using the sps and oxidant permeation method were carried out using the membrane without catalyst and with catalyst assays with the mww were performed using the uvc s2o8 2 tio2 system by changing the oxidant dose s2o8 2 stock solution 364 4 or 728 7 mm dosing rate 2 15 ml min 1 tests with direct injection of oxidant upstream of the reactor inlet using sps and mww were carried out to evaluate the system performance and to compare with the permeation dosing method table s3 presents the experimental conditions used in all tests after each experiment the reaction system was cleaned with demineralized water membrane photoactivity remained stable during all tests 2 4 analytical procedures the residual s2o8 2 concentration was measured according to the method proposed by liang et al 2008 absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 352 nm using a uv visible spectrophotometer the concentrations of pharmaceuticals were measured by hplc dad according to the method presented elsewhere cuervo lumbaque et al 2020 pharmaceutical tps generated during the photochemical photocatalytic process were extracted pre concentrated using solid phase extraction spe procedure adapted from ibáñez et al 2017 tps analysis was performed in a liquid chromatography quadrupole time

contains the calculated masses of the suspected transformation products and the chemical structure of each of them the qtof ms system was operated in broadband collision induced dissociation bbcid acquisition mode which provided ms and ms ms spectra at the same time this simultaneous extraction allowed to confirm the fragment ions in the spectra recorded for each peak the requirements to find

biowin complement of epi suite the simplified molecular input line entry system smiles was used for the assessment table s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 s2o8 2 radial addition tests and steady state conditions steady state conditions for s2o8 2 concentration in the absence of uvc light and pharmaceuticals fig s1a and b and for concentrations of pharmaceuticals at the reactor outlet using the uvc s2o8 2 membrane without catalyst fig s2a or uvc s2o8 2 tio2 membrane coated with catalyst fig s2b systems in the water flow side at the reactor outlet are obtained after t τ 100 τ is the space time inside the illuminated arz in the next sections the conversion of pharmaceuticals will be calculated based on the pharmaceutical concentrations at steady state conditions process efficiency was calculated as the ratio between the mass flux of pharmaceutical converted in a single passage in the reactor pharm inlet pharm outlet q at steady state conditions and the mass flux of pharmaceutical in the inlet stream pharm inlet q 3 2 membrane without catalyst uvc s2o8 2 and uvc s2o8 2 uvc photolysis without catalyst and no s2o8 2 permeation of the four pharmaceuticals showed limited conversions values ranging from 2 5 fig 1 a mainly associated with the low uvc fluence 45 mj cm 2 employed in this study yang et al 2014 frs and dzp are the most photolabile molecules frs presents a carboxylate anion group at ph 6 4 which drives the subsequent release of a leaving group via β elimination due to the photons energy while the carbonyl group present in dzp is the center of photochemical reactivity klán et al 2013 this is in agreement with the optical properties of the pharmaceutical compounds at 254 nm see table s1 quantum yield frs dzp pct and extinction coefficient pct dzp frs nmd therefore the combination of large molar absorption coefficients and quantum yields at 254 nm could explain the higher photosensitivity of frs followed by dzp and pct however the correlation between photo reactivity and the physicochemical properties of their molecules is not easy because pharmaceuticals are present in a mixture some of them show acid and basic groups molinari et al 2006 as well as various substituents electron donating and withdrawing s2o8 2 direct reaction with pharmaceuticals in the absence of uvc light considering the highest dose of s2o8 2 0 59 mm takes place at a very low rate resulting in conversions of 4 5 fig 1b as reported elsewhere cvetnić et al 2019 as expected the uvc s2o8 2 system showed significantly higher degradation values of pharmaceuticals following step wise order regarding an increase of oxidant concentration until 0 59 mm fig 1a associated with the production of so4 by the homolytic cleavage of the o o bond of s2o8 2 by uvc light frontistis 2019 pct frs and dzp are the molecules more sensitive to uvc s2o8 2 as so4 is electrophilic the reaction is favored by the presence of electron donating groups of pharmaceuticals and the reaction with electron withdrawing groups is generally slower under the experimental conditions at ph 6 4 and according to the speciation of the pharmaceuticals in this condition fig s3 frs contains a carboxylate group strong electron donating group allowing degradation pathways by electron transfer nmd does not have spontaneous reactions through an electron transfer mechanism due to strong electron withdrawing group no2 mei et al 2019 which explains the low degradation of the nmd on the other hand the dzp molecule could be susceptible to oxidation by so4 through cleavage of n c guo et al 2004 like the so4 attack to the pct molecule favors aromatic ring opening through cleavage of c c bond by electron transfer reactions moussavi et al 2017 also for molecules containing the oh group as pct the addition of free radicals and the h abstraction reactions are thermodynamically favorable mei et al 2019 a kinetic model eq 1 was developed taking into account the mass balance to the annular reactor at steady state conditions first order reaction plug flow hydrodynamics conditions and constant temperature 1 c out c feed e v l k where c feed is the concentration of pharmaceuticals at the inlet of the photoreactor μg l 1 c out is the concentration of pharmaceuticals at the outlet of the photoreactor at steady state conditions μg l 1 v is the fluid velocity cm min 1 l is the length of illuminated photoreactor cm and k is the first order kinetic constant min 1 the kinetic constant based on degradation showed a higher reactivity towards pct than frs dzp and nmd k pct 5 13min 1 k frs 4 57 min 1 k dzp 4 03 min 1 and k nmd 2 40 min 1 3 3 membrane coated with tio2 p25 3 3 1 uva radiation uva tio2and uva s2o8 2 tio2 in the next set of experiments membrane coated with tio2 p25 irradiated by uva light was used to improve the system performance for degradation of pharmaceuticals using sps as solution matrix as the ph of the sps 6 4 is similar to the phpzc of tio2 p25 nanoparticles 6 5 matos et al 2009 negligible electrostatic attraction occurs between the target molecules and the catalyst surface resulting in low removal values of 0 8 1 2 0 1 and 0 9 for pct frs nmd and dzp respectively data not shown although tio2 uva photocatalysis showed low conversion values of pharmaceuticals and low consumption of s2o8 2 fig 2 a and c the titration of small doses of s2o8 2 to the tio2 nanoparticles immobilized in the membrane shell side activated by uva light boosted the conversion of pharmaceuticals through two different mechanisms a direct oxidation by s2o8 2 and uva light b indirect oxidation by b1 oh s2o8 generated by the photo oxidation of h2o oh s2o8 2 by holes hvb b2 so4 o2 produced by the photo reduction of s2o8 2 o2 by electrons ecd yang et al 2019a simultaneously s2o8 2 serves as electron trap reducing the recombination rate of photogenerated e h ike et al 2018 and increases the ratio of radicals product electron hole pairs consumption monteagudo et al 2019 schneider et al 2014 3 3 2 uvc radiation uvc tio2 and uvc s2o8 2 tio2 the uva s2o8 2 system presents a lower efficiency than the photochemical uvc s2o8 2 process which is mainly associated with lower molar absorptivity and quantum yield of s2o8 2 at 365 nm ε 0 1 m 1 cm 1 ϕ 1 1 mol oxidant einstein 1 ding and hu 2020 ismail et al 2017 when compared to 254 nm ε 22 m 1 cm 1 ϕ 1 8 mol oxidant einstein 1 he et al 2013 xu et al 2020 a higher pharmaceutical degradation efficiency was observed for the uvc driven photocatalysis fig 3 a when compared with the uvc light driven photolysis uvc s2o8 2 this implicates that the synergic effect between the catalyst film immobilized in the membrane shell side and uvc radiation plays a role on the activation of persulfate as also in the generation of other reactive oxygen species which is reflected in the highest consumption of s2o8 2 fig 3c vs fig 1c fig 4 compares the kinetic constants for the four pharmaceutical compounds using persulfate and hydrogen peroxide oxidants cuervo lumbaque et al 2020 when the activation mechanism is uvc light persulfate leads to better results than hydrogen peroxide for all pharmaceuticals tested considering the highest oxidant dose tested this is in agreement with the optical properties of the applied oxidant φ254 s2o8 2 1 8 φ254 h2o2 1 0 molar absorption coefficients ε254 s2o8 2 21 1 m 1cm 1 ε254 h2o2 18 m 1cm 1 goldstein et al 2007 and dissociation energy 92 kj mol 1fors2o8 2 and 213 kj mol 1 for h2o2 wacławek et al 2017 when oxidants are activated simultaneously by uvc light and electron transfer mechanisms the following conclusions can be taken i s2o8 2 based process presents a higher performance towards pct ii h2o2 based process presents a higher performance towards nmd and iii both oxidants based processes present a similar performance towards frs and dzp 3 4 effect of wastewater matrix at the natural ph 8 0 of the mww the uvc s2o8 2 tio2 system shows a rather low removal of pharmaceuticals fig 5 b the mww matrix impacts negatively the generation of radicals species as also has a strong radical quenching effect resulting in a nine to seven fold rate of degradation decrease on nmd and dzp respectively and four fold rate of degradation decrease on pct and frs removal when comparing with the sps using the same dose of oxidant 0 59 mm fig 5a vs fig 3a although an increase on oxidant dose enhances conversion of pharmaceuticals higher residual concentrations of oxidant are observed at the reactor outlet mainly associated with the low uvc fluence 45 mj cm 2 to avoid the waste of high oxidant doses and increase the process efficiency a much higher uvc fluence is requested as normally used in real treatment plants 600 1000 mj cm 2 oh et al 2016 being able to use lower amounts of oxidant since the probability of persulfate molecules to be photolyzed increases with the uvc fluence another approach to overcome this limitation is to integrate sr aop with another type of oxidant e g hydrogen peroxide or ozone to achieve a synergistic oxidation effect and thus decrease the pds dose and sulfate post contamination duan et al 2020 the so4 and oh radicals are largely consumed by the main components of mww such as inorganic anions and natural organic matter as hco3 major source of inorganic carbon at ph 8 is one of the major scavenger agents of so4 k so4 hco3 9 1 106 m 1s 1 and oh k oh hco3 8 5 106 m 1s 1 wacławek et al 2017 the effect of the mww ph ic 24 1 20 3 10 9 and 6 3 mg c l 1 for ph values of 8 7 6 and 5 respectively on removal of pharmaceuticals was assessed fig 5b shows a continuous increase on the conversion of pharmaceuticals with the decrease of inorganic carbon indicating that hco3 species plays an important role as scavenger agent of sulfate and hydroxyl radicals the presence of nitrates in mww 57 mg l 1 can acts as uvc filter preventing light transmission through the reaction medium to the catalyst surface yang et al 2019b being also a strong scavenger agent k so4 no2 8 8 108 m 1s 1 k oh no2 8 0 109 m 1s 1 shah et al 2013 phosphate can also exhibit a strong inhibitory effect on the removal of pharmaceuticals by processes based on sulfate or hydroxyl radicals k so4 h2po4 7 2 104 m 1s 1 k oh h2po4 2 0 104 m 1s 1 k so4 hpo4 2 1 2 106 m 1s 1 k oh hpo4 2 1 5 105 m 1s 1 xie et al 2015 furthermore the phosphate ions can also chelate on tio2 surface zhao et al 2008 relative to the sulfate ion the reaction of so4 2 with so4 and oh is much slower k oh so4 2 3 5 105 m 1s 1 shah et al 2013 than other inorganic anions such as cl k so4 cl 6 6 108 m 1s 1 k oh cl 4 3 109 m 1s 1 shah et al 2013 and hco3 therefore the role of so4 2 as radical scavenger is not as important as the dissolved organic matter k so4 dom 6 8 103 mg c 1 s 1 k oh dom 1 4 104 mg c 1 s 1 oh et al 2016 total suspended solids can have a high impact on light penetration in the reaction medium until the surface of the catalyst since they can block the catalyst surface and work as radical scavenger consequently further tests were performed using a mww after filtration with a qualitative filter paper particle retention 12 µm the filtration step improved substantially the conversion of pharmaceuticals reaching values of 27 26 15 and 19 for pct frs nmd and dzp respectively fig 5c concluding a sand filtration step is mandatory before the uvc s2o8 2 tio2 oxidation treatment the kinetic constants for the conversion of the four pharmaceuticals using persulfate and hydrogen peroxideoxidants with the same matrix mww oxidant dose 2 36 mm reactor configuration and process uvc oxidant tio2 are displayed in fig 6 it can be seen that the persulfate oxidation process achieves a much faster conversion of pharmaceutical than the hydrogen peroxide oxidation process then sr aops seems to be a good approach for the treatment of complex environmental matrices containing plenty of doms and inorganic anions such as mww towards the removal of specific pharmaceuticals and other cecs 3 5 effect of the s2o8 2 dosage method the permeation of the oxidant through the membranes pores is able to drive in a smart way the oxidant into the catalyst surface and water to be treated resulting in a much better performance especially for the most recalcitrant pharmaceuticals nmd and dzp than its injection upstream the reactor inlet and leading to a higher consumption of oxidant fig s4a and b although the same tendency is observed for the mww matrix the impact of radial addition of oxidant is less significant when compared to its injection upstream the reactor inlet fig s4c this can be associated with the much slower reactions kinetics for mww matrix and to the use of a much higher oxidant dosage 2 36 mm fig s4d beyond that the persulfate solution that is internally fed to the membrane presents an acidic ph value between 4 01 and 4 27 this will result in local points near the membrane shell side with more acidic ph values increasing the oxidant power of so4 and oh radicals the final ph values of the water at the reactor outlet at steady state conditions were around 5 0 for sps for uww the ph of the inlet and outlet water was similar besides the reactor configuration induces a helical motion of the fluid stream around the membrane shell side increasing the interfacial mass transfer promoting the mobility of persulfate molecules and ros from the catalyst surface to the solution bulk facilitating the shift from a heterogeneous to homogeneous reaction 3 6 identification of tps by using purpose built database and target screening method samples from uvc s2o8 2 and uvc s2o8 2 tio2 processes using sps and mww matrices were analyzed by lc qtof ms system in bbcid operation mode tps identification was performed using total ion chromatograms and extracted ion chromatograms data obtained for each sample analyzed in total 22 tps were identified table s4 during the oxidation tests tps chemical structures have been assigned based in purpose built database gathered from the current literature on the basis of the tps identified tentatively pharmaceutical degradation pathways were proposed fig 7 for each initial compound studied in uvc s2o8 2 tio2 system so4 normally undergo electron transfer reactions while oh may also react via hydrogen atom abstraction along with an electron transfer process which is however less prominent in its case liang and su 2009 the so4 could react with aromatic rings and double bonds thereby forming sulfate radical adducts having a very short life 20 ns lomoth et al 1999 which confirms the non identification of adducts with a sulfonic moiety the radical cation adducts are formed due to electron transfer from aromatic ring to so4 by releasing a sulfate group so4 2 and these adducts could react through nucleophilic attack of water or via the addition of oxygen from the air and or decomposition of s2o8 2 these are responsible for the formation of hydroxylated tps by the elimination of ho2 or water molecules sharma et al 2015 the radical degradation pathway for paracetamol pct fig 7a proceeds initially by the formation of pct by a one electron oxidation process this oxidized radical intermediate which itself is an identified tp tp30 pct can undergo hydroxylation trough two different pathways path a in red color and path b in green color reaction with hydroxyl radical at the ortho position path a red leads to tp5 pct which was observed in mww matrix while the reaction at the para position path b green leads to an additional c n bond breaking event ultimately leading to tp8 pct alternatively the key radical intermediate can lead to the corresponding dimerization products tp28 pct a b and c arising from carbon oxygen or carbon carbon radical dimerization during pct oxidation in sps and mww matrices since these three products have the same m z ratio m z 301 073832 at this point is difficult to unambiguously assign which is the correct structure however based on the relative radical stability it is more likely that tp28 pct a and b are favored over tp28 pct c zhong et al 2019 this dimerization pathway is in accordance with that reported elsewhere fang et al 2013b in which the authors propose the dimerization of the quinone moiety through the production of so4 from persulfate in the uvc s2o8 2 system so4 is the predominant radical species although ho derivatives are reported from the reaction of so4 due the interaction of so4 with ho o2 or h2o and both so4 or oh could be considered for the degradation of pharmaceuticals fang et al 2013a fang et al 2015 fang et al 2013b zhu et al 2016 oxidation of frs fig 7b takes place initially by the formation of a resonance stabilized radical next to the furan ring hydrogen abstraction led to imine formation tp3 frs and subsequent hydrolysis of the imine functional groups results in the formation of the free aniline tp4 frs in a parallel fashion the furan heterocycle is oxidized by a radical hydroxylation followed by a ring opening reaction leading to the corresponding γ ketoenal tp1 frs laurencé et al 2014 2011 this tp is also prone to amine to imine oxidation therefore delivering tp10 frs as the product the previous tps from frs were observed in both so4 based processes tp3 and tp4 frs were also identified in oh based processes cuervo lumbaque et al 2020 it was also observed that nmd pka 6 7 exists in an equilibrium between the ionized and unionized forms fig 7c the ionized form is prone to reaction with so4 to yield the resonance stabilized radical tp45 nmd this intermediate can then undergo a c h radical hydroxylation at the ortho position related to the sulfonamide group leading to tp41 nmd carbon oxygen oxidative bond cleavage triggers the phenol oxidative decomposition pathway ultimately leading to the identification of tp14 nmd in agreement with the mechanism proposed bukkitgar et al 2016 these tps were only observed for the uvc s2o8 2 tio2 in mww finally in the oxidation process of dzp by uvc s2o8 2 and uvc s2o8 2 tio2 fig 7d the degradation process starts by radical abstraction of a hydrogen next to the amide group leading to a resonance stabilized radical further hydroxylation at this position can lead to tp9 dzp a alternatively two additional tps with the same m z can also be formed by a different mechanistic pathway radical hydroxylation at either one the aromatic rings might afford tp9 dzp b and tp9 dzp c at this point of the study is premature to unequivocally assign the exact structure among the three possibilities these tps are thermodynamically stable relative to the starting compounds yang et al 2018 on the other hand one electron oxidation at the c n bond can lead to the radical anion which leads to hemi aminal tp13 dzp by protonation and radical hydroxylation reactions this tp13 dzp undergoes further hydrolysis to result in tp1 dzp as the result of breaking of the 8 membered ring system according to so4 and oh initiated oxidation reactions four possible mechanisms in the degradation of pharmaceuticals can be elucidated i free radical addition to the neutral pharmaceutical molecule favoring in most cases adduct formation ii free radical abstract one h atom from the neutral molecule leading to bisulfate ion water molecule mei et al 2019 iii hydroxylation through interaction of so4 with ho o2 or h2o and iv ring opening reactions that generate less aromatic products in our previous study cuervo lumbaque et al 2020 the oh based process uvc h2o2and uvc h2o2 tio2 was characterized by aromatic ring hydroxylation and the formation of smaller structures compared to the original pharmaceutical in addition there was no evidence of significant differences in tps using both oh based process the tps identified in so4 based processes show more clearly the formation of aromatic intermediates as a consequence of oxidative coupling reactions of resonance stabilized radicals dimerization and ring contraction ring opening products were typical for oxidation based on so4 and oh 3 7 q sar assessment of ecotoxicological implications the tps chemical structures were analyzed to estimate the ecotoxicological implications a preliminary evaluation of tps toxicity was carried out with toxtree and epi suite software as described in section 2 4 the results obtained are summarized in fig s5 and table s5 tps were classified according to cramer s rules class iii suggest significant toxicity lapenna and worth 2011 alerts for possible dna damage mutagenic cancer formation carcinogenic and if they are biodegradable or not according to predicted activation and deactivation alerts indicated by q sar models the results obtained for the tps identified showed that more than 80 of tp content suggests significant toxicity and persistence in the environment among them 42 can cause cancer and 11 direct damage to dna all dzp frs and nmd tps are in class iii according to carmer s rules and most of them are not biodegradable tp1 and tp10 frs are potentially mutagenic and carcinogenic substances which is corroborated by the high probability of intermediates of the furan ring such as γ ketoenal present in these two tps to alkylate proteins and dna which triggers toxicity peterson 2013 with reference to pct tps tp8 and tp33 are highlighted as they have low ecotoxicological damage characteristics and easily biodegradable regarding previous studies cuervo lumbaque et al 2020 regardless of the oxidant used h2o2 or s2o8 2 the low biodegradability of the tps identified in each process is maintained 4 conclusions a low footprint tube in tube membrane photoreactor operated in a continuous mode was able to boost sulfate radical advanced oxidation processes and pharmaceuticals removal due to two main points i combination of photolysis and chemical electron transfer activation methods for ros production and ii ability to drive in an efficient way the oxidant into the catalyst surface and water to be treated through virtually unlimited number of oxidant dosing points across the membrane providing a more homogeneous distribution of the injected chemical across the whole reactor length the uvc s2o8 2 tio2 showed a higher degradation performance towards all pharmaceutical compounds in mww when compared to uvc h2o2 tio2 twenty two tps were identified through lc qtof ms analysis and the main degradation routes were proposed for each evaluated pharmaceutical so4 normally undergo electron transfer reactions while oh may also react via hydrogen atom abstraction along with an electron transfer process in turn the tps chemical structures reveal a high toxicity potential low biodegradability and in some cases the risk of mutagenicity and cancerogenic by in silico q sar predictions finally in order to increase the conversion of pharmaceutical compounds and their tps into less toxic substances in urban wastewater treatment a higher

17228,this work proposes a tube in tube membrane photoreactor operated in a continuous mode to boost the efficiency of peroxydisulfate pds through the photolytic uv c radiation and photocatalytic tio2 p25 processes this new technology can efficiently facilitate the transportation of pds to the catalyst surface and water to be treated the ultrafiltration tubular ceramic membrane was used as support for the tio2 p25 and oxidant catalyst water contactor tests were performed using a synthetic solution and a municipal secondary effluent both spiked with a pharmaceutical mix solution paracetamol pct furosemide frs nimesulide nmd and diazepam dzp 200 μg l 1 of each at steady state regime the uvc s2o8 2 tio2 system with radial pds addition showed the highest removal of pharmaceuticals in both

predictions 1 introduction conventional municipal wastewater treatment plants mwwtps are not able to fully degrade contaminants of emerging concern cecs resulting in the significant and continuous release of such compounds to the anthroposphere which constitutes a stress factor for water resources loos et al 2013 reducing cecs risks is globally urgent and new mitigation technologies are needed towards a water protection approach one health initiative 2020 us water alliance 2020 in recent years sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes sr aops are gaining attention as a potential technology for removal of cecs from municipal wastewaters cvetnić et al 2019 ike et al 2018 wacławek et al 2017 sulfate radicals can be generated from peroxydisulfate pds which has high stability high solubility 730 g l 1 at 25 c high molar extinction coefficient 21 1 m 1 cm 1 high quantum efficiency 1 8 mol einstein 1 at 254 nm and comparable price 0 18 usd mol 1 when compared to other oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide he et al 2014 ike et al 2018 wacławek et al 2017 the activation of pds involves the homolytic cleavage of the o o bond that leads to the generation of so4 which has a high redox potential 2 5 3 1 v vs nhe neta et al 1988 the main activators of the pds are energy in different forms e g heat sonochemical photochemical transition metals carbonaceous materials alkaline conditions electrochemical and through its combination with other oxidants e g ozone hydrogen peroxide and calcium peroxide duan et al 2020 there are several limitations in sr aops systems i the recovery of catalysts or metal ions which requires more steps for separation ii catalytic performance is highly dependent on solution ph and iii in real wastewater the existence of a large number of organic compounds can bind to the catalyst which also reduces the generation of radicals duan et al 2020 a possible approach to overcome such barrier is the combination of two or more different activation methods hybrid systems such as photochemical and photocatalytic able to produce different reactive species synergistic effects such as sulfate hydroxyl and superoxide radicals boosting the process performance of sr aops the combination of photochemical and photocatalytic processes involves i direct oxidation by s2o8 2 ii photolysis of s2o8 2 into so4 in the presence of uvc light iii photo oxidation of h2o s2o8 2 into oh s2o8 by holes hvb of semiconductor valence band vb under uv light iv photo reduction of s2o8 2 o2 into so4 o2 by electrons ecd of semiconductor conduction band cb under uv light yang et al 2019a the addition of persulfate to the photocatalytic system i minimizes e h recombination since ecd are captured by s2o8 2 more easily than by h2o2 and o2 due to the higher electron affinity of s2o8 2 2 1 against 1 77 and 0 44 ev respectively guerra rodríguez et al 2018 huling and pivetz 2006 and ii increases the ratio of radicals product electron hole pairs consumption for s2o8 2 pathway compared to that for o2 pathway monteagudo et al 2019 schneider et al 2014 another possible strategy is to develop new oxidant dosing methods able to reduce the dosage of pds required and minimize the quenching reactions between radicals decreasing the sulfate post contamination vilar and co workers proposed a low footprint tube in tube membrane reactor castellanos et al 2020 to drive in a smart way the oxidant into the catalyst surface and water to be treated through virtually unlimited number of oxidant dosing points across the membrane and further dispersed to the annular reaction zone where the oxidant is activated by uvc light reducing its consumption improving the contact with the pollutants and avoiding catalyst deactivation therefore this paper investigates for the first time the use of a tube in tube membrane reactor to boost the efficiency of uv s2o8 2 and uv s2o8 2 tio2 for the treatment of pharmaceutical compounds in municipal secondary effluent additional objectives are i to identify the main pharmaceuticals transformation products tps with proposed pathways and ii to assess the potential toxicity and biodegradability of the tps generated during the treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials analytical grade purity 98 99 nimesulide nmd furosemide frs paracetamol pct and diazepam dzp were used in this work as target pollutants see table s 1 these pharmaceuticals are frequently detected in hospital and urban wastewaters becker et al 2019 papageorgiou et al 2016 sodium persulfate merck 98 was used as oxidant aeroxide tio2 p25 powder 99 5 w w purity crystalline phases 20 wt rutile and 80 wt anatase was supplied by evonik and used as catalyst ethanol merck p a were used to stop the oxidation ability

c were used in the hplc dad analytical system the synthetic pharmaceutical solution sps was prepared freshly before each experiment by appropriate dilution of the pharmaceutical stock solution 10 000 mg l 1 in methanol acetonitrile 1 2 v v in demineralized water panice reverse osmosis system municipal wastewater mww sample was collected downstream the secondary settling tank of a mwwtp located in the north of portugal and kept refrigerated until use the main physicochemical characteristics of the real mww table s2 were assessed according to the procedures already described moreira et al 2016 taking into consideration that typical pharmaceutical concentrations in the wastewater are in the 0 1 200 µg l 1 range it was decided to fortify a synthetic pharmaceutical solution sps in demineralized water and mww with 200 µg l 1 of each pharmaceutical compound which is related to i a concentration high enough to study kinetics using conventional analytical techniques and ii low enough to simulate real conditions the ph of the mww was adjusted to 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 when required using sulfuric acid pronalab purity 96 1 84 g cm3 sps and mww matrices were used as inlet streams of the tube in tube membrane reactor 2 2 tube in tube membrane reactor set up the full description of the experimental set up can be seen elsewhere castellanos et al 2020 vilar et al 2020 summarizing the reactor comprises an inner ceramic tubular ultrafiltration membrane γ al2o3 membrane from inopor gmbh and an outer quartz tube fixed vertically and sealed by mobile polypropylene flanges four uv lamps located externally to the quartz tube allows for a uniform illumination of the annular reaction zone arz and membrane surface the ceramic membrane shell side was coated with a tio2 p25 thin film 9 layers by dip coating more information about the experimental set up and catalyst deposition procedure over the membrane shell side can be seen in section s 3 supporting information 2 3 experimental procedure firstly the inner space of the ceramic membrane was filled with s2o8 2 stock solution 52 1 mm ph 4 27 182 2 mm ph 4 15 364 4 mm ph 4 06 or 728 7 mm ph 4 01 using a syringe pump back pressure regulator bpr fully open then with the bpr fully closed s2o8 2 solution is forced through the membrane pores inside out permeation using the syringe pump the sps pharm inlet 200 µg l 1 of each t 25 c ph 6 4 was pumped q inlet pharm 40 l h 1 re 2056 optimum hydrodynamics conditions according to vilar et al 2020 through the arz while the syringe pump forced the s2o8 2 solution through the membrane pores and uvc or uva lamps were turned on the system was surrounded by an aluminum shell to protect direct eye contact from the radiation samples were collected at reactor outlet at different time intervals until a steady state condition was reached for quantification of pharmaceuticals ethanol 100 μl was added to quench s2o8 2 immediately after collection of samples 1 ml oxidant permeation tests were carried out for the membranes with and without tio2 after pharmaceutical oxidation tests using the sps and oxidant permeation method were carried out using the membrane without catalyst and with catalyst assays with the mww were performed using the uvc s2o8 2 tio2 system by changing the oxidant dose s2o8 2 stock solution 364 4 or 728 7 mm dosing rate 2 15 ml min 1 tests with direct injection of oxidant upstream of the reactor inlet using sps and mww were carried out to evaluate the system performance and to compare with the permeation dosing method table s3 presents the experimental conditions used in all tests after each experiment the reaction system was cleaned with demineralized water membrane photoactivity remained stable during all tests 2 4 analytical procedures the residual s2o8 2 concentration was measured according to the method proposed by liang et al 2008 absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 352 nm using a uv visible spectrophotometer the concentrations of pharmaceuticals were measured by hplc dad according to the method presented elsewhere cuervo lumbaque et al 2020 pharmaceutical tps generated during the photochemical photocatalytic process were extracted pre concentrated using solid phase extraction spe procedure adapted from ibáñez et al 2017 tps analysis was performed in a liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry lc qtof ms system see text s 4 supporting information using a purpose built database associated with tps screening methodology cuervo lumbaque et al 2018 the database contains the calculated masses of the suspected transformation products and the chemical structure of each of them the qtof ms system was operated in broadband collision induced dissociation bbcid acquisition mode which provided ms and ms ms spectra at the same time this simultaneous extraction allowed to confirm the fragment ions in the spectra recorded for each peak the requirements to find the peak and postulate it as probable tp were i an intensity threshold greater than 1000 cps ii s n ratio higher than 10 iii precision error of the measured mass 5 ppm for the protonated ion m h iv the same retention time between the protonated ion and its fragments and v the double bond equivalent rdb fit with the structure helping to indicate compounds as tentative tps found using the database approach schymanski et al 2014 the ecotoxicity assessment of the tps previously identified was provided by toxtree v 3 1 0 patlewicz et al 2008 and epi suite software us epa 2019 cramer rules module and benigni bossarulebase for mutagenicity and carcinogenicity available at toxtree and ready biodegradability values were predicted by start biodegradation and persistence model of toxtree and the biowin complement of epi suite the simplified molecular input line entry system smiles was used for the assessment table s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 s2o8 2 radial addition tests and steady state conditions steady state conditions for s2o8 2 concentration in the absence of uvc light and pharmaceuticals fig s1a and b and for concentrations of pharmaceuticals at the reactor outlet using the uvc s2o8 2 membrane without catalyst fig s2a or uvc s2o8 2 tio2 membrane coated with catalyst fig s2b systems in the water flow side at the reactor outlet are obtained after t τ 100 τ is the space time inside the illuminated arz in the next sections the conversion of pharmaceuticals will be calculated based on the pharmaceutical concentrations at steady state conditions process efficiency was calculated as the ratio between the mass flux of pharmaceutical converted in a single passage in the reactor pharm inlet pharm outlet q at steady state conditions and the mass flux of pharmaceutical in the inlet stream pharm inlet q 3 2 membrane without catalyst uvc s2o8 2 and uvc s2o8 2 uvc photolysis without catalyst and no s2o8 2 permeation of the four pharmaceuticals showed limited conversions values ranging from 2 5 fig 1 a mainly associated with the low uvc fluence 45 mj cm 2 employed in this study yang et al 2014 frs and dzp are the most photolabile molecules frs presents a carboxylate anion group at ph 6 4 which drives the subsequent release of a leaving group via β elimination due to the photons energy while the carbonyl group present in dzp is the center of photochemical reactivity klán et al 2013 this is in agreement with the optical properties of the pharmaceutical compounds at 254 nm see table s1 quantum yield frs dzp pct and extinction coefficient pct dzp frs nmd therefore the combination of large molar absorption coefficients and quantum yields at 254 nm could explain the higher photosensitivity of frs followed by dzp and pct however the correlation between photo reactivity and the physicochemical properties of their molecules is not easy because pharmaceuticals are present in a mixture some of them show acid and basic groups molinari et al 2006 as well as various substituents electron donating and withdrawing s2o8 2 direct reaction with pharmaceuticals in the absence of uvc light considering the highest dose of s2o8 2 0 59 mm takes place at a very low rate resulting in conversions of 4 5 fig 1b as reported elsewhere cvetnić et al 2019 as expected the uvc s2o8 2 system showed significantly higher degradation values of pharmaceuticals following step wise order regarding an increase of oxidant concentration until 0 59 mm fig 1a associated with the production of so4 by the homolytic cleavage of the o o bond of s2o8 2 by uvc light frontistis 2019 pct frs and dzp are the molecules more sensitive to uvc s2o8 2 as so4 is electrophilic the reaction is favored by the presence of electron donating groups of pharmaceuticals and the reaction with electron withdrawing groups is generally slower under the experimental conditions at ph 6 4 and according to the speciation of the pharmaceuticals in this condition fig s3 frs contains a carboxylate group strong electron donating group allowing degradation pathways by electron transfer nmd does not have spontaneous reactions through an electron transfer mechanism due to strong electron withdrawing group no2 mei et al 2019 which explains the low degradation of the nmd on the other hand the dzp molecule could be susceptible to oxidation by so4 through cleavage of n c guo et al 2004 like the so4 attack to the pct molecule favors aromatic ring opening through cleavage of c c bond by electron transfer reactions moussavi et al 2017 also for molecules containing the oh group as pct the addition of free radicals and the h abstraction reactions are thermodynamically favorable mei et al 2019 a kinetic model eq 1 was developed taking into account the mass balance to the annular reactor at steady state conditions first order reaction plug flow hydrodynamics conditions and constant temperature 1 c out c feed e v l k where c feed is the concentration of pharmaceuticals at the inlet of the photoreactor μg l 1 c out is the concentration of pharmaceuticals at the outlet of the photoreactor at steady state conditions μg l 1 v is the fluid velocity cm min 1 l is the length of illuminated photoreactor cm and k is the first order kinetic constant min 1 the kinetic constant based on degradation showed a higher reactivity towards pct than frs dzp and nmd k pct 5 13min 1 k frs 4 57 min 1 k dzp 4 03 min 1 and k nmd 2 40 min 1 3 3 membrane coated with tio2 p25 3 3 1 uva radiation uva tio2and uva s2o8 2 tio2 in the next set of experiments membrane coated with tio2 p25 irradiated by uva light was used to improve the system performance for degradation of pharmaceuticals using sps as solution matrix as the ph of the sps 6 4 is similar to the phpzc of tio2 p25 nanoparticles 6 5 matos et al 2009 negligible electrostatic attraction occurs between the target molecules and the catalyst surface resulting in low removal values of 0 8 1 2 0 1 and 0 9 for pct frs nmd and dzp respectively data not shown although tio2 uva photocatalysis showed low conversion values of pharmaceuticals and low consumption of s2o8 2 fig 2 a and c the titration of small doses of s2o8 2 to the tio2 nanoparticles immobilized in the membrane shell side activated by uva light boosted the conversion of pharmaceuticals through two different mechanisms a direct oxidation by s2o8 2 and uva light b indirect oxidation by b1 oh s2o8 generated by the photo oxidation of h2o oh s2o8 2 by holes hvb b2 so4 o2 produced by the photo reduction of s2o8 2 o2 by electrons ecd yang et al 2019a simultaneously s2o8 2 serves as electron trap reducing the recombination rate of photogenerated e h ike et al 2018 and increases the ratio of radicals product electron hole pairs consumption monteagudo et al 2019 schneider et al 2014 3 3 2 uvc radiation uvc tio2 and uvc s2o8 2 tio2 the uva s2o8 2 system presents a lower efficiency than the photochemical uvc s2o8 2 process which is mainly associated with lower molar absorptivity and quantum yield of s2o8 2 at 365 nm ε 0 1 m 1 cm 1 ϕ 1 1 mol oxidant einstein 1 ding and hu 2020 ismail et al 2017 when compared to 254 nm ε 22 m 1 cm 1 ϕ 1 8 mol oxidant einstein 1 he et al 2013 xu et al 2020 a higher pharmaceutical degradation efficiency was observed for the uvc driven photocatalysis fig 3 a when compared with the uvc light driven photolysis uvc s2o8 2 this implicates that the synergic effect between the catalyst film immobilized in the membrane shell side and uvc radiation plays a role on the activation of persulfate as also in the generation of other reactive oxygen species which is reflected in the highest consumption of s2o8 2 fig 3c vs fig 1c fig 4 compares the kinetic constants for the four pharmaceutical compounds using persulfate and hydrogen peroxide oxidants cuervo lumbaque et al 2020 when the activation mechanism is uvc light persulfate leads to better results than hydrogen peroxide for all pharmaceuticals tested considering the highest oxidant dose tested this is in agreement with the optical properties of the applied oxidant φ254 s2o8 2 1 8 φ254 h2o2 1 0 molar absorption coefficients ε254 s2o8 2 21 1 m 1cm 1 ε254 h2o2 18 m 1cm 1 goldstein et al 2007 and dissociation energy 92 kj mol 1fors2o8 2 and 213 kj mol 1 for h2o2 wacławek et al 2017 when oxidants are activated simultaneously by uvc light and electron transfer mechanisms the following conclusions can be taken i s2o8 2 based process presents a higher performance towards pct ii h2o2 based process presents a higher performance towards nmd and iii both oxidants based processes present a similar performance towards frs and dzp 3 4 effect of wastewater matrix at the natural ph 8 0 of the mww the uvc s2o8 2 tio2 system shows a rather low removal of pharmaceuticals fig 5 b the mww matrix impacts negatively the generation of radicals species as also has a strong radical quenching effect resulting in a nine to seven fold rate of degradation decrease on nmd and dzp respectively and four fold rate of degradation decrease on pct and frs removal when comparing with the sps using the same dose of oxidant 0 59 mm fig 5a vs fig 3a although an increase on oxidant dose enhances conversion of pharmaceuticals higher residual concentrations of oxidant are observed at the reactor outlet mainly associated with the low uvc fluence 45 mj cm 2 to avoid the waste of high oxidant doses and increase the process efficiency a much higher uvc fluence is requested as normally used in real treatment plants 600 1000 mj cm 2 oh et al 2016 being able to use lower amounts of oxidant since the probability of persulfate molecules to be photolyzed increases with the uvc fluence another approach to overcome this limitation is to integrate sr aop with another type of oxidant e g hydrogen peroxide or ozone to achieve a synergistic oxidation effect and thus decrease the pds dose and sulfate post contamination duan et al 2020 the so4 and oh radicals are largely consumed by the main components of mww such as inorganic anions and natural organic matter as hco3 major source of inorganic carbon at ph 8 is one of the major scavenger agents of so4 k so4 hco3 9 1 106 m 1s 1 and oh k oh hco3 8 5 106 m 1s 1 wacławek et al 2017 the effect of the mww ph ic 24 1 20 3 10 9 and 6 3 mg c l 1 for ph values of 8 7 6 and 5 respectively on removal of pharmaceuticals was assessed fig 5b shows a continuous increase on the conversion of pharmaceuticals with the decrease of inorganic carbon indicating that hco3 species plays an important role as scavenger agent of sulfate and hydroxyl radicals the presence of nitrates in mww 57 mg l 1 can acts as uvc filter preventing light transmission through the reaction medium to the catalyst surface yang et al 2019b being also a strong scavenger agent k so4 no2 8 8 108 m 1s 1 k oh no2 8 0 109 m 1s 1 shah et al 2013 phosphate can also exhibit a strong inhibitory effect on the removal of pharmaceuticals by processes based on sulfate or hydroxyl radicals k so4 h2po4 7 2 104 m 1s 1 k oh h2po4 2 0 104 m 1s 1 k so4 hpo4 2 1 2 106 m 1s 1 k oh hpo4 2 1 5 105 m 1s 1 xie et al 2015 furthermore the phosphate ions can also chelate on tio2 surface zhao et al 2008 relative to the sulfate ion the reaction of so4 2 with so4 and oh is much slower k oh so4 2 3 5 105 m 1s 1 shah et al 2013 than other inorganic anions such as cl k so4 cl 6 6 108 m 1s 1 k oh cl 4 3 109 m 1s 1 shah et al 2013 and hco3 therefore the role of so4 2 as radical scavenger is not as important as the dissolved organic matter k so4 dom 6 8 103 mg c 1 s 1 k oh dom 1 4 104 mg c 1 s 1 oh et al 2016 total suspended solids can have a high impact on light penetration in the reaction medium until the surface of the catalyst since they can block the catalyst surface and work as radical scavenger consequently further tests were performed using a mww after filtration with a qualitative filter paper particle retention 12 µm the filtration step improved substantially the conversion of pharmaceuticals reaching values of 27 26 15 and 19 for pct frs nmd and dzp respectively fig 5c concluding a sand filtration step is mandatory before the uvc s2o8 2 tio2 oxidation treatment the kinetic constants for the conversion of the four pharmaceuticals using persulfate and hydrogen peroxideoxidants with the same matrix mww oxidant dose 2 36 mm reactor configuration and process uvc oxidant tio2 are displayed in fig 6 it can be seen that the persulfate oxidation process achieves a much faster conversion of pharmaceutical than the hydrogen peroxide oxidation process then sr aops seems to be a good approach for the treatment of complex environmental matrices containing plenty of doms and inorganic anions such as mww towards the removal of specific pharmaceuticals and other cecs 3 5 effect of the s2o8 2 dosage method the permeation of the oxidant through the membranes pores is able to drive in a smart way the oxidant into the catalyst surface and water to be treated resulting in a much better performance especially for the most recalcitrant pharmaceuticals nmd and dzp than its injection upstream the reactor inlet and leading to a higher consumption of oxidant fig s4a and b although the same tendency is observed for the mww matrix the impact of radial addition of oxidant is less significant when compared to its injection upstream the reactor inlet fig s4c this can be associated with the much slower reactions kinetics for mww matrix and to the use of a much higher oxidant dosage 2 36 mm fig s4d beyond that the persulfate solution that is internally fed to the membrane presents an acidic ph value between 4 01 and 4 27 this will result in local points near the membrane shell side with more acidic ph values increasing the oxidant power of so4 and oh radicals the final ph values of the water at the reactor outlet at steady state conditions were around 5 0 for sps for uww the ph of the inlet and outlet water was similar besides the reactor configuration induces a helical motion of the fluid stream around the membrane shell side increasing the interfacial mass transfer promoting the mobility of persulfate molecules and ros from the catalyst surface to the solution bulk facilitating the shift from a heterogeneous to homogeneous reaction 3 6 identification of tps by using purpose built database and target screening method samples from uvc s2o8 2 and uvc s2o8 2 tio2 processes using sps and mww matrices were analyzed by lc qtof ms system in bbcid operation mode tps identification was performed using total ion chromatograms and extracted ion chromatograms data obtained for each sample analyzed in total 22 tps were identified table s4 during the oxidation tests tps chemical structures have been assigned based in purpose built database gathered from the current literature on the basis of the tps identified tentatively pharmaceutical degradation pathways were proposed fig 7 for each initial compound studied in uvc s2o8 2 tio2 system so4 normally undergo electron transfer reactions while oh may also react via hydrogen atom abstraction along with an electron transfer process which is however less prominent in its case liang and su 2009 the so4 could react with aromatic rings and double bonds thereby forming sulfate radical adducts having a very short life 20 ns lomoth et al 1999 which confirms the non identification of adducts with a sulfonic moiety the radical cation adducts are formed due to electron transfer from aromatic ring to so4 by releasing a sulfate group so4 2 and these adducts could react through nucleophilic attack of water or via the addition of oxygen from the air and or decomposition of s2o8 2 these are responsible for the formation of hydroxylated tps by the elimination of ho2 or water molecules sharma et al 2015 the radical degradation pathway for paracetamol pct fig 7a proceeds initially by the formation of pct by a one electron oxidation process this oxidized radical intermediate which itself is an identified tp tp30 pct can undergo hydroxylation trough two different pathways path a in red color and path b in green color reaction with hydroxyl radical at the ortho position path a red leads to tp5 pct which was observed in mww matrix while the reaction at the para position path b green leads to an additional c n bond breaking event ultimately leading to tp8 pct alternatively the key radical intermediate can lead to the corresponding dimerization products tp28 pct a b and c arising from carbon oxygen or carbon carbon radical dimerization during pct oxidation in sps and mww matrices since these three products have the same m z ratio m z 301 073832 at this point is difficult to unambiguously assign which is the correct structure however based on the relative radical stability it is more likely that tp28 pct a and b are favored over tp28 pct c zhong et al 2019 this dimerization pathway is in accordance with that reported elsewhere fang et al 2013b in which the authors propose the dimerization of the quinone moiety through the production of so4 from persulfate in the uvc s2o8 2 system so4 is the predominant radical species although ho derivatives are reported from the reaction of so4 due the interaction of so4 with ho o2 or h2o and both so4 or oh could be considered for the degradation of pharmaceuticals fang et al 2013a fang et al 2015 fang et al 2013b zhu et al 2016 oxidation of frs fig 7b takes place initially by the formation of a resonance stabilized radical next to the furan ring hydrogen abstraction led to imine formation tp3 frs and subsequent hydrolysis of the imine functional groups results in the formation of the free aniline tp4 frs in a parallel fashion the furan heterocycle is oxidized by a radical hydroxylation followed by a ring opening reaction leading to the corresponding γ ketoenal tp1 frs laurencé et al 2014 2011 this tp is also prone to amine to imine oxidation therefore delivering tp10 frs as the product the previous tps from frs were observed in both so4 based processes tp3 and tp4 frs were also identified in oh based processes cuervo lumbaque et al 2020 it was also observed that nmd pka 6 7 exists in an equilibrium between the ionized and unionized forms fig 7c the ionized form is prone to reaction with so4 to yield the resonance stabilized radical tp45 nmd this intermediate can then undergo a c h radical hydroxylation at the ortho position related to the sulfonamide group leading to tp41 nmd carbon oxygen oxidative bond cleavage triggers the phenol oxidative decomposition pathway ultimately leading to the identification of tp14 nmd in agreement with the mechanism proposed bukkitgar et al 2016 these tps were only observed for the uvc s2o8 2 tio2 in mww finally in the oxidation process of dzp by uvc s2o8 2 and uvc s2o8 2 tio2 fig 7d the degradation process starts by radical abstraction of a hydrogen next to the amide group leading to a resonance stabilized radical further hydroxylation at this position can lead to tp9 dzp a alternatively two additional tps with the same m z can also be formed by a different mechanistic pathway radical hydroxylation at either one the aromatic rings might afford tp9 dzp b and tp9 dzp c at this point of the study is premature to unequivocally assign the exact structure among the three possibilities these tps are thermodynamically stable relative to the starting compounds yang et al 2018 on the other hand one electron oxidation at the c n bond can lead to the radical anion which leads to hemi aminal tp13 dzp by protonation and radical hydroxylation reactions this tp13 dzp undergoes further hydrolysis to result in tp1 dzp as the result of breaking of the 8 membered ring system according to so4 and oh initiated oxidation reactions four possible mechanisms in the degradation of pharmaceuticals can be elucidated i free radical addition to the neutral pharmaceutical molecule favoring in most cases adduct formation ii free radical abstract one h atom from the neutral molecule leading to bisulfate ion water molecule mei et al 2019 iii hydroxylation through interaction of so4 with ho o2 or h2o and iv ring opening reactions that generate less aromatic products in our previous study cuervo lumbaque et al 2020 the oh based process uvc h2o2and uvc h2o2 tio2 was characterized by aromatic ring hydroxylation and the formation of smaller structures compared to the original pharmaceutical in addition there was no evidence of significant differences in tps using both oh based process the tps identified in so4 based processes show more clearly the formation of aromatic intermediates as a consequence of oxidative coupling reactions of resonance stabilized radicals dimerization and ring contraction ring opening products were typical for oxidation based on so4 and oh 3 7 q sar assessment of ecotoxicological implications the tps chemical structures were analyzed to estimate the ecotoxicological implications a preliminary evaluation of tps toxicity was carried out with toxtree and epi suite software as described in section 2 4 the results obtained are summarized in fig s5 and table s5 tps were classified according to cramer s rules class iii suggest significant toxicity lapenna and worth 2011 alerts for possible dna damage mutagenic cancer formation carcinogenic and if they are biodegradable or not according to predicted activation and deactivation alerts indicated by q sar models the results obtained for the tps identified showed that more than 80 of tp content suggests significant toxicity and persistence in the environment among them 42 can cause cancer and 11 direct damage to dna all dzp frs and nmd tps are in class iii according to carmer s rules and most of them are not biodegradable tp1 and tp10 frs are potentially mutagenic and carcinogenic substances which is corroborated by the high probability of intermediates of the furan ring such as γ ketoenal present in these two tps to alkylate proteins and dna which triggers toxicity peterson 2013 with reference to pct tps tp8 and tp33 are highlighted as they have low ecotoxicological damage characteristics and easily biodegradable regarding previous studies cuervo lumbaque et al 2020 regardless of the oxidant used h2o2 or s2o8 2 the low biodegradability of the tps identified in each process is maintained 4 conclusions a low footprint tube in tube membrane photoreactor operated in a continuous mode was able to boost sulfate radical advanced oxidation processes and pharmaceuticals removal due to two main points i combination of photolysis and chemical electron transfer activation methods for ros production and ii ability to drive in an efficient way the oxidant into the catalyst surface and water to be treated through virtually unlimited number of oxidant dosing points across the membrane providing a more homogeneous distribution of the injected chemical across the whole reactor length the uvc s2o8 2 tio2 showed a higher degradation performance towards all pharmaceutical compounds in mww when compared to uvc h2o2 tio2 twenty two tps were identified through lc qtof ms analysis and the main degradation routes were proposed for each evaluated pharmaceutical so4 normally undergo electron transfer reactions while oh may also react via hydrogen atom abstraction along with an electron transfer process in turn the tps chemical structures reveal a high toxicity potential low biodegradability and in some cases the risk of mutagenicity and cancerogenic by in silico q sar predictions finally in order to increase the conversion of pharmaceutical compounds and their tps into less toxic substances in urban wastewater treatment a higher

17229,the contribution of specific precursors to n nitrosodimethylamine formation potential ndma fp upon chloramination depends not only on their ndma molar yields but also on their concentrations in the actual environment we investigated the seasonal and diurnal patterns of the ndma precursor n n dimethylformamide dmf and ndma fp in the yodo river basin japan by examining water samples taken from inside the basin s largest sewage treatment plant stp as well as samples from five final effluents from four stps two main stream sites and two tributary sites in the same basin dmf and ndma fp were found to be high in influent raw sewage and were found to be mostly removed during the stp treatment processes especially with biological treatment nevertheless dmf was found in concentrations of 0 06 to 31 7 µg l in chlorinated effluents and in receiving rivers while ndma fp was detected in concentrations of 3 57 to 306 ng l thus stps were shown to be an important source of dmf and ndma fp to rivers a strong positive correlation between ndma fp and dmf was confirmed in the receiving river k m indicating that dmf was an important ndma precursor in the yodo river basin the contribution of dmf to ndma fp was 15 8 11 2 n 4 in summer and 82 1 10 2 n 4 in winter in the main stream site k m of the river due to insufficient dilution of chlorinated effluents from the largest stp from the viewpoint of ndma and ndma fp control at downstream sites monitoring and control of dmf at upstream sites are important graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords n nitrosodimethylamine formation potential n n dimethylformamide precursor intermediate contribution 1 introduction n nitrosodimethylamine ndma is classified as a group 2a carcinogen who 1987 and it arises unintentionally from a large series of processes who 2002 including disinfection in sewage treatment plants stps especially chloramination chloramination is considered the dominant mechanism responsible for formation of ndma krasner et al 2013 and chloramine can be produced when secondary stp effluent containing ammonia is treated with chlorine furst et al 2018 moreover ndma formation potential ndma fp is also readily found in stp effluent and in surface waters upon chloramination uzun et al 2015 yoon et al 2011 zeng et al 2016 indicating that there are residual precursors responsible for the formation of ndma therefore although ndma is not commercially used ndma is frequently detected in the aquatic environment krasner et al 2013 sgroi et al 2018 zhao et al 2020a 2020b due to unintentional production from industry mitch et al 2003a sedlak and kavanaugh 2006 krasner et al 2009 ndma precursors in the environment are influenced by anthropogenic activities especially industry as well as by the types of disinfection process used in water and wastewater treatment previous studies identified dimethylamine dma as an important precursor for ndma formation during water and wastewater disinfection mitch and sedlak 2002 however based on the low molar yield dma alone cannot account for the entire mass of ndma formation mitch et al 2003b therefore efforts to evaluate other specific precursors and formation pathways are critical to develop suitable strategies to reduce formation of ndma during water and wastewater treatment padhye et al 2009 a few industry related ndma precursors have been found and are used in specific industries kosaka et al 2009 2014 their use can be prohibited if there are alternative substances or the wastewater from these industries can be treated separately before discharge lim et al 2016 however there are many basic substances that have dma functional groups and several of these including n n dimethylformamide dmf have been evaluated and recognized as possible precursors of ndma formation upon chloramination hinneh et al 2019 nakada et al 2016 selbes et al 2013 yoon and tanaka 2014 and some of these cannot be substituted with other substances because of its excellent miscibility with water and numerous organic substances dmf has been widely employed in a variety of industries as a versatile organic polar solvent ceri 2007 dmf itself has an adverse impact on water quality and human health because of its numerous toxic effects kumar et al 2012 swaroop et al 2009 yan et al 2002 moreover dmf used in the production of drugs was found to be responsible for ndma contamination of certain valsartan containing drugs due to its transformation to dma masada et al 2019 scherf clavel et al 2019 sörgel et al 2019 according to japan s pollutant release and transfer register prtr dmf is one of the nation s most commonly used chemicals with total releases and transfers of 9627 tonnes in 2017 and 9035 tonnes in 2018 pollutant release and transfer register prtr 2017 pollutant release and transfer register prtr 2018 pollutant release and transfer register prtr 2017 pollutant release and transfer register prtr 2018 of which 0 4 was discharged into the sewerage system in kyoto prefecture which was within the area covered in our study dmf was the 5th most used chemical with total releases and transfers of 187 tonnes in 2017 and 185 tonnes in 2018 pollutant release and transfer register prtr 2017 pollutant release and transfer register prtr 2018 pollutant release and transfer register prtr 2017 pollutant release and transfer register prtr 2018 in 2018 16 4 tonnes of dmf was discharged to the sewerage system pollutant release and transfer register prtr 2018 pollutant release and transfer register prtr 2018 which was a much higher amount than other possible ndma precursors such as dma with 0 01 tonnes therefore it is possible that dmf acts as a typical ndma precursor upon chloramination in urban water treatment systems when the removal of dmf is not enough during processing in stps most studies have focused on the biodegradation of dmf in batch tests kong et al 2018 sanjeevkumar et al 2013 swaroop et al 2009 wang and li 2015 wang et al 2020 but research is largely lacking as to the fate of dmf in the actual environment including during stp processes and in rivers although tanabe and kawata 2009 demonstrated the fluctuations of dmf in the influents and effluents of two stps twice and found low removal rates the behavior of dmf within the stps was still not clear in fact it has been found that dmf is a product of the hypochlorite oxidation and chloramination of hydrazine fuels brubaker et al 1989 mitch and sedlak 2002 implying that it is insufficient to monitor dmf only in the influent and effluent of stps due to possible formation of dmf during disinfection by chlorination although there are many advanced treatments e g reverse osmosis ro and uv h2o2 used in wastewater reclamation that can effectively remove the majority of ndma precursors it has been found that dmf could still contribute to ndma formation during chloramination after those advanced treatments krauss et al 2010 lee et al 2007 mccurry et al 2017 mitch and sedlak 2004 sgroi et al 2015 furthermore due to its thermal stability and low degradability dmf remains obstinate in the natural environment kumar et al 2012 and has been found in river water nd 0 67 µg l and sea water nd 1 0 µg l kadokami et al 1993 the contribution of a specific precursor to ndma fp depends not only on its ndma molar yield but also on its concentration in the actual environment after evaluation dmf might be found to be an important precursor of ndma as pointed out by other researchers mitch and sedlak 2004 several studies have reported ndma fp in urban drinking water systems however comprehensive studies detailing the relationship between dmf and ndma fp in the aquatic environment are lacking in the literature considering the strict regulations on ndma it is important to grasp the fate and concentration of dmf and ndma fp in stps and in receiving rivers especially those used as a source of drinking water downstream to the best of our knowledge this is the first research to address the fate of dmf as well as the role of dmf in ndma formation during chloramination in de facto wastewater reuse in an urban area 2 materials and

site y m in the yodo river basin which is one of japan s major basins fig 1 the yodo river basin covers an area of 8240 km2 extending over the shiga kyoto and osaka prefectures and it is home to a population of over 11 7 million water samples were collected at nine sites five stp effluents two in the main stream of the yodo river and two in the nishitakase river a tributary of the katsura river fig 1 the four selected stps stp a stp b stp c and stp d represent major stps in the central yodo river basin three stps stp a stp c and stp d use a conventional activated sludge cas process for secondary treatment whereas stp b uses three different treatments a cas process an anaerobic oxic process and a recycled nitrification step feed biological nitrogen removal process in terms of disinfection three stps stp b stp c and stp d use chlorination while stp a uses ozonation stp b which this study focused on serves most of the population equivalent to over 0 78 million in kyoto city population of 1 46 million kyoto city waterworks bureau kcwb 2018 kyoto city waterworks bureau kcwb 2019 this plant plays an important role in water quality especially in the downstream sites of the yodo river and treats domestic and industrial wastewater with a treatment volume of over 53 9 104 m3 d the properties of the influent at stp b are reported in our previous study zhao et al 2019 stp b has two influent lines b 1 and b 2 and two final effluents from them which are discharged into the nishitakase river b s1 and the katsura river b s2 respectively fig 1 the influents are treated in 11 lines consisting of individual primary and secondary treatments and four disinfection processes fig s1 to investigate the fates of dmf and ndma fp samples were taken from influent raw sewage points 1

on occurrence and relationship of target compounds grab samplings were also carried out in stp b in the nishitakase river inflow between sites a s and k 1t consisted solely of treated water discharged from stp a while site k 2t contained about 100 treated wastewater from stps a a s and b b s1 there was no notable additional inflow the distance was 1 56 km between a s and k 1t while the distance was 1 06 km between k 1t and k 2t the river flow and depth were stable during dry weather hanamoto et al 2014 zhao et al 2020a 2020b to evaluate the natural attenuation of analytes especially between a s and k 2t travel time was considered in certain samplings to determine the sampling time especially at k 2t the theoretical concentration was calculated by multiplying the detected concentration at a s

infrastructure and transport japan surveys in the study area were conducted over a 1 year period from may 2017 to july 2018 during periods of no rainfall including seasonal summer june september and winter december february and diurnal day and night variations for determining the presence of ndma and dmf ambient levels samples were collected in 300 ml amber bottles and immediately dechlorinated by addition of sodium thiosulfate to determine ndma precursor levels samples were collected for the ndma fp test in 1000 ml amber bottles without addition of sodium thiosulfate and brought to the laboratory where phosphate buffer 10 mm was added to each bottle to adjust ph to 7 0 all samples were kept in an ice box during shipment then placed in the dark at 4 c until sample pre treatment 2 3

standards ndma and dmf were analyzed by solid phase extraction spe lc tandem ms lc ms ms the spe process was modified slightly from that of the previous study yoon et al 2013 detailed procedures for dmf and ndma analysis are described in supplementary information s1 detailed analytical parameters for ndma are summarized in our previous study zhao et al 2020a while the information for dmf is summarized in table s1 analytical accuracy test data for dmf and ndma using different types of water sample are summarized in table s2 2 4 ndma fp tests 2 4 1 ndma fp of environmental samples by chloramination the potential for ndma formation by chloramination ndma fp in environmental samples was defined as the increase in ndma concentration after 10 days the procedure for the test followed that of other studies mitch et al 2003b with a minor modification yoon et al 2011 a 20 mm stock solution of monochloramine nh2cl was prepared for chloramination unfiltered water samples 900 ml with ph adjusted to 7 0 were dosed with 100 ml of monochloramine stock solution final concentration of 2 0 mm or 142 mg l as cl2 in 1 l sealed amber bottles with teflon lined screw caps and the sample was stored for 10 days at 25 c shielded from light after 10 days incubation residual chloramine was quenched by adding excess sodium thiosulfate then the samples were processed for ndma and dmf analysis the difference in dmf concentration during the fp test was defined as dmf and was calculated by the following equation 1 δ d m f c d m f 10 d c d m f a m b i e n t where c dm f 10 d is the final concentration of dmf in the environmental sample after 10 days incubation µg l and c dm f ambient is the ambient concentration of dmf in the environmental sample µg l 2 4 2 ndma fp of dmf by chloramination and contribution of dmf to ndma fp in environmental samples the ndma fp from chloramination of dmf was also tested based on the procedure for environmental samples above with a minor modification dmf was added to the solutions dosed with the monochloramine stock solution to an initial dmf concentration of 1 37 µm equal to 100 µg l and initial chloramine concentration of 2 0 mm or 142 mg l as cl2 aliquots of 1 l ultrapure water without dmf only chloramine and without chloramine only dmf were also processed using the same procedure to serve as controls after 10 days incubation residual chloramine was quenched by adding excess sodium thiosulfate then the samples were processed for ndma and dmf analysis the ndma fp of dmf was evaluated from percent molar yield by the following equation 2 m o l a r y i e l d c n d m a c d m f 100 where cndma is the final molar concentration of ndma after 10 days incubation and cdmf is the initial designed molar concentration of dmf moreover the contribution of dmf to ndma fp ng l in environmental samples was calculated by the concentration of dmf in samples multiplied by its molar yield 10 days 2 5 biodegradation and photodegradation tests biodegradation tests were conducted in accordance with the u s environmental protection agency s test guideline 835 3170 epa 1998a to estimate the attenuation of dmf by bioactivity in addition to estimate the attenuation of dmf by sunlight irradiation during river transport direct photolysis tests were conducted in accordance with the u s environmental protection agency s test guideline 835 2210 epa 1998b to evaluate the natural attenuation of dmf by weak solar irradiation on winter middays december 2018 the methods of these two experiments are described in supplementary information s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 contribution of dmf to ndma fp within stps because dmf had been identified in previous studies to be a precursor of ndma hinneh et al 2019 mitch and sedlak 2004 nakada et al 2016 the contribution of dmf to total ndma fp detected at individual sampling points within stp b was calculated based on the ndma molar yield from dmf 0 90 on average n 3 table s3 and the dmf concentration detected 3 1 1 influent raw sewage dmf is a popular solvent for chemical reactions and is used in the manufacture of many industrial products e g acrylic fiber plastics and surface coatings bipp and kieczka 2000 the concentrations of dmf and ndma fp in influents fluctuated n 4 table s4 to confirm the relationship between ndma fp and dmf in the influent influent b 2 was sampled every hour for 24 hours in winter december 14 15 2017 and summer july 11 12 2018 because the flow rate of influent b 2 sampling point 2 1 fluctuated much more than the flow rates at other sampling points along the treatment line e g 2 2 fig s1 we considered it better to use mass flux to clarify the trends in target compounds in influent b 2 rather than concentration mass flux was calculated based on the concentrations and hourly flow rates in the two surveys dmf fluctuated with hourly mass flux ranging from 32 2 to 495 g h in winter fig 2 a1 and 72 4 to 607 g h in summer fig 2a2 the observed tendency of a few peaks of mass flux implied regular discharges of dmf from specific sources e g industrial or commercial discharges similarly tanabe and kawata 2009 also reported that the concentration of dmf in the influent of one stp increased from 11 p m to 1 a m in the summer which might be due to discharge from industries using dmf there was no detection of ndma in either of the two surveys indicating no or low direct discharge of ndma from sewerage pipe lines related to line b 2 of stp b however ndma fp was detected with hourly mass flux ranging from 12 8 to 23 9 g h in winter fig 2b1 and 6 60 to 27 4 g h in summer fig 2b2 as shown in figs 2b1 and 2b2 the contribution of dmf to ndma fp was low both in winter median value of 5 2 and summer median value of 14 4 implying that there were many precursors in the raw sewage shen and andrews 2011 table s5 3 1 2 effect of biological treatment ndma fp has been shown to be readily removed by bioreactors in stps sgroi et al 2018 yoon et al 2011 but the biodegradation of dmf is less clear previous batch tests under aerobic anoxic and anaerobic conditions found the removal efficiencies of dmf to be 72 5 66 8 and 61 7 in 12 hours respectively wang and li 2015 it was also confirmed by the grab samples in this study that dmf could be greatly removed during the biological treatment in most cases table s4 to clarify the effectiveness of removal and fluctuations within an actual stp this study also investigated the fates of dmf and ndma fp before and after biological treatment using a recycled nitrification and step feed biological nitrogen removal process line 8 on the b 2 line by sampling every hour for 24 hours fig 3 the type of fluctuation continuous peak of dmf in the input to the bioreactor fig 3a1 was similar to that of influent b 2 figs 2a1 and 2b1 indicating that dmf was a daily discharged chemical without clear seasonal patterns dmf was detected in concentrations of 9 17 57 0 µg l fig 3a1 in the influent to the bioreactor but in concentrations of 0 69 3 43 µg l after biological treatment fig 3a2 these results clearly showed that the biodegradability of dmf was high and stable mean removal rate 95 which was different from results of a previous study no removal tanabe and kawata 2009 moreover ndma fp also showed notable biodegradation mean removal rate 88 figs 3b1 and b2 which was in accordance with removal rates of 85 found in previous measurements at 12 stps with different biological treatment types yoon et al 2011 the contribution of dmf to ndma fp ranged from 37 0 to 92 6 median value of 56 8 in the influent to the bioreactor and from 11 2 to 117 median value of 24 4 in the effluent from the bioreactor fig 3 however residual ndma precursors e g dmf or products from the biodegradation of dmf kong et al 2018 wang et al 2020 could have the possibility to form ndma during the subsequent disinfection process 3 1 3 effect of the disinfection process it is reported that dmf itself can also be formed as a by product during chloramination when relevant precursors are present e g unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine and that that could form ndma mitch and sedlak 2002 from samples taken every hour for 24 hours before disinfection point 2 6 fig s1 and after disinfection point 2 8 fig s1 it appears that there is possible dmf formation under conditions of low chlorine disinfection around 1 0 mg l figs 4 a1 and a2 in addition the fluctuations in dmf showed a similar trend before and after the disinfection tank implying that precursors of dmf remained after biological treatment in contrast ndma did not show notable formation in the disinfection process fig s2 which might be caused by low ammonia 0 3 mg l and nitrite 0 1 mg l on average through years table s6 although dmf was transformed to ndma due to the high chloramine dose used in the fp test as shown by dmf in secondary effluent at point 2 4 in line 8 in aug 29 2017 table s4 the low chlorine disinfection at the stp was not enough to produce ndma however chlorine might decompose dmf precursor s existing in secondary effluent and could form dmf thereby raising ndma fp fig 4b2 to confirm this hypothesis additional grab samplings were conducted at individual points points 2 5 2 6 and 2 7 fig s1 before three disinfection tanks and at a confluence of effluents from them point 2 9 two times in winter and three times in summer considering the retention time of disinfection average value of 0 5 hours from the observed values of dmf and ndma and the flow rates table s7 flow proportional mass loads were calculated and were compared with the observed values at point 2 9 fig s3 the change in dmf mass load was not clear it decreased in the disinfection tanks two times in winter and one time in summer but not at other times fig s3 implying that the balance of dmf formation in the disinfection and residue of dmf precursor s fluctuated that also might be a reason why the concentration of dmf was highly changeable in the final effluent table s4 on the other hand on dec 15 2017 the sum of the mass loads 2 5 2 7 of ndma fp was 29 2 ng l while the detected mass load of ndma fp was 37 0 ng l at point 2 9 data not shown thus although ndma fp could be greatly removed during the biological treatment as shown above fig 3b it increased slightly during the disinfection process figs 4b1 and b2 which might be caused by more ndma precursors e g dmf being produced from residual organic matter during the chlorination process after biological treatment therefore the contribution of dmf to ndma fp ranged from 5 4 to 35 4 median value of 11 4 before disinfection and it increased by 10 3 45 9 median value of 18 4 after disinfection fig 4 3 1 4 final effluent although dmf and ndma fp showed high biodegradability with large removal during the stp process some dmf and ndma fp remained in final effluent from stp b table s4 fig s4 posing a pollution risk to the receiving rivers in order to grasp the contribution of dmf to ndma fp in the chlorinated effluent from stp b we combined data from grab samplings n 16 n 8 each for b s1 and b s2 with data from a one time 24 hour survey conducted at b s2 mixed samples comprising four lots of hourly samples fig s4b to clarify the relationships between them fig 5 it was observed that the contribution of dmf to the total ndma fp was higher in final effluent than that in influent figs 2 and 5 however there were fluctuations in the contributions of dmf to ndma fp in the final effluents fig 5 which might be caused by fluctuations in ambient dmf after biological treatment and disinfection as discussed above the concentrations of ndma fp at b s1 and b s2 showed fluctuation without seasonal trend fig 5 which might be caused by fluctuation on concentrations of ndma fp in influents b 1 and b 2 and biological treatment types fig s1 however it was noticed that b s2 could have much higher ndma fp concentration in two times in winter as well as dmf because the ndma precursors might be changed due to the variety of physical chemical and or biological processes that cause natural attenuation of contaminants in aquatic environments fono et al 2006 woods and dickenson 2016 it was necessary to investigate the occurrence of dmf and ndma fp section 3 2 and the contribution of dmf to ndma fp section 3 3 in rivers that received final effluents from stps 3 2 occurrence and fate of dmf and ndma fp in surface waters comprehensive examinations of dmf and ndma fp were conducted with respect to concentrations and mass fluxes in final effluents from stps and in receiving rivers which could help to understand their occurrence fates and relationships in urban water systems as discussed in section 3 1 4 final effluent from stp b contained a certain level of dmf and ndma fp and was discharged into receiving rivers therefore dmf and ndma fp were also monitored in surface waters in the yodo river basin between may 2017 and february 2018 including five final effluents from four stps and four points on receiving rivers two tributaries and two main streams fig s5 details of measured concentrations are listed in table s8 and flow rates in table s9 all sampling campaigns were conducted during dry weather detection frequency of dmf at each monitoring point final effluents and rivers was 100 fig s5a even at the most downstream site y m which is close to the uptake point for a drinking water treatment plant showed occurrence of dmf with concentrations of 0 16 2 34 µg l fig s6a these agreed closely with measurements in another area of japan kojima bay where concentrations were from loq to 2 60 µg l yoshioka et al 2011 implying that dmf discharged from anthropogenic activities was a common pollutant in the aquatic environment dmf was found in five final effluents with median concentrations of 0 38 1 45 µg l fig s5a while dmf was detected at four points on receiving rivers with median concentrations of 0 28 1 33 µg l dmf concentrations at river water sampling points were governed for example a s and k 1t b s1 and k 2t or largely influenced for example b s2 and k m by concentrations detected in effluent from the closest upstream stp which indicated that there was insufficient capacity for dilution of the effluent at each point specifically for the two tributary sampling points k 1t and k 2t in the nishitakase river there was no notable additional inflow and flow consisted solely of final effluent from stp a and stp b indicating that k 1t contained about 100 treated wastewater from stp a a s while k 2t contained about 100 treated wastewater from a s and b s1 fig 1 therefore to examine the relationship between dmf concentration in effluents and that in receiving rivers and to confirm the fate of dmf during river transportation each sampling between a s and k 2t was collected taking the travel time of flow into consideration a strong positive correlation was observed between dmf occurrence at sites a s and k 1t r 2 0 95 f test p 0 01 fig s6a and a good positive correlation was also observed between calculated dmf concentration see 2 2 and the value observed at k 2t r 2 0 96 f test p 0 01 fig s6b it also implied that dmf could be recalcitrant during river flows of longer than 3 0 hours from a s to k 2t with very low or no photodegradation fig s7 and low biolysis t 1 2 95 hours for k 1t and k 2t table s10 because there was not much difference in concentration between that at a s and k 2t slope of 0 93 fig s6a or between the calculated and observed values at k 2t slope of 1 07 fig s6b as a comparison the role of photodegradation and biolysis on the fate of ndma between a s and k 1t in the nishitakase river was also evaluated in our previous papers zhao et al 2020a 2020b the median concentrations of ndma fp observed in the five effluents ranged from 54 2 to 82 6 ng l which were higher than that in the rivers median concentrations of 16 2 53 6 ng l fig s5b however different disinfection processes might have induced the differences in occurrence of ndma fp in final effluents notably the lowest detection frequency of ndma fp was found at a s detected two times out of seven sampling events which used ozone treatment although it has been found that ozone is effective for removal of chloramine related ndma precursors lee et al 2007 dmf remained at concentrations of 0 18 to 4 23 µg l after ozonation at a s and decreased during the formation potential test table s8 however dmf showed no relationship with ndma fp at a s figs s8a1 and s8a2 in addition dmf showed weak relationship with ndma fp in final effluents treated with chlorine b s1 b s2 c s and d s figs s8b1 and s8b2 it indicated that there were other chloramine related precursors except dmf including wide variety of anthropogenic chemicals with a range of concentrations and reactivities yields in stp effluents ambient ndma was much higher at a s than in other final effluents treated with chlorine table s8 zhao et al 2020a similarly lower ndma fp also was found at k 1t which has higher ambient ndma than that at other river points although a few ozone related precursors of ndma were identified in the influent and secondary effluent of stp a kosaka et al 2009 2014 more studies are needed in the future to further investigate the conditions in ozonated waters that influence the mechanisms of ndma formation from specific precursors during chloramination nevertheless it was confirmed that dmf plays more important role in ndma fp in final effluents treated with chlorine b s1 b s2 c s and d s fig 5 the linear correlation between ndma fp and toc was also examined to confirm whether there was a possibility of using toc to predict levels of ndma precursors fig s9 there were poor correlations r 2 0 10 between ndma fp and toc in effluents fig s9a and in rivers fig s9b these results implied that ndma precursors occurred at very low concentrations which did not represent toc quantified in this area at k m approximately 36 of the water consisted of treated wastewater from stp b fig 1 table s9 to clarify the fate of target compounds over longer distances mass fluxes of dmf and ndma fp from stp b were compared with those at the central main stream sampling site k m based on measurements in summer daytime sd summer night sn winter daytime wd and winter night wn the mass flux of each analyte was calculated at each site by multiplying the detected concentration by the mean river flow rate per day or the mean stp discharge in terms of m3 of effluent per day although the biological treatment showed effective removal of dmf fig 3 dmf was still discharged from stp b with a median value of 0 38 µg l at b s1 and 0 90 µg l at b s2 fig s5a as dmf was not photodegradable there was also no clear intraday pattern of mass flux at k m fig 6 a however the mass flux of dmf in final effluents from stp b and at k m was higher in winter than in summer indicating that water temperature might influence the biolysis of dmf in the biological treatment process of stp b and during river transportation ndma fp also was higher in winter than in summer in stp b discharges but not at k m which might be caused by other sources during river transportation based on the results of mass flux final effluents of stp were shown to be important sources of dmf and ndma fp for receiving rivers fig 6 moreover because of persistent precursors like dmf in rivers ndma fp showed low or no removal rate within rivers schreiber and mitch 2006 due to the low dilution factor 2 8 for treated wastewater from stp b it was confirmed that final effluents from stp b had a direct influence on mass fluxes of dmf at k m r 2 0 96 f test p 0 01 fig s10 and dmf was detected with 100 frequency at k m 3 3 contribution of dmf to ndma fp in main streams of rivers because dmf and ndma fp could be detected in main streams k m and y m with 100 frequency fig s5 it was necessary to investigate the contribution of dmf to ndma fp in main streams the contribution of dmf to ndma fp was 15 8 11 2 n 4 in summer and 82 1 10 2 n 4 in winter at k m fig 7 in addition good linear correlations were observed between ndma fp and ambient dmf r 2 0 79 f test p 0 01 fig s11a1 and between ndma fp and dmf r 2 0 81 f test p 0 01 fig s11a2 at k m this implies that dmf was an important precursor of ndma at k m at the most downstream site at y m no relationship was observed between ndma fp and ambient dmf fig s11b1 and between ndma fp and dmf fig s11b2 which also indicates that there were other sources supplying ndma precursors during the river transportation such as other tributaries such as the uji and kidzu rivers fig 1 or river sediments woods and dickenson 2016 at y m the contribution of dmf to total ndma fp was still as much as 11 4 7 1 n 4 in summer and 30 2 22 3 n 4 in winter therefore formation of ndma caused by dmf might lead to water quality problems of ndma pollution in downstream waters used as a source of drinking water 4 conclusions anthropogenic nitrogenous compounds like dmf were found to be important sources of ndma precursors during chloramination although dmf showed lower ndma molar yield than other precursors because of its high usage in human activities its frequent detection and high concentration means that dmf could make a notable contribution to the formation of ndma in the aquatic environment based on two 24 hour surveys dmf fluctuated with hourly mass flux ranging from 32 2 to 607 g h in influent of stp b while ndma fp was detected with hourly mass flux ranging from 6 60 to 27 4 g h dmf and ndma fp showed high biodegradability during the stp process however some dmf and ndma fp remained in effluents that were then discharged into the receiving rivers the frequencies of detection of dmf and ndma fp were high both in the chlorinated effluents from the stps studied and in the receiving rivers in yodo river basin the mass flux of dmf showed higher values in winter than in summer in discharges from stp b and at k m indicating that water temperature might influence the biolysis of dmf in the biological treatment process of stp b and during river transportation ndma fp also showed higher values in winter than in summer in discharges from stp b but not in main streams at sites k m and y m which might be caused by other sources during the river transportation dmf in main streams came mainly from stps strong positive relationships between ndma fp and ambient dmf and between ndma fp and dmf were confirmed in main stream k m the contribution of dmf calculated ndma fp from dmf to total ndma fp was 15 8 11 2 n 4 in summer and 82 1 10 2 n 4 in winter at one of the mainstream sampling sites k m while the contribution of dmf to total ndma fp was 11 4 7 1 n 4 in summer and 30 2 22 3 n 4 in winter at the most downstream site y m all results showed that dmf was an important ndma precursor in the yodo river basin moreover because of persistent precursors like dmf in rivers ndma fp showed low or no removal rate within the rivers pollution by ndma fp and its related specific precursors such as dmf should be monitored to protect drinking water sources at downstream sites declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments we acknowledge the long range research

17229,the contribution of specific precursors to n nitrosodimethylamine formation potential ndma fp upon chloramination depends not only on their ndma molar yields but also on their concentrations in the actual environment we investigated the seasonal and diurnal patterns of the ndma precursor n n dimethylformamide dmf and ndma fp in the yodo river basin japan by examining water samples taken from inside the basin s largest sewage treatment plant stp as well as samples from five final effluents from four stps two main stream sites and two tributary sites in the same basin dmf and ndma fp were found to be high in influent raw sewage and were found to be mostly removed during the stp treatment processes especially with biological treatment nevertheless dmf was found in concentrations of 0 06 to 31 7 µg l in chlorinated effluents and in receiving rivers while ndma fp was detected in concentrations of 3 57 to 306 ng l thus stps were shown to be an important source of dmf and ndma fp to rivers a strong positive correlation between ndma fp and dmf was confirmed in the receiving river k m indicating that dmf was an important ndma precursor in the yodo river basin the contribution of dmf to ndma fp was 15 8 11 2 n 4 in summer and 82 1 10 2 n 4 in winter in the main stream site k m of the river due to insufficient dilution of chlorinated effluents from the largest stp from the viewpoint of ndma and ndma fp control at downstream sites monitoring and control of dmf at upstream sites are important graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords n nitrosodimethylamine formation potential n n dimethylformamide precursor intermediate contribution 1 introduction n nitrosodimethylamine ndma is classified as a group 2a carcinogen who 1987 and it arises unintentionally from a large series of processes who 2002 including disinfection in sewage treatment plants stps especially chloramination chloramination is considered the dominant mechanism responsible for formation of ndma krasner et al 2013 and chloramine can be produced when secondary stp effluent containing ammonia is treated with chlorine furst et al 2018 moreover ndma formation potential ndma fp is also readily found in stp effluent and in surface waters upon chloramination uzun et al 2015 yoon et al 2011 zeng et al 2016 indicating that there are residual precursors responsible for the formation of ndma therefore although ndma is not commercially used ndma is frequently detected in the aquatic environment krasner et al 2013 sgroi et al 2018 zhao et al 2020a 2020b due to unintentional production from industry mitch et al 2003a sedlak and kavanaugh 2006 krasner et al 2009 ndma precursors in the environment are influenced by anthropogenic activities especially industry as well as by the types of disinfection process used in water and wastewater treatment previous studies identified dimethylamine dma as an important precursor for ndma formation during water and wastewater disinfection mitch and sedlak 2002 however based on the low molar yield dma alone cannot account for the entire mass of ndma formation mitch et al 2003b therefore efforts to evaluate other specific precursors and formation pathways are critical to develop suitable strategies to reduce formation of ndma during water and wastewater treatment padhye et al 2009 a few industry related ndma precursors have been found and are used in specific industries kosaka et al 2009 2014 their use can be prohibited if there are alternative substances or the wastewater from these industries can be treated separately before discharge lim et al 2016 however there are many basic substances that have dma functional groups and several of these including n n dimethylformamide dmf have been evaluated and recognized as possible precursors of ndma formation upon chloramination hinneh et al 2019 nakada et al 2016 selbes et al 2013 yoon and tanaka 2014 and some of these cannot be substituted with other substances because of its excellent miscibility with water and numerous organic substances dmf has been widely employed in a variety of industries as a versatile organic polar solvent ceri 2007 dmf itself has an adverse impact on water quality and human health because of its numerous toxic effects kumar et al 2012 swaroop et al 2009 yan et al 2002 moreover dmf used in the production of drugs was found to be responsible for ndma contamination of certain valsartan containing drugs due to its transformation to dma masada et al 2019 scherf clavel et al 2019 sörgel et al 2019 according to japan s pollutant release and transfer register prtr dmf is one of the nation s most commonly used chemicals with total releases and transfers of 9627 tonnes in 2017 and 9035 tonnes in 2018 pollutant release and transfer register prtr 2017 pollutant release and transfer register prtr 2018 pollutant release and transfer register prtr 2017 pollutant release and transfer register prtr 2018 of which 0 4 was discharged into the sewerage system in kyoto prefecture which was within the area covered in our study dmf was the 5th most used chemical with total releases and transfers of 187 tonnes in 2017 and 185 tonnes in 2018 pollutant release and transfer register prtr 2017 pollutant release and transfer register prtr 2018 pollutant release and transfer register prtr 2017 pollutant release and transfer register prtr 2018 in 2018 16 4 tonnes of dmf was discharged to the sewerage system pollutant release and transfer register prtr 2018 pollutant release and transfer register prtr 2018 which was a much higher amount than other possible ndma precursors such as dma with 0 01 tonnes therefore it is possible that dmf acts as a typical ndma precursor upon chloramination in urban water treatment systems when the removal of dmf is not enough during processing in stps most studies have focused on the biodegradation of dmf in batch tests kong et al 2018 sanjeevkumar et al 2013 swaroop et al 2009 wang and li 2015 wang et al 2020 but research is largely lacking as to the fate of dmf in the actual environment including during stp processes and in rivers although tanabe and kawata 2009 demonstrated the fluctuations of dmf in the influents and effluents of two stps twice and found low removal rates the behavior of dmf within the stps was still not clear in fact it has been found that dmf is a product of the hypochlorite oxidation and chloramination of hydrazine fuels brubaker et al 1989 mitch and sedlak 2002 implying that it is insufficient to monitor dmf only in the influent and effluent of stps due to possible formation of dmf during disinfection by chlorination although there are many advanced treatments e g reverse osmosis ro and uv h2o2 used in wastewater reclamation that can effectively remove the majority of ndma precursors it has been found that dmf could still contribute to ndma formation during chloramination after those advanced treatments krauss et al 2010 lee et al 2007 mccurry et al 2017 mitch and sedlak 2004 sgroi et al 2015 furthermore due to its thermal stability and low degradability dmf remains obstinate in the natural environment kumar et al 2012 and has been found in river water nd 0 67 µg l and sea water nd 1 0 µg l kadokami et al 1993 the contribution of a specific precursor to ndma fp depends not only on its ndma molar yield but also on its concentration in the actual environment after evaluation dmf might be found to be an important precursor of ndma as pointed out by other researchers mitch and sedlak 2004 several studies have reported ndma fp in urban drinking water systems however comprehensive studies detailing the relationship between dmf and ndma fp in the aquatic environment are lacking in the literature considering the strict regulations on ndma it is important to grasp the fate and concentration of dmf and ndma fp in stps and in receiving rivers especially those used as a source of drinking water downstream to the best of our knowledge this is the first research to address the fate of dmf as well as the role of dmf in ndma formation during chloramination in de facto wastewater reuse in an urban area 2 materials and

secondary treatment whereas stp b uses three different treatments a cas process an anaerobic oxic process and a recycled nitrification step feed biological nitrogen removal process in terms of disinfection three stps stp b stp c and stp d use chlorination while stp a uses ozonation stp b which this study focused on serves most of the population equivalent to over 0 78 million in kyoto city population of 1 46 million kyoto city waterworks bureau kcwb 2018 kyoto city waterworks bureau kcwb 2019 this plant plays an important role in water quality especially in the downstream sites of the yodo river and treats domestic and industrial wastewater with a treatment volume of over 53 9 104 m3 d the properties of the influent at stp b are reported in our previous study zhao et al 2019 stp b has two influent lines b 1 and b 2 and two final effluents from them which are discharged into the nishitakase river b s1 and the katsura river b s2 respectively fig 1 the influents are treated in 11 lines consisting of individual primary and secondary treatments and four disinfection processes fig s1 to investigate the fates of dmf and ndma fp samples were taken from influent raw sewage points 1

on occurrence and relationship of target compounds grab samplings were also carried out in stp b in the nishitakase river inflow between sites a s and k 1t consisted solely of treated water discharged from stp a while site k 2t contained about 100 treated wastewater from stps a a s and b b s1 there was no notable additional inflow the distance was 1 56 km between a s and k 1t while the distance was 1 06 km between k 1t and k 2t the river flow and depth were stable during dry weather hanamoto et al 2014 zhao et al 2020a 2020b to evaluate the natural attenuation of analytes especially between a s and k 2t travel time was considered in certain samplings to determine the sampling time especially at k 2t the theoretical concentration was calculated by multiplying the detected concentration at a s

infrastructure and transport japan surveys in the study area were conducted over a 1 year period from may 2017 to july 2018 during periods of no rainfall including seasonal summer june september and winter december february and diurnal day and night variations for determining the presence of ndma and dmf ambient levels samples were collected in 300 ml amber bottles and immediately dechlorinated by addition of sodium thiosulfate to determine ndma precursor levels samples were collected for the ndma fp test in 1000 ml amber bottles without addition of sodium thiosulfate and brought to the laboratory where phosphate buffer 10 mm was added to each bottle to adjust ph to 7 0 all samples were kept in an ice box during shipment then placed in the dark at 4 c until sample pre treatment 2 3

dmf and ndma analysis are described in supplementary information s1 detailed analytical parameters for ndma are summarized in our previous study zhao et al 2020a while the information for dmf is summarized in table s1 analytical accuracy test data for dmf and ndma using different types of water sample are summarized in table s2 2 4 ndma fp tests 2 4 1 ndma fp of environmental samples by chloramination the potential for ndma formation by chloramination ndma fp in environmental samples was defined as the increase in ndma concentration after 10 days the procedure for the test followed that of other studies mitch et al 2003b with a minor modification yoon et al 2011 a 20 mm stock solution of monochloramine nh2cl was prepared for chloramination unfiltered water samples 900 ml with ph adjusted to 7 0 were dosed with 100 ml of monochloramine stock solution final concentration of 2 0 mm or 142 mg l as cl2 in 1 l sealed amber bottles with teflon lined screw caps and the sample was stored for 10 days at 25 c shielded from light after 10 days incubation residual chloramine was quenched by adding excess sodium thiosulfate then the samples were processed for ndma and dmf analysis the difference in dmf concentration during the fp test was defined as dmf and was calculated by the following equation 1 δ d m f c d m f 10 d c d m f a m b i e n t where c dm f 10 d is the final concentration of dmf in the environmental sample after 10 days incubation µg l and c dm f ambient is the ambient concentration of dmf in the environmental sample µg l 2 4 2 ndma fp of dmf by chloramination and contribution of dmf to ndma fp in environmental samples the ndma fp from chloramination of dmf was also tested based on the procedure for environmental samples above with a minor modification dmf was added to the solutions dosed with the monochloramine stock solution to an initial dmf concentration of 1 37 µm equal to 100 µg l and initial chloramine concentration of 2 0 mm or 142 mg l as cl2 aliquots of 1 l ultrapure water without dmf only chloramine and without chloramine only dmf were also processed using the same procedure to serve as controls after 10 days incubation residual chloramine was quenched by adding excess sodium thiosulfate then the samples were processed for ndma and dmf analysis the ndma fp of dmf was evaluated from percent molar yield by the following equation 2 m o l a r y i e l d c n d m a c d m f 100 where cndma is the final molar concentration of ndma after 10 days incubation and cdmf is the initial designed molar concentration of dmf moreover the contribution of dmf to ndma fp ng l in environmental samples was calculated by the concentration of dmf in samples multiplied by its molar yield 10 days 2 5 biodegradation and photodegradation tests biodegradation tests were conducted in accordance with the u s environmental protection agency s test guideline 835 3170 epa 1998a to estimate the attenuation of dmf by bioactivity in addition to estimate the attenuation of dmf by sunlight irradiation during river transport direct photolysis tests were conducted in accordance with the u s environmental protection agency s test guideline 835 2210 epa 1998b to evaluate the natural attenuation of dmf by weak solar irradiation on winter middays december 2018 the methods of these two experiments are described in supplementary information s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 contribution of dmf to ndma fp within stps because dmf had been identified in previous studies to be a precursor of ndma hinneh et al 2019 mitch and sedlak 2004 nakada et al 2016 the contribution of dmf to total ndma fp detected at individual sampling points within stp b was calculated based on the ndma molar yield from dmf 0 90 on average n 3 table s3 and the dmf concentration detected 3 1 1 influent raw sewage dmf is a popular solvent for chemical reactions and is used in the manufacture of many industrial products e g acrylic fiber plastics and surface coatings bipp and kieczka 2000 the concentrations of dmf and ndma fp in influents fluctuated n 4 table s4 to confirm the relationship between ndma fp and dmf in the influent influent b 2 was sampled every hour for 24 hours in winter december 14 15 2017 and summer july 11 12 2018 because the flow rate of influent b 2 sampling point 2 1 fluctuated much more than the flow rates at other sampling points along the treatment line e g 2 2 fig s1 we considered it better to use mass flux to clarify the trends in target compounds in influent b 2 rather than concentration mass flux was calculated based on the concentrations and hourly flow rates in the two surveys dmf fluctuated with hourly mass flux ranging from 32 2 to 495 g h in winter fig 2 a1 and 72 4 to 607 g h in summer fig 2a2 the observed tendency of a few peaks of mass flux implied regular discharges of dmf from specific sources e g industrial or commercial discharges similarly tanabe and kawata 2009 also reported that the concentration of dmf in the influent of one stp increased from 11 p m to 1 a m in the summer which might be due to discharge from industries using dmf there was no detection of ndma in either of the two surveys indicating no or low direct discharge of ndma from sewerage pipe lines related to line b 2 of stp b however ndma fp was detected with hourly mass flux ranging from 12 8 to 23 9 g h in winter fig 2b1 and 6 60 to 27 4 g h in summer fig 2b2 as shown in figs 2b1 and 2b2 the contribution of dmf to ndma fp was low both in winter median value of 5 2 and summer median value of 14 4 implying that there were many precursors in the raw sewage shen and andrews 2011 table s5 3 1 2 effect of biological treatment ndma fp has been shown to be readily removed by bioreactors in stps sgroi et al 2018 yoon et al 2011 but the biodegradation of dmf is less clear previous batch tests under aerobic anoxic and anaerobic conditions found the removal efficiencies of dmf to be 72 5 66 8 and 61 7 in 12 hours respectively wang and li 2015 it was also confirmed by the grab samples in this study that dmf could be greatly removed during the biological treatment in most cases table s4 to clarify the effectiveness of removal and fluctuations within an actual stp this study also investigated the fates of dmf and ndma fp before and after biological treatment using a recycled nitrification and step feed biological nitrogen removal process line 8 on the b 2 line by sampling every hour for 24 hours fig 3 the type of fluctuation continuous peak of dmf in the input to the bioreactor fig 3a1 was similar to that of influent b 2 figs 2a1 and 2b1 indicating that dmf was a daily discharged chemical without clear seasonal patterns dmf was detected in concentrations of 9 17 57 0 µg l fig 3a1 in the influent to the bioreactor but in concentrations of 0 69 3 43 µg l after biological treatment fig 3a2 these results clearly showed that the biodegradability of dmf was high and stable mean removal rate 95 which was different from results of a previous study no removal tanabe and kawata 2009 moreover ndma fp also showed notable biodegradation mean removal rate 88 figs 3b1 and b2 which was in accordance with removal rates of 85 found in previous measurements at 12 stps with different biological treatment types yoon et al 2011 the contribution of dmf to ndma fp ranged from 37 0 to 92 6 median value of 56 8 in the influent to the bioreactor and from 11 2 to 117 median value of 24 4 in the effluent from the bioreactor fig 3 however residual ndma precursors e g dmf or products from the biodegradation of dmf kong et al 2018 wang et al 2020 could have the possibility to form ndma during the subsequent disinfection process 3 1 3 effect of the disinfection process it is reported that dmf itself can also be formed as a by product during chloramination when relevant precursors are present e g unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine and that that could form ndma mitch and sedlak 2002 from samples taken every hour for 24 hours before disinfection point 2 6 fig s1 and after disinfection point 2 8 fig s1 it appears that there is possible dmf formation under conditions of low chlorine disinfection around 1 0 mg l figs 4 a1 and a2 in addition the fluctuations in dmf showed a similar trend before and after the disinfection tank implying that precursors of dmf remained after biological treatment in contrast ndma did not show notable formation in the disinfection process fig s2 which might be caused by low ammonia 0 3 mg l and nitrite 0 1 mg l on average through years table s6 although dmf was transformed to ndma due to the high chloramine dose used in the fp test as shown by dmf in secondary effluent at point 2 4 in line 8 in aug 29 2017 table s4 the low chlorine disinfection at the stp was not enough to produce ndma however chlorine might decompose dmf precursor s existing in secondary effluent and could form dmf thereby raising ndma fp fig 4b2 to confirm this hypothesis additional grab samplings were conducted at individual points points 2 5 2 6 and 2 7 fig s1 before three disinfection tanks and at a confluence of effluents from them point 2 9 two times in winter and three times in summer considering the retention time of disinfection average value of 0 5 hours from the observed values of dmf and ndma and the flow rates table s7 flow proportional mass loads were calculated and were compared with the observed values at point 2 9 fig s3 the change in dmf mass load was not clear it decreased in the disinfection tanks two times in winter and one time in summer but not at other times fig s3 implying that the balance of dmf formation in the disinfection and residue of dmf precursor s fluctuated that also might be a reason why the concentration of dmf was highly changeable in the final effluent table s4 on the other hand on dec 15 2017 the sum of the mass loads 2 5 2 7 of ndma fp was 29 2 ng l while the detected mass load of ndma fp was 37 0 ng l at point 2 9 data not shown thus although ndma fp could be greatly removed during the biological treatment as shown above fig 3b it increased slightly during the disinfection process figs 4b1 and b2 which might be caused by more ndma precursors e g dmf being produced from residual organic matter during the chlorination process after biological treatment therefore the contribution of dmf to ndma fp ranged from 5 4 to 35 4 median value of 11 4 before disinfection and it increased by 10 3 45 9 median value of 18 4 after disinfection fig 4 3 1 4 final effluent although dmf and ndma fp showed high biodegradability with large removal during the stp process some dmf and ndma fp remained in final effluent from stp b table s4 fig s4 posing a pollution risk to the receiving rivers in order to grasp the contribution of dmf to ndma fp in the chlorinated effluent from stp b we combined data from grab samplings n 16 n 8 each for b s1 and b s2 with data from a one time 24 hour survey conducted at b s2 mixed samples comprising four lots of hourly samples fig s4b to clarify the relationships between them fig 5 it was observed that the contribution of dmf to the total ndma fp was higher in final effluent than that in influent figs 2 and 5 however there were fluctuations in the contributions of dmf to ndma fp in the final effluents fig 5 which might be caused by fluctuations in ambient dmf after biological treatment and disinfection as discussed above the concentrations of ndma fp at b s1 and b s2 showed fluctuation without seasonal trend fig 5 which might be caused by fluctuation on concentrations of ndma fp in influents b 1 and b 2 and biological treatment types fig s1 however it was noticed that b s2 could have much higher ndma fp concentration in two times in winter as well as dmf because the ndma precursors might be changed due to the variety of physical chemical and or biological processes that cause natural attenuation of contaminants in aquatic environments fono et al 2006 woods and dickenson 2016 it was necessary to investigate the occurrence of dmf and ndma fp section 3 2 and the contribution of dmf to ndma fp section 3 3 in rivers that received final effluents from stps 3 2 occurrence and fate of dmf and ndma fp in surface waters comprehensive examinations of dmf and ndma fp were conducted with respect to concentrations and mass fluxes in final effluents from stps and in receiving rivers which could help to understand their occurrence fates and relationships in urban water systems as discussed in section 3 1 4 final effluent from stp b contained a certain level of dmf and ndma fp and was discharged into receiving rivers therefore dmf and ndma fp were also monitored in surface waters in the yodo river basin between may 2017 and february 2018 including five final effluents from four stps and four points on receiving rivers two tributaries and two main streams fig s5 details of measured concentrations are listed in table s8 and flow rates in table s9 all sampling campaigns were conducted during dry weather detection frequency of dmf at each monitoring point final effluents and rivers was 100 fig s5a even at the most downstream site y m which is close to the uptake point for a drinking water treatment plant showed occurrence of dmf with concentrations of 0 16 2 34 µg l fig s6a these agreed closely with measurements in another area of japan kojima bay where concentrations were from loq to 2 60 µg l yoshioka et al 2011 implying that dmf discharged from anthropogenic activities was a common pollutant in the aquatic environment dmf was found in five final effluents with median concentrations of 0 38 1 45 µg l fig s5a while dmf was detected at four points on receiving rivers with median concentrations of 0 28 1 33 µg l dmf concentrations at river water sampling points were governed for example a s and k 1t b s1 and k 2t or largely influenced for example b s2 and k m by concentrations detected in effluent from the closest upstream stp which indicated that there was insufficient capacity for dilution of the effluent at each point specifically for the two tributary sampling points k 1t and k 2t in the nishitakase river there was no notable additional inflow and flow consisted solely of final effluent from stp a and stp b indicating that k 1t contained about 100 treated wastewater from stp a a s while k 2t contained about 100 treated wastewater from a s and b s1 fig 1 therefore to examine the relationship between dmf concentration in effluents and that in receiving rivers and to confirm the fate of dmf during river transportation each sampling between a s and k 2t was collected taking the travel time of flow into consideration a strong positive correlation was observed between dmf occurrence at sites a s and k 1t r 2 0 95 f test p 0 01 fig s6a and a good positive correlation was also observed between calculated dmf concentration see 2 2 and the value observed at k 2t r 2 0 96 f test p 0 01 fig s6b it also implied that dmf could be recalcitrant during river flows of longer than 3 0 hours from a s to k 2t with very low or no photodegradation fig s7 and low biolysis t 1 2 95 hours for k 1t and k 2t table s10 because there was not much difference in concentration between that at a s and k 2t slope of 0 93 fig s6a or between the calculated and observed values at k 2t slope of 1 07 fig s6b as a comparison the role of photodegradation and biolysis on the fate of ndma between a s and k 1t in the nishitakase river was also evaluated in our previous papers zhao et al 2020a 2020b the median concentrations of ndma fp observed in the five effluents ranged from 54 2 to 82 6 ng l which were higher than that in the rivers median concentrations of 16 2 53 6 ng l fig s5b however different disinfection processes might have induced the differences in occurrence of ndma fp in final effluents notably the lowest detection frequency of ndma fp was found at a s detected two times out of seven sampling events which used ozone treatment although it has been found that ozone is effective for removal of chloramine related ndma precursors lee et al 2007 dmf remained at concentrations of 0 18 to 4 23 µg l after ozonation at a s and decreased during the formation potential test table s8 however dmf showed no relationship with ndma fp at a s figs s8a1 and s8a2 in addition dmf showed weak relationship with ndma fp in final effluents treated with chlorine b s1 b s2 c s and d s figs s8b1 and s8b2 it indicated that there were other chloramine related precursors except dmf including wide variety of anthropogenic chemicals with a range of concentrations and reactivities yields in stp effluents ambient ndma was much higher at a s than in other final effluents treated with chlorine table s8 zhao et al 2020a similarly lower ndma fp also was found at k 1t which has higher ambient ndma than that at other river points although a few ozone related precursors of ndma were identified in the influent and secondary effluent of stp a kosaka et al 2009 2014 more studies are needed in the future to further investigate the conditions in ozonated waters that influence the mechanisms of ndma formation from specific precursors during chloramination nevertheless it was confirmed that dmf plays more important role in ndma fp in final effluents treated with chlorine b s1 b s2 c s and d s fig 5 the linear correlation between ndma fp and toc was also examined to confirm whether there was a possibility of using toc to predict levels of ndma precursors fig s9 there were poor correlations r 2 0 10 between ndma fp and toc in effluents fig s9a and in rivers fig s9b these results implied that ndma precursors occurred at very low concentrations which did not represent toc quantified in this area at k m approximately 36 of the water consisted of treated wastewater from stp b fig 1 table s9 to clarify the fate of target compounds over longer distances mass fluxes of dmf and ndma fp from stp b were compared with those at the central main stream sampling site k m based on measurements in summer daytime sd summer night sn winter daytime wd and winter night wn the mass flux of each analyte was calculated at each site by multiplying the detected concentration by the mean river flow rate per day or the mean stp discharge in terms of m3 of effluent per day although the biological treatment showed effective removal of dmf fig 3 dmf was still discharged from stp b with a median value of 0 38 µg l at b s1 and 0 90 µg l at b s2 fig s5a as dmf was not photodegradable there was also no clear intraday pattern of mass flux at k m fig 6 a however the mass flux of dmf in final effluents from stp b and at k m was higher in winter than in summer indicating that water temperature might influence the biolysis of dmf in the biological treatment process of stp b and during river transportation ndma fp also was higher in winter than in summer in stp b discharges but not at k m which might be caused by other sources during river transportation based on the results of mass flux final effluents of stp were shown to be important sources of dmf and ndma fp for receiving rivers fig 6 moreover because of persistent precursors like dmf in rivers ndma fp showed low or no removal rate within rivers schreiber and mitch 2006 due to the low dilution factor 2 8 for treated wastewater from stp b it was confirmed that final effluents from stp b had a direct influence on mass fluxes of dmf at k m r 2 0 96 f test p 0 01 fig s10 and dmf was detected with 100 frequency at k m 3 3 contribution of dmf to ndma fp in main streams of rivers because dmf and ndma fp could be detected in main streams k m and y m with 100 frequency fig s5 it was necessary to investigate the contribution of dmf to ndma fp in main streams the contribution of dmf to ndma fp was 15 8 11 2 n 4 in summer and 82 1 10 2 n 4 in winter at k m fig 7 in addition good linear correlations were observed between ndma fp and ambient dmf r 2 0 79 f test p 0 01 fig s11a1 and between ndma fp and dmf r 2 0 81 f test p 0 01 fig s11a2 at k m this implies that dmf was an important precursor of ndma at k m at the most downstream site at y m no relationship was observed between ndma fp and ambient dmf fig s11b1 and between ndma fp and dmf fig s11b2 which also indicates that there were other sources supplying ndma precursors during the river transportation such as other tributaries such as the uji and kidzu rivers fig 1 or river sediments woods and dickenson 2016 at y m the contribution of dmf to total ndma fp was still as much as 11 4 7 1 n 4 in summer and 30 2 22 3 n 4 in winter therefore formation of ndma caused by dmf might lead to water quality problems of ndma pollution in downstream waters used as a source of drinking water 4 conclusions anthropogenic nitrogenous compounds like dmf were found to be important sources of ndma precursors during chloramination although dmf showed lower ndma molar yield than other precursors because of its high usage in human activities its frequent detection and high concentration means that dmf could make a notable contribution to the formation of ndma in the aquatic environment based on two 24 hour surveys dmf fluctuated with hourly mass flux ranging from 32 2 to 607 g h in influent of stp b while ndma fp was detected with hourly mass flux ranging from 6 60 to 27 4 g h dmf and ndma fp showed high biodegradability during the stp process however some dmf and ndma fp remained in effluents that were then discharged into the receiving rivers the frequencies of detection of dmf and ndma fp were high both in the chlorinated effluents from the stps studied and in the receiving rivers in yodo river basin the mass flux of dmf showed higher values in winter than in summer in discharges from stp b and at k m indicating that water temperature might influence the biolysis of dmf in the biological treatment process of stp b and during river transportation ndma fp also showed higher values in winter than in summer in discharges from stp b but not in main streams at sites k m and y m which might be caused by other sources during the river transportation dmf in main streams came mainly from stps strong positive relationships between ndma fp and ambient dmf and between ndma fp and dmf were confirmed in main stream k m the contribution of dmf calculated ndma fp from dmf to total ndma fp was 15 8 11 2 n 4 in summer and 82 1 10 2 n 4 in winter at one of the mainstream sampling sites k m while the contribution of dmf to total ndma fp was 11 4 7 1 n 4 in summer and 30 2 22 3 n 4 in winter at the most downstream site y m all results showed that dmf was an important ndma precursor in the yodo river basin moreover because of persistent precursors like dmf in rivers ndma fp showed low or no removal rate within the rivers pollution by ndma fp and its related specific precursors such as dmf should be monitored to protect drinking water sources at downstream sites declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments we acknowledge the long range research
