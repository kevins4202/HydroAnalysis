25265,non consumptive effects of predators within ecosystems can alter the behavior of individual prey species and have cascading effects on other trophic levels in this context an understanding of non consumptive predator effects on the whole prey community is crucial for predicting community structure and composition hence biodiversity patterns we used an individual based spatially explicit modelling approach to investigate the consequences of landscapes of fear on prey community metrics the model spans multiple hierarchical levels from individual home range formation based on food availability and perceived predation risk to consequences on prey community structure and composition this mechanistic approach allowed us to explore how important factors such as refuge availability and foraging strategy under fear affect prey community metrics fear of predators affected prey space use such as home range formation these adaptations had broader consequences for the community leading to changes in community structure and composition the strength of community responses to perceived predation risk was driven by refuge availability in the landscape and the foraging strategy of prey animals low refuge availability in the landscape strongly decreased diversity and total biomass of prey communities additionally body mass distributions in prey communities facing high predation risk were shifted towards small prey animals with increasing refuge availability the consequences of non consumptive predator effects were reduced diversity and total biomass of the prey community increased prey foraging strategies affected community composition under medium refuge availability risk averse prey communities consisted of many small animals while risk taking prey communities showed a more even body mass distribution our findings reveal that non consumptive predator effects can have important implications for prey community diversity and should therefore be considered in the context of conservation and nature management keywords predator prey interactions individual based model landscape of fear home range biodiversity foraging 1 introduction predators affect prey populations in two different ways directly by consuming and indirectly by evoking fear brown et al 1999 lima 1998 while it is clear that consumption has negative consequences for prey populations the impact of fear is not that obvious prey individuals sensing the presence of a predator may respond with morphological changes for example the development of spines against being eaten in daphnia pulex krueger and dodson 1981 or behavioral adjustments such as increased vigilance behavior hunter and skinner 1998 alterations in group size creel and winnie 2005 or diurnal vertical migration stich and lampert 1981 in order to minimize predation risk additionally fear effects can have profound consequences on ecosystem functioning due to cascading impacts on other species ripple and beschta 2004 schmitz et al 2004 werner and peacor 2003 due to the frequently reported losses of apex predators in many ecosystems estes et al 2011 an understanding of indirect effects of predators on prey is of high importance to better understand and predict consequences for biodiversity and ecosystems common behavioral adjustments of animals perceiving predation risk are modifications in space use during foraging in order to understand these modifications the landscape of fear concept has been developed consisting of visual maps that quantify the spatial distribution of predation risk laundré et al 2010 2001 predation risk perception can be measured by using established methods such as giving up densities brown 1988 or vigilance patterns altendorf et al 2001 in combination with information about food availability and locomotion costs landscapes of fear can help to decipher and predict animal movement decision gallagher et al 2017 furthermore landscapes of fear can be integrated in basic ecological concepts such as the link between bottom up and top down control laundré et al 2014 adaptations in prey behavior due to perceived predation risk can have cascading effects on other species these effects have been summarized under the term behavior mediated indirect interactions dill et al 2003 werner and peacor 2003 behavior mediated indirect interactions occur in manifold ecological communities with quantitatively significant effects on community dynamics often exceeding the impact of density mediated effects reviewed in werner and peacor 2003 experimental analysis of behavior mediated effects is often challenging due to difficulties of disentangling direct and indirect effects nevertheless by using playbacks from a predator the domestic dog suraci et al 2016 could show that increases in fear reduce raccoon foraging on marine biota leading to cascading effects across multiple trophic levels in the intertidal food web thereby fear of predators can act as an important ecosystem service that can structure communities and ecosystems ripple and beschta 2004 to date most studies on behavior mediated effects of predators on their prey either focused on specific behavioral adaptations on the level of single individuals e g lima and dill 1990 kotler et al 1991 jacob and brown 2000 or on consequences for other trophic levels e g beckerman et al 1997 dill et al 2003 however consequences of fear at the prey community level are largely unknown despite their potential implications for conservation and management non consumptive effects have been shown to have strong negative impacts on reproduction of the prey zanette et al 2011 e g via maternal effects boonstra et al 1998 sheriff et al 2010 furthermore non consumptive effects can exist in prey communities even if direct predation is low or not present creel and christianson 2008 an understanding of community responses to predation risk and the underlying mechanisms behind them is therefore important to predict how changing predator abundance affects prey community structures in this study we assessed the consequences of non consumptive predator effects on prey community structure and composition given the challenge to scale up from the behavior of individuals to the whole community structure we applied an individual based mechanistic model of home range formation in a mammalian prey community where individual space use is based on the trade off between food availability and predation risk it extends a modelling approach by buchmann et al 2011 which has been successfully applied to explain community responses to habitat loss and fragmentation buchmann et al 2013 the importance of individual foraging movement for community structure buchmann et al 2012 and to generate realistic landscape patterns of biodiversity in the context of matrix suitability prevedello et al 2016 the incorporation of fear in the model advances our understanding of the impact of predator prey interactions on home range formation and the consequences for community structure and composition a key concept in our model is the premise that behavioral strategies of animals under predation risk can be expected to have consequences on prey community structure animals adjust the time they spend in local foraging patches and the amount of food they exploit from them in response to perceived predation risk animals can adopt different foraging strategies in order to minimize predation risk animals that use a risk averse strategy reduce foraging in risky patches to decrease the probability of encountering a predator to compensate for the reduced food intake in risky patches animals increase foraging activities in safe patches this adaptation in foraging activities represents a commonly observed pattern in many animals such as fish rozas and odum 1988 werner et al 1983 and small mammals jacob and brown 2000 simonetti 1989 for example under the presence of owls several gerbil species increase their food intake in bush microhabitats in contrast to open habitats since they offer shelter from avian predators kotler et al 1991 in contrast to the risk averse foraging strategy animals with a risk taking foraging strategy utilize food resources both in risky and safe patches risk taking animals reduce the probability of predation in dangerous patches by using shorter foraging bouts these animals frequently use refuges or return to their den in order to escape from a predator an example for this strategy are birds that directly fly to cover when detecting a predator schneider 1984 by implementing contrasting foraging strategies of prey animals risk averse and risk taking in the model we assessed a possible spectrum of consequences of different strategies on the prey community in concert with landscape of fear effects additionally to the foraging strategy of prey animals under predation risk refuge availability in the landscape plays an important role if available prey animals frequently use refuges in order to reduce predation risk lima and dill 1990 in aquatic systems refuges are known to alter the impact of predation risk and can affect prey population dynamics and coexistence orrock et al 2013 by varying the amount of refuges in the landscape we assessed how prey community structures are affected by refuge availability based on these premises we specifically aim to assess the following hypotheses 1 perceived predation risk in the landscape impacting individual space use in prey species can shape prey community structures 2 the interplay between the availability of high quality refuges and foraging strategies of prey animals is a driving mechanism of prey community responses to predation risk 2 methods 2 1 model overview the model simulates home range formation in a mammalian prey community based on food availability and perceived predation risk it aims to gain a mechanistic understanding about space use behavior under fear and its consequences for community structure and composition as our model focuses on the indirect effects of predation on space use it does not include the direct effects of predator induced mortality on individuals or communities over time the model predicts how individual changes in behavior can affect the structure and composition of prey communities in turn allowing us to predict how non consumptive predator effects can alter prey community metrics it extends a successfully validated modelling approach developed by buchmann et al 2011 by integrating landscapes of fear and different foraging strategies of animals under predation risk a detailed model description following the odd overview design concepts details protocol grimm et al 2010 2006 is provided in the supplementary material appendix a here we only give an overview of the general model structure and processes the individual based and spatially explicit model includes two entities 1 landscape cells which are described by their location the amount of food resources they contain and the predation risk that animals perceive in this cell and 2 prey individuals which are characterized by their body mass and their foraging strategy under predation risk table 1 the body mass is used to calculate physiological traits such as energy requirements per day and movement costs of prey individuals via allometric relationships in this study we focus on small herbivorous mammals with a body mass ranging from 10 g to 1000 g predators are not modelled explicitly but are represented by the predation risk in the landscape cells i e the landscape of fear we assume generalist predators such as eagles buzzards foxes or lynxes 2 2 landscape design the landscape is characterized by the distribution of food resources and predation risk the whole landscape comprises 100 100 cells with each cell representing 4 m² landscape cells can be either productive i e they contain food that can be consumed by animals or they are non productive and do not contain food resources we assume that 30 of the landscape cells contain food productive food cells are distributed randomly in the landscape each productive cell initially contains food resources reflecting the average daily productivity in grass and shrublands 0 685 g m² day whittaker 1975 from these food resources we assume that 80 of the food resources are lost to other taxonomic groups or not suitable for animal consumption so that only 20 of the average daily productivity can be used by prey animals see buchmann et al 2011 for further discussion on this value food resources are exploited by animals during the simulation and do not refill besides food resources cells either have a high perceived predation risk p safety 0 1 or a low perceived predation risk p safety 0 9 all non productive cells have a high perceived predation risk because we assume that a lack of vegetation corresponds with high perceived predation risk this corresponds to landscapes in which animals have to cope with areas of hostile matrix in their home ranges which is typical for human dominated landscapes such as clear cuts in forests productive cells can have a high or a low perceived risk of predation in the following we use the term risky habitat for productive cells with a high perceived predation risk and refuge for productive cells with a low perceived predation risk the proportion of refuges is a systematically tested model parameter the distribution of perceived predation risk in the landscape represents the landscape of fear for the prey animals we assume that the landscape of fear is static i e the predation risk in the cells does not change during the simulation 2 3 foraging strategies in the model we implemented two highly contrasting foraging strategies in separate model runs to explore a possible spectrum of consequences of different strategies on the prey community we assume that individuals of both foraging strategies are central place foragers frequently returning to a central place their den the den is an absolute refuge where individuals do not face predation risk foraging strategies were tested separately i e all individuals in a community had the same strategy moreover we compared the two contrasting foraging strategies to a control foraging strategy in which animals do not respond to predation risk in the landscape i e their food intake only depends on food availability and physiological constraints the rationale of these two strategies is described in the following their implementation is described below in the process home range formation the foraging strategy of risk averse individuals focuses on adaptations in food intake between patches with different predation risk risk averse animals show a reduced food intake in risky habitat to minimize the time they are exposed to this high risk to compensate the lower food intake under high risk they forage more intensively in refuges and show an increased food intake in these patches compared to control individuals these animals are facing indirect costs of their antipredatory behavior via the costs of missed opportunities risk taking individuals deal with predation risk by adapting their activity patterns in risky habitat risk taking animals show short foraging bouts with frequent returns to the den and hiding in refuges in order to minimize encounters with a predator this behavior increases the energy costs of risk taking animals in risky habitat to cover the increased movement costs they need to exploit more food resources to fulfill their daily energy requirements in refuges risk taking individuals have the same activity patterns as animals of the control the two foraging strategies represent simplified behavioral strategies of animals foraging under predation risk the risk averse foraging strategy allows to explore the consequences of adaptations in food intake under perceived predation risk on prey communities while the risk taking strategy focuses on consequences of increased movement costs due to perceived predation risk by using these extreme and contrasting examples we intend to gain a first overview of the spectrum of consequences that different foraging strategies have on prey community structures 2 4 process scheduling each simulation starts with the generation of a new landscape with a specific distribution of food and perceived predation risk after the generation of the landscape in each step of the model one additional new prey individual characterized by its body mass and foraging strategy searches for a home range in the landscape the home range has to contain enough food resources to fulfill the animal s energy requirements if the individual finds a suitable home range it exploits the food resources within the home range otherwise the individual is excluded from the community we assume that the individual disperses to another area outside the simulated landscape or dies existing individuals in the landscape are not affected by newly added individuals the simulation continues until the community is saturated i e 100 individuals parameter nfail see supplementary material appendix a table a 2 have consecutively not been able to establish a home range in the landscape because they could not reach their energy requirements in the following we briefly describe the processes within the model see fig 1 for an overview of processes in the model 2 4 1 trait assignment in each model step a new prey individual characterized by its body mass and foraging strategy is created the body mass of the new individual is drawn from a body mass input distribution a truncated power law distribution with an exponent of 1 5 see supplementary material appendix a table a 2 this specific exponent was chosen since it yields realistic community structures buchmann et al 2011 2012 on the basis of the body mass further traits of the animal are calculated by using allometric relationships namely the feeding rate locomotion costs maximum home range size and the share of food resources that is available to an animal per grid cell see supplementary material appendix a table a 3 in addition to body mass individuals are attributed a foraging strategy either risk averse risk taking or control 2 4 2 home range search and food consumption the key process of the model is the home range search of the newly created prey individual the home range needs to contain enough food resources to cover the individual s daily feeding rate and movement costs for foraging within the home range individuals are central place foragers frequently returning to a central place their den within their home range this is implicitly represented in the model by calculating the movement costs for the distance to a cell and the return the home range search starts with the choice of a core cell the central place of the home range where the den of the individual is located this cell is chosen randomly from the pool of productive cells the addition of a cell to the home range consists of two steps the choice of which cell is added and the calculation of the food gain from the cell the cell that is added next to the home range is chosen from the neighboring cells of the cell that was added last to the home range we assume that the animal has a perceptual range of one cell i e it can sense the food availability and the predation risk in the eight neighboring cells for the decision which of these cells is added to the home range the suitability of a cell is calculated by the product of food availability and predation risk 1 suitability p food p safety the cell with the highest suitability is added to the home range for the control only the food availability is taken into account suitability p food if several cells have the same suitability the cell with the minimum distance to the core is chosen after the decision for a cell the food gain from this cell is calculated the food gain is the difference between the exploited food and the movement costs 2 food gain exploited food movement costs for the control and the risk taking individuals the amount of exploited food is the arithmetic product of food availability in the cell p food and the allometric magnitude of food exploitation i foodshare 3 exploited food p food i foodshare for risk averse individuals predation risk p safety additionally affects food intake 4 exploited food p food i foodshare 2 p safety the factor 2 was chosen so that the food intake at a medium predation risk p safety 0 5 equals the food intake of the control in safe cells p safety 0 5 risk averse animals have a higher food intake than risk taking and control animals whereas their food intake is reduced in dangerous cells p safety 0 5 the factor i foodshare leads to different feeding efficiencies in mammals depending on their body size for control and risk averse individuals movement costs are the product of the allometric costs i lococost and twice the distance to the core cell distancecore as the individual has to move to the foraging cell and back to the central place 5 movement costs 2 i lococost distancecore risk taking individuals have the same movement costs when predation risk is low i e p safety 0 5 however high predation risk p safety 0 5 causes additional movement costs for risk taking individuals 6 movement costs 2 i lococost distancecore p food i foodshare 1 2 p safety movement costs in risk taking individuals thus increase depending on the amount of food in the cell we assume that the higher the food intake the more often the individual interrupts foraging to return to the den furthermore movement costs in this case can also include costs of other adapted behavior not related to movement such as increased vigilance exemplary calculations for the different foraging types during home range search are shown in supplementary material appendix a table a 4 if after adding a cell the food gain from the home range meets the daily energy requirements of the animal and the movement costs the home range search was considered successful and the individual establishes its home range in these cells if the amount of cells exceeds the maximum home range size before the energy requirements are achieved the individual fails to find a home range and is excluded from the community i e we assume that it disperses to another area outside the simulated landscape or dies if the home range search was successful food resources p food of cells within the home range are reduced by the amount of exploited food calculated during the home range search due to fractal characteristics of food resources animals only exploit a share of the available food resources in a grid cell and do not deplete food resources completely therefore the individuals entering subsequently are able to include cells that already have been exploited leading to overlapping home ranges a visual representation of exemplary home ranges for animals with different foraging strategies is shown in fig 2 2 4 3 community saturation as the simulation progresses an increasing number of individuals establish home ranges and deplete food resources within the landscape this reduction in available food means that new individuals are less likely to establish home ranges thus the community becomes saturated simulations were stopped if 100 individuals have consecutively not been able to find a home range the sequential failure of individuals indicates that most accessible food resources in the landscape have been exploited and a further establishment of home ranges was not possible 2 5 design and analyses of simulation experiments all simulations were conducted in netlogo 5 3 1 wilensky 1999 to compare the effect of different foraging strategies with a control foraging strategy we performed simulations for risk averse risk taking and control prey communities all individuals in one simulation had the same foraging strategy furthermore we varied the proportion of refuges in the landscape from 0 to 1 with an interval of 0 1 30 repetitions were performed for each combination of foraging strategy and landscape configuration model output included body mass size and location of individuals that successfully established a home range in the landscape and food availability in the landscape cells at the end of the simulation to analyze the effect of body mass initial food availability in the landscape and the proportion of refuges on the home range size we made additional simulations where only one individual established a home range in the landscape we varied the body mass of the individual from 10 g to 1000 g the initial food availability in the landscape by reducing the default food availability from 100 to 10 of the initial food availability and the proportion of refuges in the landscape from 0 to 100 while varying one of these parameters the others were kept constant the body mass at 50 g the reduction in food resource availability at 0 and the proportion of refuges at 50 for each combination 30 replicate simulations were conducted statistical analyses were conducted in r version 3 3 2 r core team 2016 to calculate shannon diversity species richness and evenness the package vegan oksanen et al 2017 was used for the calculation of these community metrics prey individuals were categorized into species depending on their body mass we used a total number of 100 species the right border of the body mass interval in g representing a species was defined by 10 s 1 5 with s as the species number from 0 to 100 the left border of the interval was the right border of the previous species the exponent 1 5 was chosen in order to cover the range of possible body masses in the model additionally we calculated community metrics for evenly spaced body mass intervals and for 10 species all body mass intervals and species numbers yielded similar results see supplementary material appendix b fig b 1 for a comparison of community metrics of different body mass intervals and species numbers 3 results 3 1 space use patterns to gain a better understanding of individual home range formation we compared the addition of cells to the home range between control risk averse and risk taking individuals fig 2 results show that all individuals avoided including non productive cells in their home range since they could not gain food resources from these individuals of the control consecutively added productive cells closest to the home range core often resulting in circular home ranges risk averse and risk taking individuals preferred refuges although possibly located further away from the home range center from refuges individuals could gain more food risk averse or had lower movement costs risk taking than in risky habitat if the home range contained risky habitat risk taking individuals needed to add more cells to their home range than risk averse individuals to cover the increased movement costs in this habitat the individual s home range size was the result of the interplay between its traits and the landscape configuration fig 3 traits influencing the home range size were the daily energy requirements the movement costs per distance unit and the foraging strategy under predation risk the first two traits were determined by the body mass due to allometric relationships home range size increased with body mass as the individuals had higher energy requirements and movement costs fig 3a risk taking individuals had larger home ranges than risk averse individuals and individuals of the control additionally the landscape configuration affected the home range size an important factor determining home range size was food resource availability in the landscape simulations always started with the same food resource availability but due to the depletion of food resources by animals that already established a home range individuals that were chosen later in the simulation found a lower food resource availability in the landscape since the depletion by animals varied across simulations we reduced the initial overall food resource availability in the landscape to analyze the effect of food availability on individual home range size and compare between different foraging strategies fig 3b the reduction in food resource availability led to an increase in home range size again home range sizes of risk taking individuals were generally higher than for risk averse and control individuals concerning individuals of the risk averse and the risk taking behavioral type the proportion of refuges also had an effect on the home range size with increasing proportions of refuges home range size decreased fig 3c risk averse individuals showed a larger decrease in home range size than risk taking individuals beside effects on home range formation the behavioral response of animals to risk had consequences for the landscape usage by prey animals fig 4 the overlap of home ranges per grid cell in low risk and high risk areas differed between foraging strategies fig 4a risk averse communities showed a higher overlap of home ranges in risky habitat compared to refuges the high food intake of risk averse individuals in refuges caused a strong depletion of these resources consequently these cells were occupied by few individuals low density profiting from the good resource conditions other individuals had to use risky habitat which could due to the low food intake in these be utilized by many individuals resulting in a high overlap of home ranges in this area the reverse pattern was found in risk taking communities although the difference between risky habitat and refuges was much smaller here risk taking individuals had the same food intake in risky habitat and refuges due to the preference for refuges which bear lower movement costs the home range overlap was higher in these than in the risky habitat furthermore modified space use patterns of individuals due to the fear distribution had consequences for the exploitation of food resources in the landscape the preference for refuges led to an unequal use of food resources in the landscape fig 4b due to the increased foraging pressure in refuges food resources were depleted to a higher degree i e lower giving up density than food resources in risky habitat which had a higher giving up density this difference in depletion was more distinct for risk averse individuals 3 2 community effects the median body mass increased for both risk averse and risk taking individuals with the proportion of refuges indicating a shift in the community structure towards animals with a larger body mass fig 5 a the increase was steeper in the community with risk taking individuals than in the risk averse for low proportions of refuges for high proportions of refuges the pattern was inverted with a higher increase in median body mass of the risk averse community compared to the risk taking community furthermore risk averse communities reached a higher median body mass under high proportions of refuges compared to risk taking and control communities regarding the number of individuals in the community risk averse and risk taking showed different patterns to increasing proportions of refuges fig 5b for the risk averse community the number of individuals decreased with an increasing proportion of refuges whereas it increased in the community of risk taking individuals the total biomass of the community represents the sum of the body mass of all individuals in the community for the community of risk taking and risk averse individuals the total biomass increased with the proportion of refuges and in case of the risk averse individuals even exceeded the total biomass of the control fig 5c similar to the total biomass and the mean body mass shannon diversity and species richness increased with the proportion of refuges fig 5d e risk taking prey communities showed a higher diversity for medium proportions of refuges than risk averse prey communities if no refuges were present in the landscape risk averse prey communities had a higher diversity than risk taking communities for high proportions of refuges the diversity and species richness of risk averse communities were higher than the control the evenness of the risk taking community decreased with the proportion of refuges and was generally higher than the evenness of the control fig 5f in contrast the evenness of the risk averse prey communities showed a u shaped pattern with the smallest evenness at medium proportions of refuges in order to get further insights into the community structure we compared the distribution of body masses within the community for exemplary proportions of refuges fig 6 the risk averse and the risk taking communities both showed a clear shift to smaller individuals accompanied by a loss of large individuals for low proportions of refuges fig 6a in these scenarios the body mass distribution is similar to the body mass distribution of control communities that are facing a reduced initial food availability of 20 of the default availability with increasing proportion of refuges the body mass distributions of the communities approximated each other for a proportion of 50 of refuges the risk taking community was nearly equal to the control while the risk averse community still showed a shift towards animals with smaller body masses fig 6b if all cells were refuges the body mass distribution in the control the risk averse and the risk taking community was approximately the same fig 6c 4 discussion in this study we investigated the consequences of non consumptive predator effects on prey community metrics by using a mechanistic model of individual home range formation the results support our hypothesis that perceived predation risk shapes prey community structure due to modifications in prey space use furthermore the model gives insights into the role of refuges and foraging strategies of prey animals for prey community structure the availability of refuges increased general community metrics such as total biomass mean body mass species richness and shannon diversity foraging strategies of prey individuals affected the composition of the prey community by shifting the body mass distribution towards smaller individuals occurring in high abundances this shift was more pronounced in risk averse than in risk taking prey communities especially for a medium proportion of refuges 4 1 foraging strategies under predation risk we compared the performance of prey communities using two contrasting foraging strategies under predation risk risk taking animals have increased movement costs in areas with risky habitat since they return more often to refuges in order to escape from predators to cover the increased movement costs risk taking animals need to exploit more food to fulfill their daily energy requirements which results in larger home ranges home range overlap of risk taking animals is slightly higher in refuges since they bear lower movement costs due to the higher food requirements of risk taking animals fewer individuals could be supported by the available food resources in the landscape resulting in decreased biomass and species richness at the community level compared to risk averse communities and the control in contrast to risk taking prey risk averse animals face indirect costs of their antipredatory behavior via the costs of missed opportunities risk averse individuals reduce their foraging in risky habitat and thus miss exploiting food resources in these parts of the landscape individuals balance the reduced food intake in risky habitat with intensive foraging in refuges this behavior caused strong competition for food resources in refuges and a fast depletion of these by only a few animals therefore risk averse communities show a low overlap of home ranges in refuges in risky habitat low food exploitation by risk averse animals results in a high overlap of home ranges in comparison to risk taking prey communities risk averse communities showed a higher biomass and species richness since their antipredatory behavior only reduced the access to food resources but did not lead to additional energy costs foraging strategies could be considered to be the result of different personality traits between individuals the impact of individual differences in traits such as boldness and exploratory behavior on animal space use has been confirmed for many species reviewed in spiegel et al 2017 for example starlings that spend more time on the ground have larger home ranges compared to starlings that spend more time on perches minderman et al 2010 this is similar to larger home ranges of risk taking individuals in the model nevertheless empirical studies have shown that animals often adapt their foraging decisions according to specific conditions lima 1998 for example hungry animals are more likely to use risky areas than well fed animals gotceitas and godin 1991 kohler and mcpeek 1989 pettersson and brönmark 1993 i e they switch between a risk averse and a risk taking strategy depending on their internal state obviously the implemented foraging strategies in the model do not allow for such an adaptive foraging behavior but they can give an initial overview about the spectrum of consequences that differences in foraging behavior can have further studies should refine the implemented foraging strategies by integrating more sophisticated trade offs such as a direct feedback of perceived predation risk on the fitness of the animal and the possibility of adaptations in the behavior depending on the internal state and external conditions additionally future studies could incorporate communities in which individuals follow different foraging strategies representing for example differences in personalities between individuals this would allow to investigate which foraging strategies are favored under varying environmental conditions regarding community composition risk taking communities consisted of animals with larger body mass and a more even body mass distribution but lower number of individuals compared to risk averse communities risk averse communities were more shifted towards small individuals occurring at high abundance the high number of individuals in risk averse communities caused a high species richness while the uneven distribution of body masses resulted in lower evenness and shannon diversity compared to risk taking communities differences in community composition of risk taking and risk averse communities shed first light on the question which foraging strategy prey animals should use to maximize their fitness under low refuge availability a risk averse strategy is preferable for small animals since their low energy requirements allow them to forage only in the refuges large animals with high energy requirements should follow a risk taking strategy since it allows them to use additional food resources from risky habitat patches 4 2 refuge availability changes in prey community structure emerged from modified home range formation on the individual level individuals integrated areas with the maximum food availability and the lowest predation risk in their home ranges in the model we used landscapes of fear varying in the proportion of refuges to risky habitat in order to investigate the role of refuge availability for prey communities on the individual level prey home range sizes decreased with increasing availability of refuges fig 3c within refuges food gain of prey individuals was higher compared to risky habitat since they could exploit more food risk averse strategy or had lower movement costs risk taking strategy therefore the integration of refuges in the home range allowed animals to fulfill their food requirements by foraging in a smaller area the use of refuges is a common strategy among animals in order to minimize predation risk lima and dill 1990 many animals show modifications in their space use due to changes in the landscape of fear either on the scale of shifting their home ranges to other areas or by adapting the space use within the home range for example wild boars respond to variation in predation risk during the hunting season by shifting their home ranges towards protected areas where hunting is not allowed tolon et al 2009 deer and black bears respond to increased predation risk with adaptations within the home range e g by decreasing the usage of ecotones and roads respectively padié et al 2015 stillfried et al 2015 the distance travelled and exploratory behavior marantz et al 2016 furthermore refuge use leads to a heterogeneous distribution of food resources in the landscape due to the lower giving up density in refuges food resources are depleted to a lower level compared to food resources in risky habitat fig 4b these differences in food resource exploitation can induce trophic cascades werner and peacor 2003 on the community level modifications in space use due to increased refuge availability had positive effects on prey community metrics leading to higher species richness diversity and total biomass these results are in good agreement with empirical patterns found in coral reef fish assemblages showing increased species abundance and richness with refuge availability in reefs caley and st john 1996 hixon and beets 1993 additionally these results support the habitat heterogeneity hypothesis stating that environmental heterogeneity increases species diversity bazzaz 1975 increasing availability of refuges causes a heterogeneous distribution of fear in the landscape and therefore allows more species to coexist moreover refuge availability drives community composition in risk averse and risk taking animal communities while there is a large difference in the number of individuals between risk averse and risk taking animals under low refuge availability both communities show similar numbers of individuals under high refuge availability in risk averse communities low food availability in risky habitat allows only small animals the establishment of a home range while large animals are not able to find enough food to cover their food requirements with increasing refuge availability more food becomes available as a result large animals can establish home ranges and replace small animals due to higher food requirements of large animals the number of individuals in the community decreases while median body mass increases by contrast risk taking animals face increased movement costs in risky habitat under low refuge availability these movement costs strongly increase the food requirements of the animals therefore food resources in the landscape are depleted by fewer animals compared to risk averse communities with increasing refuge availability movement costs decrease and more and larger animals can establish a home range in the landscape therefore the number of individuals and the median body mass increase for high levels of refuge availability biomass diversity and species richness of risk averse prey communities even exceeded the values of the control the high availability of refuges allows risk averse animals to use nearly the whole landscape so that competition for refuges is reduced due to the intensive foraging in refuges risk averse animals can exploit even more food than animals of the control however the consumption of food resources at such a high rate would in reality only be possible if food resources refill very quickly otherwise it would soon lead to a breakdown of food resources cases of mesopredator release have shown strong increases in the population of mesopredators under the absence of predation risk from top predators accompanied by increased consumption of prey animals which can lead to the breakdown of prey populations elmhagen and rushton 2007 ritchie and johnson 2009 low levels of refuge availability led to a reduction of large animals and an increase of smaller animals in risk averse and risk taking communities compared to control communities this shift towards animals with smaller body mass is similar to the shift that can be observed in control communities facing a decreased initial food availability similarities arise because the reduced food gain of risk aware individuals in risky habitat is comparable to the food gain of control individuals in cells with a decreased food availability 4 3 scaling up from the individual level to the community level linking different hierarchical levels the model bridges the gap between behavioral and community ecology in our model patterns emerge from underlying processes which is crucial to understand complex interactions in ecosystems cabral et al 2017 and to tease apart effects of bottom up vs top down control on biodiversity one reason why models often cover only one hierarchical level is the increasing complexity when integrating more levels grimm et al 2017 nevertheless several examples show that it is possible to develop individual based community models e g for forests köhler and huth 1998 for fish communities giacomini et al 2009 the crucial point to reduce the complexity in such models is to find a way to represent all species in a community and their interactions with the same basic approach in forest ecology gap models botkin et al 1972 bugmann 2001 have used this approach for decades animal community ecology has made progress in this direction the key being a trait based approach where species differ only in their parameterization but not in their representation jeltsch et al 2013b in the presented model we further reduced complexity by using allometric relationships to calculate several physiological traits again this approach has been used in forest modelling for a long time thus individuals can be described only by their body mass and their specific foraging strategy under predation risk 4 4 possible extension of the model temporal variation in predation risk the model predicts possible consequences of different landscapes of fear and foraging strategies on prey community structure emerging from adaptations in space use however the model focuses on spatial variation in predation risk and does not include temporal variation of that risk the occurrence of temporal variation in risk is common in nature due to seasonal changes varying light intensity during the lunar cycle or within a day dodson 1990 kotler et al 1994 werner 1986 the risk allocation hypothesis states that animals should increase antipredator behavior during pulses of high risk and allocate foraging activities to pulses of low risk lima and bednekoff 1999 several studies have shown temporal adaptations in animals to minimize predation risk e g gerbils that show the highest foraging activities during the darkest hours of the night kotler et al 1994 or elk that shift from diurnal to nocturnal activity to avoid hunters visscher et al 2017 it can be expected that such temporal adaptations have effects on the community level since they can affect competition between prey animals arising from changes in activity times for the integration of temporal variation in predation risk in the model it would be necessary to explicitly include time and allow modifications of home ranges after an individual has settled at a specific location including the displacement of individuals with an established home range by other individuals depending on the time scale it might also be necessary to include further processes such as reproduction mortality and dispersal nevertheless it has been shown that the static approach developed by buchmann et al 2011 that we used here can capture realistic features of community composition and structure buchmann et al 2011 prevedello et al 2016 4 5 implications for empirical research and nature management our results reveal that perceived predation risk can shape prey community structures although adaptations in behavior and cascading effects on ecosystem functioning are widely known risk effects on prey communities remain poorly studied creel and christianson 2008 a study on songbirds highlights the strong impact of perceived predation risk on reproduction zanette et al 2011 furthermore landscapes of fear are expected to control the extent of bottom up and top down processes in prey populations laundré et al 2014 additionally the concept of landscapes of fear can also be applied to apex predators for example a study by mech 1977 showed that wolves are afraid of hunting close to the territories of neighboring packs thereby they create buffer zones in which prey animals such as deer can browse safely which can have cascading effects on the vegetation since risk effects are difficult to assess empirically a combination of empirical and modelling studies might prove useful to investigate the consequences of fear in different prey communities jeltsch et al 2013a empirical studies can provide information about the basic principles from which differences in community structure emerge such as the configuration of the landscape of fear or the foraging behavior of prey animals concerning their decisions on which locations they choose for their home range by integrating this information the model can be applied to specific prey communities and allows the prediction of community structures and composition vice versa the model provides mechanisms that are important for shaping community structure that could then be tested in empirical studies the prediction of prey community structure under different conditions can prove useful since in many areas landscapes of fear are changing firstly ecosystems face a loss of apex predators resulting in the loss of top down control estes et al 2011 secondly predators are reintroduced in ecosystems where they have been formerly present leading to changes in the spatial distribution of prey animals which can affect other trophic levels kuijper et al 2013 thirdly human activities affect the predation risk that animals perceive these can be direct risk effects on hunted species bonnot et al 2013 tolon et al 2009 or indirect effects on non target species mori 2017 furthermore human activities and disturbances create landscapes of fear for predators and prey which can decrease the strength of non consumptive effects on prey animals due to adaptive behavior of predators oriol cotterill et al 2015 and in case of the prey often exceed the predation risk perceived from natural predators ciuti et al 2012 further research on the consequences for prey communities is necessary to estimate the effect of large predators on biodiversity 5 conclusions the consequences of non consumptive predator effects on prey communities are until now largely unknown since research focuses either on behavioral adaptations on the individual level e g altendorf et al 2001 martin et al 2003 or on possible effects for other trophic levels and ecosystem functioning schmitz et al 2004 werner and peacor 2003 the presented model integrates behavior on the individual level with effects on the level of the prey community this approach allows to link patterns at the community level with mechanistic processes on the individual level which is a central goal in ecology cabral et al 2017 our findings show that modifications in home range formation due to perceived predation risk shape prey community structures with important implications for biodiversity of the whole prey community an understanding of the consequences of non consumptive predator effects on prey communities is crucial under the current loss of apex predators in many ecosystems estes et al 2011 furthermore anthropogenic land use and hunting modify existing landscapes of fear with potentially extensive consequences for animal communities kuijper et al 2016 the model presented in this study helps to understand and evaluate the magnitude of general mechanisms such as refuge availability and foraging strategy affecting prey community responses under predation risk based on these results further studies combining simulation models and empirical studies can be designed to evaluate the impact of non consumptive predator effects on prey communities declaration of interest none acknowledgements this work was supported by deutsche

25265,non consumptive effects of predators within ecosystems can alter the behavior of individual prey species and have cascading effects on other trophic levels in this context an understanding of non consumptive predator effects on the whole prey community is crucial for predicting community structure and composition hence biodiversity patterns we used an individual based spatially explicit modelling approach to investigate the consequences of landscapes of fear on prey community metrics the model spans multiple hierarchical levels from individual home range formation based on food availability and perceived predation risk to consequences on prey community structure and composition this mechanistic approach allowed us to explore how important factors such as refuge availability and foraging strategy under fear affect prey community metrics fear of predators affected prey space use such as home range formation these adaptations had broader consequences for the community leading to changes in community structure and composition the strength of community responses to perceived predation risk was driven by refuge availability in the landscape and the foraging strategy of prey animals low refuge availability in the landscape strongly decreased diversity and total biomass of prey communities additionally body mass distributions in prey communities facing high predation risk were shifted towards small prey animals with increasing refuge availability the consequences of non consumptive predator effects were reduced diversity and total biomass of the prey community increased prey foraging strategies affected community composition under medium refuge availability risk averse prey communities consisted of many small animals while risk taking prey communities showed a more even body mass distribution our findings reveal that non consumptive predator effects can have important implications for prey community diversity and should therefore be considered in the context of conservation and nature management keywords predator prey interactions individual based model landscape of fear home range biodiversity foraging 1 introduction predators affect prey populations in two different ways directly by consuming and indirectly by evoking fear brown et al 1999 lima 1998 while it is clear that consumption has negative consequences for prey populations the impact of fear is not that obvious prey individuals sensing the presence of a predator may respond with morphological changes for example the development of spines against being eaten in daphnia pulex krueger and dodson 1981 or behavioral adjustments such as increased vigilance behavior hunter and skinner 1998 alterations in group size creel and winnie 2005 or diurnal vertical migration stich and lampert 1981 in order to minimize predation risk additionally fear effects can have profound consequences on ecosystem functioning due to cascading impacts on other species ripple and beschta 2004 schmitz et al 2004 werner and peacor 2003 due to the frequently reported losses of apex predators in many ecosystems estes et al 2011 an understanding of indirect effects of predators on prey is of high importance to better understand and predict consequences for biodiversity and ecosystems common behavioral adjustments of animals perceiving predation risk are modifications in space use during foraging in order to understand these modifications the landscape of fear concept has been developed consisting of visual maps that quantify the spatial distribution of predation risk laundré et al 2010 2001 predation risk perception can be measured by using established methods such as giving up densities brown 1988 or vigilance patterns altendorf et al 2001 in combination with information about food availability and locomotion costs landscapes of fear can help to decipher and predict animal movement decision gallagher et al 2017 furthermore landscapes of fear can be integrated in basic ecological concepts such as the link between bottom up and top down control laundré et al 2014 adaptations in prey behavior due to perceived predation risk can have cascading effects on other species these effects have been summarized under the term behavior mediated indirect interactions dill et al 2003 werner and peacor 2003 behavior mediated indirect interactions occur in manifold ecological communities with quantitatively significant effects on community dynamics often exceeding the impact of density mediated effects reviewed in werner and peacor 2003 experimental analysis of behavior mediated effects is often challenging due to difficulties of disentangling direct and indirect effects nevertheless by using playbacks from a predator the domestic dog suraci et al 2016 could show that increases in fear reduce raccoon foraging on marine biota leading to cascading effects across multiple trophic levels in the intertidal food web thereby fear of predators can act as an important ecosystem service that can structure communities and ecosystems ripple and beschta 2004 to date most studies on behavior mediated effects of predators on their prey either focused on specific behavioral adaptations on the level of single individuals e g lima and dill 1990 kotler et al 1991 jacob and brown 2000 or on consequences for other trophic levels e g beckerman et al 1997 dill et al 2003 however consequences of fear at the prey community level are largely unknown despite their potential implications for conservation and management non consumptive effects have been shown to have strong negative impacts on reproduction of the prey zanette et al 2011 e g via maternal effects boonstra et al 1998 sheriff et al 2010 furthermore non consumptive effects can exist in prey communities even if direct predation is low or not present creel and christianson 2008 an understanding of community responses to predation risk and the underlying mechanisms behind them is therefore important to predict how changing predator abundance affects prey community structures in this study we assessed the consequences of non consumptive predator effects on prey community structure and composition given the challenge to scale up from the behavior of individuals to the whole community structure we applied an individual based mechanistic model of home range formation in a mammalian prey community where individual space use is based on the trade off between food availability and predation risk it extends a modelling approach by buchmann et al 2011 which has been successfully applied to explain community responses to habitat loss and fragmentation buchmann et al 2013 the importance of individual foraging movement for community structure buchmann et al 2012 and to generate realistic landscape patterns of biodiversity in the context of matrix suitability prevedello et al 2016 the incorporation of fear in the model advances our understanding of the impact of predator prey interactions on home range formation and the consequences for community structure and composition a key concept in our model is the premise that behavioral strategies of animals under predation risk can be expected to have consequences on prey community structure animals adjust the time they spend in local foraging patches and the amount of food they exploit from them in response to perceived predation risk animals can adopt different foraging strategies in order to minimize predation risk animals that use a risk averse strategy reduce foraging in risky patches to decrease the probability of encountering a predator to compensate for the reduced food intake in risky patches animals increase foraging activities in safe patches this adaptation in foraging activities represents a commonly observed pattern in many animals such as fish rozas and odum 1988 werner et al 1983 and small mammals jacob and brown 2000 simonetti 1989 for example under the presence of owls several gerbil species increase their food intake in bush microhabitats in contrast to open habitats since they offer shelter from avian predators kotler et al 1991 in contrast to the risk averse foraging strategy animals with a risk taking foraging strategy utilize food resources both in risky and safe patches risk taking animals reduce the probability of predation in dangerous patches by using shorter foraging bouts these animals frequently use refuges or return to their den in order to escape from a predator an example for this strategy are birds that directly fly to cover when detecting a predator schneider 1984 by implementing contrasting foraging strategies of prey animals risk averse and risk taking in the model we assessed a possible spectrum of consequences of different strategies on the prey community in concert with landscape of fear effects additionally to the foraging strategy of prey animals under predation risk refuge availability in the landscape plays an important role if available prey animals frequently use refuges in order to reduce predation risk lima and dill 1990 in aquatic systems refuges are known to alter the impact of predation risk and can affect prey population dynamics and coexistence orrock et al 2013 by varying the amount of refuges in the landscape we assessed how prey community structures are affected by refuge availability based on these premises we specifically aim to assess the following hypotheses 1 perceived predation risk in the landscape impacting individual space use in prey species can shape prey community structures 2 the interplay between the availability of high quality refuges and foraging strategies of prey animals is a driving mechanism of prey community responses to predation risk 2 methods 2 1 model overview the model simulates home range formation in a mammalian prey community based on food availability and perceived predation risk it aims to gain a mechanistic understanding about space use behavior under fear and its consequences for community structure and composition as our model focuses on the indirect effects of predation on space use it does not include the direct effects of predator induced mortality on individuals or communities over time the model predicts how individual changes in behavior can affect the structure and composition of prey communities in turn allowing us to predict how non consumptive predator effects can alter prey community metrics it extends a successfully validated modelling approach developed by buchmann et al 2011 by integrating landscapes of fear and different foraging strategies of animals under predation risk a detailed model description following the odd overview design concepts details protocol grimm et al 2010 2006 is provided in the supplementary material appendix a here we only give an overview of the general model structure and processes the individual based and spatially explicit model includes two entities 1 landscape cells which are described by their location the amount of food resources they contain and the predation risk that animals perceive in this cell and 2 prey individuals which are characterized by their body mass and their foraging strategy under predation risk table 1 the body mass is used to calculate physiological traits such as energy requirements per day and movement costs of prey individuals via allometric relationships in this study we focus on small herbivorous mammals with a body mass ranging from 10 g to 1000 g predators are not modelled explicitly but are represented by the predation risk in the landscape cells i e the landscape of fear we assume generalist predators such as eagles buzzards foxes or lynxes 2 2 landscape design the landscape is characterized by the distribution of food resources and predation risk the whole landscape comprises 100 100 cells with each cell representing 4 m² landscape cells can be either productive i e they contain food that can be consumed by animals or they are non productive and do not contain food resources we assume that 30 of the landscape cells contain food productive food cells are distributed randomly in the landscape each productive cell initially contains food resources reflecting the average daily productivity in grass and shrublands 0 685 g m² day whittaker 1975 from these food resources we assume that 80 of the food resources are lost to other taxonomic groups or not suitable for animal consumption so that only 20 of the average daily productivity can be used by prey animals see buchmann et al 2011 for further discussion on this value food resources are exploited by animals during the simulation and do not refill besides food resources cells either have a high perceived predation risk p safety 0 1 or a low perceived predation risk p safety 0 9 all non productive cells have a high perceived predation risk because we assume that a lack of vegetation corresponds with high perceived predation risk this corresponds to landscapes in which animals have to cope with areas of hostile matrix in their home ranges which is typical for human dominated landscapes such as clear cuts in forests productive cells can have a high or a low perceived risk of predation in the following we use the term risky habitat for productive cells with a high perceived predation risk and refuge for productive cells with a low perceived predation risk the proportion of refuges is a systematically tested model parameter the distribution of perceived predation risk in the landscape represents the landscape of fear for the prey animals we assume that the landscape of fear is static i e the predation risk in the cells does not change during the simulation 2 3 foraging strategies in the model we implemented two highly contrasting foraging strategies in separate model runs to explore a possible spectrum of consequences of different strategies on the prey community we assume that individuals of both foraging strategies are central place foragers frequently returning to a central place their den the den is an absolute refuge where individuals do not face predation risk foraging strategies were tested separately i e all individuals in a community had the same strategy moreover we compared the two contrasting foraging strategies to a control foraging strategy in which animals do not respond to predation risk in the landscape i e their food intake only depends on food availability and physiological constraints the rationale of these two strategies is described in the following their implementation is described below in the process home range formation the foraging strategy of risk averse individuals focuses on adaptations in food intake between patches with different predation risk risk averse animals show a reduced food intake in risky habitat to minimize the time they are exposed to this high risk to compensate the lower food intake under high risk they forage more intensively in refuges and show an increased food intake in these patches compared to control individuals these animals are facing indirect costs of their antipredatory behavior via the costs of missed opportunities risk taking individuals deal with predation risk by adapting their activity patterns in risky habitat risk taking animals show short foraging bouts with frequent returns to the den and hiding in refuges in order to minimize encounters with a predator this behavior increases the energy costs of risk taking animals in risky habitat to cover the increased movement costs they need to exploit more food resources to fulfill their daily energy requirements in refuges risk taking individuals have the same activity patterns as animals of the control the two foraging strategies represent simplified behavioral strategies of animals foraging under predation risk the risk averse foraging strategy allows to explore the consequences of adaptations in food intake under perceived predation risk on prey communities while the risk taking strategy focuses on consequences of increased movement costs due to perceived predation risk by using these extreme and contrasting examples we intend to gain a first overview of the spectrum of consequences that different foraging strategies have on prey community structures 2 4 process scheduling each simulation starts with the generation of a new landscape with a specific distribution of food and perceived predation risk after the generation of the landscape in each step of the model one additional new prey individual characterized by its body mass and foraging strategy searches for a home range in the landscape the home range has to contain enough food resources to fulfill the animal s energy requirements if the individual finds a suitable home range it exploits the food resources within the home range otherwise the individual is excluded from the community we assume that the individual disperses to another area outside the simulated landscape or dies existing individuals in the landscape are not affected by newly added individuals the simulation continues until the community is saturated i e 100 individuals parameter nfail see supplementary material appendix a table a 2 have consecutively not been able to establish a home range in the landscape because they could not reach their energy requirements in the following we briefly describe the processes within the model see fig 1 for an overview of processes in the model 2 4 1 trait assignment in each model step a new prey individual characterized by its body mass and foraging strategy is created the body mass of the new individual is drawn from a body mass input distribution a truncated power law distribution with an exponent of 1 5 see supplementary material appendix a table a 2 this specific exponent was chosen since it yields realistic community structures buchmann et al 2011 2012 on the basis of the body mass further traits of the animal are calculated by using allometric relationships namely the feeding rate locomotion costs maximum home range size and the share of food resources that is available to an animal per grid cell see supplementary material appendix a table a 3 in addition to body mass individuals are attributed a foraging strategy either risk averse risk taking or control 2 4 2 home range search and food consumption the key process of the model is the home range search of the newly created prey individual the home range needs to contain enough food resources to cover the individual s daily feeding rate and movement costs for foraging within the home range individuals are central place foragers frequently returning to a central place their den within their home range this is implicitly represented in the model by calculating the movement costs for the distance to a cell and the return the home range search starts with the choice of a core cell the central place of the home range where the den of the individual is located this cell is chosen randomly from the pool of productive cells the addition of a cell to the home range consists of two steps the choice of which cell is added and the calculation of the food gain from the cell the cell that is added next to the home range is chosen from the neighboring cells of the cell that was added last to the home range we assume that the animal has a perceptual range of one cell i e it can sense the food availability and the predation risk in the eight neighboring cells for the decision which of these cells is added to the home range the suitability of a cell is calculated by the product of food availability and predation risk 1 suitability p food p safety the cell with the highest suitability is added to the home range for the control only the food availability is taken into account suitability p food if several cells have the same suitability the cell with the minimum distance to the core is chosen after the decision for a cell the food gain from this cell is calculated the food gain is the difference between the exploited food and the movement costs 2 food gain exploited food movement costs for the control and the risk taking individuals the amount of exploited food is the arithmetic product of food availability in the cell p food and the allometric magnitude of food exploitation i foodshare 3 exploited food p food i foodshare for risk averse individuals predation risk p safety additionally affects food intake 4 exploited food p food i foodshare 2 p safety the factor 2 was chosen so that the food intake at a medium predation risk p safety 0 5 equals the food intake of the control in safe cells p safety 0 5 risk averse animals have a higher food intake than risk taking and control animals whereas their food intake is reduced in dangerous cells p safety 0 5 the factor i foodshare leads to different feeding efficiencies in mammals depending on their body size for control and risk averse individuals movement costs are the product of the allometric costs i lococost and twice the distance to the core cell distancecore as the individual has to move to the foraging cell and back to the central place 5 movement costs 2 i lococost distancecore risk taking individuals have the same movement costs when predation risk is low i e p safety 0 5 however high predation risk p safety 0 5 causes additional movement costs for risk taking individuals 6 movement costs 2 i lococost distancecore p food i foodshare 1 2 p safety movement costs in risk taking individuals thus increase depending on the amount of food in the cell we assume that the higher the food intake the more often the individual interrupts foraging to return to the den furthermore movement costs in this case can also include costs of other adapted behavior not related to movement such as increased vigilance exemplary calculations for the different foraging types during home range search are shown in supplementary material appendix a table a 4 if after adding a cell the food gain from the home range meets the daily energy requirements of the animal and the movement costs the home range search was considered successful and the individual establishes its home range in these cells if the amount of cells exceeds the maximum home range size before the energy requirements are achieved the individual fails to find a home range and is excluded from the community i e we assume that it disperses to another area outside the simulated landscape or dies if the home range search was successful food resources p food of cells within the home range are reduced by the amount of exploited food calculated during the home range search due to fractal characteristics of food resources animals only exploit a share of the available food resources in a grid cell and do not deplete food resources completely therefore the individuals entering subsequently are able to include cells that already have been exploited leading to overlapping home ranges a visual representation of exemplary home ranges for animals with different foraging strategies is shown in fig 2 2 4 3 community saturation as the simulation progresses an increasing number of individuals establish home ranges and deplete food resources within the landscape this reduction in available food means that new individuals are less likely to establish home ranges thus the community becomes saturated simulations were stopped if 100 individuals have consecutively not been able to find a home range the sequential failure of individuals indicates that most accessible food resources in the landscape have been exploited and a further establishment of home ranges was not possible 2 5 design and analyses of simulation experiments all simulations were conducted in netlogo 5 3 1 wilensky 1999 to compare the effect of different foraging strategies with a control foraging strategy we performed simulations for risk averse risk taking and control prey communities all individuals in one simulation had the same foraging strategy furthermore we varied the proportion of refuges in the landscape from 0 to 1 with an interval of 0 1 30 repetitions were performed for each combination of foraging strategy and landscape configuration model output included body mass size and location of individuals that successfully established a home range in the landscape and food availability in the landscape cells at the end of the simulation to analyze the effect of body mass initial food availability in the landscape and the proportion of refuges on the home range size we made additional simulations where only one individual established a home range in the landscape we varied the body mass of the individual from 10 g to 1000 g the initial food availability in the landscape by reducing the default food availability from 100 to 10 of the initial food availability and the proportion of refuges in the landscape from 0 to 100 while varying one of these parameters the others were kept constant the body mass at 50 g the reduction in food resource availability at 0 and the proportion of refuges at 50 for each combination 30 replicate simulations were conducted statistical analyses were conducted in r version 3 3 2 r core team 2016 to calculate shannon diversity species richness and evenness the package vegan oksanen et al 2017 was used for the calculation of these community metrics prey individuals were categorized into species depending on their body mass we used a total number of 100 species the right border of the body mass interval in g representing a species was defined by 10 s 1 5 with s as the species number from 0 to 100 the left border of the interval was the right border of the previous species the exponent 1 5 was chosen in order to cover the range of possible body masses in the model additionally we calculated community metrics for evenly spaced body mass intervals and for 10 species all body mass intervals and species numbers yielded similar results see supplementary material appendix b fig b 1 for a comparison of community metrics of different body mass intervals and species numbers 3 results 3 1 space use patterns to gain a better understanding of individual home range formation we compared the addition of cells to the home range between control risk averse and risk taking individuals fig 2 results show that all individuals avoided including non productive cells in their home range since they could not gain food resources from these individuals of the control consecutively added productive cells closest to the home range core often resulting in circular home ranges risk averse and risk taking individuals preferred refuges although possibly located further away from the home range center from refuges individuals could gain more food risk averse or had lower movement costs risk taking than in risky habitat if the home range contained risky habitat risk taking individuals needed to add more cells to their home range than risk averse individuals to cover the increased movement costs in this habitat the individual s home range size was the result of the interplay between its traits and the landscape configuration fig 3 traits influencing the home range size were the daily energy requirements the movement costs per distance unit and the foraging strategy under predation risk the first two traits were determined by the body mass due to allometric relationships home range size increased with body mass as the individuals had higher energy requirements and movement costs fig 3a risk taking individuals had larger home ranges than risk averse individuals and individuals of the control additionally the landscape configuration affected the home range size an important factor determining home range size was food resource availability in the landscape simulations always started with the same food resource availability but due to the depletion of food resources by animals that already established a home range individuals that were chosen later in the simulation found a lower food resource availability in the landscape since the depletion by animals varied across simulations we reduced the initial overall food resource availability in the landscape to analyze the effect of food availability on individual home range size and compare between different foraging strategies fig 3b the reduction in food resource availability led to an increase in home range size again home range sizes of risk taking individuals were generally higher than for risk averse and control individuals concerning individuals of the risk averse and the risk taking behavioral type the proportion of refuges also had an effect on the home range size with increasing proportions of refuges home range size decreased fig 3c risk averse individuals showed a larger decrease in home range size than risk taking individuals beside effects on home range formation the behavioral response of animals to risk had consequences for the landscape usage by prey animals fig 4 the overlap of home ranges per grid cell in low risk and high risk areas differed between foraging strategies fig 4a risk averse communities showed a higher overlap of home ranges in risky habitat compared to refuges the high food intake of risk averse individuals in refuges caused a strong depletion of these resources consequently these cells were occupied by few individuals low density profiting from the good resource conditions other individuals had to use risky habitat which could due to the low food intake in these be utilized by many individuals resulting in a high overlap of home ranges in this area the reverse pattern was found in risk taking communities although the difference between risky habitat and refuges was much smaller here risk taking individuals had the same food intake in risky habitat and refuges due to the preference for refuges which bear lower movement costs the home range overlap was higher in these than in the risky habitat furthermore modified space use patterns of individuals due to the fear distribution had consequences for the exploitation of food resources in the landscape the preference for refuges led to an unequal use of food resources in the landscape fig 4b due to the increased foraging pressure in refuges food resources were depleted to a higher degree i e lower giving up density than food resources in risky habitat which had a higher giving up density this difference in depletion was more distinct for risk averse individuals 3 2 community effects the median body mass increased for both risk averse and risk taking individuals with the proportion of refuges indicating a shift in the community structure towards animals with a larger body mass fig 5 a the increase was steeper in the community with risk taking individuals than in the risk averse for low proportions of refuges for high proportions of refuges the pattern was inverted with a higher increase in median body mass of the risk averse community compared to the risk taking community furthermore risk averse communities reached a higher median body mass under high proportions of refuges compared to risk taking and control communities regarding the number of individuals in the community risk averse and risk taking showed different patterns to increasing proportions of refuges fig 5b for the risk averse community the number of individuals decreased with an increasing proportion of refuges whereas it increased in the community of risk taking individuals the total biomass of the community represents the sum of the body mass of all individuals in the community for the community of risk taking and risk averse individuals the total biomass increased with the proportion of refuges and in case of the risk averse individuals even exceeded the total biomass of the control fig 5c similar to the total biomass and the mean body mass shannon diversity and species richness increased with the proportion of refuges fig 5d e risk taking prey communities showed a higher diversity for medium proportions of refuges than risk averse prey communities if no refuges were present in the landscape risk averse prey communities had a higher diversity than risk taking communities for high proportions of refuges the diversity and species richness of risk averse communities were higher than the control the evenness of the risk taking community decreased with the proportion of refuges and was generally higher than the evenness of the control fig 5f in contrast the evenness of the risk averse prey communities showed a u shaped pattern with the smallest evenness at medium proportions of refuges in order to get further insights into the community structure we compared the distribution of body masses within the community for exemplary proportions of refuges fig 6 the risk averse and the risk taking communities both showed a clear shift to smaller individuals accompanied by a loss of large individuals for low proportions of refuges fig 6a in these scenarios the body mass distribution is similar to the body mass distribution of control communities that are facing a reduced initial food availability of 20 of the default availability with increasing proportion of refuges the body mass distributions of the communities approximated each other for a proportion of 50 of refuges the risk taking community was nearly equal to the control while the risk averse community still showed a shift towards animals with smaller body masses fig 6b if all cells were refuges the body mass distribution in the control the risk averse and the risk taking community was approximately the same fig 6c 4 discussion in this study we investigated the consequences of non consumptive predator effects on prey community metrics by using a mechanistic model of individual home range formation the results support our hypothesis that perceived predation risk shapes prey community structure due to modifications in prey space use furthermore the model gives insights into the role of refuges and foraging strategies of prey animals for prey community structure the availability of refuges increased general community metrics such as total biomass mean body mass species richness and shannon diversity foraging strategies of prey individuals affected the composition of the prey community by shifting the body mass distribution towards smaller individuals occurring in high abundances this shift was more pronounced in risk averse than in risk taking prey communities especially for a medium proportion of refuges 4 1 foraging strategies under predation risk we compared the performance of prey communities using two contrasting foraging strategies under predation risk risk taking animals have increased movement costs in areas with risky habitat since they return more often to refuges in order to escape from predators to cover the increased movement costs risk taking animals need to exploit more food to fulfill their daily energy requirements which results in larger home ranges home range overlap of risk taking animals is slightly higher in refuges since they bear lower movement costs due to the higher food requirements of risk taking animals fewer individuals could be supported by the available food resources in the landscape resulting in decreased biomass and species richness at the community level compared to risk averse communities and the control in contrast to risk taking prey risk averse animals face indirect costs of their antipredatory behavior via the costs of missed opportunities risk averse individuals reduce their foraging in risky habitat and thus miss exploiting food resources in these parts of the landscape individuals balance the reduced food intake in risky habitat with intensive foraging in refuges this behavior caused strong competition for food resources in refuges and a fast depletion of these by only a few animals therefore risk averse communities show a low overlap of home ranges in refuges in risky habitat low food exploitation by risk averse animals results in a high overlap of home ranges in comparison to risk taking prey communities risk averse communities showed a higher biomass and species richness since their antipredatory behavior only reduced the access to food resources but did not lead to additional energy costs foraging strategies could be considered to be the result of different personality traits between individuals the impact of individual differences in traits such as boldness and exploratory behavior on animal space use has been confirmed for many species reviewed in spiegel et al 2017 for example starlings that spend more time on the ground have larger home ranges compared to starlings that spend more time on perches minderman et al 2010 this is similar to larger home ranges of risk taking individuals in the model nevertheless empirical studies have shown that animals often adapt their foraging decisions according to specific conditions lima 1998 for example hungry animals are more likely to use risky areas than well fed animals gotceitas and godin 1991 kohler and mcpeek 1989 pettersson and brönmark 1993 i e they switch between a risk averse and a risk taking strategy depending on their internal state obviously the implemented foraging strategies in the model do not allow for such an adaptive foraging behavior but they can give an initial overview about the spectrum of consequences that differences in foraging behavior can have further studies should refine the implemented foraging strategies by integrating more sophisticated trade offs such as a direct feedback of perceived predation risk on the fitness of the animal and the possibility of adaptations in the behavior depending on the internal state and external conditions additionally future studies could incorporate communities in which individuals follow different foraging strategies representing for example differences in personalities between individuals this would allow to investigate which foraging strategies are favored under varying environmental conditions regarding community composition risk taking communities consisted of animals with larger body mass and a more even body mass distribution but lower number of individuals compared to risk averse communities risk averse communities were more shifted towards small individuals occurring at high abundance the high number of individuals in risk averse communities caused a high species richness while the uneven distribution of body masses resulted in lower evenness and shannon diversity compared to risk taking communities differences in community composition of risk taking and risk averse communities shed first light on the question which foraging strategy prey animals should use to maximize their fitness under low refuge availability a risk averse strategy is preferable for small animals since their low energy requirements allow them to forage only in the refuges large animals with high energy requirements should follow a risk taking strategy since it allows them to use additional food resources from risky habitat patches 4 2 refuge availability changes in prey community structure emerged from modified home range formation on the individual level individuals integrated areas with the maximum food availability and the lowest predation risk in their home ranges in the model we used landscapes of fear varying in the proportion of refuges to risky habitat in order to investigate the role of refuge availability for prey communities on the individual level prey home range sizes decreased with increasing availability of refuges fig 3c within refuges food gain of prey individuals was higher compared to risky habitat since they could exploit more food risk averse strategy or had lower movement costs risk taking strategy therefore the integration of refuges in the home range allowed animals to fulfill their food requirements by foraging in a smaller area the use of refuges is a common strategy among animals in order to minimize predation risk lima and dill 1990 many animals show modifications in their space use due to changes in the landscape of fear either on the scale of shifting their home ranges to other areas or by adapting the space use within the home range for example wild boars respond to variation in predation risk during the hunting season by shifting their home ranges towards protected areas where hunting is not allowed tolon et al 2009 deer and black bears respond to increased predation risk with adaptations within the home range e g by decreasing the usage of ecotones and roads respectively padié et al 2015 stillfried et al 2015 the distance travelled and exploratory behavior marantz et al 2016 furthermore refuge use leads to a heterogeneous distribution of food resources in the landscape due to the lower giving up density in refuges food resources are depleted to a lower level compared to food resources in risky habitat fig 4b these differences in food resource exploitation can induce trophic cascades werner and peacor 2003 on the community level modifications in space use due to increased refuge availability had positive effects on prey community metrics leading to higher species richness diversity and total biomass these results are in good agreement with empirical patterns found in coral reef fish assemblages showing increased species abundance and richness with refuge availability in reefs caley and st john 1996 hixon and beets 1993 additionally these results support the habitat heterogeneity hypothesis stating that environmental heterogeneity increases species diversity bazzaz 1975 increasing availability of refuges causes a heterogeneous distribution of fear in the landscape and therefore allows more species to coexist moreover refuge availability drives community composition in risk averse and risk taking animal communities while there is a large difference in the number of individuals between risk averse and risk taking animals under low refuge availability both communities show similar numbers of individuals under high refuge availability in risk averse communities low food availability in risky habitat allows only small animals the establishment of a home range while large animals are not able to find enough food to cover their food requirements with increasing refuge availability more food becomes available as a result large animals can establish home ranges and replace small animals due to higher food requirements of large animals the number of individuals in the community decreases while median body mass increases by contrast risk taking animals face increased movement costs in risky habitat under low refuge availability these movement costs strongly increase the food requirements of the animals therefore food resources in the landscape are depleted by fewer animals compared to risk averse communities with increasing refuge availability movement costs decrease and more and larger animals can establish a home range in the landscape therefore the number of individuals and the median body mass increase for high levels of refuge availability biomass diversity and species richness of risk averse prey communities even exceeded the values of the control the high availability of refuges allows risk averse animals to use nearly the whole landscape so that competition for refuges is reduced due to the intensive foraging in refuges risk averse animals can exploit even more food than animals of the control however the consumption of food resources at such a high rate would in reality only be possible if food resources refill very quickly otherwise it would soon lead to a breakdown of food resources cases of mesopredator release have shown strong increases in the population of mesopredators under the absence of predation risk from top predators accompanied by increased consumption of prey animals which can lead to the breakdown of prey populations elmhagen and rushton 2007 ritchie and johnson 2009 low levels of refuge availability led to a reduction of large animals and an increase of smaller animals in risk averse and risk taking communities compared to control communities this shift towards animals with smaller body mass is similar to the shift that can be observed in control communities facing a decreased initial food availability similarities arise because the reduced food gain of risk aware individuals in risky habitat is comparable to the food gain of control individuals in cells with a decreased food availability 4 3 scaling up from the individual level to the community level linking different hierarchical levels the model bridges the gap between behavioral and community ecology in our model patterns emerge from underlying processes which is crucial to understand complex interactions in ecosystems cabral et al 2017 and to tease apart effects of bottom up vs top down control on biodiversity one reason why models often cover only one hierarchical level is the increasing complexity when integrating more levels grimm et al 2017 nevertheless several examples show that it is possible to develop individual based community models e g for forests köhler and huth 1998 for fish communities giacomini et al 2009 the crucial point to reduce the complexity in such models is to find a way to represent all species in a community and their interactions with the same basic approach in forest ecology gap models botkin et al 1972 bugmann 2001 have used this approach for decades animal community ecology has made progress in this direction the key being a trait based approach where species differ only in their parameterization but not in their representation jeltsch et al 2013b in the presented model we further reduced complexity by using allometric relationships to calculate several physiological traits again this approach has been used in forest modelling for a long time thus individuals can be described only by their body mass and their specific foraging strategy under predation risk 4 4 possible extension of the model temporal variation in predation risk the model predicts possible consequences of different landscapes of fear and foraging strategies on prey community structure emerging from adaptations in space use however the model focuses on spatial variation in predation risk and does not include temporal variation of that risk the occurrence of temporal variation in risk is common in nature due to seasonal changes varying light intensity during the lunar cycle or within a day dodson 1990 kotler et al 1994 werner 1986 the risk allocation hypothesis states that animals should increase antipredator behavior during pulses of high risk and allocate foraging activities to pulses of low risk lima and bednekoff 1999 several studies have shown temporal adaptations in animals to minimize predation risk e g gerbils that show the highest foraging activities during the darkest hours of the night kotler et al 1994 or elk that shift from diurnal to nocturnal activity to avoid hunters visscher et al 2017 it can be expected that such temporal adaptations have effects on the community level since they can affect competition between prey animals arising from changes in activity times for the integration of temporal variation in predation risk in the model it would be necessary to explicitly include time and allow modifications of home ranges after an individual has settled at a specific location including the displacement of individuals with an established home range by other individuals depending on the time scale it might also be necessary to include further processes such as reproduction mortality and dispersal nevertheless it has been shown that the static approach developed by buchmann et al 2011 that we used here can capture realistic features of community composition and structure buchmann et al 2011 prevedello et al 2016 4 5 implications for empirical research and nature management our results reveal that perceived predation risk can shape prey community structures although adaptations in behavior and cascading effects on ecosystem functioning are widely known risk effects on prey communities remain poorly studied creel and christianson 2008 a study on songbirds highlights the strong impact of perceived predation risk on reproduction zanette et al 2011 furthermore landscapes of fear are expected to control the extent of bottom up and top down processes in prey populations laundré et al 2014 additionally the concept of landscapes of fear can also be applied to apex predators for example a study by mech 1977 showed that wolves are afraid of hunting close to the territories of neighboring packs thereby they create buffer zones in which prey animals such as deer can browse safely which can have cascading effects on the vegetation since risk effects are difficult to assess empirically a combination of empirical and modelling studies might prove useful to investigate the consequences of fear in different prey communities jeltsch et al 2013a empirical studies can provide information about the basic principles from which differences in community structure emerge such as the configuration of the landscape of fear or the foraging behavior of prey animals concerning their decisions on which locations they choose for their home range by integrating this information the model can be applied to specific prey communities and allows the prediction of community structures and composition vice versa the model provides mechanisms that are important for shaping community structure that could then be tested in empirical studies the prediction of prey community structure under different conditions can prove useful since in many areas landscapes of fear are changing firstly ecosystems face a loss of apex predators resulting in the loss of top down control estes et al 2011 secondly predators are reintroduced in ecosystems where they have been formerly present leading to changes in the spatial distribution of prey animals which can affect other trophic levels kuijper et al 2013 thirdly human activities affect the predation risk that animals perceive these can be direct risk effects on hunted species bonnot et al 2013 tolon et al 2009 or indirect effects on non target species mori 2017 furthermore human activities and disturbances create landscapes of fear for predators and prey which can decrease the strength of non consumptive effects on prey animals due to adaptive behavior of predators oriol cotterill et al 2015 and in case of the prey often exceed the predation risk perceived from natural predators ciuti et al 2012 further research on the consequences for prey communities is necessary to estimate the effect of large predators on biodiversity 5 conclusions the consequences of non consumptive predator effects on prey communities are until now largely unknown since research focuses either on behavioral adaptations on the individual level e g altendorf et al 2001 martin et al 2003 or on possible effects for other trophic levels and ecosystem functioning schmitz et al 2004 werner and peacor 2003 the presented model integrates behavior on the individual level with effects on the level of the prey community this approach allows to link patterns at the community level with mechanistic processes on the individual level which is a central goal in ecology cabral et al 2017 our findings show that modifications in home range formation due to perceived predation risk shape prey community structures with important implications for biodiversity of the whole prey community an understanding of the consequences of non consumptive predator effects on prey communities is crucial under the current loss of apex predators in many ecosystems estes et al 2011 furthermore anthropogenic land use and hunting modify existing landscapes of fear with potentially extensive consequences for animal communities kuijper et al 2016 the model presented in this study helps to understand and evaluate the magnitude of general mechanisms such as refuge availability and foraging strategy affecting prey community responses under predation risk based on these results further studies combining simulation models and empirical studies can be designed to evaluate the impact of non consumptive predator effects on prey communities declaration of interest none acknowledgements this work was supported by deutsche

25266,contact networks are convenient models to investigate epidemics with nodes and links representing potential hosts and infection pathways respectively the outcomes of outbreak simulations on networks are driven both by the underlying epidemic model and by the networks structural properties so that the same pathogen can generate different epidemic dynamics on different networks here we ask whether there are general properties that make a contact network intrinsically vulnerable to epidemics that is regardless of specific epidemiological parameters by conducting simulations on a large set of modelled networks we show that when a broad range of network topologies is taken into account the effect of specific network properties on outbreak magnitude is stronger than that of fundamental pathogen features such as transmission rate infection duration and immunization ability then by focusing on a large set of real world networks of the same type potential contacts between field voles microtus agrestis we showed how network structure can be used to accurately assess the relative intrinsic vulnerability of networks towards a specific pathogen even when those have limited topological variability these results have profound implications for how we prevent disease outbreaks in many real world situations the topology of host contact networks can be described and used to infer intrinsic vulnerability such an approach can increase preparedness and inform preventive measures against emerging diseases for which limited epidemiological information is available enabling the identification of priority targets before an epidemic event keywords contact networks disease ecology emerging infectious diseases epidemic model immunization 1 introduction network analysis is a powerful approach for investigating epidemics with nodes representing anything from individuals to countries and links mapping transmission routes that pathogens can exploit to spread from one node to another newman 2002 keeling and eames 2005 strona and castellano 2018 this general framework permits simulating different epidemiological scenarios over the same network pastor satorras et al 2015 yielding disease specific outcomes that could be important for informing management and intervention strategies rushmore et al 2013 yamin et al 2014 sun et al 2014 herrera et al 2016 although each scenario has its own characteristics and is expected to lead to specific outcomes those are also constrained by network structure understanding to what extent such constraints can attenuate differences between different epidemiological scenarios may offer important insights into the ecology and dynamics of infectious disease spread keeling 2005 common models that investigate epidemics in networks are based on identifying distinct categories i e compartments that define the health status of a host and a set of specific rules dictating the probability of transition from one status to another in a typical implementation of epidemic models nodes can be in one of three different states at any given time susceptible to the infection s infected i and recovered removed from the system r following complete immunization or death different epidemic models are then formulated by varying the rules that permit hosts to transition from one state to another for example a very common model is the si where nodes can pass only from s to i in the sis models infected nodes are allowed to roll back to the susceptible state without gaining immunity i s according to a certain probability which enables a disease to cycle in a host population by re infecting individuals that have recovered from a previous infection simulating individuals gaining permanent or temporary immunity requires the addition of a third compartment that sees nodes removed from the network i r which creates more complex models such as the sir and the sirs note that besides immunization the r status may indicate the death of a node pastor satorras et al 2015 the classic compartmental epidemic models are flexible and simple but moving beyond these particular formulations to establish more general topology vulnerability relationships has been difficult in part because they depict specific and distinct scenarios as a result the effects of network structure on disease outcomes are usually investigated by focusing on a particular type of network and pathogen whose features combine to determine disease dynamics pastor satorras et al 2015 while precise these constraints on model formulation limit our ability to compare dynamical outcomes across different networks configurations and across different pathogen types in an attempt to overcome these issues we introduce here a generalization of classic compartmental models which we named the synthetic network epidemic spread snes model despite its simple formulation the snes model permits the investigation of a wide range of epidemic scenarios in a continuous and controlled way through tuning three parameters quantifying fundamental pathogen features 1 the pathogen s transmission rate τ 2 the duration of infection i e survival time of the pathogen in the host ρ and 3 the pathogen s immunization effect on hosts over repeated infections ι such parameters all bounded in 0 1 offer a straightforward way to perform comparisons across different epidemic scenarios here we take advantage of this by applying the snes model to a large set of simulated networks representative of many different real world situations and to a set of animal contact networks representing potential encounters between field voles obtained from a mark recapture study davis et al 2015 with the aim to investigate to what extent network structure affects the outcome of an epidemic we found that when a broad range of network topologies is taken into account the epidemiological parameters of the model are in many cases less important than network structure in determining the magnitude of an epidemic outbreak of course when similar networks are considered as in the case of the field vole contact networks epidemic parameters and particularly transmission rate became fundamental to determine epidemic magnitude nevertheless even in the case of similarly structured networks topological properties still permit an accurate assessment of relative network vulnerability towards a given class of pathogens i e to pathogens whose spread can be modelled using similar epidemic parameters these findings can help improve preparedness when limited epidemiological information is available and a fast response for example in terms of prioritization is needed a situation that is expected to become ever more common in the future due to the growing globalization and the rapid emergence of new diseases 2 materials and methods 2 1 the synthetic network epidemic spread model snes at each time step any node i can be infected by nodes pointing towards or in the case of an undirected network connected to it according to a given probability τ s i with τ being the pathogen s transmission rate and s i being individual host susceptibility to the infection concurrently each node recovers with probability r i controlled by a parameter ρ varying in 0 1 and increasing with time since infection r i 1 1 1 t ρ due to the purely theoretical nature of this study the choice of the r i function is arbitrary this formulation of r i however permits a smooth transition from situations where the probability of recovery increases very slowly with time when ρ is close to 0 to opposite scenarios of fast recovery when ρ is close to 1 it is intuitive that the concept behind the snes model allows for maximum flexibility in the choice of r i t function making it possible to accommodate specific situations yet to avoid adding further complexity to our analyses and possibly complicating the interpretation of results we used the above formulation in all of our epidemic simulations the susceptibility of a node following infection becomes s i s i ι with ι being equal for all individuals since theoretically dependent on the pathogen and varying in 0 1 this accounts for a general property of immunizing diseases where individuals who have been infected and who have recovered are less likely to be re infected which is the basis of vaccination though we note there is variation with respect to immunity which is unaccounted for in these models e g waning immunity scherer and mclean 2002 interestingly analogies can be drawn for very different contexts such as that of information spread in social networks the probability that a person will share a piece of information will rapidly decrease when receiving the same piece of information again in the following we will refer to this process as immunization but it may also represent the path towards removal death of an individual corresponding to real world situations where repeated infections can be fatal as in the case of r i t s i ι can also be adjusted to fit specific hypotheses the parameters ρ and ι combine to control disease behavior for instance the extent of disease spread in terms of number of infected nodes these parameters also permit the model to be tuned to reflect typical epidemiological models such as si when ρ 0 ι 1 sis when ρ 0 ι 1 sir s when ρ 0 and ι 1 or to explore epidemic scenarios in a continuous and controlled way for example the snes framework makes it possible to track how epidemic outcomes compare between the si scenario to a typical sis scenario pastor satorras et al 2015 by progressively increasing the probability that a host will recover and become susceptible again additionally the snes model can also be easily adapted to more specific scenarios for example the addition of a simple rule controlling the lapse between the time a node is infected and the time it becomes infectious enables the snes to emulate compartment models that include latency such as the seirs which includes an exposed class we note that the snes is conceptually similar to a sirs model were the transition probabilities s i i r and r s are adjusted to particular values nevertheless by departing from the typical compartmental scheme the formulation of snes offers some advantages in terms of clarity in particular while the different typical compartmental models and possibly a tunable sirs focus on the possibility and probability of a host s transition from a health status to another and use this constraint to identify different epidemic categories on the basis of permitted and forbidden transitions the snes attempts to remove the boundaries between different models those in fact simply represent different regions of an ideal continuous three dimensional space defined by ρ ι and τ 2 2 generation of simulated networks we tested our model on 10 000 simulated networks to grow each network we selected at random a model between four different well known ones configuration model erdos renyi er barabasi albert ba and watts strogatz ws strogatz 2001 to build networks using the configuration model békéssy et al 1972 we selected a random exponent for the power law degree distribution varying between 2 and 3 in er networks we set the number of nodes v to a random integer in 50 500 and the number of edges to a random integer in v 1000 in ba networks we set the number of nodes to a random integer in 500 1000 and the number of outgoing edges generated for each node to v r 0 01 1 with v being the number of nodes and r being a random real number in 0 1 in ws networks we set the dimension of the lattice to 1 the size of the lattice along all dimensions to a random integer in 50 250 the distance within two nodes are connected to a random integer in 2 10 and the rewiring probability to a random real number in 0 1 in this way we obtained networks with a good variation in number of edges nodes connectance clustering and diameter fig 1 2 3 reciprocity instead of focusing on directed and undirected networks separately we applied the following conceptualization an undirected network is in fact a directed network where given any link connecting node a to node b a reciprocal link b a exists the relative abundance of reciprocal links determines how much a directed network differs from its undirected counterpart thus we generated all networks as directed and simple that is without loops and reciprocal links and then we added reciprocal links until reaching a preselected degree of reciprocity extracted at random in 0 1 with 0 corresponding to a directed network with no reciprocal links and 1 corresponding to an undirected network 2 4 real world contact networks to verify the validity of our results in real world situations we replicated the analysis also on a set of empirical networks all representing the same specific setting in particular we used mark recapture data of field voles microtus agrestis collected over 7 years in four different sites which we obtained from davis et al 2015 in the original study davis et al 2015 captures were performed at each of the four sites using 100 traps placed at the nodes on a regular grid of 5 m2 square cells trapping sessions were carried out every 28 days from march to november and every 56 days from november to march please refer to davis et al 2015 for a more complete description of the methodology and additional details starting from the raw data which included a unique identifier for each field vole individual caught in a trap at least once as well as the time day and location node in the trap grid of capture we built networks of potential contacts between voles by linking all individuals caught in the same cage or in two neighbouring cages i e at a distance smaller than 5 m on the same day we then retained only the networks including at least 100 edges in this way we built 296 networks with relatively small variability in their structural properties much smaller than that observed in the set of simulated networks see fig 2 2 5 unique robustness measure r besides basic network properties such as clustering connectance diameter number of nodes and edges and spectral radius of the adjacency matrix wang et al 2003 we also measured robustness as described in schneider et al 2011 for each network robustness is computed as r 1 n r 1 n q where n is the total number of network nodes and q is the fraction of nodes in the largest connected cluster after removing r nodes although this measure was developed in a completely different context in particular to assess the resilience of a network against node removal it is also closely related to the concept of percolation which has fundamental implications for studying epidemics moore and newman 2000 boguná et al 2003 serrano and boguná 2006 in its original formulation r was computed by removing nodes in decreasing order of their degree i e their number of connections the aim of sequentially removing nodes with the largest degree is to speed up the process of network disassembly hence obtaining a conservative estimate of robustness in the worst case scenario of node removal however it has been pointed out that other criteria going beyond local properties such as node degree could offer more efficient ways to disrupt networks morone and makse 2015 thus we used pagerank page et al 1999 to determine the order of node removal in the computation of r nevertheless we also tested the sensitivity of r as a measure of intrinsic vulnerability see section 2 10 to different criteria of node removal namely node degree and betweenness 2 6 node susceptibility to investigate the potential effect of individual node susceptibility s i on outbreak magnitude we replicated the experiment on simulated networks in two alternative scenarios in the first one for which we report results in the main text we attributed equal susceptibility 0 5 to all nodes in the network in the second scenario we attributed individual s i values to nodes by sampling them from a normal distribution with mean 0 5 and standard deviation 0 1 2 7 model runs for each model run we varied ρ and ι at random in order to produce very different scenarios ranging from situations where the probability of a node to recover from infection was very low ρ 0 and where immunization required several repeated infections ι 1 to situations of fast recovery ρ 1 and immunization ι 0 in all cases we set ρ 0 and ι 1 in order to produce contained epidemics we ran each model until the infection disappeared from the network in addition we varied at random the disease transmission rate τ between 0 1 in order to simulate different scenarios of pathogen infectivity we simulated 100 epidemics on each network starting from a randomly selected infected node and then averaging the results see next paragraph over the 100 runs for the set of real world networks we performed 10000 replicates by randomly selecting one of the networks in the dataset n 296 and by averaging the outcomes of 100 epidemic spreads 2 8 outbreak magnitude measures for each virus spread simulation we recorded five different measures of outbreak magnitude fig 3 defined as follows i epidemic persistence i e the total number of performed simulation steps until complete immunization ii epidemic breadth i e the fraction of nodes that have ever been infected over the total number of nodes iii epidemic peak i e the ratio between the maximum number of simultaneously infected nodes and the total number of nodes iv epidemic strength i e the mean fraction of infected nodes per step v epidemic area quantified as the area under the curve of the fraction of infected nodes over the total number of nodes vs simulation time rescaled to 0 1 although these measure are clearly not independent from one another they still indicate different aspects of outbreak magnitude and together can depict subtle differences between different epidemic events 2 9 statistical analysis we used canonical correlation analysis hair et al 2006 to compare the outbreak magnitude measures with the corresponding network structural properties and the epidemic parameters ρ and ι using the r package yacca butts 2016 we standardized all data to z values as x i μ σ with x i being the target value and μ and σ being respectively the average and standard deviation of the variable x i we evaluated the strength of canonical relationships using canonical roots and we used rao s f test to assess significance of the relationships mardia et al 1980 we evaluated the effects of dependent and independent variables on the respective canonical variates by examining cross canonical loadings and we used redundancy analysis to evaluate the amount of variance in the set of dependent variables explained by independent variables hair et al 2006 in both simulated and real world networks the redundancy values indicated that the first canonical dimension explained a consistent fraction of variance respectively 0 57 and 0 62 while the second canonical dimension added a limited contribution 0 04 and 0 05 thus in the main text we limited our discussion the canonical loadings of the first dimension 2 10 testing r as a measure of intrinsic vulnerability to assess the performance of the unique robustness measure as an estimator of intrinsic network vulnerability to epidemic spread for a given class of pathogens i e for pathogens whose spread can be modelled with similar epidemic parameters we first ranked all the field vole contact networks according to their r we then ran several sets of classical sir models pastor satorras et al 2015 under 100 different combinations of infection and recovery probabilities with both ranging from 0 1 to 1 with a step of 0 1 on all networks each scenario correspond to a particular class of pathogens for each network and model setting we replicated 100 epidemic simulations each starting from a randomly selected infected node averaging the total fraction of infected nodes throughout each simulation run this value was used to rank networks within each set of simulations i e for each combination of infection recovery probability finally we compared this rank with that provided by the unique robustness measure r networks for which the average fraction of infected nodes throughout the 100 simulations happened to be identical were ranked in random order 2 11 reproducibility all the scripts and data needed to replicate the analyses in the present paper and reproduce figures are made freely available at https github com giovannistrona network intrinsic vulnerability to epidemics 3 results and discussion we conducted a large experiment to compare the vulnerability of a wide range of network topologies fig 1 to a broad range of epidemic spread scenarios that we obtained by varying randomly the three epidemic parameters of the snes ρ ι and τ see section 2 in simulated networks the magnitude of epidemic outbreaks fig 3 was well explained by the combination of epidemic parameters and by network properties table 1 surprisingly topological properties and particularly the density of infection pathways quantified by network connectance and their redundancy quantified by network clustering that is how often two nodes pointing to another one are linked and by network robustness see below had a stronger effect on outbreak magnitude than the epidemic parameters when a broad range of network topology is considered fig 4 network robustness r resulted also more important than epidemic parameters and the second most important factor this result was very consistent in two different scenarios where we assumed respectively that all nodes had the same susceptibility to infection 0 5 or a random susceptibility extracted from a normal distribution with mean 0 5 and standard deviation 0 1 this suggests that outbreak magnitude is driven by average susceptibility more than by its variation across individuals thus we report and discuss here only the results referring to the first scenario we replicated the same procedure as was applied to the simulated networks using a set of real world networks the experiment with simulated networks explored a very broad range of network topologies and demonstrated how network topology affects epidemic outbreak magnitude even more than epidemiological parameters conversely for our test on real world scenarios we focused on a set of networks representing independent replicates of the same exact real world setting and that therefore exhibited a relatively low variability in their structural features fig 2 this permitted us to investigate if and to what extent small variations in network properties may be major determinants of epidemic outbreak magnitude even in this case where network topological variability was limited important epidemiological parameters such as the one controlling the duration of the infective stage ρ and the one modelling the immunizing effect of pathogens ι had a negligible effect in determining outbreak magnitude fig 4 transmission rate τ emerged as the most important factor although both network robustness and network connectance had very strong effects much higher than those of ρ and ι the other network parameters were less relevant and their effects were not always consistent with those observed in the set of simulated networks for example clustering was positively associated to epidemic magnitude in simulated networks but negatively associated in real world networks fig 4 which highlights how the dynamics and outcome of an epidemic event are affected by network structure in complicated ways that cannot be captured by individual basic network properties and that do not offer a straightforward interpretation in both experiments the unique robustness measure r schneider et al 2011 was consistently one of the most influential factors and positively associated with outbreak magnitude figs 4 5 the r measure is computed by counting the number of nodes present in the largest connected component after nodes are progressively removed thus representing the ability of a system such as a power grid or the internet to delay collapse after subsequent failures schneider et al 2011 in the context of epidemics r may offer a synthetic picture of the redundancy of infection pathways in a network with higher r a pathogen will have many chances to spread between nodes and will be less affected by the immunization of many nodes or their death leading in both cases to their removal from the network this finding has two important implications on the one hand it indicates that the networks where a potential outbreak is predicted to be strongest will also be the most difficult to protect since having a high r complicates immunization procedures based for example on targeted vaccination morone and makse 2015 on the other hand it suggests that r s ability to synthesize various aspects of network structure in a single value might make it a useful index to rank networks on the basis of their intrinsic vulnerability thereby offering a way to prioritize preparedness efforts by focusing preventive and surveillance actions on the most vulnerable networks this idea was supported by our experimental results which confirmed the unique robustness measure r as an efficient measure of intrinsic network vulnerability in particular the rank of field vole networks according to r was very consistent with the rank obtained by ordering networks on the basis of their vulnerability in a broad range of epidemic scenarios that we modeled by running a set of classical sir models pastor satorras et al 2015 under different combinations of infection recovery probabilities fig 6 adjusted r squared 0 59 p 0 00001 regression line y 0 77x 0 12 we quantified vulnerability in terms of the total fraction of nodes reached by the infection throughout the epidemic simulation see fig 3 ii this result is particularly convincing when considering the limited topological variability of the field vole contact networks see fig 2 which makes them a challenging benchmark to test the sensitivity of r as a vulnerability measure using different criteria of node removal to compute r namely node degree and betweenness led to very consistent results adjusted r squared 0 60 p 0 00001 regression line y 0 78x 0 11 when node degree was used adjusted r squared 0 61 p 0 00001 regression line y 0 78x 0 11 when node betweenness was used intuition suggests that the outcome of an epidemic should be affected mainly by disease behaviour in terms for example of transmission infection dynamics or latency lloyd smith et al 2009 yet our results paint a very different picture where the structure of the infected network influences outbreak magnitude more than epidemic parameters used to model pathogens features it should be highlighted that in some cases the structure of the network used to model a particular outbreak includes some implicit information about a pathogen s behavior such as its transmission mode for example one will use a network of sexual contacts to model the spread of hiv within a community woodhouse et al 1994 or a spatial network mapping crop distribution to model a plant pest spread strona et al 2017 or again the air transportation network for describing airborne pathogens brockmann and helbing 2013 on the one hand in such cases looking at the pathogen and at the network as two separate entities would not be straightforward on the other hand however the issue is more philosophical rather than applicative since it does not prevent us from comparing network vulnerability both between and within broad classes of pathogen transmission strategies furthermore it depicts more scenarios where our findings could be very useful for example one may generate different networks within the same context by considering different possible pathogen transmission strategies those could be either general ones such as airborne or sexual transmission or very specific strategies taking into account for instance vector vagility strona et al 2017 then one may compare the structure of such networks in order to identify their relative risk towards different kinds of pathogens our results are consistent with and complementary to previous studies that have shown how network structure can profoundly affect infectious disease dynamics keeling 2005 and that taking this aspect into account may improve our ability to understand and predict epidemic patterns and to implement intervention measures keeling and eames 2005 for example the properties of the air transportation network have been identified as a main determinant of global patterns of emerging diseases with complex features of the airline network being at heart of the global spread dynamics of diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome colizza et al 2006 in addition a more recent study showed that measuring the distance between the source and the target of an infection in network space can provide a more reliable prediction of epidemic spread rate than geographical distance regardless of the nature of the disease brockmann and helbing 2013 consistent with those ideas our findings suggest that in the face of many unmeasurable unknowns related to epidemiological parameters focusing on network properties can facilitate the identification of vulnerabilities and the optimization of existing systems 
25266,contact networks are convenient models to investigate epidemics with nodes and links representing potential hosts and infection pathways respectively the outcomes of outbreak simulations on networks are driven both by the underlying epidemic model and by the networks structural properties so that the same pathogen can generate different epidemic dynamics on different networks here we ask whether there are general properties that make a contact network intrinsically vulnerable to epidemics that is regardless of specific epidemiological parameters by conducting simulations on a large set of modelled networks we show that when a broad range of network topologies is taken into account the effect of specific network properties on outbreak magnitude is stronger than that of fundamental pathogen features such as transmission rate infection duration and immunization ability then by focusing on a large set of real world networks of the same type potential contacts between field voles microtus agrestis we showed how network structure can be used to accurately assess the relative intrinsic vulnerability of networks towards a specific pathogen even when those have limited topological variability these results have profound implications for how we prevent disease outbreaks in many real world situations the topology of host contact networks can be described and used to infer intrinsic vulnerability such an approach can increase preparedness and inform preventive measures against emerging diseases for which limited epidemiological information is available enabling the identification of priority targets before an epidemic event keywords contact networks disease ecology emerging infectious diseases epidemic model immunization 1 introduction network analysis is a powerful approach for investigating epidemics with nodes representing anything from individuals to countries and links mapping transmission routes that pathogens can exploit to spread from one node to another newman 2002 keeling and eames 2005 strona and castellano 2018 this general framework permits simulating different epidemiological scenarios over the same network pastor satorras et al 2015 yielding disease specific outcomes that could be important for informing management and intervention strategies rushmore et al 2013 yamin et al 2014 sun et al 2014 herrera et al 2016 although each scenario has its own characteristics and is expected to lead to specific outcomes those are also constrained by network structure understanding to what extent such constraints can attenuate differences between different epidemiological scenarios may offer important insights into the ecology and dynamics of infectious disease spread keeling 2005 common models that investigate epidemics in networks are based on identifying distinct categories i e compartments that define the health status of a host and a set of specific rules dictating the probability of transition from one status to another in a typical implementation of epidemic models nodes can be in one of three different states at any given time susceptible to the infection s infected i and recovered removed from the system r following complete immunization or death different epidemic models are then formulated by varying the rules that permit hosts to transition from one state to another for example a very common model is the si where nodes can pass only from s to i in the sis models infected nodes are allowed to roll back to the susceptible state without gaining immunity i s according to a certain probability which enables a disease to cycle in a host population by re infecting individuals that have recovered from a previous infection simulating individuals gaining permanent or temporary immunity requires the addition of a third compartment that sees nodes removed from the network i r which creates more complex models such as the sir and the sirs note that besides immunization the r status may indicate the death of a node pastor satorras et al 2015 the classic compartmental epidemic models are flexible and simple but moving beyond these particular formulations to establish more general topology vulnerability relationships has been difficult in part because they depict specific and distinct scenarios as a result the effects of network structure on disease outcomes are usually investigated by focusing on a particular type of network and pathogen whose features combine to determine disease dynamics pastor satorras et al 2015 while precise these constraints on model formulation limit our ability to compare dynamical outcomes across different networks configurations and across different pathogen types in an attempt to overcome these issues we introduce here a generalization of classic compartmental models which we named the synthetic network epidemic spread snes model despite its simple formulation the snes model permits the investigation of a wide range of epidemic scenarios in a continuous and controlled way through tuning three parameters quantifying fundamental pathogen features 1 the pathogen s transmission rate τ 2 the duration of infection i e survival time of the pathogen in the host ρ and 3 the pathogen s immunization effect on hosts over repeated infections ι such parameters all bounded in 0 1 offer a straightforward way to perform comparisons across different epidemic scenarios here we take advantage of this by applying the snes model to a large set of simulated networks representative of many different real world situations and to a set of animal contact networks representing potential encounters between field voles obtained from a mark recapture study davis et al 2015 with the aim to investigate to what extent network structure affects the outcome of an epidemic we found that when a broad range of network topologies is taken into account the epidemiological parameters of the model are in many cases less important than network structure in determining the magnitude of an epidemic outbreak of course when similar networks are considered as in the case of the field vole contact networks epidemic parameters and particularly transmission rate became fundamental to determine epidemic magnitude nevertheless even in the case of similarly structured networks topological properties still permit an accurate assessment of relative network vulnerability towards a given class of pathogens i e to pathogens whose spread can be modelled using similar epidemic parameters these findings can help improve preparedness when limited epidemiological information is available and a fast response for example in terms of prioritization is needed a situation that is expected to become ever more common in the future due to the growing globalization and the rapid emergence of new diseases 2 materials and methods 2 1 the synthetic network epidemic spread model snes at each time step any node i can be infected by nodes pointing towards or in the case of an undirected network connected to it according to a given probability τ s i with τ being the pathogen s transmission rate and s i being individual host susceptibility to the infection concurrently each node recovers with probability r i controlled by a parameter ρ varying in 0 1 and increasing with time since infection r i 1 1 1 t ρ due to the purely theoretical nature of this study the choice of the r i function is arbitrary this formulation of r i however permits a smooth transition from situations where the probability of recovery increases very slowly with time when ρ is close to 0 to opposite scenarios of fast recovery when ρ is close to 1 it is intuitive that the concept behind the snes model allows for maximum flexibility in the choice of r i t function making it possible to accommodate specific situations yet to avoid adding further complexity to our analyses and possibly complicating the interpretation of results we used the above formulation in all of our epidemic simulations the susceptibility of a node following infection becomes s i s i ι with ι being equal for all individuals since theoretically dependent on the pathogen and varying in 0 1 this accounts for a general property of immunizing diseases where individuals who have been infected and who have recovered are less likely to be re infected which is the basis of vaccination though we note there is variation with respect to immunity which is unaccounted for in these models e g waning immunity scherer and mclean 2002 interestingly analogies can be drawn for very different contexts such as that of information spread in social networks the probability that a person will share a piece of information will rapidly decrease when receiving the same piece of information again in the following we will refer to this process as immunization but it may also represent the path towards removal death of an individual corresponding to real world situations where repeated infections can be fatal as in the case of r i t s i ι can also be adjusted to fit specific hypotheses the parameters ρ and ι combine to control disease behavior for instance the extent of disease spread in terms of number of infected nodes these parameters also permit the model to be tuned to reflect typical epidemiological models such as si when ρ 0 ι 1 sis when ρ 0 ι 1 sir s when ρ 0 and ι 1 or to explore epidemic scenarios in a continuous and controlled way for example the snes framework makes it possible to track how epidemic outcomes compare between the si scenario to a typical sis scenario pastor satorras et al 2015 by progressively increasing the probability that a host will recover and become susceptible again additionally the snes model can also be easily adapted to more specific scenarios for example the addition of a simple rule controlling the lapse between the time a node is infected and the time it becomes infectious enables the snes to emulate compartment models that include latency such as the seirs which includes an exposed class we note that the snes is conceptually similar to a sirs model were the transition probabilities s i i r and r s are adjusted to particular values nevertheless by departing from the typical compartmental scheme the formulation of snes offers some advantages in terms of clarity in particular while the different typical compartmental models and possibly a tunable sirs focus on the possibility and probability of a host s transition from a health status to another and use this constraint to identify different epidemic categories on the basis of permitted and forbidden transitions the snes attempts to remove the boundaries between different models those in fact simply represent different regions of an ideal continuous three dimensional space defined by ρ ι and τ 2 2 generation of simulated networks we tested our model on 10 000 simulated networks to grow each network we selected at random a model between four different well known ones configuration model erdos renyi er barabasi albert ba and watts strogatz ws strogatz 2001 to build networks using the configuration model békéssy et al 1972 we selected a random exponent for the power law degree distribution varying between 2 and 3 in er networks we set the number of nodes v to a random integer in 50 500 and the number of edges to a random integer in v 1000 in ba networks we set the number of nodes to a random integer in 500 1000 and the number of outgoing edges generated for each node to v r 0 01 1 with v being the number of nodes and r being a random real number in 0 1 in ws networks we set the dimension of the lattice to 1 the size of the lattice along all dimensions to a random integer in 50 250 the distance within two nodes are connected to a random integer in 2 10 and the rewiring probability to a random real number in 0 1 in this way we obtained networks with a good variation in number of edges nodes connectance clustering and diameter fig 1 2 3 reciprocity instead of focusing on directed and undirected networks separately we applied the following conceptualization an undirected network is in fact a directed network where given any link connecting node a to node b a reciprocal link b a exists the relative abundance of reciprocal links determines how much a directed network differs from its undirected counterpart thus we generated all networks as directed and simple that is without loops and reciprocal links and then we added reciprocal links until reaching a preselected degree of reciprocity extracted at random in 0 1 with 0 corresponding to a directed network with no reciprocal links and 1 corresponding to an undirected network 2 4 real world contact networks to verify the validity of our results in real world situations we replicated the analysis also on a set of empirical networks all representing the same specific setting in particular we used mark recapture data of field voles microtus agrestis collected over 7 years in four different sites which we obtained from davis et al 2015 in the original study davis et al 2015 captures were performed at each of the four sites using 100 traps placed at the nodes on a regular grid of 5 m2 square cells trapping sessions were carried out every 28 days from march to november and every 56 days from november to march please refer to davis et al 2015 for a more complete description of the methodology and additional details starting from the raw data which included a unique identifier for each field vole individual caught in a trap at least once as well as the time day and location node in the trap grid of capture we built networks of potential contacts between voles by linking all individuals caught in the same cage or in two neighbouring cages i e at a distance smaller than 5 m on the same day we then retained only the networks including at least 100 edges in this way we built 296 networks with relatively small variability in their structural properties much smaller than that observed in the set of simulated networks see fig 2 2 5 unique robustness measure r besides basic network properties such as clustering connectance diameter number of nodes and edges and spectral radius of the adjacency matrix wang et al 2003 we also measured robustness as described in schneider et al 2011 for each network robustness is computed as r 1 n r 1 n q where n is the total number of network nodes and q is the fraction of nodes in the largest connected cluster after removing r nodes although this measure was developed in a completely different context in particular to assess the resilience of a network against node removal it is also closely related to the concept of percolation which has fundamental implications for studying epidemics moore and newman 2000 boguná et al 2003 serrano and boguná 2006 in its original formulation r was computed by removing nodes in decreasing order of their degree i e their number of connections the aim of sequentially removing nodes with the largest degree is to speed up the process of network disassembly hence obtaining a conservative estimate of robustness in the worst case scenario of node removal however it has been pointed out that other criteria going beyond local properties such as node degree could offer more efficient ways to disrupt networks morone and makse 2015 thus we used pagerank page et al 1999 to determine the order of node removal in the computation of r nevertheless we also tested the sensitivity of r as a measure of intrinsic vulnerability see section 2 10 to different criteria of node removal namely node degree and betweenness 2 6 node susceptibility to investigate the potential effect of individual node susceptibility s i on outbreak magnitude we replicated the experiment on simulated networks in two alternative scenarios in the first one for which we report results in the main text we attributed equal susceptibility 0 5 to all nodes in the network in the second scenario we attributed individual s i values to nodes by sampling them from a normal distribution with mean 0 5 and standard deviation 0 1 2 7 model runs for each model run we varied ρ and ι at random in order to produce very different scenarios ranging from situations where the probability of a node to recover from infection was very low ρ 0 and where immunization required several repeated infections ι 1 to situations of fast recovery ρ 1 and immunization ι 0 in all cases we set ρ 0 and ι 1 in order to produce contained epidemics we ran each model until the infection disappeared from the network in addition we varied at random the disease transmission rate τ between 0 1 in order to simulate different scenarios of pathogen infectivity we simulated 100 epidemics on each network starting from a randomly selected infected node and then averaging the results see next paragraph over the 100 runs for the set of real world networks we performed 10000 replicates by randomly selecting one of the networks in the dataset n 296 and by averaging the outcomes of 100 epidemic spreads 2 8 outbreak magnitude measures for each virus spread simulation we recorded five different measures of outbreak magnitude fig 3 defined as follows i epidemic persistence i e the total number of performed simulation steps until complete immunization ii epidemic breadth i e the fraction of nodes that have ever been infected over the total number of nodes iii epidemic peak i e the ratio between the maximum number of simultaneously infected nodes and the total number of nodes iv epidemic strength i e the mean fraction of infected nodes per step v epidemic area quantified as the area under the curve of the fraction of infected nodes over the total number of nodes vs simulation time rescaled to 0 1 although these measure are clearly not independent from one another they still indicate different aspects of outbreak magnitude and together can depict subtle differences between different epidemic events 2 9 statistical analysis we used canonical correlation analysis hair et al 2006 to compare the outbreak magnitude measures with the corresponding network structural properties and the epidemic parameters ρ and ι using the r package yacca butts 2016 we standardized all data to z values as x i μ σ with x i being the target value and μ and σ being respectively the average and standard deviation of the variable x i we evaluated the strength of canonical relationships using canonical roots and we used rao s f test to assess significance of the relationships mardia et al 1980 we evaluated the effects of dependent and independent variables on the respective canonical variates by examining cross canonical loadings and we used redundancy analysis to evaluate the amount of variance in the set of dependent variables explained by independent variables hair et al 2006 in both simulated and real world networks the redundancy values indicated that the first canonical dimension explained a consistent fraction of variance respectively 0 57 and 0 62 while the second canonical dimension added a limited contribution 0 04 and 0 05 thus in the main text we limited our discussion the canonical loadings of the first dimension 2 10 testing r as a measure of intrinsic vulnerability to assess the performance of the unique robustness measure as an estimator of intrinsic network vulnerability to epidemic spread for a given class of pathogens i e for pathogens whose spread can be modelled with similar epidemic parameters we first ranked all the field vole contact networks according to their r we then ran several sets of classical sir models pastor satorras et al 2015 under 100 different combinations of infection and recovery probabilities with both ranging from 0 1 to 1 with a step of 0 1 on all networks each scenario correspond to a particular class of pathogens for each network and model setting we replicated 100 epidemic simulations each starting from a randomly selected infected node averaging the total fraction of infected nodes throughout each simulation run this value was used to rank networks within each set of simulations i e for each combination of infection recovery probability finally we compared this rank with that provided by the unique robustness measure r networks for which the average fraction of infected nodes throughout the 100 simulations happened to be identical were ranked in random order 2 11 reproducibility all the scripts and data needed to replicate the analyses in the present paper and reproduce figures are made freely available at https github com giovannistrona network intrinsic vulnerability to epidemics 3 results and discussion we conducted a large experiment to compare the vulnerability of a wide range of network topologies fig 1 to a broad range of epidemic spread scenarios that we obtained by varying randomly the three epidemic parameters of the snes ρ ι and τ see section 2 in simulated networks the magnitude of epidemic outbreaks fig 3 was well explained by the combination of epidemic parameters and by network properties table 1 surprisingly topological properties and particularly the density of infection pathways quantified by network connectance and their redundancy quantified by network clustering that is how often two nodes pointing to another one are linked and by network robustness see below had a stronger effect on outbreak magnitude than the epidemic parameters when a broad range of network topology is considered fig 4 network robustness r resulted also more important than epidemic parameters and the second most important factor this result was very consistent in two different scenarios where we assumed respectively that all nodes had the same susceptibility to infection 0 5 or a random susceptibility extracted from a normal distribution with mean 0 5 and standard deviation 0 1 this suggests that outbreak magnitude is driven by average susceptibility more than by its variation across individuals thus we report and discuss here only the results referring to the first scenario we replicated the same procedure as was applied to the simulated networks using a set of real world networks the experiment with simulated networks explored a very broad range of network topologies and demonstrated how network topology affects epidemic outbreak magnitude even more than epidemiological parameters conversely for our test on real world scenarios we focused on a set of networks representing independent replicates of the same exact real world setting and that therefore exhibited a relatively low variability in their structural features fig 2 this permitted us to investigate if and to what extent small variations in network properties may be major determinants of epidemic outbreak magnitude even in this case where network topological variability was limited important epidemiological parameters such as the one controlling the duration of the infective stage ρ and the one modelling the immunizing effect of pathogens ι had a negligible effect in determining outbreak magnitude fig 4 transmission rate τ emerged as the most important factor although both network robustness and network connectance had very strong effects much higher than those of ρ and ι the other network parameters were less relevant and their effects were not always consistent with those observed in the set of simulated networks for example clustering was positively associated to epidemic magnitude in simulated networks but negatively associated in real world networks fig 4 which highlights how the dynamics and outcome of an epidemic event are affected by network structure in complicated ways that cannot be captured by individual basic network properties and that do not offer a straightforward interpretation in both experiments the unique robustness measure r schneider et al 2011 was consistently one of the most influential factors and positively associated with outbreak magnitude figs 4 5 the r measure is computed by counting the number of nodes present in the largest connected component after nodes are progressively removed thus representing the ability of a system such as a power grid or the internet to delay collapse after subsequent failures schneider et al 2011 in the context of epidemics r may offer a synthetic picture of the redundancy of infection pathways in a network with higher r a pathogen will have many chances to spread between nodes and will be less affected by the immunization of many nodes or their death leading in both cases to their removal from the network this finding has two important implications on the one hand it indicates that the networks where a potential outbreak is predicted to be strongest will also be the most difficult to protect since having a high r complicates immunization procedures based for example on targeted vaccination morone and makse 2015 on the other hand it suggests that r s ability to synthesize various aspects of network structure in a single value might make it a useful index to rank networks on the basis of their intrinsic vulnerability thereby offering a way to prioritize preparedness efforts by focusing preventive and surveillance actions on the most vulnerable networks this idea was supported by our experimental

the rank obtained by ordering networks on the basis of their vulnerability in a broad range of epidemic scenarios that we modeled by running a set of classical sir models pastor satorras et al 2015 under different combinations of infection recovery probabilities fig 6 adjusted r squared 0 59 p 0 00001 regression line y 0 77x 0 12 we quantified vulnerability in terms of the total fraction of nodes reached by the infection throughout the epidemic simulation see fig 3 ii this result is particularly convincing when considering the limited topological variability of the field vole contact networks see fig 2 which makes them a challenging benchmark to test the sensitivity of r as a vulnerability measure using different criteria of node removal to compute r namely node degree and betweenness led to very consistent results adjusted r squared 0 60 p 0 00001 regression line y 0 78x 0 11 when node degree was used adjusted r squared 0 61 p 0 00001 regression line y 0 78x 0 11 when

25267,the complexity and non linearity of increasingly available fisheries data requires modern analytical approaches and statistical tools that can accommodate the temporal and scale structures of natural systems traditional analyses often assume uncorrelated or weakly correlated temporal structure in fisheries data time series we propose that frequency and scale domain methods in the form of wavelet transforms can serve as useful probes in early investigations of fisheries data finding out the mechanisms underlying the changes in the diversity and abundance of fishes we used cross wavelet analysis with phase angle and coherency parameters to study the effect of discharge on the occurrence of silver carp larvae in a large subtropical river simulation studies show that the spectral signature given by the cross wavelet method provided a useful approach for statistically detecting and characterizing temporal dependency in the occurrence of fish larvae in addition our simulations provide an objective quantitative basis for understanding how river flow rate acts as a trigger for the occurrence of larvae and our results can be used to ecological operation silver carp larvae were found when discharge was greater than 104 m3 s 1 the flood peak persists for some days at least 2 days and can induce a peak in larval abundance our analyses also show that flood duration and the flood total volume decreased from 2006 to 2013 moreover the flood occurred earlier each year this may be why the period of most intense spawning the day of maximum larvae collected was earlier each year we conclude with a discussion about the role wavelet analysis may have in appropriately guiding flexible probabilistic models connecting fisheries with environmental covariates the wavelet approach is an especially promising tool for analyzing ecological data such as the relationship between hydrological conditions and fish larva occurrence keywords cross wavelet modelling fish larvae discharge time series analysis pearl river 1 introduction intensive regulation of large rivers has altered natural hydrological regimes with profound consequences for aquatic biota puckridge et al 1998 nilsson et al 2005 the impacts of flow regulating structures e g dams and weirs and changes to natural flow regimes on fish have been discussed worldwide gehrke et al 1995 pringle et al 2000 hu et al 2008 river regulation typically leads to a reduction in fisheries resources and in fish community diversity bice and zampatti 2011 the mechanisms underlying the varying diversity and abundance of fish has long been a perplexing problem for fish ecologists numerous mechanisms and models have been proposed to account for the decrease in fish resources including the impacts of human activities and climate change minns 2009 barange and cheung 2010 one of these theories states that freshwater fish population decreases are mainly attributed to the construction of dams which change the continuum of the rivers leading to changes of hydrology and flow and which also affects fish migration and reproduction sanchez et al 2011 the reproduction of riverine fishes can be linked to specific flow events the degree of variability of the flow regime at various temporal and spatial scales probably drives the reproductive strategies of riverine fishes humphries and lake 2000 some research shows that hydrological changes are among the most important factors for reproduction of the silver carp high flows before and during the spawning period were positively correlated with fish spawning unfer et al 2010 vilizzi 2012 most likely because of their specific habitat requirements humphries and lake 2000 overbank flood pulses and in channel flow pulses can enhance riverine fish production hardie et al 2007 especially for bream probst et al 2009 earlier studies costa pierce 1992 jankovic 1998 kocovsky et al 2012 reported that flood events as seen through water levels are important for spawning and for larval survival of the asian carps although considerable effort has been made to understand the effect of the flow rate on spawning these mechanism are still not very clear and in general there is an astonishing lack of consensus about the mechanisms behind the manner in which water discharge acts as a trigger for the occurrence of larvae time series analysis is a fundamental issue in ecology ghil et al 2011 the signals contained in time series datasets often reflect the results of the superimposition of various natural mechanisms these mechanisms may have different time characteristics and different scale patterns since the spawning type of most fish were single spawning and the spawning period are concentrated in a special time the number of larvae will be very large on a certain day and may be very small or even to zero on the second day so the fisheries time series data especially the larvae data are non linear and irregular for such data first order autoregressive and traditional statistical models such as correlation analysis principal component analysis linear regression redundancy analysis or any similar statistical tools may miss important features of the data because they can t do frequency decomposition cazelles and stone 2003 they are unable to retrieve the moment when the links are the most pre eminent the classical standard approaches to investigate such data by frequency decomposition is fourier analysis however a disadvantage of fourier analysis is that the window width is changeless and thus the time resolution is constant for all frequencies investigated here wavelet analysis has proven to be superior to analyze the time series locally in time and in scale another advantage of wavelet analysis is the flexible choice of the mother wavelet according to the characteristics of the time series investigated thus to analyze local correlations cross wavelet analysis may be seen as a very powerful technique wavelet analysis also called wavelet theory or just wavelets provides a way to conduct multi resolution analysis in non linear domains grinsted 2004 by visualising the decomposition of a signal into translated and dilated patterns which give the local contribution of a wavelet to the signal grenfell et al 2001 wavelets are specially adapted to the characterization of local structures and has been successfully applied in ecology polansky et al 2010 wang et al 2010 recknagel et al 2013 including studies of disease grenfell et al 2001 cazelles et al 2007 and population dynamics cazelles et al 2008 if the objective of a study is to find a relationship between two time series it is possible to compute the cross wavelet coefficient equivalent to the covariance for two time series it is also possible to provide the phase angle and the coherence this tool is very interesting and novel for ecological data series such as those used to analyze the effect of hydrological phenomena on the production of fish larvae with typical non linear and highly irregular fisheries time series data wavelet analysis has the unique advantage of being able to find out how two time series data are related in which period or which scale and can find out which is the dependent and which is the independent variable this cannot be done by traditional statistical methods such as correlation analysis to our knowledge no research has yet employed wavelets to analyze hydrological changes and fish larvae occurrence at the high temporal resolution of the data considered here such studies are important both to understand the mechanisms of fish spawning and for fisheries management wavelet analysis is less common in fisheries studies but see grados et al 2012 the objectives of this paper are 1 to find out the occurrence characteristics and the ecological conditions for silver carp larvae based on larval and hydrological data from 8 years of continuous monitoring in the pearl river china 2 to evaluate their relationship by using cross wavelet analysis and 3 to model how water discharge acts as a trigger for the occurrence of larvae our study paves the way for future research on this subject we believe that this work provides theoretical guidance for fisheries protection and management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study species the silver carp hypophthalmichthys molitrix cuvier and valencinnes cyprinidae hypophthalmichthyinae one of the traditional big four domestic carps is a large commercially important fish in china with its high productivity silver carp has been introduced to many other countries for various reasons milstein et al 2006 however the size of the wild silver carp population in china has decreased sharply in recent years the main reasons are the loss of spawning grounds or obstruction of fish migration caused by dam constructions changes of river flow regime overfishing hu et al 2008 duan et al 2009 tan et al 2010 silver carp is a typical filtering feeding ﬁsh and widely dispersed in the pearl river basin silver carp in the pearl river mature at about age 3 and spawn once a year typically migrating from middle and lower reaches to spawning ground in the upper reaches and tributaries the eggs are buoyant and drift downstream as they develop 2 2 study sites the pearl river is the longest river in southern china 2400 km and flows into the south china sea with a mean annual discharge of 3 3 1011 m3 the catchment area is about 453 690 km2 the seasonal flow regime of the pearl river is evident with high flows during summer with low flows during spring and winter the pearl river supports 381 fish species 262 freshwater species and 119 estuarine species tan et al 2010 the spawning grounds of silver carp are shown in fig 1 at the beginning of the flood season silver carp spawn and their larvae drift down into the delta tan et al 2010 our study site 23 2 40 n 112 27 5 e is located along the zhaoqing section in the pearl river 100 km upstream of the pearl river estuary fig 1 this location is a necessary place for larvae and drifting eggs transported to the pearl river delta in addition the water flow in this section is relatively slow which facilitates the larvae collection 2 3 data collection samples were collected three times a day 06 00 08 00 13 00 15 00 and 19 00 21 00 and once every 2 days at the whole year larval fish samples were collected with jiang nets of 0 5 mm mesh the jiang net were 2 m in total length and consists of a rectangle mouth formed by an iron frame loop with an area of 1 5 m2 1 0 m high and 1 5 m wide with a rectangular pyramid net and a filter collection bucket 0 8 m 0 4 m 0 4 m a flow meter was mounted in the mouth of the net to measure the volume of water filtered in order to calculate larval density number m 3 the nets were deployed in water 2 5 m deep space in 10 m far from the shore for sampling larval fish samples collected were immediately fixed with 5 formalin caudal vein melanophores distribution snout shape relative position of the dorsal and anal fins spines the fin ray and vertebrae counts are used to identify fish larvae to gain insight into fish stock composition larval fish collections were performed in this location from the year 2006 to 2013 water discharge data were obtained from the pearl river water conservancy commission we defined the spawning period as the days between the first and last spawning days in any one year the most intense spawning period was noted as the day of maximum larval collected that year the mean annual discharge of the pearl river is about 10 103 m3 s 1 zhang et al 2008 so we defined the flood duration as the days when the discharge was over than the mean value in this study we used the spearman rank correlation to evaluate the relationships between the spawning period changes and the flood duration changes 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 cross wavelet analysis we used cross wavelet analysis with phase angle and coherency parameters to study the effect of discharge on the occurrence of silver carp larvae wavelet analysis has attracted much attention recently for its ability to rapidly analyze changing transient signals grenfell et al 2001 cho and chon 2006 keitt and fischer 2006 kim et al 2006 downing et al 2008 keitt 2008 the evolution of the components over time can reveal a link locally in time between two signals allowing the quantification of a non stationary association for a specific time range farge 1992 torrence and compo 2010 in order to introduce the concept of scale and localization a wavelet function ψ t is considered see fig 2 we assume that the signal is composed of a sequence of structures a structure is a specific pattern like steps transitory signals or other local functions with different characteristic time lengths the scale structure refers to the duration of the phenomenon producing this structure see fig 2 the time series are seen as the superimposition of all the structures existing at the different scales the dilation or contraction of a pattern called the mother wavelet is performed fig 2 and a comparison with part of the series is made this method is able to analyze any type of time series regular or not continuous or not periodic or not considering the time t 1 t where t 0 and a mother wavelet ψ t satisfying the admissibility condition 1 t ψ t d t 0 we define the wavelet ψ m n for the m th scale and the n th time by ψ m n t 1 m ψ t n m m r n 1 t considering a time series or a signal f t the wavelet coefficient for the m th scale and the n th time is given by w m n f 1 t f t ψ m n t d t where denotes the complex conjugate the scale factor m may be seen as a dilation of function f while the number n is the time translation using wavelet analysis it is possible to define an analogy of the cross correlation with localization in time and scale if two time series present some common structures the high values of the cross wavelet coefficients highlight these structures in contrast when the two series have no relation cross wavelet analysis indicates weak coefficients the cross wavelet transform is useful to compare signals or to analyze common behaviour in two time series formally a first time series f t and a second g t both defined in the interval 1 t one may define the cross wavelet w m n f g by the wavelet coefficients inner product w m n f g w m n f w m n g grinsted et al 2004 maraun and kurths 2004 thus a cross wavelet coefficient is a complex number with an absolute value and an argument or phase angle 2 4 2 cross wavelet phase angle and coherency when cross wavelet coefficients are computed it is possible to define two new quantities the coherency and the phase angle maraun and kurths 2004 the coherency is the ratio of the energy of w m n f g by the product of the energy of w m n f and w m n g more precisely using a normalized smoothing operator in scale and in time the wavelet coherency is given by r m n f g w m n f g w m n f w m n g 1 2 coherency is 1 if the two series f and g are linearly dependent around the time n and at a scale m a zero value means no local cross correlation the wavelet coherency phase angle ϕ m n f g is the argument of the coefficient w m n f g it may be computed using the relation ϕ m n f g a t a n i w m n f g r w m n f g where for a complex number z c r z is its real part and i z its imaginary part we use the circular mean of the phase over regions with over 5 statistical signiﬁcance that are outside the coi cone of influence to quantify the phase relationship grinsted et al 2004 the circular mean of a set of angles ai i 1 n is deﬁned as a m arg x y with x x i 1 n cos a i and y i 1 n sin a i the phase angle describes the phase difference between the two series the shape of the time lag between the series a null phase angle means that the two waves are in phase i e they reach their maximum at the same time the phase angle is π when the waves are anti phased i e the first reaches its maximum while the second is at its minimum the phase angle is π 2 when the first series leads the second and is π 2 when the second series leads the first the coherency may be seen as the local correlation between the two signals in this study we used cross wavelets to analyze the links between discharge and larva numbers and infered the hydrological effects on numbers of larvae in the pearl river based on continuous records from 2006 to 2013 of fish larva samples and records of daily discharge instead of using the direct coefficient we examined the wavelet power spectrum wps to describe the distribution of energy the energy is the square module of the wavelet coefficients among hydrological changes and fish larvae wps is defined as 2 j w m n f 2 where j is the scale level the normalized stream flow data and the silver carp larva data were transformed using the morlet wavelet transform with the mother wavelet for the parameter k given by ψ k t π 1 4 e i k t e t 2 2 and we selected the 95 conﬁdence interval for wavelet power as signiﬁcance criterion the coherency and phase angle are evaluated to bear out the first analyses and complete the diagnoses all statistical analyses were performed with matlab 5 2 mathworks 3 results 3 1 the spawning characteristics of silver carp during the study period the earliest silver carp larvae occurrence was in april 2 2009 and the latest one was october 11 2008 the earliest day of spawning was not changed while the latest day of spawning occurred at an earlier date each year fig 3 this means the spawning period has been shortening over time the maximum horizontal width of the violin plots in fig 3 reaches from june 17 to august 10 this means the period of most intense spawning was earlier each year pearson rank correlation one tailed p 0 05 the spawning season mainly from june to august accounting for 85 41 of total annual spawning abundance june had the highest proportion of larvae was 34 91 of the total amount silver carp spawned varied among years occurring over three months in 2011 and seven consecutive months in 2008 these facts may be related to the hydrological variation that occurred in 2008 with more than 15 flood peaks while 2011 was a drought year with rare flood peaks 3 2 the wavelet power spectrum of silver carp larval abundance all silver carp larva data from 2006 to 2013 was analyzed by wavelet power spectrum the colours blue to red indicate the strength of energy from low to high high energy represents a high reproductive activity the wps shows a concentrated area with high energy closely consistent with fish spawning there is a similar energy time interval in the area below scale 32 in all years studied fig 4 this indicates that there was a similar periodic process that led to spawning each year the year 2008 exhibits a very bright color and a strong signal followed by 2013 meaning a particularly high reproductive behavior of the silver carp during these years in contrast the years 2007 and 2011 show a low level of wavelet energy indicating low reproductive behavior during these years 3 3 the wavelet power spectrum of river discharge the wps of daily discharge provided a highly compressed and integrative picture of the annual ﬂow features consistent with seasonal flows high energy represents high discharge around scale 12 there are several energy peaks during the years 2008 and 2013 indicating that several floods occurred during these years in conclusion that all the years show similar behavior the longest flood season was in 2008 lasting 107 days while the shortest one was in 2011 with 19 days fig 5 3 4 discharge level acting as a trigger for the occurrence of larvae production the seasonal flows and the occurrence of larvae from 2006 to 2013 are show in fig 6 we found the flood occurred earlier each year table 1 this may account for the period of most intense spawning larval collection peak being earlier each year fig 3 in addition flood duration was positively associated with the spawning period pearson correlation one tailed p 0 05 the cumulative daily current difference was positively correlated with the number of larvae table 1 pearson correlation 0 56 p 0 05 in order to find out how discharge acts as the trigger for silver carp spawning we used the wavelet coherency and the coherency phase angle analyzed the relationship between the occurrence of silver carp larvae and discharge the results are shown in fig 7 and table 2 the colours blue low energy to red high energy indicate the strength of association the highest coherencies are in red the lowest in blue the maximum of coherency is given by the annual scales the dominant of left to right arrows in 2006 2008 and 2013 indicate that the spawning peak occurred after the discharge peak and the lag time is about one quarter of wavelength the left to downright arrows in 2007 2011 and 2012 indicate the spawning peak lag the discharge between λ 4 and λ 2 there is an anti phased in 2010 this means discharge series is reaching its maximum while the fish larvae series is at its minimum the lag time between them is about λ 2 the specific lag time in each year is shown in table 2 this indicates that a common process links the amount of discharge and number of larvae and the occurrence of larvae always lag behind discharge suggesting discharge acts as a trigger discharge of over 104m3s 1 is the basic condition for the occurrence of silver carp larvae the flood peak which lasted for at least 2 days can induce massive spawning sudden flood rise or repeatedly hydrological fluctuations such as the flood peak persist for some days are the key factors to initiate an outbreak of silver carp spawning fig 8 4 discussion information on how river regulation influence the reproductive of fishes which is essential for river regulation and management has been scarce in the pearl river our results demonstrate that the number of larvae is related to hydrological changes their spawning follows the discharge and occurred after flood when greater than 1 1 104m3s 1 flood acts as a trigger for spawning our results also show that the breeding period the interval between the first and the last breeding days in a year tended to shorten and positively associated with the flood duration and the flood times besides the period of most intense spawning occurred earlier each year understanding the mechanisms that affect fish spawning is critical to the effective conservation of wild fish populations there is evidence that quantifiable relationships exist between hydrology and density of young fish a flood water velocity 0 7 m s 1 occurred in the lower illinois river a major tributary of the mississippi river and was found to stimulate the fish spawning costa pierce 1992 jankovic 1998 the hydrological changes facilitate their establishment persistence and dispersal in the lower illinois river flood pulses act as a trigger for dispersal and promote population expansion garvey 2007 2008 costa pierce 1992 showed that seasonal water temperatures 18 to 25 c increases in water levels 0 5 to 2 0 m in 24 h and current speeds 50 cm to 1m s 1 are important factors determining the establishment of silver carp populations from to field surveys zhang et al 2012 found that the construction of the three gorges dam tgd between the upper and middle reaches of the yangtze river had a dramatic influence on the abundance of fish larvae including silver carp larva that is spawning of silver carp has been delayed and suppressed moreover the abundance of larva and the drifting eggs of the four domestic chinese carps has declined greatly from 3590 million in 1997 to 105 million in 2005 duan et al 2009 the same phenomenon also occurs in the pearl river the inter annual abundances of the fish larvae also showed some variability shuai et al 2015 likely as a result of the construction of the changzhou dam at the end of the year 2007 upstream of the study site the construction of the changzhou dam changed the continuum of the pearl river modifying hydrology and flow and then affects the fish migration and reproduction most economically important fish species in the pearl river are affected by interannual river discharge variability tan et al 2010 especially migratory fish species and species who cast their drifting eggs in the running water such as silver carp wavelet transform is a promising tool that can be utilized in a variety of scientific fields such as signal processing image compression aerology ecology epidemiology and fisheries sciences it can overcomes the well known limits of classical statistics analysis cazelles and stone 2003 and played a key role in our study because of the shape of the data we studied indeed the discharge values are continuous data while numbers of fish larvae are discontinuous in time these two data sets are non linear and irregular traditional statistical methods may lead to erroneous results the cross wavelet analyses provided a novel solution the ability of the wavelet method to provide a coherent analysis allows us to highlight the link between the discharge and the number of silver carp larvae and to identify the lag between the discharge peak and the spawning time we were thus able to identify the role of the flow pulses in the spawning process our results pave the way towards increasing our knowledge of how the system works applied to fisheries data wavelet methods provide an objective quantitative basis for understanding how discharge affect fish spawning the use of wavelets highlights the relevance of a multi method framework to characterize multi scale relationships between the various components of aquatic ecosystem grados et al 2012 such as the correlation between captures and water surface temperatures and their oscillations polanco et al 2011 stock discrimination watkinson and gillis 2005 and fish catch forecasting rodríguez et al 2011 2014 the continuous wavelet transform cwt is a tool for extracting time localized information from tags data subbey et al 2008 it clearly overcomes the well known limits of classical statistics analysis cazelles and stone 2003 wavelet analysis is a relatively new technique and makes an important addition to standard signal analysis methods wavelet analysis uses quantitative partitioning of the variability of a time series in terms of time scales each scale represents a characteristic duration zolezzi et al 2009 are very useful for processing nonstationary signals unlike fourier analysis which yields an average amplitude and phase for each harmonic in a dataset the wavelet transform produces an instantaneous estimate or local value for the amplitude and phase of each harmonic whitcher et al 2000 this allows detailed study of non stationary spatial or time dependent signal characteristics newland 2012 wavelet analysis allows the possible correspondence between two parameters to be highlighted the nonparametric nature of wavelet analysis methods makes them particularly useful as initial statistical probes for detecting and understanding transient relationships between the occurrence of fish larvae and environmental factors such as discharge recently a wavelet based time series discrimination method has been developed by rouyer et al 2008 it classifies multiple more than two time series and thus offers a method for clustering groups of individuals based on shared time frequency properties as further data become available we anticipate that wavelet based approaches will be used to improve understanding about the nature of the effects environmental factors have on fish spawning e g both temperature and discharge the present study will have to be continued with more characterization and with other data the next step will be to forecast the fish population according to regulated discharge on the pearl river we suggest pursuing stochastic modelling of biological parameters with respect to environmental inputs to feed new stochastic models many data will be necessary with a daily sampling rate and over long periods wavelet analysis is such an excellent tool allowing for non stationarity but it still displays some shortcomings with respect to its use in ecology rouyer et al 2008 first the time and frequency locations of the wavelet spectra are not uncorrelated and the statistical inference is therefore difficult issartel et al 2015 second it remains difficulty to deal with a large number of shorter time series third the wavelet transformation at a point in time t0 always contains information of neighboring data points the number of these points depends on the chosen wavelet and the scale considered if the wavelet is centered close to the beginning or the end of the time series edge effects occur maraun and kurths 2004 although only 8 years of data were included in our study we believe that river flows both as discharge or flood pulses are factors that effectively control larva abundance in the pearl river at present dam construction in rivers is a common phenomenon it affects the natural hydrology and flow and then impacts the success of fishes for which spawning depends on the occurrence of hydrological pulses based on the results of this study we can propose a flow regulating method to reach the basic breeding flow during their breeding season on the other hand in many countries asian carps have become annoying invasive species in recent years their population expands quickly and extensively indicating favourable hydrological conditions for their spawning restraining the repeated flow fluctuations and the sudden flood rises by hydrological regulation would be a preferable method to control propagation of silver carp like regulating the salmonid population by control the flows in regulated rivers malcolm et al 2012 our study provides clues to understand how the phenomena affecting the breeding of the silver carp are crucial for fishery resource protection and river management besides understanding the breeding characteristics of the silver carp in its native range in order to control its excessive expansion is also of great significance 5 conclusion the wavelet approach is promising tool for analyzing ecological data such as the relationship between hydrologic condition and fish larvae occurrence the wavelet power spectrum reveals the fine structure of discharge and provides an extremely efficient tool with which to assess the relationships between changes in the hydrological parameters and the occurrence of larvae the wavelet method played a key role in our study because of the shape of the data we studied indeed the discharge values are continuous data while numbers of fish larvae are discontinuous in time these two data sets are non linear and irregular traditional statistical methods may lead to erroneous results the cross wavelet analyses gives a neat solution then the ability of the wavelet method to provide a coherent analysis allows us to highlight the link between the discharge and the number of silver carp larvae and to identify the lag between the discharge peak and the spawning time we were thus able to identify the role of the flow pulses in the spawning process in short the cross wavelet transform method is an excellent technique that study the interaction phenomenon between different components of a living system or between different living systems the cross wavelet transform method allows us to measure the degree of synchronization phenomenon between different components and conjointly the evolution over time of the studied phenomenon i e times series data set acknowledgements

25267,the complexity and non linearity of increasingly available fisheries data requires modern analytical approaches and statistical tools that can accommodate the temporal and scale structures of natural systems traditional analyses often assume uncorrelated or weakly correlated temporal structure in fisheries data time series we propose that frequency and scale domain methods in the form of wavelet transforms can serve as useful probes in early investigations of fisheries data finding out the mechanisms underlying the changes in the diversity and abundance of fishes we used cross wavelet analysis with phase angle and coherency parameters to study the effect of discharge on the occurrence of silver carp larvae in a large subtropical river simulation studies show that the spectral signature given by the cross wavelet method provided a useful approach for statistically detecting and characterizing temporal dependency in the occurrence of fish larvae in addition our simulations provide an objective quantitative basis for understanding how river flow rate acts as a trigger for the occurrence of larvae and our results can be used to ecological operation silver carp larvae were found when discharge was greater than 104 m3 s 1 the flood peak persists for some days at least 2 days and can induce a peak in larval abundance our analyses also show that flood duration and the flood total volume decreased from 2006 to 2013 moreover the flood occurred earlier each year this may be why the period of most intense spawning the day of maximum larvae collected was earlier each year we conclude with a discussion about the role wavelet analysis may have in appropriately guiding flexible probabilistic models connecting fisheries with environmental covariates the wavelet approach is an especially promising tool for analyzing ecological data such as the relationship between hydrological conditions and fish larva occurrence keywords cross wavelet modelling fish larvae discharge time series analysis pearl river 1 introduction intensive regulation of large rivers has altered natural hydrological regimes with profound consequences for aquatic biota puckridge et al 1998 nilsson et al 2005 the impacts of flow regulating structures e g dams and weirs and changes to natural flow regimes on fish have been discussed worldwide gehrke et al 1995 pringle et al 2000 hu et al 2008 river regulation typically leads to a reduction in fisheries resources and in fish community diversity bice and zampatti 2011 the mechanisms underlying the varying diversity and abundance of fish has long been a perplexing problem for fish ecologists numerous mechanisms and models have been proposed to account for the decrease in fish resources including the impacts of human activities and climate change minns 2009 barange and cheung 2010 one of these theories states that freshwater fish population decreases are mainly attributed to the construction of dams which change the continuum of the rivers leading to changes of hydrology and flow and which also affects fish migration and reproduction sanchez et al 2011 the reproduction of riverine fishes can be linked to specific flow events the degree of variability of the flow regime at various temporal and spatial scales probably drives the reproductive strategies of riverine fishes humphries and lake 2000 some research shows that hydrological changes are among the most important factors for reproduction of the silver carp high flows before and during the spawning period were positively correlated with fish spawning unfer et al 2010 vilizzi 2012 most likely because of their specific habitat requirements humphries and lake 2000 overbank flood pulses and in channel flow pulses can enhance riverine fish production hardie et al 2007 especially for bream probst et al 2009 earlier studies costa pierce 1992 jankovic 1998 kocovsky et al 2012 reported that flood events as seen through water levels are important for spawning and for larval survival of the asian carps although considerable effort has been made to understand the effect of the flow rate on spawning these mechanism are still not very clear and in general there is an astonishing lack of consensus about the mechanisms behind the manner in which water discharge acts as a trigger for the occurrence of larvae time series analysis is a fundamental issue in ecology ghil et al 2011 the signals contained in time series datasets often reflect the results of the superimposition of various natural mechanisms these mechanisms may have different time characteristics and different scale patterns since the spawning type of most fish were single spawning and the spawning period are concentrated in a special time the number of larvae will be very large on a certain day and may be very small or even to zero on the second day so the fisheries time series data especially the larvae data are non linear and irregular for such data first order autoregressive and traditional statistical models such as correlation analysis principal component analysis linear regression redundancy analysis or any similar statistical tools may miss important features of the data because they can t do frequency decomposition cazelles and stone 2003 they are unable to retrieve the moment when the links are the most pre eminent the classical standard approaches to investigate such data by frequency decomposition is fourier analysis however a disadvantage of fourier analysis is that the window width is changeless and thus the time resolution is constant for all frequencies investigated here wavelet analysis has proven to be superior to analyze the time series locally in time and in scale another advantage of wavelet analysis is the flexible choice of the mother wavelet according to the characteristics of the time series investigated thus to analyze local correlations cross wavelet analysis may be seen as a very powerful technique wavelet analysis also called wavelet theory or just wavelets provides a way to conduct multi resolution analysis in non linear domains grinsted 2004 by visualising the decomposition of a signal into translated and dilated patterns which give the local contribution of a wavelet to the signal grenfell et al 2001 wavelets are specially adapted to the characterization of local structures and has been successfully applied in ecology polansky et al 2010 wang et al 2010 recknagel et al 2013 including studies of disease grenfell et al 2001 cazelles et al 2007 and population dynamics cazelles et al 2008 if the objective of a study is to find a relationship between two time series it is possible to compute the cross wavelet coefficient equivalent to the covariance for two time series it is also possible to provide the phase angle and the coherence this tool is very interesting and novel for ecological data series such as those used to analyze the effect of hydrological phenomena on the production of fish larvae with typical non linear and highly irregular fisheries time series data wavelet analysis has the unique advantage of being able to find out how two time series data are related in which period or which scale and can find out which is the dependent and which is the independent variable this cannot be done by traditional statistical methods such as correlation analysis to our knowledge no research has yet employed wavelets to analyze hydrological changes and fish larvae occurrence at the high temporal resolution of the data considered here such studies are important both to understand the mechanisms of fish spawning and for fisheries management wavelet analysis is less common in fisheries studies but see grados et al 2012 the objectives of this paper are 1 to find out the occurrence characteristics and the ecological conditions for silver carp larvae based on larval and hydrological data from 8 years of continuous monitoring in the pearl river china 2 to evaluate their relationship by using cross wavelet analysis and 3 to model how water discharge acts as a trigger for the occurrence of larvae our study paves the way for future research on this subject we believe that this work provides theoretical guidance for fisheries protection and management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study species the silver carp hypophthalmichthys molitrix cuvier and

compare signals or to analyze common behaviour in two time series formally a first time series f t and a second g t both defined in the interval 1 t one may define the cross wavelet w m n f g by the wavelet coefficients inner product w m n f g w m n f w m n g grinsted et al 2004 maraun and kurths 2004 thus a cross wavelet coefficient is a complex number with an absolute value and an argument or phase angle 2 4 2 cross wavelet phase angle and coherency when cross wavelet coefficients are computed it is possible to define two new quantities the coherency and the phase angle maraun and kurths 2004 the coherency is the ratio of the energy of w m n f g by the product of the energy of w m n f and w m n g more precisely using a normalized smoothing operator in scale and in time the wavelet coherency is given by r m n f g w m n f g w m n f w m n g 1 2 coherency is 1 if the two series f and g are linearly dependent around the time n and at a scale m a zero value means no local cross correlation the wavelet coherency phase angle ϕ m n f g is the argument of the coefficient w m n f g it may be computed using the relation ϕ m n f g a t a n i w m n f g r w m n f g where for a complex number z c r z is its real part and i z its imaginary part we use the circular mean of the phase over regions with over 5 statistical signiﬁcance that are outside the coi cone of influence to quantify the phase relationship grinsted et al 2004 the circular mean of a set of angles ai i 1 n is deﬁned as a m arg x y with x x i 1 n cos a i and y i 1 n sin a i the phase angle describes the phase difference between the two series the shape of the time lag between the series a null phase angle means that the two waves are in phase i e they reach their maximum at the same time the phase angle is π when the waves are anti phased i e the first reaches its maximum while the second is at its minimum the phase angle is π 2 when the first series leads the second and is π 2 when the second series leads the first the coherency may be seen as the local correlation between the two signals in this study we used cross wavelets to analyze the links between discharge and larva numbers and infered the hydrological effects on numbers of larvae in the pearl river based on continuous records from 2006 to 2013 of fish larva samples and records of daily discharge instead of using the direct coefficient we examined the wavelet power spectrum wps to describe the distribution of energy the energy is the square module of the wavelet coefficients among hydrological changes and fish larvae wps is defined as 2 j w m n f 2 where j is the scale level the normalized stream flow data and the silver carp larva data were transformed using the morlet wavelet transform with the mother wavelet for the parameter k given by ψ k t π 1 4 e i k t e t 2 2 and we selected the 95 conﬁdence interval for wavelet power as signiﬁcance criterion the coherency and phase angle are evaluated to bear out the first analyses and complete the diagnoses all statistical analyses were performed with matlab 5 2 mathworks 3 results 3 1 the spawning characteristics of silver carp during the study period the earliest silver carp larvae occurrence was in april 2 2009 and the latest one was october 11 2008 the earliest day of spawning was not changed while the latest day of spawning occurred at an earlier date each year fig 3 this means the spawning period has been shortening over time the maximum horizontal width of the violin plots in fig 3 reaches from june 17 to august 10 this means the period of most intense spawning was earlier each year pearson rank correlation one tailed p 0 05 the spawning season mainly from june to august accounting for 85 41 of total annual spawning abundance june had the highest proportion of larvae was 34 91 of the total amount silver carp spawned varied among years occurring over three months in 2011 and seven consecutive months in 2008 these facts may be related to the hydrological variation that occurred in 2008 with more than 15 flood peaks while 2011 was a drought year with rare flood peaks 3 2 the wavelet power spectrum of silver carp larval abundance all silver carp larva data from 2006 to 2013 was analyzed by wavelet power spectrum the colours blue to red indicate the strength of energy from low to high high energy represents a high reproductive activity the wps shows a concentrated area with high energy closely consistent with fish spawning there is a similar energy time interval in the area below scale 32 in all years studied fig 4 this indicates that there was a similar periodic process that led to spawning each year the year 2008 exhibits a very bright color and a strong signal followed by 2013 meaning a particularly high reproductive behavior of the silver carp during these years in contrast the years 2007 and 2011 show a low level of wavelet energy indicating low reproductive behavior during these years 3 3 the wavelet power spectrum of river discharge the wps of daily discharge provided a highly compressed and integrative picture of the annual ﬂow features consistent with seasonal flows high energy represents high discharge around scale 12 there are several energy peaks during the years 2008 and 2013 indicating that several floods occurred during these years in conclusion that all the years show similar behavior the longest flood season was in 2008 lasting 107 days while the shortest one was in 2011 with 19 days fig 5 3 4 discharge level acting as a trigger for the occurrence of larvae production the seasonal flows and the occurrence of larvae from 2006 to 2013 are show in fig 6 we found the flood occurred earlier each year table 1 this may account for the period of most intense spawning larval collection peak being earlier each year fig 3 in addition flood duration was positively associated with the spawning period pearson correlation one tailed p 0 05 the cumulative daily current difference was positively correlated with the number of larvae table 1 pearson correlation 0 56 p 0 05 in order to find out how discharge acts as the trigger for silver carp spawning we used the wavelet coherency and the coherency phase angle analyzed the relationship between the occurrence of silver carp larvae and discharge the results are shown in fig 7 and table 2 the colours blue low energy to red high energy indicate the strength of association the highest coherencies are in red the lowest in blue the maximum of coherency is given by the annual scales the dominant of left to right arrows in 2006 2008 and 2013 indicate that the spawning peak occurred after the discharge peak and the lag time is about one quarter of wavelength the left to downright arrows in 2007 2011 and 2012 indicate the spawning peak lag the discharge between λ 4 and λ 2 there is an anti phased in 2010 this means discharge series is reaching its maximum while the fish larvae series is at its minimum the lag time between them is about λ 2 the specific lag time in each year is shown in table 2 this indicates that a common process links the amount of discharge and number of larvae and the occurrence of larvae always lag behind discharge suggesting discharge acts as a trigger discharge of over 104m3s 1 is the basic condition for the occurrence of silver carp larvae the flood peak which lasted for at least 2 days can induce massive spawning sudden flood rise or repeatedly hydrological fluctuations such as the flood peak persist for some days are the key factors to initiate an outbreak of silver carp spawning fig 8 4 discussion information on how river regulation influence the reproductive of fishes which is essential for river regulation and management has been scarce in the pearl river our results demonstrate that the number of larvae is related to hydrological changes their spawning follows the discharge and occurred after flood when greater than 1 1 104m3s 1 flood acts as a trigger for spawning our results also show that the breeding period the interval between the first and the last breeding days in a year tended to shorten and positively associated with the flood duration and the flood times besides the period of most intense spawning occurred earlier each year understanding the mechanisms that affect fish spawning is critical to the effective conservation of wild fish populations there is evidence that quantifiable relationships exist between hydrology and density of young fish a flood water velocity 0 7 m s 1 occurred in the lower illinois river a major tributary of the mississippi river and was found to stimulate the fish spawning costa pierce 1992 jankovic 1998 the hydrological changes facilitate their establishment persistence and dispersal in the lower illinois river flood pulses act as a trigger for dispersal and promote population expansion garvey 2007 2008 costa pierce 1992 showed that seasonal water temperatures 18 to 25 c increases in water levels 0 5 to 2 0 m in 24 h and current speeds 50 cm to 1m s 1 are important factors determining the establishment of silver carp populations from to field surveys zhang et al 2012 found that the construction of the three gorges dam tgd between the upper and middle reaches of the yangtze river had a dramatic influence on the abundance of fish larvae including silver carp larva that is spawning of silver carp has been delayed and suppressed moreover the abundance of larva and the drifting eggs of the four domestic chinese carps has declined greatly from 3590 million in 1997 to 105 million in 2005 duan et al 2009 the same phenomenon also occurs in the pearl river the inter annual abundances of the fish larvae also showed some variability shuai et al 2015 likely as a result of the construction of the changzhou dam at the end of the year 2007 upstream of the study site the construction of the changzhou dam changed the continuum of the pearl river modifying hydrology and flow and then affects the fish migration and reproduction most economically important fish species in the pearl river are affected by interannual river discharge variability tan et al 2010 especially migratory fish species and species who cast their drifting eggs in the running water such as silver carp wavelet transform is a promising tool that can be utilized in a variety of scientific fields such as signal processing image compression aerology ecology epidemiology and fisheries sciences it can overcomes the well known limits of classical statistics analysis cazelles and stone 2003 and played a key role in our study because of the shape of the data we studied indeed the discharge values are continuous data while numbers of fish larvae are discontinuous in time these two data sets are non linear and irregular traditional statistical methods may lead to erroneous results the cross wavelet analyses provided a novel solution the ability of the wavelet method to provide a coherent analysis allows us to highlight the link between the discharge and the number of silver carp larvae and to identify the lag between the discharge peak and the spawning time we were thus able to identify the role of the flow pulses in the spawning process our results pave the way towards increasing our knowledge of how the system works applied to fisheries data wavelet methods provide an objective quantitative basis for understanding how discharge affect fish spawning the use of wavelets highlights the relevance of a multi method framework to characterize multi scale relationships between the various components of aquatic ecosystem grados et al 2012 such as the correlation between captures and water surface temperatures and their oscillations polanco et al 2011 stock discrimination watkinson and gillis 2005 and fish catch forecasting rodríguez et al 2011 2014 the continuous wavelet transform cwt is a tool for extracting time localized information from tags data subbey et al 2008 it clearly overcomes the well known limits of classical statistics analysis cazelles and stone 2003 wavelet analysis is a relatively new technique and makes an important addition to standard signal analysis methods wavelet analysis uses quantitative partitioning of the variability of a time series in terms of time scales each scale represents a characteristic duration zolezzi et al 2009 are very useful for processing nonstationary signals unlike fourier analysis which yields an average amplitude and phase for each harmonic in a dataset the wavelet transform produces an instantaneous estimate or local value for the amplitude and phase of each harmonic whitcher et al 2000 this allows detailed study of non stationary spatial or time dependent signal characteristics newland 2012 wavelet analysis allows the possible correspondence between two parameters to be highlighted the nonparametric nature of wavelet analysis methods makes them particularly useful as initial statistical probes for detecting and understanding transient relationships between the occurrence of fish larvae and environmental factors such as discharge recently a wavelet based time series discrimination method has been developed by rouyer et al 2008 it classifies multiple more than two time series and thus offers a method for clustering groups of individuals based on shared time frequency properties as further data become available we anticipate that wavelet based approaches will be used to improve understanding about the nature of the effects environmental factors have on fish spawning e g both temperature and discharge the present study will have to be continued with more characterization and with other data the next step will be to forecast the fish population according to regulated discharge on the pearl river we suggest pursuing stochastic modelling of biological parameters with respect to environmental inputs to feed new stochastic models many data will be necessary with a daily sampling rate and over long periods wavelet analysis is such an excellent tool allowing for non stationarity but it still displays some shortcomings with respect to its use in ecology rouyer et al 2008 first the time and frequency locations of the wavelet spectra are not uncorrelated and the statistical inference is therefore difficult issartel et al 2015 second it remains difficulty to deal with a large number of shorter time series third the wavelet transformation at a point in time t0 always contains information of neighboring data points the number of these points depends on the chosen wavelet and the scale considered if the wavelet is centered close to the beginning or the end of the time series edge effects occur maraun and kurths 2004 although only 8 years of data were included in our study we believe that river flows both as discharge or flood pulses are factors that effectively control larva abundance in the pearl river at present dam construction in rivers is a common phenomenon it affects the natural hydrology and flow and then impacts the success of fishes for which spawning depends on the occurrence of hydrological pulses based on the results of this study we can propose a flow regulating method to reach the basic breeding flow during their breeding season on the other hand in many countries asian carps have become annoying invasive species in recent years their population expands quickly and extensively indicating favourable hydrological conditions for their spawning restraining the repeated flow fluctuations and the sudden flood rises by hydrological regulation would be a preferable method to control propagation of silver carp like regulating the salmonid population by control the flows in regulated rivers malcolm et al 2012 our study provides clues to understand how the phenomena affecting the breeding of the silver carp are crucial for fishery resource protection and river management besides understanding the breeding characteristics of the silver carp in its native range in order to control its excessive expansion is also of great significance 5 conclusion the wavelet approach is promising tool for analyzing ecological data such as the relationship between hydrologic condition and fish larvae occurrence the wavelet power spectrum reveals the fine structure of discharge and provides an extremely efficient tool with which to assess the relationships between changes in the hydrological parameters and the occurrence of larvae the wavelet method played a key role in our study because of the shape of the data we studied indeed the discharge values are continuous data while numbers of fish larvae are discontinuous in time these two data sets are non linear and irregular traditional statistical methods may lead to erroneous results the cross wavelet analyses gives a neat solution then the ability of the wavelet method to provide a coherent analysis allows us to highlight the link between the discharge and the number of silver carp larvae and to identify the lag between the discharge peak and the spawning time we were thus able to identify the role of the flow pulses in the spawning process in short the cross wavelet transform method is an excellent technique that study the interaction phenomenon between different components of a living system or between different living systems the cross wavelet transform method allows us to measure the degree of synchronization phenomenon between different components and conjointly the evolution over time of the studied phenomenon i e times series data set acknowledgements

25268,marine ecosystems are experiencing rapid changes driven by anthropogenic stressors which in turn are affecting human communities one such stressor is ocean acidification a result of increasing carbon emissions most research on biological impacts of ocean acidification has focused on the responses of an individual species or life stage yet understanding how changes scale from species to ecosystems and the services they provide is critical to managing fisheries and setting research priorities here we use an ecosystem model which is forced by oceanographic projections and also coupled to an economic input output model to quantify biological responses to ocean acidification in six coastal regions from vancouver island canada to baja california mexico and economic responses at 17 ports on the us west coast this model is intended to explore one possible future of how ocean acidification may influence this coastline outputs show that declines in species biomass tend to be larger in the southern region of the model but the largest economic impacts on revenue income and employment occur from northern california to northern washington state the economic consequences are primarily driven by declines in dungeness crab from loss of prey given the substantive revenue generated by the fishing industry on the west coast the model suggests that long term planning for communities researchers and managers in the northern region of the california current would benefit from tracking dungeness crab productivity and potential declines related to ph keywords atlantis california current dungeness crab food web modeling input output modeling ocean acidification 1 introduction the oceans are experiencing warming acidification eutrophication and other changes that are modifying marine ecosystems halpern et al 2008 ekstrom et al 2015 these modifications have consequences for human communities that rely on living marine resources much of the research focused on the impacts of novel stressors has investigated the responses of individual species e g cooley et al 2015 dueri et al 2016 vanderplancke et al 2015 however understanding how these changes scale up to impact ecosystems and ecosystem services such as fisheries catch and revenue is critical to setting research priorities and making strategic marine resource management decisions ecosystem scale research has begun to identify broad geographic regions most at risk from modifications of the environment kaplan et al 2010 ainsworth et al 2011 cheung et al 2011 barange et al 2014 however impacts on human communities often depend on localized ecological change making it critical to understand changes at a finer geographic scale ekstrom et al 2015 human communities are place based and benefit from distinct sets of species thus spatially heterogeneous variation in climate change impacts on those species can have socio economic consequences that vary across communities methods to understand the consequences of marine ecosystem change require an interdisciplinary approach bai et al 2016 that includes oceanographic conditions such as temperature and or ph at high resolution spatially explicit responses of the ecosystem to those conditions and the dependencies of local human communities on marine resources allison et al 2009 ocean acidification oa caused by increasing global carbon emissions is a stressor with both spatial and temporal variability that has the potential to restructure marine systems griffith et al 2011 branch et al 2012 le quesne and pinnegar 2012 marshall et al 2017 both calcifying and non calcifying species have been shown to respond directly to changing ph branch et al 2012 kroeker et al 2013 busch and mcelhany 2016 ocean carbonate chemistry varies globally orr et al 2005 friedrich et al 2012 and some regions are more at risk from oa than others because of a natural occurrence of low ph water from upwelling that is expected to be exacerbated by the effects of oa feely et al 2016 such regions include eastern boundary currents like the california current large marine ecosystem feely et al 2008 gruber et al 2012 the california current is an upwelling system with high spatial variability in oceanographic conditions king et al 2011 and seasonally low ph in nearshore environments feely et al 2008 gruber et al 2012 upwelling occurs in spring and summer bringing up low ph waters that create a temporal window of exposure to low ph that is expected to worsen with oa hauri et al 2013 latitudinally the california current can be divided into three regions king et al 2011 the northern region defined by the area north of cape mendocino or cape blanco is defined by strong winter storms and substantial freshwater inputs the regions south to point conception california and then beyond point conception experience higher levels of upwelling than in the north as indicated by the bakun cumulative upwelling index feely et al 2016 report the lowest surface ph in the central region and a model by hauri et al 2013 projected this region to have the most variable ph levels range 7 85 8 15 σph 0 1 and the lowest surface ph most months of the year though species in this system may have adapted to these heterogeneous conditions pespeni et al 2013 the natural occurrence of low ph waters can be problematic because future declines may push ph beyond species physiological tolerance thresholds fabry et al 2008 feely et al 2008 gruber et al 2012 the oceanographic heterogeneity in the california current will lead to heterogeneous exposure to low ph waters and thus spatial heterogeneity in ecosystem changes the california current supports a diverse food web and a multi million dollar fishing industry the direct ex vessel revenue from fisheries in the us portion of the ecosystem was worth over 450 million in 2013 pacfin 2013 fisheries catches and species composition are localized in time and space kaplan et al 2013b for instance fisheries in washington state are dominated by dungeness crab metacarcinus magister cancridae sardine sardinops sagax clupeidae pacific hake merluccius productus merlucciidae and shrimp family pandalidae while ports off southern california catch market squid doryteuthis opalescens loliginidae mackerel family scombridae sardine anchovy engraulis mordax engraulidae and nearshore urchins mesocentrotus spp strongylocentrotidae pacfin 2013 given the variability of target species and total landings between ports in the california current kaplan et al 2013b and heterogeneity of oceanographic conditions king et al 2011 hauri et al 2013 feely et al 2016 changes in catch from ocean acidification are likely to be regionally different based on localized changes in organism responses basin wide impacts have been projected in the california current kaplan et al 2010 marshall et al 2017 the southeastern australia marine ecosystem griffith et al 2011 and for the uk fernandes et al 2016 to our knowledge no work has estimated how oa may impact fisheries at finer spatial scales such as the port level here we explore spatially heterogeneous impacts of ocean acidification on species and fisheries in the california current we employ oceanographic predictions from a regional oceanographic modeling system roms model forced by an earth system model gfdl esm2m under climate scenario rcp8 5 an atlantis end to end marine ecosystem model fulton et al 2011 and an economic input output model leonard and watson 2011 we projected the state of the ecosystem in the 2060 s and described spatial variation in the marine species and human communities at risk the value of ecosystem models such as this is in long term strategic management and planning where path dependency means that actions now may influence the utility of measures into the future as well as research prioritization thus our work identifies where future research monitoring and management focus is needed by exploring the potential consequences of ph changes and vulnerabilities for port revenue income and employment in us west coast communities 2 methods 2 1 overview we used an ecosystem model to investigate the impacts of ocean acidification in the california current and consequences for fishing communities along the us west coast outputs generated by a fine scale ocean model provided physical forcing for the atlantis ecosystem model for the present and 50 years in the future outputs from atlantis were then passed to an economic input output model developed for the west coast of the us io pac leonard and watson 2011 a schematic diagram representing the modeling approach can be found in appendix a fig a1 because the io pac model and high resolution revenue data were only available for the us portion of the model we focused our economic analysis on the us west coast i e excluding canada and mexico we focused on the 17 us port groups on the outer coast excluding puget sound used by the pacific fisheries information network pacfin to aggregate data and avoid issues of disclosure of confidential information table 8 1 of appendix a in pfmc 2004 for all 17 port groups we simulated changes in catch revenue income and employment 2 2 summary of atlantis model we used the spatially explicit end to end ecosystem model atlantis fulton et al 2011 to simulate food web dynamics and fisheries atlantis represents ecosystem dynamics with three components i an oceanographic sub model ii an ecological sub model and iii a human dynamics sub model fulton et al 2004a b extensive documentation of the atlantis modeling framework for both the california current and other ecosystems can be found in previous publications fulton et al 2004a b kaplan et al 2010 2013a therefore we briefly summarize the most recent version of the atlantis model developed for the california current marshall et al 2017 including all three sub models highlighting changes we made explicitly to investigate spatial impacts of oa the physical domain of the atlantis model is represented by polygons which are defined by depth ranges and by longitudinal and latitudinal breaks our model includes 88 spatial polygons that span the entire domain of the california current from the northern extent of vancouver island canada and south to punta eugenia baja california mexico longitudinal polygon boundaries were based on bathymetry with breaks at 50 m 100 m 200 m 550 m and 1200 m and then finally at the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone eez fig 1 these breaks were chosen based on a mixture of bathymetric and biological information representing nearshore shelf deeper shelf shelf slope break see appendix s1 in marshall et al 2017 depth ranges of boxes within the model match the depths used to define bathymetric breaks 2 3 oceanographic model the atlantis model was forced with oceanographic outputs from an implementation of roms version 3 7 haidvogel et al 2008 moore et al 2011 with biogeochemistry fennel et al 2006 2008 configured to predict oceanographic conditions currents ph oxygen temperature salinity and nutrients for the present decade 2011 2020 and for a decade 50 years in the future 2061 2070 from these two runs we used a single year to represent current conditions 2013 and a single year to represent future conditions 2063 see further explanation below the two decade long runs were used as opposed to creating a full time series of downscaled oceanographic conditions between 2011 2070 because creating a 60 year time series of roms was too computationally intensive our implementation of roms has 10 x 10 km horizontal grid resolution includes tidal dynamics and uses global model outputs from the noaa geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl esm2m model with biogeochemistry topaz dunne et al 2012 dunne et al 2013 to derive surface forcing initial conditions and boundary conditions for the two simulated time periods the climate scenario used was rcp8 5 moss et al 2010 van vuuren et al 2011 which assumes continuation of current emissions trajectories in our case through the 2060 s we force atlantis with this rcp 8 5 scenario for two reasons first in comparison with our 2013 baseline scenario this bounds the potential changes we expect on the biogeochemistry of the california current by the 2060 s second global co2 emissions continue to rise with no clear evidence of a rapid reversal being likely locking in future change over the next few decades and approximating rcp 8 5 more closely than more moderate scenarios usgcrp 2017 the two time periods were run independently in roms in each case the first year january 1st 2011 and 2061 respectively was initialized through interpolation of the global ocean simulation results the esm2m topaz simulation scenario rcp8 5 this higher resolution roms model of oceanography for the california current was developed because upwelling in this region is not well resolved with global scale models orr et al 2005 and upwelling plays an important role in the development and spatial extent of oa this roms model does not represent nearshore environments inshore of 50 m with high resolution and therefore does not represent land based run off as a contributor to oa previous models for the southern california current have found expected ph levels of around 7 8 in nearshore surface waters by 2050 with heterogeneity in space by latitude and depth and seasonally gruber et al 2012 thus ph levels in this model are expected to be in a similar range further details on the roms implementation can be found in marshall et al 2017 and the associated appendices oceanographic conditions were extracted from the decade long roms runs and used to force atlantis now and in the future in each case a single year was taken from each roms run 2013 in the first instance and 2063 in the second because they were representative of the time period and then looped 100 times to achieve quasi stable forcing for the ecological model so as to achieve quasi equilibrium ecological conditions in atlantis this looping of a single year as opposed to implementing the full 10 year set of oceanographic conditions helped control for inter annual variability in ocean conditions 2 4 ecological model the atlantis modeling framework is a c code base that simulates multi species ecosystem dynamics in a spatial framework using a simple forward difference integration scheme typically on 12 hour time steps fulton et al 2004a c horne et al 2010 atlantis is 3 dimensional and spatially explicit with vertebrate numbers at age and weights at age tracked per polygon and invertebrates modeled as biomass pools per polygon the model simulates processes including primary production growth and reproduction trophic dynamics movement migration and habitat interactions within each polygon and depth layer these processes can be directly impacted by environmental conditions such as ph temperature oxygen and water flux from roms or other oceanographic forcing predator prey dynamics allow diet switching predator starvation and declines in predator weight at age if prey decline in abundance the most recent california current atlantis model includes 82 functional groups representing detritus 2 groups primary producers 6 groups benthic and pelagic invertebrates 25 groups fishes 36 groups marine mammals 10 groups and seabirds 3 groups this model is an update of the marshall et al 2017 model which was developed to better represent groups that are known to respond to low ph including pteropods dungeness crab coral coccolithophores and market squid all biological parameters used in the model reported in this manuscript such as recruitment mortality diets and distributions were the same as those used in marshall et al 2017 save for a few changes discussed below model calibration for the marshall et al 2017 version of the model was achieved in two phases initial simulations with no fishing and then secondary calibration with constant fishing pressure we followed best practices for calibration of this type of end to end model as described previously kaplan marshall 2016 we evaluated atlantis projections of seasonal and inter annual biomass trends spatial distribution vertebrate numbers at age and weights at age in a pattern oriented modeling approach grimm et al 2005 iterative manual calibration is the best possible current approach for these complex models for which simulations require hours to days of computing time tests of fishing pressure involved comparing species productivity as measured by fishing rates sustainable in the model to expected rules of thumb based on natural mortality rates kenneth et al 2001 walters martell 2002 in the course of calibration we made slight modifications to the model parameterization used by marshall et al 2017 with our focus on the spatial effects of oa on fisheries catch we modified parameter values for five of the 11 groups that declined to low biomass levels in the previous model under a baseline simulation i we made slight modifications to feeding efficiency parameters for dungeness crab nearshore sea urchins and an epibenthic predatory invertebrate group comprised of sea stars and large predatory snails and ii both feeding efficiencies and quadratic mortality rates were modified for market squid and pandalid shrimp dungeness crab pandalid shrimp and market squid are key invertebrate fishery species market squid in particular is a highly important fishery species in southern california making up over 50 of the biomass of catch for 5 ports in 2013 with these modifications we were able to ensure persistence of both market squid and pandalid shrimp and obtain more realistic biomass levels of dungeness crab along the entire coast however thirteen groups still declined to low biomass levels 2 starting biomass groups declining which also declined in marshall et al 2017 included deep demersal fish pacific ocean perch sebastes alutus sebastidae arrowtooth flounder atheresthes stomias pleuronectinae large demersal predators large pelagic predators chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha salmonidae pelagic sharks epibenthic predatory invertebrates and large phytoplankton groups which declined in our model and not in marshall et al 2017 included deep small rockfish small demersal sharks nearshore sea urchins and coccolithophores though the groups declining made up 17 of the functional groups in the model they represented only 2 of vertebrate biomass and 1 of consumer biomass and accounted for 7 5 of 2013 us west coast catch additionally crangon shrimp were found to have unrealistic increases in biomass and were removed from economic analyses they accounted for 0 1 of 2013 catch similar challenges with persistence in complex ecosystem models have been reported by others gaichas et al 2012 thorpe et al 2015 and remain a substantial challenge in large multi species models with our primary focus on effects on fisheries catch the declining groups were not expected to greatly impact outputs though future modeling efforts can work to increase persistence across groups 2 5 fisheries parameterization fishing mortality for each functional group was set at a constant rate e g 0 05 yr 1 such that the catch metric tonnes in the first year of the model would match the 2013 catch data from pacfin our us catches were allocated spatially to 17 port groups hereafter called ports along the coast with one additional fishery each for canada and mexico fig 1 spatially explicit fishing mortality rates per port or country and functional group were then applied as constant fishing rates see appendix a this assumes no management responses or shifts in regimes and or fishery behavior in the future while this is unrealistic it allows for consideration of oa effects without the confounding socioeconomic dynamics which would make attribution incredibly difficult us vessels were assumed to have access to coastal nearshore areas within 200 km of the homeport the main city in the port and equal access to areas offshore to 1200 m depth canadian and mexican fishing mortality rates were applied equally to all canadian and mexican areas in the model domain respectively though our atlantis model projects port level catches each of these ports has catch from a mix of vessel types table 1 the categories used to classify vessels were originally defined in leonard and watson 2011 the vessel categories have distinct target species economic characteristics and subsequent vulnerabilities to ocean acidification the port level catches were allocated to the vessel types based on the proportion of catches per vessel type reported in pacfin in 2013 we report results for 10 vessel types that primarily harvest groups well represented by atlantis biomass dynamics nine other vessels types depend substantially on species that are poorly represented in the base atlantis simulations i e functional groups that do not persist and these were aggregated into a generic coast wide fishery the catch metric tonnes landed at each port was converted to total revenue using 2013 price per pound data pacfin 2013 prices were found for each functional group at the resolution of vessel type and port these prices were multiplied by biomass to find total revenue by 1 vessel type at each port and 2 functional group at each port 2 6 input output models implan and io pac we used an input output io model leontief 1951 to investigate changes in income and employment resulting from changes in ex vessel fisheries revenue here and in previous work kaplan and leonard 2012 we use io models to estimate direct indirect and induced effects direct effect refers to the change in production such as impacts at the level of the vessel indirect effect refers to secondary activity caused by changing input needs of directly affected industries e g changes in fleet revenue may cause a decline in output from shipyards that service those vessels induced effects are caused by changes in household spending from additional income generated by direct and indirect effects the northwest fisheries science center s input output model for pacific coast fisheries io pac was designed to estimate the gross changes in economic contributions and economic impacts resulting from policy environmental or other changes that affect fishery harvest leonard and watson 2011 the io pac was constructed by customizing impact analysis for planning implan regional input output io software implan pro 2012 mig inc hudson wisconsin development of io pac included customizing implan with an addition of 19 commercial fishing vessel types the present application used a version of io pac that was developed to include the 17 ports in the atlantis model and the subset 10 of the 19 fishing vessel types for which spatial catches were tracked table 1 economic impact estimates in io pac include the effects of changes in fish harvest on income and employment by harvesting vessels and processors at the scale of port and vessel type there are three major assumptions of io pac 1 supply of outputs is not constraining an increase in demand such as demand by the fishing sectors for engine maintenance is always met by an increase in supply for the commodity or service demanded 2 prices of commodities such as processed fish and factors of production such as diesel fuel are fixed and here are denominated in 2013 dollars 3 there is no substitution in either production or consumption which means that a fishery sector will always require the same set of inputs diesel ice etc to land a dollar s worth of fish similarly households always purchase the same set of commodities in the same proportions 2 7 functional group responses to ph for this analysis 10 functional groups were assumed to respond directly to ph groups were chosen based on a review of 393 papers on sensitivity of species in temperate oceans to carbon chemistry and a tailoring of species sensitivity estimates to the california current busch and mcelhany 2016 table 2 these were the same 10 groups affected by ph in the cumulative scenario in marshall et al 2017 and had the strongest negative responses to ocean acidification according to the review by busch and mcelhany 2016 functional group sensitivity was translated into species response through parameterizing ph induced mortality additional to any linear or quadratic mortality all response curves were parameterized such that there was no ph induced mortality above ph 8 0 and mortality linearly increased with declines in ph declines in ph would be felt by a species based on their spatial distribution polygons in which they inhabit and the ph in that region the threshold of 8 0 was chosen because average ph in the region in present day conditions start just under 8 0 at 7 95 the rate of decline slope of the curve was set such that the most sensitive group experienced an additional 10 total annual mortality rate for one unit change in ph from 8 0 to 7 0 as depicted in marshall et al 2017 fig s3 all other functional groups ph response slopes were scaled against that group using scaling parameters provided by busch and mcelhany 2016 marshall et al 2017 tested atlantis model output sensitivity to mortality rates up to 10 times higher and found the directions of impact either in the positive or negative direction of species responses were largely insensitive to higher mortality rates two sets of oceanographic outputs described above were used to run three 100 year atlantis scenarios isolating the effects of ph and removing the impacts that may have been caused by changes in temperature the three atlantis scenarios included two baselines using 2013 and 2063 oceanography referred to as 2013baseline and 2063baseline where no species responded to ph and a third run with 2063 oceanography where species responded to ph referred to as 2063phmortality we calculated the effect size for each functional group as the difference in biomass for the scenario with 2063 conditions with and without ph mortality turned on 2063phmortality and 2063baseline respectively standardized by the biomass predicted in the 2013 runs 2013baseline using the following metric 1 e i b 2063 p h m o r t a l i t y i b 2063 b a s e l i n e i b 2013 b a s e l i n e i biomass values used were an average over the final 10 years of the 100 year model run representing quasi equilibrium values under the oceanographic conditions used this approach was used to remove the influence of other oceanographic changes such as temperature over the 50 years so that results are an indication of the sole influence of ph although biological responses to changes in temperature and oxygen levels are expected to be substantial shaffer et al 2009 barange et al 2014 fernandes et al 2016 they were not the focus of our analysis revenue changes were calculated at the finest resolution of functional group by vessel type and port multiplying biomass by price 2 r i j k r p i j k b i j k r where ri j k r is functional group revenue calculated directly as the total biomass landed at the port bi j k r multiplied by the price per unit biomass pi j k for group i at port j for vessel type k and for model run r where the run can be 2013baseline 2063baseline or 2063phmortality we investigated revenue outputs at three scales 1 total port revenue rp 2 revenue by port and vessel type rf and 3 revenue by port and functional group rs the effect size on revenue was calculated in the same way as for biomass the difference between revenue under 2063 conditions with and without ph mortality standardized by 2013 revenue we report changes in biomass and revenue only for effect sizes greater than 0 2 this is the convention with large ecosystem models which are best used to reveal large vulnerabilities rather than fine grained projections fulton et al 2011 fulton et al 2014 collie et al 2016 and because a difference of less than 20 would be lost in the observation noise of most ecosystem processes further economic analysis was performed using multipliers from the io pac model to consider direct indirect and induced effects on income and employment multipliers for fisheries revenue and processor effect at each port were used for example income effects i for a single port j were the product of revenue outputs by vessel type k and port and the two multipliers 3 i j r j 1 j 17 r f j k r m i d j m i p j where mi d j is the economic multiplier for revenue for income at port j and mi p j is the multiplier for the processor effect on income at port j the employment produced ej r was calculated the same way using me d j and me p j the effect size on income and employment was calculated as the difference between scenarios in 2063 and standardizing by 2013baseline three ports do not have processors brookings crescent city and bodega bay thus those ports only had mi d j and me d j 3 results 3 1 changes in biomass demersal functional groups were most affected by changes in ph sixteen functional groups experienced biomass effect sizes of 0 20 or greater affected groups included invertebrates and demersal fishes fig 2 we categorize functional groups according to three classes of response functional groups with substantial changes magnitude 0 2 that varied regionally groups with substantial but spatially consistent changes and groups with no substantial change 0 2 we focus on functional groups with regional variability and then briefly touch on the last two classes most invertebrate responses varied by region but the patterns of responses were unique to each functional group excluding pandalid shrimp fig 2 for species directly responding to ph the variation was largely driven by local ph values on average ph declined the most between northern california and vancouver island although species exposure to ph was dependent on the ph projected in the roms model within the species latitudinal range and depth distribution while dungeness crab experienced the lowest ph in canadian waters other species e g benthic herbivorous grazers and deposit feeders experienced the lowest ph in southern california fig 2 as a result species responses to lower ph values do not consistently match what might be expected from observations feely et al 2016 that the lowest ph and most severe effects would occur between northern california and oregon rather proportional effects on some functional groups were more substantial in the southern portion of the model with the size of response scaling with the slope of their ph mortality curve table 2 notably the crab group excluding dungeness had heterogeneous responses across space likely due to low biomass near 7 of starting biomass creating higher sensitivity to small differences between 2013 and 2063 declines in benthic herbivorous grazers bivalves deposit feeders and benthic carnivores were not only from direct effects of changing ph but also from indirect food web effects via changes in predator prey dynamics appendix b table b1 other invertebrates indirectly responded to declines in ph in heterogeneous patterns resulting primarily from changes in predator and prey biomass levels groups with indirect declines meiobenthos gelatinous zooplankton microphytobenthos and black corals all responded in limited geographical regions southern portion of the model with meiobenthos and gelatinous zooplankton experiencing changes in predation biomass increases for pandalid shrimp and microzooplankton neither of which responded directly to ph resulted from a release from predation dungeness crab were a unique case they were parameterized to respond directly to declines in ph but the realized impact resulted almost entirely from indirect effects of changes in prey availability appendix b table b1 this impact was most substantial off of oregon and northern california fig 2 but also led to declines in dungeness crab biomass off canada and washington state ninety percent of the dungeness crab biomass in the model is in these northern regions and we did not see the same substantial declines of dungeness crab in southern regions five functional groups exhibited consistent changes across the model domain there were four declining fish groups petrale sole eopsetta jordani pleuronectinae dover sole microstomus pacificus pleuronectinae cowcod sebastes levis sebastidae and deep large rockfish whereas pandalid shrimp increased fig 2 the four fish groups declined due to decreases in prey abundance that were substantial enough to create a consistent effect across all six regions all four fish groups consumed benthic invertebrates that declined benthic herbivorous grazers bivalves and crangon shrimp not shown in fig 2 but had 19 decline pandalid shrimp are preyed upon by both dover sole and deep large rockfish in the model such that biomass declines in these two fish groups may have caused release from predation on pandalid shrimp making increases constant across space groups that did not respond 0 2 included four of the functional groups parameterized to respond directly to declines in ph mesozooplankton pteropods shallow benthic filter feeders and crangon shrimp as well as pelagic fishes mammals sharks and seabirds it is likely that for groups parameterized to respond to ph that did not change substantially a combination of high productivity and release from predation were able to counteract direct effects from induced mortality 3 2 spatial economic impacts simulated revenue from catch in our base scenario 2013baseline mostly matched recent revenue composition for 2013 from the pacfin records 15 of 17 ports with exceptions driven by biomass trends in the simulations appendix c table c1 port revenue from sablefish anoplopoma fimbria anoplopomitidae and pacific hake was consistently lower in our atlantis simulations than in 2013 landings data atlantis projections for north coast wa fort bragg ca and san diego ca did not accurately represent 2013 landings as all three ports have substantial landings of species that declined in abundance in baseline atlantis simulations simulated revenue per port ratio of simulated revenue to revenue from pacfin ranged from 0 4 to 1 48 mean 1 07 sd 0 39 appendix c table c2 simulated revenue was lower than baseline records at ports between crescent city and san francisco ca due to the model projecting lower dungeness crab abundance in those regions in comparison simulated revenue was higher than 2013 records in the southern california ports highly dependent on market squid which were projected to increase in biomass over the course of the present day simulation of the 16 major fishery target groups i e groups which comprise 90 of the model port revenue one quarter had a substantial change in revenue rs 0 2 in response to projected ph fig 3 indirect food web effects drove these changes declines in revenue were dominated by declines in dungeness crab with effect sizes between 0 42 and 1 0 at the nine u s ports north of fort bragg ca see fig 2 caption for explanation of changes greater than 1 0 a number of ports experienced an increase in revenue from pandalid shrimp consistently a 0 3 effect size seven ports experienced an effect size of 0 27 from declines in petrale sole some in the southern region fig 3 three ports in oregon and northern california experienced declines in revenue from dover sole with an effect size of 0 39 substantial port level revenue changes rp 0 2 occurred at ports north of fort bragg ca that had a large proportional reliance on dungeness crab and flatfish figs 3 and 4 the most substantial declines occurred where there was both large reliance on dungeness crab 50 of revenue and where crab biomass declined most severely oregon and northern california tillamook experienced the largest decline in revenue as a result of declines in ph due to dungeness crab which made up 97 3 of revenue in 2013baseline see impacts by functional group in fig 3 in pacfin dungeness crab made up 86 3 of revenue for tillamook in 2013 appendix c table c1 some ports experienced relief from dungeness crab declines with increases in pandalid shrimp revenue most notably for coos bay oregon with equivalent reliance on dungeness crab and pandalid shrimp appendix c table c1 though dover and petrale sole both declined neither had a strong influence on port level revenue changes as they made up a smaller proportion of port revenue 5 0 8 5 and 4 0 19 8 reliance on dover and petrale sole respectively the eight ports that did not experience declines greater than 0 2 nonetheless experienced modest declines in catch and revenue appendix d table d1 income and employment impacts of oa reflected revenue impacts at the port level with the effect on employment at times more exaggerated than the effect on revenue and income fig 4 this exaggeration is a result of differences in the income versus employment multipliers by vessel type for example crescent city has catch from four vessel types fig 5 the income multipliers for these four vessel types are similar appendix d whereas the multipliers for employment are higher for crabbers and other groundfish fixed gear than for large groundfish trawlers and shrimpers therefore employment declined more strongly 0 71 than revenue and income 0 58 and 0 59 appendix d when revenue for crabbers was reduced eureka in contrast had similar impacts across revenue 0 37 income 0 36 and employment 0 37 because multipliers were similar across vessel types landing catch at this port parsing port level revenue to vessel type suggests that nine of the ten vessel types will experience a decline 0 2 in at least one port fig 5 the widespread impacts across vessel types reflect the fact that each vessel type fishes for many species throughout the year thereby enhancing the likelihood that the catch composition of any single vessel type will include one or more species that is adversely affected by oa for instance hake trawlers sablefish fixed gear vessels and crabber vessels all catch a mixture of species with dungeness crab making up a substantial proportion of revenue in our model with pacific hake and sablefish both declining over the 100 year spinup of 2063 conditions hake trawlers and sablefish fixed gear vessels relied more strongly on dungeness crab than might be expected nonetheless in oregon and washington from brookings north these three vessel types and large trawlers show the most detrimental effects from oa despite crabber vessels experiencing some relief from increases in pandalid shrimp in the south diver vessels experienced declines in a variety of targeted species appendix c table c3 however this outcome may be confounded by the difficulty we had in maintaining initial densities of nearshore urchins during baseline model calibration see methods section 2 4 4 discussion though increasing focus has been placed on understanding the economic consequences of climate change cooley and doney 2009 barange et al 2014 punt et al 2014 falkenberg and tubb 2017 or the resulting vulnerability of species and human communities ekstrom et al 2015 hare et al 2016 such work is frequently at the ecosystem scale which is a coarser spatial scale than is relevant for many stakeholders and managers here our modeling framework used a meaningful spatial resolution to project regionally varying biological and economic impacts of ocean acidification within the california current the model projects that the largest economic consequences may occur for central and northern west coast ports that rely on demersal species for a large portion of fisheries catch in particular dungeness crab short of immediate global actions to dramatically reduce co2 emissions highly vulnerable ports and fisheries will need to consider resilient responses such as establishment of marine reserves reductions in nutrient loading washington state blue ribbon panel on ocean acidification 2012 or an emphasis on robust management flexible and diversified fisheries and increased monitoring pinsky and mantua 2014 schindler and hilborn 2015 the atlantis model is best suited to questions of strategic management and exploration of ecosystem dynamics fulton et al 2011 we use the model in the spirit of scenario analysis a common approach used by businesses and organizations to explore possible future pathways with a recognition that there are large uncertainties when projecting forward in time postma and liebl 2005 amer et al 2013 the value of taking this approach is discussed further below the geographic variability of impacts found here resulted from the high resolution in the three components of our modeling framework the roms model the spatially explicit ecosystem model and the spatially resolved fishing revenues used in an io model additional scenarios either through different models different configuration of this same model or other types of scenario assessment will more fully scope vulnerable species and communities peterson et al 2003 indirect food web effects that varied with space reflect the complex predator prey interactions and detailed species distributions that the atlantis model can represent large scale analyses of the effects of climate change frequently include either food web dynamics ainsworth et al 2011 barange et al 2014 or high spatial resolution cheung et al 2010 cheung et al 2011 fernandes et al 2016 but not both atlantis provides the ability to consider spatially variable indirect food web effects from changing oceanographic conditions this high spatial resolution has often not been fully utilized in previously published atlantis analyses that have summarized findings at a coarser resolution kaplan et al 2010 fulton 2011 griffith et al 2011 marshall et al 2017 while some users within management agencies may directly utilize some of the finer scale information existing publications tend to remain at the broad spatial scale model outputs presented here support results from griffith et al 2011 suggesting that demersal species are most at risk from oa griffith et al 2011 using an atlantis modeling framework found substantial indirect impacts of oa on demersal fishes including demersal sharks shallow macrozoobenthos cephalopods and benthic filter feeders in the california current kaplan et al 2010 found very strong indirect effects on flatfish namely english sole parophrys vetulus yellowtail rockfish sebastes flavidus and arrowtooth flounder unlike kaplan et al 2010 where most of the indirect effects appeared to be on demersal fishes marshall et al 2017 and this paper found strong indirect effects on dungeness crabs these differences in model outcomes are not unexpected given that the kaplan et al 2010 and the present model had different functional group structures in contrast to the demersal community consumers in the pelagic community pelagic fishes marine mammals and seabirds experienced only small indirect effects in our model consistent with previous results our work and that of marshall et al 2017 highlight the importance of integrating vulnerability information for an individual species from a variety of methodologies to understand potential impacts across ecological scales from physiological to population responses for instance previous work on dungeness crab has provided mixed results regarding oa lab studies have shown that lowered ph reduces larval survival and slows development rates miller et al 2016 in contrast a population vulnerability assessment integrating across life stages showed that the overall population may have low vulnerability even with high larval vulnerability hodgson et al 2016 here we see that although direct effects from ph induced mortality are insubstantial in our model indirect food web effects loss of prey made dungeness crab populations quite vulnerable that declines in fishery revenue are so dependent on this species warrants future attention on details of dungeness crab vulnerability and vulnerability of their primary prey resources finally the variability in ph conditions and resulting ecological impacts was driven in part by the oceanographic model roms there are a number of methods simpler than computationally intensive dynamical downscaling through roms however each alternative method has limitations for instance initial insights into the ecosystem impacts from oa using atlantis employed a uniform mortality rate for groups assumed to be impacted by declines in ph kaplan et al 2010 griffith et al 2011 alternatively direct use of global circulation models gcms is possible but has limited utility in the california current because they currently do not resolve upwelling regions from eastern boundary currents gruber et al 2012 nor tidal forces on the continental shelf ådlandsvik and bentsen 2007 thus using these models directly for projections of oa in the california current is not yet ideal statistical downscaling is an alternative option but is limited in the number of oceanographic variables produced and assumes that relationships between current climate conditions correlations between oceanographic variables hold under future climate conditions which may or may not occur ekström et al 2015 given these varying limitations roms was used here as it provides high resolution output that resolves upwelling and includes numerous oceanographic parameters the drawback to this approach was that it necessitated considering potential end point outcomes rather transitory effects 4 1 management applications while this initial analysis was constrained by available inputs to considering a single scenario it does form a solid basis for identifying vulnerable species and ports that warrant further scientific and management focus as evidenced by some of the counter intuitive results and the high heterogeneity found here simply relying on common sense mental extrapolation is not appropriate in path dependent instances such as natural resource management and planning consequently even uncertain results can provide useful insights and starting points for discussions planning and strategic research prioritization output from other atlantis ecosystem models has been used to inform strategic management questions and outputs from the present work have the potential to fit into existing management efforts within the u s for example in australia atlantis has been used as part of management strategy evaluation exercises to compare different management levers in the process of restructuring south eastern australian federal fisheries fulton et al 2011 it has also been used alone or in combination with other models to inform the australian government of ecosystem responses to climate change fulton and gorton 2014 fulton et al 2018 within the u s there has been an increasing focus on both developing climate change strategies and understanding risk to different regions of the coastline to improve resilience and reduce the impact of forthcoming change one of the seven objectives in the noaa national marine fisheries service nmfs climate science strategy is to develop future projections specifically at regional scales that are relevant to management busch et al 2016 similarly the west coast ocean acidification and hypoxia science panel note the importance of both higher spatial resolution in model outputs and the need for coupling biophysical and ecosystem models to improve our understanding of potential outcomes chan et al 2016 thus outputs from this work can feed into these management priority areas and can be used in conjunction with alternative methodologies such as the nmfs climate vulnerability assessments noaa nw sw fisheries science centers 2016 within this advisory context it is important to recognize that the results presented here represent a single instance of how ocean acidification may impact the biology and economics of the coastline bordering the california current as with any highly parameterized and complex ecosystem model it is important to consider the results in conjunction with an ensemble of other models that use different assumptions and modeling frameworks we are hopeful that future ensemble projections will build on this current work and provide alternative scenarios and projections so that we can gain a fuller picture of possible future vulnerabilities within the system however the reality that more models are needed does not diminish the utility of this approach because in taking steps towards understanding vulnerability within the california current to oa there is a need to go beyond mental extrapolation and tangibly build on past information 4 2 uncertainties and limitations given the constrained nature of the work presented here it is important to be explicit about the associated uncertainties and limitations while model complexity is useful in providing higher resolution outputs and more explicitly dealing with a broader range of specific processes it also introduces uncertainty cheung et al 2016 a number of elements regarding model uncertainty as defined by hawkins and sutton 2009 and cheung et al 2016 were addressed in marshall et al 2017 thus we focus on uncertainties as they pertain to influencing spatial impacts of oa the roms model used for present day and future oceanographic predictions was forced by a single realization of a global earth system model gfdl esm2m run under a single emissions scenario rcp 8 5 both of these simplifications should be addressed in future efforts future work would benefit from downscaling of multiple realizations and multiple global earth system models to quantify both intrinsic natural and model structural uncertainty related to physics and biogeochemistry this could be substantially addressed by adding two or three different downscaling studies and does not necessarily require dozens of computationally intensive model iterations additionally alternative emissions scenarios should be considered hawkins and sutton 2009 hollowed et al 2009 in our atlantis ecosystem model a substantial structural uncertainty was the representation of vertebrate spatial movements vertebrate biomass was distributed using prescribed seasonal shifts with the daily distribution interpolated linearly from one season to the next more complex movement patterns have been applied in some other atlantis models fulton et al 2014 including effects such as thermal tolerances but these add substantially to model calibration consequently we used prescribed seasonal movement which effectively handles large model domains under historic conditions but limits the evolution of spatial variability in future projections there are two potential consequences of our approach if a vertebrate functional group only experiences a decline in one region e g 0 6 off washington state that effect will be smoothed out across all regions reducing the extent to which we will observe heterogeneous impacts on vertebrate species in addition it masks the potential for strong spatial rearrangement of species distributions in response to environmental conditions such redistribution might mean coastwide biomass shifts different to those seen here e g a group may not have an impact exceeding our reporting threshold effect size of 0 2 as it has moved to more hospitable areas the economic effects of a shift may also differ to what is seen here particularly if a fleet components is unable to match the distributional shift regardless of the realized biomass levels predator diet compositions are notoriously challenging to estimate baker et al 2014 and in atlantis diets evolve dynamically based on shifts in prey abundance and spatial overlap between predators and prey for example starting conditions allowed dungeness crab to prey upon many functional groups but realized dungeness crab diets were relatively simple and consisted of mostly bivalves benthic herbivorous grazers and dungeness crab which are known to cannibalize fernández 1999 with decreases in two of their main prey resources cannibalism increased likely driving declines in biomass fig 2 however it is possible that this was an oversimplification of true crab diets making them more sensitive to changes in the model than they would be to changes in the natural environment in the economic analysis we assumed fixed prices from present day through to the 2060 s and did not include substitution between fisheries inputs fisheries always use the same amount of diesel food etc per dollar of revenue these are both characteristics of io models seung and waters 2006 which have been used previously for moderate future forecasts 15 years kaplan and leonard 2012 and long term forecasts over 50 years fernandes et al 2016 there is presently no alternative for analyzing port level outputs for the us west coast in the future long term projections of economic responses may be better forecasted with techniques such as a computable general equilibrium cge model e g finnoff and tschirhart 2003 which factors in changing prices and input substitutions we note that io model estimates of impacts on employment and income did not substantially differ from changes in revenue fig 5 our economic outputs are most useful for identifying ports with higher relative vulnerability in addition to these primary limitations there are a few key biological assumptions that could affect our results we looked at ocean acidification as a single stressor when it is well established that the california current experiences a variety of anthropogenic impacts halpern et al 2008 thus future analyses would benefit from investigating cumulative effects particularly regarding temperature which is highly correlated to observed ph reum et al 2014 our work assumes ph only affects mortality though additional physiological processes have been included in other recent modeling efforts fernandes et al 2016 finally we do not include the evolution of species responses or changes in species distributions given future climate conditions and both of these are possible if not likely cheung et al 2010 sunday et al 2011 lohbeck et al 2012 pinsky et al 2013 4 3 conclusions ocean acidification has the potential to restructure marine ecosystems and strongly impact human communities dependent on marine resources le quesne and pinnegar 2012 ekstrom et al 2015 it is critical to assess risks to prioritize research and make strategic management decisions the california current is already experiencing the consequences of regional variations in ph and here we identify functional groups that are most likely to change in response to further declines in ph and the ports that may experience the largest economic impacts substantial biological impacts were projected to occur for benthic invertebrate and fish species economic consequences were most severe where declines in dungeness crab biomass resulted in lost fisheries catch dungeness crab is a major fishery resource on the us west coast making up between 40 89 of revenue for 8 of the 17 ports 43 on average across all ports appendix c our results highlight the value of methods that integrate physical ecological and economic consequences of climate change at a spatial resolution compatible with human communities

25268,marine ecosystems are experiencing rapid changes driven by anthropogenic stressors which in turn are affecting human communities one such stressor is ocean acidification a result of increasing carbon emissions most research on biological impacts of ocean acidification has focused on the responses of an individual species or life stage yet understanding how changes scale from species to ecosystems and the services they provide is critical to managing fisheries and setting research priorities here we use an ecosystem model which is forced by oceanographic projections and also coupled to an economic input output model to quantify biological responses to ocean acidification in six coastal regions from vancouver island canada to baja california mexico and economic responses at 17 ports on the us west coast this model is intended to explore one possible future of how ocean acidification may influence this coastline outputs show that declines in species biomass tend to be larger in the southern region of the model but the largest economic impacts on revenue income and employment occur from northern california to northern washington state the economic consequences are primarily driven by declines in dungeness crab from loss of prey given the substantive revenue generated by the fishing industry on the west coast the model suggests that long term planning for communities researchers and managers in the northern region of the california current would benefit from tracking dungeness crab productivity and potential declines related to ph keywords atlantis california current dungeness crab food web modeling input output modeling ocean acidification 1 introduction the oceans are experiencing warming acidification eutrophication and other changes that are modifying marine ecosystems halpern et al 2008 ekstrom et al 2015 these modifications have consequences for human communities that rely on living marine resources much of the research focused on the impacts of novel stressors has investigated the responses of individual species e g cooley et al 2015 dueri et al 2016 vanderplancke et al 2015 however understanding how these changes scale up to impact ecosystems and ecosystem services such as fisheries catch and revenue is critical to setting research priorities and making strategic marine resource management decisions ecosystem scale research has begun to identify broad geographic regions most at risk from modifications of the environment kaplan et al 2010 ainsworth et al 2011 cheung et al 2011 barange et al 2014 however impacts on human communities often depend on localized ecological change making it critical to understand changes at a finer geographic scale ekstrom et al 2015 human communities are place based and benefit from distinct sets of species thus spatially heterogeneous variation in climate change impacts on those species can have socio economic consequences that vary across communities methods to understand the consequences of marine ecosystem change require an interdisciplinary approach bai et al 2016 that includes oceanographic conditions such as temperature and or ph at high resolution spatially explicit responses of the ecosystem to those conditions and the dependencies of local human communities on marine resources allison et al 2009 ocean acidification oa caused by increasing global carbon emissions is a stressor with both spatial and temporal variability that has the potential to restructure marine systems griffith et al 2011 branch et al 2012 le quesne and pinnegar 2012 marshall et al 2017 both calcifying and non calcifying species have been shown to respond directly to changing ph branch et al 2012 kroeker et al 2013 busch and mcelhany 2016 ocean carbonate chemistry varies globally orr et al 2005 friedrich et al 2012 and some regions are more at risk from oa than others because of a natural occurrence of low ph water from upwelling that is expected to be exacerbated by the effects of oa feely et al 2016 such regions include eastern boundary currents like the california current large marine ecosystem feely et al 2008 gruber et al 2012 the california current is an upwelling system with high spatial variability in oceanographic conditions king et al 2011 and seasonally low ph in nearshore environments feely et al 2008 gruber et al 2012 upwelling occurs in spring and summer bringing up low ph waters that create a temporal window of exposure to low ph that is expected to worsen with oa hauri et al 2013 latitudinally the california current can be divided into three regions king et al 2011 the northern region defined by the area north of cape mendocino or cape blanco is defined by strong winter storms and substantial freshwater inputs the regions south to point conception california and then beyond point conception experience higher levels of upwelling than in the north as indicated by the bakun cumulative upwelling index feely et al 2016 report the lowest surface ph in the central region and a model by hauri et al 2013 projected this region to have the most variable ph levels range 7 85 8 15 σph 0 1 and the lowest surface ph most months of the year though species in this system may have adapted to these heterogeneous conditions pespeni et al 2013 the natural occurrence of low ph waters can be problematic because future declines may push ph beyond species physiological tolerance thresholds fabry et al 2008 feely et al 2008 gruber et al 2012 the oceanographic heterogeneity in the california current will lead to heterogeneous exposure to low ph waters and thus spatial heterogeneity in ecosystem changes the california current supports a diverse food web and a multi million dollar fishing industry the direct ex vessel revenue from fisheries in the us portion of the ecosystem was worth over 450 million in 2013 pacfin 2013 fisheries catches and species composition are localized in time and space kaplan et al 2013b for instance fisheries in washington state are dominated by dungeness crab metacarcinus magister cancridae sardine sardinops sagax clupeidae pacific hake merluccius productus merlucciidae and shrimp family pandalidae while ports off southern california catch market squid doryteuthis opalescens loliginidae mackerel family scombridae sardine anchovy engraulis mordax engraulidae and nearshore urchins mesocentrotus spp strongylocentrotidae pacfin 2013 given the variability of target species and total landings between ports in the california current kaplan et al 2013b and heterogeneity of oceanographic conditions king et al 2011 hauri et al 2013 feely et al 2016 changes in catch from ocean acidification are likely to be regionally different based on localized changes in organism responses basin wide impacts have been projected in the california current kaplan et al 2010 marshall et al 2017 the southeastern australia marine ecosystem griffith et al 2011 and for the uk fernandes et al 2016 to our knowledge no work has estimated how oa may impact fisheries at finer spatial scales such as the port level here we explore spatially heterogeneous impacts of ocean acidification on species and fisheries in the california current we employ oceanographic predictions from a regional oceanographic modeling system roms model forced by an earth system model gfdl esm2m under climate scenario rcp8 5 an atlantis end to end marine ecosystem model fulton et al 2011 and an economic input output model leonard and watson 2011 we projected the state of the ecosystem in the 2060 s and described spatial variation in the marine species and human communities at risk the value of ecosystem models such as this is in long term strategic management and planning where path dependency means that actions now may influence the utility of measures into the future as well as research prioritization thus our work identifies where future research monitoring and management focus is needed by exploring the potential consequences of ph changes and vulnerabilities for port revenue income and employment in us west coast communities 2 methods 2 1 overview we used an ecosystem model to investigate the impacts of ocean acidification in the california current and consequences for fishing communities along the us west coast outputs generated by a fine scale ocean model provided physical forcing for the atlantis ecosystem model for the present and 50 years in the future outputs from atlantis were then passed to an economic input output model developed for the west coast of the us io pac leonard and watson 2011 a schematic diagram representing the modeling approach can be found in appendix a fig a1 because the io pac model and high resolution revenue data were only available for the us portion of the model we focused our economic analysis on the us west coast i e excluding canada and mexico we focused on the 17 us port groups on the outer coast excluding puget sound used by the pacific fisheries information network pacfin to aggregate data and avoid issues of disclosure of confidential information table 8 1 of appendix a in pfmc 2004 for all 17 port groups we simulated changes in catch revenue income and employment 2 2 summary of atlantis model we used the spatially explicit end to end ecosystem model atlantis fulton et al 2011 to simulate food web dynamics and fisheries atlantis represents ecosystem dynamics with three components i an oceanographic sub model ii an ecological sub model and iii a human dynamics sub model fulton et al 2004a b extensive documentation of the atlantis modeling framework for both the california current and other ecosystems can be found in previous publications fulton et al 2004a b kaplan et al 2010 2013a therefore we briefly summarize the most recent version of the atlantis model developed for the california current marshall et al 2017 including all three sub models highlighting changes we made explicitly to investigate spatial impacts of oa the physical domain of the atlantis model is represented by polygons which are defined by depth ranges and by longitudinal and latitudinal breaks our model includes 88 spatial polygons that span the entire domain of the california current from the northern extent of vancouver island canada and south to punta eugenia baja california mexico longitudinal polygon boundaries were based on bathymetry with breaks at 50 m 100 m 200 m 550 m and 1200 m and then finally at the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone eez fig 1 these breaks were chosen based on a mixture of bathymetric and biological information representing nearshore shelf deeper shelf shelf slope break see appendix s1 in marshall et al 2017 depth ranges of boxes within the model match the depths used to define bathymetric breaks 2 3 oceanographic model the atlantis model was forced with oceanographic outputs from an implementation of roms version 3 7 haidvogel et al 2008 moore et al 2011 with biogeochemistry fennel et al 2006 2008 configured to predict oceanographic conditions currents ph oxygen temperature salinity and nutrients for the present decade 2011 2020 and for a decade 50 years in the future 2061 2070 from these two runs we used a single year to represent current conditions 2013 and a single year to represent future conditions 2063 see further explanation below the two decade long runs were used as opposed to creating a full time series of downscaled oceanographic conditions between 2011 2070 because creating a 60 year time series of roms was too computationally intensive our implementation of roms has 10 x 10 km horizontal grid resolution includes tidal dynamics and uses global model outputs from the noaa geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl esm2m model with biogeochemistry topaz dunne et al 2012 dunne et al 2013 to derive surface forcing initial conditions and boundary conditions for the two simulated time periods the climate scenario used was rcp8 5 moss et al 2010 van vuuren et al 2011 which assumes continuation of current emissions trajectories in our case through the 2060 s we force atlantis with this rcp 8 5 scenario for two reasons first in comparison with our 2013 baseline scenario this bounds the potential changes we expect on the biogeochemistry of the california current by the 2060 s second global co2 emissions continue to rise with no clear evidence of a rapid reversal being likely locking in future change over the next few decades and approximating rcp 8 5 more closely than more moderate scenarios usgcrp 2017 the two time periods were run independently in roms in each case the first year january 1st 2011 and 2061 respectively was initialized through interpolation of the global ocean simulation results the esm2m topaz simulation scenario rcp8 5 this higher resolution roms model of oceanography for the california current was developed because upwelling in this region is not well resolved with global scale models orr et al 2005 and upwelling plays an important role in the development and spatial extent of oa this roms model does not represent nearshore environments inshore of 50 m with high resolution and therefore does not represent land based run off as a contributor to oa previous models for the southern california current have found expected ph levels of around 7 8 in nearshore surface waters by 2050 with heterogeneity in space by latitude and depth and seasonally gruber et al 2012 thus ph levels in this model are expected to be in a similar range further details on the roms implementation can be found in marshall et al 2017 and the associated appendices oceanographic conditions were extracted from the decade long roms runs and used to force atlantis now and in the future in each case a single year was taken from each roms run 2013 in the first instance and 2063 in the second because they were representative of the time period and then looped 100 times to achieve quasi stable forcing for the ecological model so as to achieve quasi equilibrium ecological conditions in atlantis this looping of a single year as opposed to implementing the full 10 year set of oceanographic conditions helped control for inter annual variability in ocean conditions 2 4 ecological model the atlantis modeling framework is a c code base that simulates multi species ecosystem dynamics in a spatial framework using a simple forward difference integration scheme typically on 12 hour time steps fulton et al 2004a c horne et al 2010 atlantis is 3 dimensional and spatially explicit with vertebrate numbers at age and weights at age tracked per polygon and invertebrates modeled as biomass pools per polygon the model simulates processes including primary production growth and reproduction trophic dynamics movement migration and habitat interactions within each polygon and depth layer these processes can be directly impacted by environmental conditions such as ph temperature oxygen and water flux from roms or other oceanographic forcing predator prey dynamics allow diet switching predator starvation and declines in predator weight at age if prey decline in abundance the most recent california current atlantis model includes 82 functional groups representing detritus 2 groups primary producers 6 groups benthic and pelagic invertebrates 25 groups fishes 36 groups marine mammals 10 groups and seabirds 3 groups this model is an update of the marshall et al 2017 model which was developed to better represent groups that are known to respond to low ph including pteropods dungeness crab coral coccolithophores and market squid all biological parameters used in the model reported in this manuscript such as recruitment mortality diets and distributions were the same as those used in marshall et al 2017 save for a few changes discussed below model calibration for the marshall et al 2017 version of the model was achieved in two phases initial simulations with no fishing and then secondary calibration with constant fishing pressure we followed best practices for calibration of this type of end to end model as described previously kaplan marshall 2016 we evaluated atlantis projections of seasonal and inter annual biomass trends spatial distribution vertebrate numbers at age and weights at age in a pattern oriented modeling approach grimm et al 2005 iterative manual calibration is the best possible current approach for these complex models for which simulations require hours to days of computing time tests of fishing pressure involved comparing species productivity as measured by fishing rates sustainable in the model to expected rules of thumb based on natural mortality rates kenneth et al 2001 walters martell 2002 in the course of calibration we made slight modifications to the model parameterization used by marshall et al 2017 with our focus on the spatial effects of oa on fisheries catch we modified parameter values for five of the 11 groups that declined to low biomass levels in the previous model under a baseline simulation i we made slight modifications to feeding efficiency parameters for dungeness crab nearshore sea urchins and an epibenthic predatory invertebrate group comprised of sea stars and large predatory snails and ii both feeding efficiencies and quadratic mortality rates were modified for market squid and pandalid shrimp dungeness crab pandalid shrimp and market squid are key invertebrate fishery species market squid in particular is a highly important fishery species in southern california making up over 50 of the biomass of catch for 5 ports in 2013 with these modifications we were able to ensure persistence of both market squid and pandalid shrimp and obtain more realistic biomass levels of dungeness crab along the entire coast however thirteen groups still declined to low biomass levels 2 starting biomass groups declining which also declined in marshall et al 2017 included deep demersal fish pacific ocean perch sebastes alutus sebastidae arrowtooth flounder atheresthes stomias pleuronectinae large demersal predators large pelagic predators chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha salmonidae pelagic sharks epibenthic predatory invertebrates and large phytoplankton groups which declined in our model and not in marshall et al 2017 included deep small rockfish small demersal sharks nearshore sea urchins and coccolithophores though the groups declining made up 17 of the functional groups in the model they represented only 2 of vertebrate biomass and 1 of consumer biomass and accounted for 7 5 of 2013 us west coast catch additionally crangon shrimp were found to have unrealistic increases in biomass and were removed from economic analyses they accounted for 0 1 of 2013 catch similar challenges with persistence in complex ecosystem models have been reported by others gaichas et al 2012 thorpe et al 2015 and remain a substantial challenge in large multi species models with our primary focus on effects on fisheries catch the declining groups were not expected to greatly impact outputs though future modeling efforts can work to increase persistence across groups 2 5 fisheries parameterization fishing mortality for each functional group was set at a constant rate e g 0 05 yr 1 such that the catch metric tonnes in the first year of the model would match the 2013 catch data from pacfin our us catches were allocated spatially to 17 port groups hereafter called ports along the coast with one additional fishery each for canada and mexico fig 1 spatially explicit fishing mortality rates per port or country and functional group were then applied as constant fishing rates see appendix a this assumes no management responses or shifts in regimes and or fishery behavior in the future while this is unrealistic it allows for consideration of oa effects without the confounding socioeconomic dynamics which would make attribution incredibly difficult us vessels were assumed to have access to coastal nearshore areas within 200 km of the homeport the main city in the port and equal access to areas offshore to 1200 m depth canadian and mexican fishing mortality rates were applied equally to all canadian and mexican areas in the model domain respectively though our atlantis model projects port level catches each of these ports has catch from a mix of vessel types table 1 the categories used to classify vessels were originally defined in leonard and watson 2011 the vessel categories have distinct target species economic characteristics and subsequent vulnerabilities to ocean acidification the port level catches were allocated to the vessel types based on the proportion of catches per vessel type reported in pacfin in 2013 we report results for 10 vessel types that primarily harvest groups well represented by atlantis biomass dynamics nine other vessels types depend substantially on species that are poorly represented in the base atlantis simulations i e functional groups that do not persist and these were aggregated into a generic coast wide fishery the catch metric tonnes landed at each port was converted to total revenue using 2013 price per pound data pacfin 2013 prices were found for each functional group at the resolution of vessel type and port these prices were multiplied by biomass to find total revenue by 1 vessel type at each port and 2 functional group at each port 2 6 input output models implan and io pac we used an input output io model leontief 1951 to investigate changes in income and employment resulting from changes in ex vessel fisheries revenue here and in previous work kaplan and leonard 2012 we use io models to estimate direct indirect and induced effects direct effect refers to the change in production such as impacts at the level of the vessel indirect effect refers to secondary activity caused by changing input needs of directly affected industries e g changes in fleet revenue may cause a decline in output from shipyards that service those vessels induced effects are caused by changes in household spending from additional income generated by direct and indirect effects the northwest fisheries science center s input output model for pacific coast fisheries io pac was designed to estimate the gross changes in economic contributions and economic impacts resulting from policy environmental or other changes that affect fishery harvest leonard and watson 2011 the io pac was constructed by customizing impact analysis for planning implan regional input output io software implan pro 2012 mig inc hudson wisconsin development of io pac included customizing implan with an addition of 19 commercial fishing vessel types the present application used a version of io pac that was developed to include the 17 ports in the atlantis model and the subset 10 of the 19 fishing vessel types for which spatial catches were tracked table 1 economic impact estimates in io pac include the effects of changes in fish harvest on income and employment by harvesting vessels and processors at the scale of port and vessel type there are three major assumptions of io pac 1 supply of outputs is not constraining an increase in demand such as demand by the fishing sectors for engine maintenance is always met by an increase in supply for the commodity or service demanded 2 prices of commodities such as processed fish and factors of production such as diesel fuel are fixed and here are denominated in 2013 dollars 3 there is no substitution in either production or consumption which means that a fishery sector will always require the same set of inputs diesel ice etc to land a dollar s worth of fish similarly households always purchase the same set of commodities in the same proportions 2 7 functional group responses to ph for this analysis 10 functional groups were assumed to respond directly to ph groups were chosen based on a review of 393 papers on sensitivity of species in temperate oceans to carbon chemistry and a tailoring of species sensitivity estimates to the california current busch and mcelhany 2016 table 2 these were the same 10 groups affected by ph in the cumulative scenario in marshall et al 2017 and had the strongest negative responses to ocean acidification according to the review by busch and mcelhany 2016 functional group sensitivity was translated into species response through parameterizing ph induced mortality additional to any linear or quadratic mortality all response curves were parameterized such that there was no ph induced mortality above ph 8 0 and mortality linearly increased with declines in ph declines in ph would be felt by a species based on their spatial distribution polygons in which they inhabit and the ph in that region the threshold of 8 0 was chosen because average ph in the region in present day conditions start just under 8 0 at 7 95 the rate of decline slope of the curve was set such that the most sensitive group experienced an additional 10 total annual mortality rate for one unit change in ph from 8 0 to 7 0 as depicted in marshall et al 2017 fig s3 all other functional groups ph response slopes were scaled against that group using scaling parameters provided by busch and mcelhany 2016 marshall et al 2017 tested atlantis model output sensitivity to mortality rates up to 10 times higher and found the directions of impact either in the positive or negative direction of species responses were largely insensitive to higher mortality rates two sets of oceanographic outputs described above were used to run three 100 year atlantis scenarios isolating the effects of ph and removing the impacts that may have been caused by changes in temperature the three atlantis scenarios included two baselines using 2013 and 2063 oceanography referred to as 2013baseline and 2063baseline where no species responded to ph and a third run with 2063 oceanography where species responded to ph referred to as 2063phmortality we calculated the effect size for each functional group as the difference in biomass for the scenario with 2063 conditions with and without ph mortality turned on 2063phmortality and 2063baseline respectively standardized by the biomass predicted in the 2013 runs 2013baseline using the following metric 1 e i b 2063 p h m o r t a l i t y i b 2063 b a s e l i n e i b 2013 b a s e l i n e i biomass values used were an average over the final 10 years of the 100 year model run representing quasi equilibrium values under the oceanographic conditions used this approach was used to remove the influence of other oceanographic changes such as temperature over the 50 years so that results are an indication of the sole influence of ph although biological responses to changes in temperature and oxygen levels are expected to be substantial shaffer et al 2009 barange et al 2014 fernandes et al 2016 they were not the focus of our analysis revenue changes were calculated at the finest resolution of functional group by vessel type and port multiplying biomass by price 2 r i j k r p i j k b i j k r where ri j k r is functional group revenue calculated directly as the total biomass landed at the port bi j k r multiplied by the price per unit biomass pi j k for group i at port j for vessel type k and for model run r where the run can be 2013baseline 2063baseline or 2063phmortality we investigated revenue outputs at three scales 1 total port revenue rp 2 revenue by port and vessel type rf and 3 revenue by port and functional group rs the effect size on revenue was calculated in the same way as for biomass the difference between revenue under 2063 conditions with and without ph mortality standardized by 2013 revenue we report changes in biomass and revenue only for effect sizes greater than 0 2 this is the convention with large ecosystem models which are best used to reveal large vulnerabilities rather than fine grained projections fulton et al 2011 fulton et al 2014 collie et al 2016 and because a difference of less than 20 would be lost in the observation noise of most ecosystem processes further economic analysis was performed using multipliers from the io pac model to consider direct indirect and induced effects on income and employment multipliers for fisheries revenue and processor effect at each port were used for example income effects i for a single port j were the product of revenue outputs by vessel type k and port and the two multipliers 3 i j r j 1 j 17 r f j k r m i d j m i p j where mi d j is the economic multiplier for revenue for income at port j and mi p j is the multiplier for the processor effect on income at port j the employment produced ej r was calculated the same way using me d j and me p j the effect size on income and employment was calculated as the difference between scenarios in 2063 and standardizing by 2013baseline three ports do not have processors brookings crescent city and bodega bay thus those ports only had mi d j and me d j 3 results 3 1 changes in biomass demersal functional groups were most affected by changes in ph sixteen functional groups experienced biomass effect sizes of 0 20 or greater affected groups included invertebrates and demersal fishes fig 2 we categorize functional groups according to three classes of response functional groups with substantial changes magnitude 0 2 that varied regionally groups with substantial but spatially consistent changes and groups with no substantial change 0 2 we focus on functional groups with regional variability and then briefly touch on the last two classes most invertebrate responses varied by region but the patterns of responses were unique to each functional group excluding pandalid shrimp fig 2 for species directly responding to ph the variation was largely driven by local ph values on average ph declined the most between northern california and vancouver island although species exposure to ph was dependent on the ph projected in the roms model within the species latitudinal range and depth distribution while dungeness crab experienced the lowest ph in canadian waters other species e g benthic herbivorous grazers and deposit feeders experienced the lowest ph in southern california fig 2 as a result species responses to lower ph values do not consistently match what might be expected from observations feely et al 2016 that the lowest ph and most severe effects would occur between northern california and oregon rather proportional effects on some functional groups were more substantial in the southern portion of the model with the size of response scaling with the slope of their ph mortality curve table 2 notably the crab group excluding dungeness had heterogeneous responses across space likely due to low biomass near 7 of starting biomass creating higher sensitivity to small differences between 2013 and 2063 declines in benthic herbivorous grazers bivalves deposit feeders and benthic carnivores were not only from direct effects of changing ph but also from indirect food web effects via changes in predator prey dynamics appendix b table b1 other invertebrates indirectly responded to declines in ph in heterogeneous patterns resulting primarily from changes in predator and prey biomass levels groups with indirect declines meiobenthos gelatinous zooplankton microphytobenthos and black corals all responded in limited geographical regions southern portion of the model with meiobenthos and gelatinous zooplankton experiencing changes in predation biomass increases for pandalid shrimp and microzooplankton neither of which responded directly to ph resulted from a release from predation dungeness crab were a unique case they were parameterized to respond directly to declines in ph but the realized impact resulted almost entirely from indirect effects of changes in prey availability appendix b table b1 this impact was most substantial off of oregon and northern california fig 2 but also led to declines in dungeness crab biomass off canada and washington state ninety percent of the dungeness crab biomass in the model is in these northern regions and we did not see the same substantial declines of dungeness crab in southern regions five functional groups exhibited consistent changes across the model domain there were four declining fish groups petrale sole eopsetta jordani pleuronectinae dover sole microstomus pacificus pleuronectinae cowcod sebastes levis sebastidae and deep large rockfish whereas pandalid shrimp increased fig 2 the four fish groups declined due to decreases in prey abundance that were substantial enough to create a consistent effect across all six regions all four fish groups consumed benthic invertebrates that declined benthic herbivorous grazers bivalves and crangon shrimp not shown in fig 2 but had 19 decline pandalid shrimp are preyed upon by both dover sole and deep large rockfish in the model such that biomass declines in these two fish groups may have caused release from predation on pandalid shrimp making increases constant across space groups that did not respond 0 2 included four of the functional groups parameterized to respond directly to declines in ph mesozooplankton pteropods shallow benthic filter feeders and crangon shrimp as well as pelagic fishes mammals sharks and seabirds it is likely that for groups parameterized to respond to ph that did not change substantially a combination of high productivity and release from predation were able to counteract direct effects from induced mortality 3 2 spatial economic impacts simulated revenue from catch in our base scenario 2013baseline mostly matched recent revenue composition for 2013 from the pacfin records 15 of 17 ports with exceptions driven by biomass trends in the simulations appendix c table c1 port revenue from sablefish anoplopoma fimbria anoplopomitidae and pacific hake was consistently lower in our atlantis simulations than in 2013 landings data atlantis projections for north coast wa fort bragg ca and san diego ca did not accurately represent 2013 landings as all three ports have substantial landings of species that declined in abundance in baseline atlantis simulations simulated revenue per port ratio of simulated revenue to revenue from pacfin ranged from 0 4 to 1 48 mean 1 07 sd 0 39 appendix c table c2 simulated revenue was lower than baseline records at ports between crescent city and san francisco ca due to the model projecting lower dungeness crab abundance in those regions in comparison simulated revenue was higher than 2013 records in the southern california ports highly dependent on market squid which were projected to increase in biomass over the course of the present day simulation of the 16 major fishery target groups i e groups which comprise 90 of the model port revenue one quarter had a substantial change in revenue rs 0 2 in response to projected ph fig 3 indirect food web effects drove these changes declines in revenue were dominated by declines in dungeness crab with effect sizes between 0 42 and 1 0 at the nine u s ports north of fort bragg ca see fig 2 caption for explanation of changes greater than 1 0 a number of ports experienced an increase in revenue from pandalid shrimp consistently a 0 3 effect size seven ports experienced an effect size of 0 27 from declines in petrale sole some in the southern region fig 3 three ports in oregon and northern california experienced declines in revenue from dover sole with an effect size of 0 39 substantial port level revenue changes rp 0 2 occurred at ports north of fort bragg ca that had a large proportional reliance on dungeness crab and flatfish figs 3 and 4 the most substantial declines occurred where there was both large reliance on dungeness crab 50 of revenue and where crab biomass declined most severely oregon and northern california tillamook experienced the largest decline in revenue as a result of declines in ph due to dungeness crab which made up 97 3 of revenue in 2013baseline see impacts by functional group in fig 3 in pacfin dungeness crab made up 86 3 of revenue for tillamook in 2013 appendix c table c1 some ports experienced relief from dungeness crab declines with increases in pandalid shrimp revenue most notably for coos bay oregon with equivalent reliance on dungeness crab and pandalid shrimp appendix c table c1 though dover and petrale sole both declined neither had a strong influence on port level revenue changes as they made up a smaller proportion of port revenue 5 0 8 5 and 4 0 19 8 reliance on dover and petrale sole respectively the eight ports that did not experience declines greater than 0 2 nonetheless experienced modest declines in catch and revenue appendix d table d1 income and employment impacts of oa reflected revenue impacts at the port level with the effect on employment at times more exaggerated than the effect on revenue and income fig 4 this exaggeration is a result of differences in the income versus employment multipliers by vessel type for example crescent city has catch from four vessel types fig 5 the income multipliers for these four vessel types are similar appendix d whereas the multipliers for employment are higher for crabbers and other groundfish fixed gear than for large groundfish trawlers and shrimpers therefore employment declined more strongly 0 71 than revenue and income 0 58 and 0 59 appendix d when revenue for crabbers was reduced eureka in contrast had similar impacts across revenue 0 37 income 0 36 and employment 0 37 because multipliers were similar across vessel types landing catch at this port parsing port level revenue to vessel type suggests that nine of the ten vessel types will experience a decline 0 2 in at least one port fig 5 the widespread impacts across vessel types reflect the fact that each vessel type fishes for many species throughout the year thereby enhancing the likelihood that the catch composition of any single vessel type will include one or more species that is adversely affected by oa for instance hake trawlers sablefish fixed gear vessels and crabber vessels all catch a mixture of species with dungeness crab making up a substantial proportion of revenue in our model with pacific hake and sablefish both declining over the 100 year spinup of 2063 conditions hake trawlers and sablefish fixed gear vessels relied more strongly on dungeness crab than might be expected nonetheless in oregon and washington from brookings north these three vessel types and large trawlers show the most detrimental effects from oa despite crabber vessels experiencing some relief from increases in pandalid shrimp in the south diver vessels experienced declines in a variety of targeted species appendix c table c3 however this outcome may be confounded by the difficulty we had in maintaining initial densities of nearshore urchins during baseline model calibration see methods section 2 4 4 discussion though increasing focus has been placed on understanding the economic consequences of climate change cooley and doney 2009 barange et al 2014 punt et al 2014 falkenberg and tubb 2017 or the resulting vulnerability of species and human communities ekstrom et al 2015 hare et al 2016 such work is frequently at the ecosystem scale which is a coarser spatial scale than is relevant for many stakeholders and managers here our modeling framework used a meaningful spatial resolution to project regionally varying biological and economic impacts of ocean acidification within the california current the model projects that the largest economic consequences may occur for central and northern west coast ports that rely on demersal species for a large portion of fisheries catch in particular dungeness crab short of immediate global actions to dramatically reduce co2 emissions highly vulnerable ports and fisheries will need to consider resilient responses such as establishment of marine reserves reductions in nutrient loading washington state blue ribbon panel on ocean acidification 2012 or an emphasis on robust management flexible and diversified fisheries and increased monitoring pinsky and mantua 2014 schindler and hilborn 2015 the atlantis model is best suited to questions of strategic management and exploration of ecosystem dynamics fulton et al 2011 we use the model in the spirit of scenario analysis a common approach used by businesses and organizations to explore possible future pathways with a recognition that there are large uncertainties when projecting forward in time postma and liebl 2005 amer et al 2013 the value of taking this approach is discussed further below the geographic variability of impacts found here resulted from the high resolution in the three components of our modeling framework the roms model the spatially explicit ecosystem model and the spatially resolved fishing revenues used in an io model additional scenarios either through different models different configuration of this same model or other types of scenario assessment will more fully scope vulnerable species and communities peterson et al 2003 indirect food web effects that varied with space reflect the complex predator prey interactions and detailed species distributions that the atlantis model can represent large scale analyses of the effects of climate change frequently include either food web dynamics ainsworth et al 2011 barange et al 2014 or high spatial resolution cheung et al 2010 cheung et al 2011 fernandes et al 2016 but not both atlantis provides the ability to consider spatially variable indirect food web effects from changing oceanographic conditions this high spatial resolution has often not been fully utilized in previously published atlantis analyses that have summarized findings at a coarser resolution kaplan et al 2010 fulton 2011 griffith et al 2011 marshall et al 2017 while some users within management agencies may directly utilize some of the finer scale information existing publications tend to remain at the broad spatial scale model outputs presented here support results from griffith et al 2011 suggesting that demersal species are most at risk from oa griffith et al 2011 using an atlantis modeling framework found substantial indirect impacts of oa on demersal fishes including demersal sharks shallow macrozoobenthos cephalopods and benthic filter feeders in the california current kaplan et al 2010 found very strong indirect effects on flatfish namely english sole parophrys vetulus yellowtail rockfish sebastes flavidus and arrowtooth flounder unlike kaplan et al 2010 where most of the indirect effects appeared to be on demersal fishes marshall et al 2017 and this paper found strong indirect effects on dungeness crabs these differences in model outcomes are not unexpected given that the kaplan et al 2010 and the present model had different functional group structures in contrast to the demersal community consumers in the pelagic community pelagic fishes marine mammals and seabirds experienced only small indirect effects in our model consistent with previous results our work and that of marshall et al 2017 highlight the importance of integrating vulnerability information for an individual species from a variety of methodologies to understand potential impacts across ecological scales from physiological to population responses for instance previous work on dungeness crab has provided mixed results regarding oa lab studies have shown that lowered ph reduces larval survival and slows development rates miller et al 2016 in contrast a population vulnerability assessment integrating across life stages showed that the overall population may have low vulnerability even with high larval vulnerability hodgson et al 2016 here we see that although direct effects from ph induced mortality are insubstantial in our model indirect food web effects loss of prey made dungeness crab populations quite vulnerable that declines in fishery revenue are so dependent on this species warrants future attention on details of dungeness crab vulnerability and vulnerability of their primary prey resources finally the variability in ph conditions and resulting ecological impacts was driven in part by the oceanographic model roms there are a number of methods simpler than computationally intensive dynamical downscaling through roms however each alternative method has limitations for instance initial insights into the ecosystem impacts from oa using atlantis employed a uniform mortality rate for groups assumed to be impacted by declines in ph kaplan et al 2010 griffith et al 2011 alternatively direct use of global circulation models gcms is possible but has limited utility in the california current because they currently do not resolve upwelling regions from eastern boundary currents gruber et al 2012 nor tidal forces on the continental shelf ådlandsvik and bentsen 2007 thus using these models directly for projections of oa in the california current is not yet ideal statistical downscaling is an alternative option but is limited in the number of oceanographic variables produced and assumes that relationships between current climate conditions correlations between oceanographic variables hold under future climate conditions which may or may not occur ekström et al 2015 given these varying limitations roms was used here as it provides high resolution output that resolves upwelling and includes numerous oceanographic parameters the drawback to this approach was that it necessitated considering potential end point outcomes rather transitory effects 4 1 management applications while this initial analysis was constrained by available inputs to considering a single scenario it does form a solid basis for identifying vulnerable species and ports that warrant further scientific and management focus as evidenced by some of the counter intuitive results and the high heterogeneity found here simply relying on common sense mental extrapolation is not appropriate in path dependent instances such as natural resource management and planning consequently even uncertain results can provide useful insights and starting points for discussions planning and strategic research prioritization output from other atlantis ecosystem models has been used to inform strategic management questions and outputs from the present work have the potential to fit into existing management efforts within the u s for example in australia atlantis has been used as part of management strategy evaluation exercises to compare different management levers in the process of restructuring south eastern australian federal fisheries fulton et al 2011 it has also been used alone or in combination with other models to inform the australian government of ecosystem responses to climate change fulton and gorton 2014 fulton et al 2018 within the u s there has been an increasing focus on both developing climate change strategies and understanding risk to different regions of the coastline to improve resilience and reduce the impact of forthcoming change one of the seven objectives in the noaa national marine fisheries service nmfs climate science strategy is to develop future projections specifically at regional scales that are relevant to management busch et al 2016 similarly the west coast ocean acidification and hypoxia science panel note the importance of both higher spatial resolution in model outputs and the need for coupling biophysical and ecosystem models to improve our understanding of potential outcomes chan et al 2016 thus outputs from this work can feed into these management priority areas and can be used in conjunction with alternative methodologies such as the nmfs climate vulnerability assessments noaa nw sw fisheries science centers 2016 within this advisory context it is important to recognize that the results presented here represent a single instance of how ocean acidification may impact the biology and economics of the coastline bordering the california current as with any highly parameterized and complex ecosystem model it is important to consider the results in conjunction with an ensemble of other models that use different assumptions and modeling frameworks we are hopeful that future ensemble projections will build on this current work and provide alternative scenarios and projections so that we can gain a fuller picture of possible future vulnerabilities within the system however the reality that more models are needed does not diminish the utility of this approach because in taking steps towards understanding vulnerability within the california current to oa there is a need to go beyond mental extrapolation and tangibly build on past information 4 2 uncertainties and limitations given the constrained nature of the work presented here it is important to be explicit about the associated uncertainties and limitations while model complexity is useful in providing higher resolution outputs and more explicitly dealing with a broader range of specific processes it also introduces uncertainty cheung et al 2016 a number of elements regarding model uncertainty as defined by hawkins and sutton 2009 and cheung et al 2016 were addressed in marshall et al 2017 thus we focus on uncertainties as they pertain to influencing spatial impacts of oa the roms model used for present day and future oceanographic predictions was forced by a single realization of a global earth system model gfdl esm2m run under a single emissions scenario rcp 8 5 both of these simplifications should be addressed in future efforts future work would benefit from downscaling of multiple realizations and multiple global earth system models to quantify both intrinsic natural and model structural uncertainty related to physics and biogeochemistry this could be substantially addressed by adding two or three different downscaling studies and does not necessarily require dozens of computationally intensive model iterations additionally alternative emissions scenarios should be considered hawkins and sutton 2009 hollowed et al 2009 in our atlantis ecosystem model a substantial structural uncertainty was the representation of vertebrate spatial movements vertebrate biomass was distributed using prescribed seasonal shifts with the daily distribution interpolated linearly from one season to the next more complex movement patterns have been applied in some other atlantis models fulton et al 2014 including effects such as thermal tolerances but these add substantially to model calibration consequently we used prescribed seasonal movement which effectively handles large model domains under historic conditions but limits the evolution of spatial variability in future projections there are two potential consequences of our approach if a vertebrate functional group only experiences a decline in one region e g 0 6 off washington state that effect will be smoothed out across all regions reducing the extent to which we will observe heterogeneous impacts on vertebrate species in addition it masks the potential for strong spatial rearrangement of species distributions in response to environmental conditions such redistribution might mean coastwide biomass shifts different to those seen here e g a group may not have an impact exceeding our reporting threshold effect size of 0 2 as it has moved to more hospitable areas the economic effects of a shift may also differ to what is seen here particularly if a fleet components is unable to match the distributional shift regardless of the realized biomass levels predator diet compositions are notoriously challenging to estimate baker et al 2014 and in atlantis diets evolve dynamically based on shifts in prey abundance and spatial overlap between predators and prey for example starting conditions allowed dungeness crab to prey upon many functional groups but realized dungeness crab diets were relatively simple and consisted of mostly bivalves benthic herbivorous grazers and dungeness crab which are known to cannibalize fernández 1999 with decreases in two of their main prey resources cannibalism increased likely driving declines in biomass fig 2 however it is possible that this was an oversimplification of true crab diets making them more sensitive to changes in the model than they would be to changes in the natural environment in the economic analysis we assumed fixed prices from present day through to the 2060 s and did not include substitution between fisheries inputs fisheries always use the same amount of diesel food etc per dollar of revenue these are both characteristics of io models seung and waters 2006 which have been used previously for moderate future forecasts 15 years kaplan and leonard 2012 and long term forecasts over 50 years fernandes et al 2016 there is presently no alternative for analyzing port level outputs for the us west coast in the future long term projections of economic responses may be better forecasted with techniques such as a computable general equilibrium cge model e g finnoff and tschirhart 2003 which factors in changing prices and input substitutions we note that io model estimates of impacts on employment and income did not substantially differ from changes in revenue fig 5 our economic outputs are most useful for identifying ports with higher relative vulnerability in addition to these primary limitations there are a few key biological assumptions that could affect our results we looked at ocean acidification as a single stressor when it is well established that the california current experiences a variety of anthropogenic impacts halpern et al 2008 thus future analyses would benefit from investigating cumulative effects particularly regarding temperature which is highly correlated to observed ph reum et al 2014 our work assumes ph only affects mortality though additional physiological processes have been included in other recent modeling efforts fernandes et al 2016 finally we do not include the evolution of species responses or changes in species distributions given future climate conditions and both of these are possible if not likely cheung et al 2010 sunday et al 2011 lohbeck et al 2012 pinsky et al 2013 4 3 conclusions ocean acidification has the potential to restructure marine ecosystems and strongly impact human communities dependent on marine resources le quesne and pinnegar 2012 ekstrom et al 2015 it is critical to assess risks to prioritize research and make strategic management decisions the california current is already experiencing the consequences of regional variations in ph and here we identify functional groups that are most likely to change in response to further declines in ph and the ports that may experience the largest economic impacts substantial biological impacts were projected to occur for benthic invertebrate and fish species economic consequences were most severe where declines in dungeness crab biomass resulted in lost fisheries catch dungeness crab is a major fishery resource on the us west coast making up between 40 89 of revenue for 8 of the 17 ports 43 on average across all ports appendix c our results highlight the value of methods that integrate physical ecological and economic consequences of climate change at a spatial resolution compatible with human communities

25269,global warming has received more and more attention in recent years for its inevitable influence on population species soil ocean water and so on it is essential to investigate the urban metabolism of carbon emissions which is a main cause of global warming and most of it occurs in the process of production and living in urban areas in this paper a carbon emission metabolic network is established to explore the emission reduction strategies by modeling carbon dioxide flows and identifying the mutual relationships based on the input output analysis specifically eff lorenz curve derived from the painting of lorenz curve is developed to compare the efficiency of carbon emissions from different sectors the newly developed method has been applied to guangdong province to demonstrate its availability and benefit it is revealed that carbon emissions mainly concentrated in the secondary and tertiary industries with electric power generation manufacturing industry domestic consumption and transportation ranking at the top the competition relationship reveals good interactions in terms of emission reduction while a mutualism relationship provides effective pathways to mitigate carbon emissions between pairwise sectors simultaneously in guangdong province upgrading the clean combustion technology in electric power generation and energy extraction sectors would drive other sectors to cut emissions and adjusting the production structure of the construction sector also contribute to achieve this goal the results are expected to provide corresponding and holistic reference for decision makers to develop the mitigation policies keywords input output table carbon emission urban metabolism mitigation ecological network analysis guangdong province 1 introduction as a part of atmosphere carbon dioxide is mainly produced by the burning of carbonaceous material animal metabolism land cover and anthropogenic activities although carbon dioxide is essential in the process of urban metabolism and economic activities excessive existence of it as the main component of greenhouse gases is responsible for global climate change and anomalies karl and trenberth 2003 ofipcc 2013 carbon dioxide has an excellent thermal insulation effect which can coat the earth with a thick down jacket coles 2003 kosugi 2009 in the last century the global temperature was increased by 0 6 c cox et al 2000 accompanied with the rise of sea level frölicher and joos 2010 2009 the shifts of species davis et al 1998 the widespread of epidemic disease pounds et al 2006 the decline of rice yields peng et al 2004 swain 2010 and so on the global warming seriously affected the economy development and caused great threat on the security of socio economic system root et al 2003 logan et al 2003 therefore it is important to connect the invisible hands into visible data and investigate the mechanism of the urban metabolism system which will further help to alleviate the pressure of carbon emissions wolman 1965 in the early days due to the limitations of statistical methods and technologies carbon emission data were difficult to be obtained carbon cycle attracted scholars attention and a vast of case studies have been conducted including the middle latitudes in the northern hemisphere levin and kromer 2004 north america pataki et al 2006 toronto sahely et al 2003 beijing feng et al 2013 guangyuan hao 2017 and so on bolin 1970 studied the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and referred to the global carbon cycle larsen and hertwich 2009 tracked the impact of carbon footprints on climate changes based on consumption a full carbon cycle analysis developed by west and marland 2002 has been completed for agricultural inputs resulting in estimates of net carbon flux for three crop types across three tillage intensities with the development of statistical technology and the intensification of global warming the research on carbon emission is increasing carbon emission has become a hot issue in the field of resource and environment many scholars have studied the strategies in emission reduction and the influencing factors from different perspectives dietz et al 2009 proposed that the potential of household action deserves increased policy attention and domestic consumption has a strong bear on carbon emissions ali and abbas 2013 found that use of multiple tools and techniques deliver better results in carbon emission mitigation tracer research the expert system was developed by zhou 2015 to enhance performance and efficiency of the co2 capture process through comparing the changes in urban energy uses and co2 emissions in china it was shown that the 35 largest cities in china which contain 18 of the population contribute 40 of china s energy utilization and co2 emissions dhakal 2009 although the research object is different the similarity of these literatures mentioned above is related to the research of carbon element most of the researches only analyze the impact of one sector such as domestic consumption and energy utilization on carbon emissions rather than the overall analysis of different industrial sectors specifically these researches didn t involve the carbon emissions generated by intersectoral interactions later in order to study the flows among various sectors in the system and realize the mutual transformation of economic data and ecological elements the methodologies proposed by leontief 1974 1952 were widely applied to analyze specific cases leontief 1936 after that scholars introduced the specific calculation methods and formulas using monetary input output tables to compile the corresponding physical input output tables duchin 2004 zhang et al 2014a b many ecological elements have been analyzed through this method such as virtual water energy carbon and so on for instance fang et al chose ecological network analysis based on input output tables as a useful tool to examine the structure and function of virtual water network and the interactions among sectors fang and chen 2015 dai et al 2014 developed an extended exergy based sustainability indices system which had been established to provide an epitomized exploration for evaluating the performance of flows and storages with the system from a sustainability perspective yang et al 2012 addressed the issues of the indirect effects of virtual water trade through the global economic circulation and used ecological network analysis ena to shed insight into the complicated system interactions as one of the key elements in the urban metabolism system carbon has been investigated based on ena chen and chen 2012 developed a carbon flux model based on network environ analysis within the urban ecosystem of vienna a carbon metabolic network has been constructed by modeling the carbon flows between economic sectors and environment by chen et al 2015a b a model that integrated the carbon cycle with economic activities in the 2002 u s economy was developed by singh and bakshi 2015 economic activities can be captured through the economic input output model they studied carbon rather than carbon dioxide from the perspective of the application of i o table there are many research on carbon or other elements but few analyses about carbon emission therefore the study of carbon emission metabolism based on input output tables is rare and necessary in recent years the population of guangdong province has maintained a sustained growth trend in 2012 with gdp ranking first in china guangdong province has the largest population as well accounting for 7 3 of the total population at the same time the rapid development of economy brought up a large amount of carbon emissions in terms of the metabolism of carbon emissions guangdong s per capita carbon emission is much higher than some cities of developed countries such as the united states japan and so on moreover from 2000 to 2012 the total carbon emissions of guangdong province increased year by year which needs extensive attention carbon dioxide generated indirectly by the various industrial sectors is an important study content comparing with direct emissions metabolism hidden between sectors which appear to be no carbon emission flows is the focus of research in addition carbon emission metabolism of various sectors varies significantly due to the compound complexity and diversity in the system the specific studies on each sector s emission performance are of great significance for generating effective emission reduction measures and overall development planning wilbanks and kates 1999 however at present there are limited researches on carbon emissions in guangdong province with most of them are focused on the direct emissions the previous input output analysis for other regions can only reflect the local situation around the administrative boundaries chen et al 2010 2015a b the results of a certain area couldn t be extended to guangdong province since the difference of economic development degree and population level what s more most previous studies focused on the impacts of a single sector on carbon emissions while the systemic impacts of other sectors were ignored therefore the objective of this study is to get a holistic assessment of the carbon dioxide flows among sectors of guangdong province in 2012 and give a comparison of the efficiency of carbon emissions between guangdong and the whole nation in detail a carbon emission metabolic network encompassing the urban economy and environment will be proposed the direct and indirect flows among sectors and four types of ecological relationships will be compiled with methodology derived from input output analysis the dependences of one sector on other sectors will be presented to illustrate the sector s control and dependence over the system what s more an eff lorenz curve will be developed for the thirteen sectors in guangdong province to further compare the efficiency of different sectors in the system the results of this study are expected to find the sectors conductive to reducing the carbon emissions and provide assistant in policy formulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 structure of network model carbon emission network cen model is developed to illustrate the interactions and flows among different sectors here carbon emissions refer to the carbon dioxide emitted to the environment the cen model is established based on the economic input output model framework via incorporating with statistic data about carbon emissions of each sectors cen consists of thirteen distinctive sectors agriculture sector agr energy production sector cpg mining sector min manufacturing sector man electric power steam and hot water esw gas gas tap water tw construction sector con transportation sector tra wholesale retail trade and catering wrc service sector ser and domestic consumption dom for the monetary input output tables the rows of such a table describe the distribution of a producer s output throughout the economy and the columns describe the composition of inputs required by a particular industry to produce its output simpson and tsukui 1965 we defined that the direction in fji is from sector i to sector j embodied ecological element intensity enabled the conversion of the monetary input and output value flows to carbon dioxide flows among sectors which could be calculated by eqs 1 and 2 zhang et al 2014a b 1 p ε h ε u where h represents the value flow among sectors u is a diagonal matrix composed of the total output of each sector p is the initial resource or waste that flow into or out of the sector here carbon emission is the negative ecological element we are going to discuss as the initial input then 2 ε p u h 1 where ε i represents the embodied intensity of sector i let the embodied intensity matrix multiply the corresponding flows in the value matrix h then the final physical input output tables is established which can be referred in table s6 in the cen model f j i contains carbon dioxide flows among sectors with the direction from the production side to others on the consumption side the initial input is defined as the direct flows according to the mass balance theory the total amounts of carbon dioxide flowing into a sector should be equal to the carbon dioxide flowing out of the sector which can be calculated by eq 3 zhang et al 2017 3 t i i n j 1 n f i j z i t i o u t j 1 n f j i y i where t i i n is the total carbon inflow to sector i and t i o u t is total carbon outflow from i z i and y i represent the boundary input and output of sector i flowing into or out of the system respectively let directional lines that connect two sectors represent the carbon dioxide flows among sectors and a simple virtual system of three sectors is taken as an example in fig 1 the data used was mainly collected from the state statistical bureau of china and guangdong statistical yearbook of 2012 which were compiled by the central government and guangdong province 2 2 network utility analysis network utility analysis is an ecological network approach that was first proposed by patten 1992 to analyze the mutual relationship between pairwise sectors in these thirteen sectors positive utility represents the acquisition of resources while negative utility means the loss of resources or the elements direct and integral relationships between two sectors can be identified through the formulas as follows direct relationships of different sectors can be identified by a dimensionless direct utility matrix d 4 d d j i f j i f i j t j 5 t j i 1 n f j i z j where t j is the input oriented through flow of sector j when the system is at a steady state z j is the carbon dioxide defined as the initial resources or wastes transferred into the system a dimensionless integral utility matrix u is developed to analyze the indirect flow pathways between pairwise sectors which can help to determine the direction is from i to j or j to i this matrix can be calculated by the eq 6 6 u u 0 u 1 u 2 u l i d 1 the summation of all paths of all orders is given by the divergent power series especially the principle diagonal elements of the matrix u are always positive because it is assumed that all sectors have a positive effect on themselves sign d and sign u are developed by keeping the signs of the data in the matrix d and u for each pair of sectors two signs can be got from opposite directions i to j and j to i respectively the relationship between two sectors can be obtained from the combination of the two signs getting from the sign matrix for the pairwise signs got from sign d and sign u stands for mutualistic relationship or for exploitation relationship for competition and 0 0 for neutrality li et al 2012 for instance s u 21 s u 12 indicates the relationship that sector 2 exploits sector 1 which means sector 1 s output to sector 2 is more than it received from sector 2 s u 21 s u 12 0 0 indicates the equality of the two directions instead of the absence of transactions between the sectors s u 21 s u 12 stands for competition indicating sector 1 competes with sector 2 a mutualism index m is promoted to reflect the ratio of positive and negative signs in the sign matrices which can be expressed as the eq 7 7 m j s s the integral utility matrix u is taken as an example the mutualism index of system can be expressed as eq 8 8 m s u s u where s u j i max s i g n u j i 0 is the number of all positive signs in the matrix u while s u j i min s i g n u j i 0 is the number of all negative signs in the matrix u if the amount of positive signs is more than negative signs the system possesses more positive relationships instead of negative relationships conversely if the system has more negative signs than positive signs maybe the system is in an unstable state and many problems must be solved or mitigated 2 3 network control analysis network control analysis is a scientific method developed to identify the dependencies among different sectors in the system the interdependence between sectors can be calculated according to carbon dioxide flows between sectors it can be represented by a matrix c n c n j i which can be calculated by the proportion of the integral flow from sector i to sector j to the integral flow from sector j to sector i as the eq 9 9 c n j i n j i n i j there are many negative signs in this matrix without physical significance so when n j i n i j 1 c n j i 1 n j i n i j otherwise c n j i 0 for instance if the output of i has less influence on j than i receives from j then i is said to be dependent on or controlled by j here n j i and n i j can be calculated using eqs 10 and 11 10 n i g g f j i t j 11 n i g g f i j t i for example c n 12 0 9 means the dependence of sector 2 on sector 1 is 90 c n 13 0 indicates that sector 3 has no dependence on sector 1 2 4 eff lorenz curve network efficiency analysis nea is a mathematical method derived from the painting of lorenz curve to compare the rate of carbon emissions from different sectors the curve named eff lorenz curve is used to compare the amount of carbon dioxide discharged by creating per unit monetary value within the overall system configuration therefore the efficient of emission rate index ei is first defined as eq 12 12 e i i p c i p o i where p c i c i i 1 n c i is the ratio of carbon emissions from sector i to the total carbon emissions p o i o i i 1 n o i is the ratio of the economic output from sector i to the total output there are thirteen data of ei calculated by eq 9 representing the rate of carbon emissions from different sectors of guangdong province or all over the country for comparison we can exhibit the data of both guangdong province and china in the same diagram section 3 4 rearranging the order of sectors according to the data of ei in the sequence from small to large i 1 2 n the coordinates of points on the eff lorenz curve can be got from the following formula 13 each point represents a sector plotted by cumulative share of total output on the horizontal axis and the cumulative share of total carbon emissions on the vertical these points can be eventually synthesized on a monotonically increasing curve for the point the slope of the tangent line represents the carbon emission rate of the sector 13 p o k i 1 k p o i p c k i 1 k p c i 3 results 3 1 direct and indirect carbon emissions according to guangdong input and output tables of 42 sectors in the year of 2012 the direct carbon emissions of the first second tertiary industry and domestic consumption are 4 29 mt 400 93 mt 68 20 mt 30 88 mt accounting for 0 85 79 50 13 82 6 12 respectively fig s1 it indicates that the direct carbon emissions are mainly concentrated in the secondary and tertiary industries where the production and supply of electric power steam and hot water esw account for 54 4 of the total amount of direct carbon emissions 24 17 carbon emissions were produced by the manufacturing industry which is one pillar industry in guangdong province nonmetal mineral products smelting and pressing of ferrous and nonferrous metals accounted for a large proportion of carbon emissions in manufacture industry as an indispensable sector the transportation industry generated a share of 11 23 of carbon emissions ranking third in the total amount of carbon emissions with a population of 105 94 billion guangdong is the most populous province in china and maintains a state of continuous growth due to the pressure of carbon emissions from resident activities domestic consumptions produced direct carbon emissions with a ratio of 6 12 which is higher than other nine sectors therefore low carbon life should be advocated to reduce the carbon emissions and improve the quality of urban and rural environment as shown in fig 2 it is essential to analyze the amount of indirect carbon emissions since it is much higher than the direct emissions the indirect carbon emissions i 1 n f j i of different sectors can be obtained from the input output tables of guangdong province which provided us a basis for analyzing the problematic processes existing in this region it is obvious that the indirect carbon emissions of manufacturing sector man are much higher than other sectors meanwhile the direct emission of man is lower than its indirect emissions for instance comparing with the production of manufacturing products such as tobacco the carbon dioxide emitted in the utilization process is larger the agricultural sector agr emitted almost no direct carbon dioxide while the indirect carbon emissions were very large indicating that agr sector produced lots of emissions in the process of consumption instead of production for instance crop straw burning livestock respiration and metabolism would produce little direct emissions while the utilization of electricity and diesel emits a lot indirectly in the process of agricultural production the same phenomenon can be detected in service and construction sectors domestic consumption and transportation sectors emitted indirectly two or ten times as much carbon dioxide as direct emissions while the direct and indirect emissions were approximately equal for the esw sector it is worth noting that the amount of emissions of cpg and min sectors was almost zero either directly or indirectly this phenomenon is due to the energy and mining products needed for social operation are import based instead of self produced in guangdong province 3 2 network utility analysis to analyze the direct relationships between sectors matrix d table s7 has been calculated in all 78 pairs of relationships obtained from sign d there are only two types of relationships exploitation i e 76 pairs and neutralism i e 2 pairs excluding self self take an example of exploitation d 12 4 d 4 12 0 113 0 018 indicates that manufacturing sector has a positive effect on service sector during the direct transactions while service sector gives manufacturing sector a negative effect the output of manufacturing sector to service sector exceeds the output from service to manufacturing as a contributor manufacturing sector gives more to service sector than it receives from service sector which plays a role as a consumer the direct relationships of waste and gas production sector and mining and gas production sector are neutral the emission flow in two directions is equal instead of nonexistent indicating that the opposing transactions between sector 5 and sector 7 sector 3 and sector 7 are identical respectively the integral utility intensity matrix could provide a more comprehensive analysis of the integral relationships among various sectors three kinds of relationships including exploitation competition and mutualism can be seen from table s8 accounting for 70 51 15 38 and 14 10 respectively fig s2 for exploitation u 12 4 u 4 12 0 076 0 020 indicates that the positive utility of manufacturing sector to service sector is 0 076 accounting for 6 5 of all positive utilities in service sector excluding self self compared to other sectors the impact of manufacturing sector on service sector is still significant there are 12 pairs of competitive sectors in the integral utility matrix such as esw sector and gas sector indicating that the two sectors are competitors in the carbon emission flows s u 67 s u 76 indicates that the transactions between esw sector and gas sector are conducive to emission reduction there are 11 pairs of mutualism relationship in this system fig 3 could visually indicate the direct and integral relationships among sectors for the overall analysis different colors represent different data as the illustration on the right for fig 3 b the column on behalf of the con sector is all white or yellow showing that the carbon emissions input by other sectors to con is higher than the output of con to the others as an exploiter the con sector obtains positive effects from other twelve sectors and it is controlled by other sectors through the emission relationship the con sector can trace its emission source further adjust its industrial structure to achieve the emission goal the numbers in the row of the tra sector are positive which further indicate that the tra sector is exploited by most of the sectors as a contributor the tra sector transfers more carbon emissions to other sectors than it receives the tra sector have positive effects on other sectors while others exert negative utilities on tra sector that is reducing the interflows of the tra sector with other sectors would have a positive impact on emissions produced in the process of trading with agr cpg min was gas con and other sectors the same phenomenon can be detected in the esw sector the color of the main diagonal is white showing that the utility of itself is positive symmetric color blocks represent two sectors with the main diagonal as the symmetric axis if the colors of the two blocks are the same or similar showing that they are competitive or mutual relationship for was and esw sectors the colors of the two blocks are dark red giving an adequate illustration of the competitive relationship between the two sectors which leads to negative impacts for both sectors from the perspective of negative resource competition relationship is conductive to the reduction of carbon emissions because of their mutual restriction relationship the relationship between gas and con sectors is mutualism and they can benefit from their interaction but from the perspective of negative resource it is an unfavorable relationship that is the two sectors are mutually reinforcing the emission of carbon dioxide and the status quo should be changed which provides an opportunity to reduce the carbon emissions for example reducing the carbon emissions from the gas sector will lead to a reduction of carbon emissions in the con sector it can be seen from both fig 3 a and b that three kinds of imparities occurred in the system from 0 0 to from to and from to for instance the direct relationship was neutral 0 0 while the integral relationship was mutualism between mining and gas supply industries this result shows that the direct flows in opposite directions between two sectors tend to be equal but the two sectors are mutually reinforcing in the integral relationship in another case the direct relationship between the esw sector and gas sector is exploitative while the integral relationship is competitive gas sector give esw sector more carbon emissions than esw to gas when two sectors are involved in carbon emission activities of multiple nodes they are competitors which are invisible in physical data in addition the mutualism index is equal to 1 0 in matrix d while m j u 90 79 1 14 in matrix u showed that the number of positive signs is more than negative signs the system was in a symbiotic and orderly state and guangdong province had a relatively stable environment from the perspective of mutualism index m 3 3 the dependence on other sectors fig 4 shows the dependence of one sector on other sectors from center to the outside the value increase gradually ranging from 0 to 1 each sector s reliance on other sectors is represented by points in different colors for example a red dot representing dom sector in the middle of the line segment of gas sector illustrates the dependency of dom on gas is 55 69 detailed data is shown in table s9 with elements ranging from 0 to 0 99 in the control matrix c n 19 0 96 means the dependence of con sector on agr sector is 96 there are 12 sectors having reliance on cpg sector while the number of sectors depending on con sector is zero compared to other sectors numbers of points in the two sectors of cpg and esw are placed away from the center and near the margin that is many other sectors are heavily dependent on the two sectors almost more than 50 the behavior of these two sectors will influence the carbon emission of other sectors there are many sectors having reliance on tw gas and was sectors with the number of 7 8 and 10 respectively accounting for less than 50 the technologies in the above sectors should be improved to reduce carbon emissions i e upgrading the clean combustion technology to drive other sectors to cut emissions all data in the column of con sector found to be zero illustrate that no sectors have reliance on con sector while con sector is heavily dependent on others from the perspective of carbon emissions con is a sector that requires support from other sectors and the behavior of other sectors has a significance impact on the con sector contrarily points colored by dark grey are located close to the outermost location illustrating that the dependence of con sector on other sectors is always more than 90 the input of other sectors would determine the carbon emissions of the con sector and the production structure of the con sector must be adjusted to achieving the reduction goal which can be used as a reference for decision makers to formulate the reduction policies it was in line with the industrial restructuring plan of guangdong province in 2012 which advocated the development of construction sector in the second industry the same phenomenon can be detected in the man and wrc sectors 3 4 network efficiency analysis of carbon emissions comparison of carbon emission rate of 13 sectors in guangdong province can be found in fig 5 with a largest slope esw sector produces more carbon emissions than other sectors by generating economic value per unit with a large population and a serious demand of energy carbon emission rate of esw sector in guangdong province is almost ten times as much as wrc sector man sector has a relatively high level of economic value and a relatively high level of carbon emissions but the carbon emission rate is at a moderate level comparing with other sectors i e 0 468 the reason for this phenomenon is that as two important components of man sector metal and nonmetal industry accounting for the largest share of carbon emissions and food production industry with less carbon emissions can lower the average economic value and carbon emissions of dom sector are also significant among 13 sectors while the carbon emission rate of dom is at a moderate level from the perspective of carbon emission dom sector is a very flexible sector in reducing carbon emissions by enhancing the diathesis of residents table 1 there are blue and orange dots representing carbon emission rate of the nation and guangdong province in fig 6 respectively the emission rate of nine sectors in guangdong province including agr min man was gas tw con ser dom are basically the same as china in fig 6 the orange spot of tra sector is located below the blue point indicating that the carbon emission rate of guangdong province is lower than the national level because of the large scale introduction of electric buses and private cars instead of gasoline vehicles the carbon emission rate of cpg sector is also lower than the national level because of the energy shortage in guangdong province the import rate is up to 90 and almost all depend on the outside world in contrast the carbon emission rate of wrc sector in guangdong province is higher than the national level the pillar industry is the tertiary industry with a proportion of over 50 of the total gdp of guangdong and the wrc sector as an important component of the tertiary industry has a high carbon emission rate 4 discussion this study integrates the notion of carbon emission metabolism and highlights the importance of the direct and indirect flows among sectors which could be calculated by various formulas referring to the economic input output analysis ecological network analysis uncovers the mutual relationships between pairwise sectors and the control and dependence intensity in addition network efficiency analysis derived from the painting of lorenz curve is conductive to compare the amount of carbon dioxide discharged by producing per unit of monetary value within the overall system configuration by comparing the carbon emission rate of guangdong province and the whole country this study provides a foundation to analyze the functional and structural attributes 4 1 sectors with large embodied carbon emissions in this study as a pillar sector of guangdong province the embodied carbon emission of man sector is the largest among the thirteen sectors with indirect carbon emissions are ten times higher than the direct emissions which should be paid much attention to in formulating the reduction policies policies should be proposed to adjust the proportion of relevant components with large carbon emissions such as mental and nonmetallic industries included in man sector esw sector has a large amount of carbon emissions which is consistent with the actual situation as a power supply sector esw sector makes great contributions to the normal operation of cities and inevitably emits a lot of carbon emissions which is closely related to the nature of the sectors specially because of the small direct carbon emissions agr sector and tra sector are likely to be easily overlooked in the formulation of emission reduction policies in the case of guangdong province carbon emissions from agr sector and tra sector take place in the utilization of products in various sectors rather than direct consumption although dom sector doesn t produce products residents consumption leads to much carbon emissions calling for a low carbon life is a quick and simple way to reduce the emissions effectively which could not be ignored and should be paid much attention to 4 2 mutual relationships this system has more positive utility relationships from the perspective of mutualism index which is higher than 1 it indicates that this system is in a symbiotic state with a relatively stable environment exploitation relationships exist in the pairwise sectors in which esw sector receives more carbon emissions than it transfers to wrc sector as an example there are 55 pairs of sectors with exploitation relationships accounting for nearly 70 of the total relationships whereas the competition and mutualism relationships remain less than 30 sectors with damaging relationships such as gas and tra sectors are harmed mutually by the relationship it is necessary to improve the level of mutualism in guangdong s metabolic system for its characteristics of mutual promotion 4 3 dependency intensity nca is a powerful tool which can be used to find out the implied dependence intensity between sectors there are several sectors having dependence on esw sector and cpg sector and the dependence is almost over 50 indicating that reduction policies on the two sectors would have a significant impact on other sectors specifically the con sector dependents heavily on other twelve sectors for over 90 whereas no sectors have dependence on it from the perspective of network control analysis the input of other sectors would determine the carbon emissions of the con sector and the production structure of the con sector must be changed in order to achieving the reduction goal this is in line with the industrial structure adjustment plan of guangdong province in 2012 to promote the development of the second industry especially in the con sector 4 4 efficiency comparison in the network efficiency analysis eff lorenz curve is used to compare the efficiency of carbon emissions by producing per unit of monetary value esw has the lowest efficiency due to the large consumption of energy consumed in the operation of the sector which is consistent with the sector s characteristic as guangdong has maintained a steady state of population growth dom is a resilient sector with much carbon emissions and lower efficiency the result of comparison with the nation is that the carbon emission rate of wrc sector of guangdong province is higher than the national level due to the developed light industry in guangdong province the low cost of products can attract external consumption and stimulate the economy it is in conformity with the principle of supporting the development of the tertiary industry 5 conclusions the innovation of this study is summarized as follows firstly for carbon emission the competition relationships reveal good interactions in terms of emission reduction while a mutualism relationship provides effective pathways to mitigate carbon emissions between pairwise sectors simultaneously secondly the analysis of dependency intensity could help identify whether the sectors should adjust their production structure or upgrade the clean combustion technology thirdly comparing emission efficiency of different sectors with other sectors could help find out the hidden sectors with large carbon emission rate it provides a new insight into the potential sectors which play an important role in the emission reduction we hope this paper could help decision makers better control the source of the carbon emissions which is conducive to the development of industrial structure towards low energy consumption and low carbon emissions in the future more insights could be found accurately if more detailed data is available which will facilitate the development of the target policies and corrective measures unfortunately there is no way to find specific data to a certain area such as the pearl river delta whereas we can provide more precise advice for smaller regions acknowledgements

25269,global warming has received more and more attention in recent years for its inevitable influence on population species soil ocean water and so on it is essential to investigate the urban metabolism of carbon emissions which is a main cause of global warming and most of it occurs in the process of production and living in urban areas in this paper a carbon emission metabolic network is established to explore the emission reduction strategies by modeling carbon dioxide flows and identifying the mutual relationships based on the input output analysis specifically eff lorenz curve derived from the painting of lorenz curve is developed to compare the efficiency of carbon emissions from different sectors the newly developed method has been applied to guangdong province to demonstrate its availability and benefit it is revealed that carbon emissions mainly concentrated in the secondary and tertiary industries with electric power generation manufacturing industry domestic consumption and transportation ranking at the top the competition relationship reveals good interactions in terms of emission reduction while a mutualism relationship provides effective pathways to mitigate carbon emissions between pairwise sectors simultaneously in guangdong province upgrading the clean combustion technology in electric power generation and energy extraction sectors would drive other sectors to cut emissions and adjusting the production structure of the construction sector also contribute to achieve this goal the results are expected to provide corresponding and holistic reference for decision makers to develop the mitigation policies keywords input output table carbon emission urban metabolism mitigation ecological network analysis guangdong province 1 introduction as a part of atmosphere carbon dioxide is mainly produced by the burning of carbonaceous material animal metabolism land cover and anthropogenic activities although carbon dioxide is essential in the process of urban metabolism and economic activities excessive existence of it as the main component of greenhouse gases is responsible for global climate change and anomalies karl and trenberth 2003 ofipcc 2013 carbon dioxide has an excellent thermal insulation effect which can coat the earth with a thick down jacket coles 2003 kosugi 2009 in the last century the global temperature was increased by 0 6 c cox et al 2000 accompanied with the rise of sea level frölicher and joos 2010 2009 the shifts of species davis et al 1998 the widespread of epidemic disease pounds et al 2006 the decline of rice yields peng et al 2004 swain 2010 and so on the global warming seriously affected the economy development and caused great threat on the security of socio economic system root et al 2003 logan et al 2003 therefore it is important to connect the invisible hands into visible data and investigate the mechanism of the urban metabolism system which will further help to alleviate the pressure of carbon emissions wolman 1965 in the early days due to the limitations of statistical methods and technologies carbon emission data were difficult to be obtained carbon cycle attracted scholars attention and a vast of case studies have been conducted including the middle latitudes in the northern hemisphere levin and kromer 2004 north america pataki et al 2006 toronto sahely et al 2003 beijing feng et al 2013 guangyuan hao 2017 and so on bolin 1970 studied the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and referred to the global carbon cycle larsen and hertwich 2009 tracked the impact of carbon footprints on climate changes based on consumption a full carbon cycle analysis developed by west and marland 2002 has been completed for agricultural inputs resulting in estimates of net carbon flux for three crop types across three tillage intensities with the development of statistical technology and the intensification of global warming the research on carbon emission is increasing carbon emission has become a hot issue in the field of resource and environment many scholars have studied the strategies in emission reduction and the influencing factors from different perspectives dietz et al 2009 proposed that the potential of household action deserves increased policy attention and domestic consumption has a strong bear on carbon emissions ali and abbas 2013 found that use of multiple tools and techniques deliver better results in carbon emission mitigation tracer research the expert system was developed by zhou 2015 to enhance performance and efficiency of the co2 capture process through comparing the changes in urban energy uses and co2 emissions in china it was shown that the 35 largest cities in china which contain 18 of the population contribute 40 of china s energy utilization and co2 emissions dhakal 2009 although the research object is different the similarity of these literatures mentioned above is related to the research of carbon element most of the researches only analyze the impact of one sector such as domestic consumption and energy utilization on carbon emissions rather than the overall analysis of different industrial sectors specifically these researches didn t involve the carbon emissions generated by intersectoral interactions later in order to study the flows among various sectors in the system and realize the mutual transformation of economic data and ecological elements the methodologies proposed by leontief 1974 1952 were widely applied to analyze specific cases leontief 1936 after that scholars introduced the specific calculation methods and formulas using monetary input output tables to compile the corresponding physical input output tables duchin 2004 zhang et al 2014a b many ecological elements have been analyzed through this method such as virtual water energy carbon and so on for instance fang et al chose ecological network analysis based on input output tables as a useful tool to examine the structure and function of virtual water network and the interactions among sectors fang and chen 2015 dai et al 2014 developed an extended exergy based sustainability indices system which had been established to provide an epitomized exploration for evaluating the performance of flows and storages with the system from a sustainability perspective yang et al 2012 addressed the issues of the indirect effects of virtual water trade through the global economic circulation and used ecological network analysis ena to shed insight into the complicated system interactions as one of the key elements in the urban metabolism system carbon has been investigated based on ena chen and chen 2012 developed a carbon flux model based on network environ analysis within the urban ecosystem of vienna a carbon metabolic network has been constructed by modeling the carbon flows between economic sectors and environment by chen et al 2015a b a model that integrated the carbon cycle with economic activities in the 2002 u s economy was developed by singh and bakshi 2015 economic activities can be captured through the economic input output model they studied carbon rather than carbon dioxide from the perspective of the application of i o table there are many research on carbon or other elements but few analyses about carbon emission therefore the study of carbon emission metabolism based on input output tables is rare and necessary in recent years the population of guangdong province has maintained a sustained growth trend in 2012 with gdp ranking first in china guangdong province has the largest population as well accounting for 7 3 of the total population at the same time the rapid development of economy brought up a large amount of carbon emissions in terms of the metabolism of carbon emissions guangdong s per capita carbon emission is much higher than some cities of developed countries such as the united states japan and so on moreover from 2000 to 2012 the total carbon emissions of guangdong province increased year by year which needs extensive attention carbon dioxide generated indirectly by the various industrial sectors is an important study content comparing with direct emissions metabolism hidden between sectors which appear to be no carbon emission flows is the focus of research in addition carbon emission metabolism of various sectors varies significantly due to the compound complexity and diversity in the system the specific studies on each sector s emission performance are of great significance for generating effective emission reduction measures and overall development planning wilbanks and kates 1999 however at present there are limited researches on carbon emissions in guangdong province with most of them are focused on the direct emissions the previous input output analysis for other regions can only reflect the local situation around the administrative boundaries chen et al 2010 2015a b the results of a certain area couldn t be extended to guangdong province since the difference of economic development degree and population level what s more most previous studies focused on the impacts of a single sector on carbon emissions while the systemic impacts of other sectors were ignored therefore the objective of this study is to get a holistic assessment of the carbon dioxide flows among sectors of guangdong province in 2012 and give a comparison of the efficiency of carbon emissions between guangdong and the whole nation in detail a carbon emission metabolic network encompassing the urban economy and environment will be proposed the direct and indirect flows among sectors and four types of ecological relationships will be compiled with methodology derived from input output analysis the dependences of one sector on other sectors will be presented to illustrate the sector s control and dependence over the system what s more an eff lorenz curve will be developed for the thirteen sectors in guangdong province to further compare the efficiency of different sectors in the system the results of this study are expected to find the sectors conductive to reducing the carbon emissions and provide assistant in policy formulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 structure of network model carbon emission network cen model is developed to illustrate the interactions and flows among different sectors here carbon emissions refer to the carbon dioxide emitted to the environment the cen model is established based on the economic input output model framework via incorporating with statistic data about carbon emissions of each sectors cen consists of thirteen distinctive sectors agriculture sector agr energy production sector cpg mining sector min manufacturing sector man electric power steam and hot water esw gas gas tap water tw construction sector con transportation sector tra wholesale retail trade and catering wrc service sector ser and domestic consumption dom for the monetary input output tables the rows of such a table describe the distribution of a producer s output throughout the economy and the columns describe the composition of inputs required by a particular industry to produce its output simpson and tsukui 1965 we defined that the direction in fji is from sector i to sector j embodied ecological element intensity enabled the conversion of the monetary input and output value flows to carbon dioxide flows among sectors which could be calculated by eqs 1 and 2 zhang et al 2014a b 1 p ε h ε u where h represents the value flow among sectors u is a diagonal matrix composed of the total output of each sector p is the initial resource or waste that flow into or out of the sector here carbon emission is the negative ecological element we are going to discuss as the initial input then 2 ε p u h 1 where ε i represents the embodied intensity of sector i let the embodied intensity matrix multiply the corresponding flows in the value matrix h then the final physical input output tables is established which can be referred in table s6 in the cen model f j i contains carbon dioxide flows among sectors with the direction from the production side to others on the consumption side the initial input is defined as the direct flows according to the mass balance theory the total amounts of carbon dioxide flowing into a sector should be equal to the carbon dioxide flowing out of the sector which can be calculated by eq 3 zhang et al 2017 3 t i i n j 1 n f i j z i t i o u t j 1 n f j i y i where t i i n is the total carbon inflow to sector i and t i o u t is total carbon outflow from i z i and y i represent the boundary input and output of sector i flowing into or out of the system respectively let directional lines that connect two sectors represent the carbon dioxide flows among sectors and a simple virtual system of three sectors is taken as an example in fig 1 the data used was mainly collected from the state statistical bureau of china and guangdong statistical yearbook of 2012 which were compiled by the central government and guangdong province 2 2 network utility analysis network utility analysis is an ecological network approach that was first proposed by patten 1992 to analyze the mutual relationship between pairwise sectors in these thirteen sectors positive utility represents the acquisition of resources while negative utility means the loss of resources or the elements direct and integral relationships between two sectors can be identified through the formulas as follows direct relationships of different sectors can be identified by a dimensionless direct utility matrix d 4 d d j i f j i f i j t j 5 t j i 1 n f j i z j where t j is the input oriented through flow of sector j when the system is at a steady state z j is the carbon dioxide defined as the initial resources or wastes transferred into the system a dimensionless integral utility matrix u is developed to analyze the indirect flow pathways between pairwise sectors which can help to determine the direction is from i to j or j to i this matrix can be calculated by the eq 6 6 u u 0 u 1 u 2 u l i d 1 the summation of all paths of all orders is given by the divergent power series especially the principle diagonal elements of the matrix u are always positive because it is assumed that all sectors have a positive effect on themselves sign d and sign u are developed by keeping the signs of the data in the matrix d and u for each pair of sectors two signs can be got from opposite directions i to j and j to i respectively the relationship between two sectors can be obtained from the combination of the two signs getting from the sign matrix for the pairwise signs got from sign d and sign u stands for mutualistic relationship or for exploitation relationship for competition and 0 0 for neutrality li et al 2012 for instance s u 21 s u 12 indicates the relationship that sector 2 exploits sector 1 which means sector 1 s output to sector 2 is more than it received from sector 2 s u 21 s u 12 0 0 indicates the equality of the two directions instead of the absence of transactions between the sectors s u 21 s u 12 stands for competition indicating sector 1 competes with sector 2 a mutualism index m is promoted to reflect the ratio of positive and negative signs in the sign matrices which can be expressed as the eq 7 7 m j s s the integral utility matrix u is taken as an example the mutualism index of system can be expressed as eq 8 8 m s u s u where s u j i max s i g n u j i 0 is the number of all positive signs in the matrix u while s u j i min s i g n u j i 0 is the number of all negative signs in the matrix u if the amount of positive signs is more than negative signs the system possesses more positive relationships instead of negative relationships conversely if the system has more negative signs than positive signs maybe the system is in an unstable state and many problems must be solved or mitigated 2 3 network control analysis network control analysis is a scientific method developed to identify the dependencies among different sectors in the system the interdependence between sectors can be calculated according to carbon dioxide flows between sectors it can be represented by a matrix c n c n j i which can be calculated by the proportion of the integral flow from sector i to sector j to the integral flow from sector j to sector i as the eq 9 9 c n j i n j i n i j there are many negative signs in this matrix without physical significance so when n j i n i j 1 c n j i 1 n j i n i j otherwise c n j i 0 for instance if the output of i has less influence on j than i receives from j then i is said to be dependent on or controlled by j here n j i and n i j can be calculated using eqs 10 and 11 10 n i g g f j i t j 11 n i g g f i j t i for example c n 12 0 9 means the dependence of sector 2 on sector 1 is 90 c n 13 0 indicates that sector 3 has no dependence on sector 1 2 4 eff lorenz curve network efficiency analysis nea is a mathematical method derived from the painting of lorenz curve to compare the rate of carbon emissions from different sectors the curve named eff lorenz curve is used to compare the amount of carbon dioxide discharged by creating per unit monetary value within the overall system configuration therefore the efficient of emission rate index ei is first defined as eq 12 12 e i i p c i p o i where p c i c i i 1 n c i is the ratio of carbon emissions from sector i to the total carbon emissions p o i o i i 1 n o i is the ratio of the economic output from sector i to the total output there are thirteen data of ei calculated by eq 9 representing the rate of carbon emissions from different sectors of guangdong province or all over the country for comparison we can exhibit the data of both guangdong province and china in the same diagram section 3 4 rearranging the order of sectors according to the data of ei in the sequence from small to large i 1 2 n the coordinates of points on the eff lorenz curve can be got from the following formula 13 each point represents a sector plotted by cumulative share of total output on the horizontal axis and the cumulative share of total carbon emissions on the vertical these points can be eventually synthesized on a monotonically increasing curve for the point the slope of the tangent line represents the carbon emission rate of the sector 13 p o k i 1 k p o i p c k i 1 k p c i 3 results 3 1 direct and indirect carbon emissions according to guangdong input and output tables of 42 sectors in the year of 2012 the direct carbon emissions of the first second tertiary industry and domestic consumption are 4 29 mt 400 93 mt 68 20 mt 30 88 mt accounting for 0 85 79 50 13 82 6 12 respectively fig s1 it indicates that the direct carbon emissions are mainly concentrated in the secondary and tertiary industries where the production and supply of electric power steam and hot water esw account for 54 4 of the total amount of direct carbon emissions 24 17 carbon emissions were produced by the manufacturing industry which is one pillar industry in guangdong province nonmetal mineral products smelting and pressing of ferrous and nonferrous metals accounted for a large proportion of carbon emissions in manufacture industry as an indispensable sector the transportation industry generated a share of 11 23 of carbon emissions ranking third in the total amount of carbon emissions with a population of 105 94 billion guangdong is the most populous province in china and maintains a state of continuous growth due to the pressure of carbon emissions from resident activities domestic consumptions produced direct carbon emissions with a ratio of 6 12 which is higher than other nine sectors therefore low carbon life should be advocated to reduce the carbon emissions and improve the quality of urban and rural environment as shown in fig 2 it is essential to analyze the amount of indirect carbon emissions since it is much higher than the direct emissions the indirect carbon emissions i 1 n f j i of different sectors can be obtained from the input output tables of guangdong province which provided us a basis for analyzing the problematic processes existing in this region it is obvious that the indirect carbon emissions of manufacturing sector man are much higher than other sectors meanwhile the direct emission of man is lower than its indirect emissions for instance comparing with the production of manufacturing products such as tobacco the carbon dioxide emitted in the utilization process is larger the agricultural sector agr emitted almost no direct carbon dioxide while the indirect carbon emissions were very large indicating that agr sector produced lots of emissions in the process of consumption instead of production for instance crop straw burning livestock respiration and metabolism would produce little direct emissions while the utilization of electricity and diesel emits a lot indirectly in the process of agricultural production the same phenomenon can be detected in service and construction sectors domestic consumption and transportation sectors emitted indirectly two or ten times as much carbon dioxide as direct emissions while the direct and indirect emissions were approximately equal for the esw sector it is worth noting that the amount of emissions of cpg and min sectors was almost zero either directly or indirectly this phenomenon is due to the energy and mining products needed for social operation are import based instead of self produced in guangdong province 3 2 network utility analysis to analyze the direct relationships between sectors matrix d table s7 has been calculated in all 78 pairs of relationships obtained from sign d there are only two types of relationships exploitation i e 76 pairs and neutralism i e 2 pairs excluding self self take an example of exploitation d 12 4 d 4 12 0 113 0 018 indicates that manufacturing sector has a positive effect on service sector during the direct transactions while service sector gives manufacturing sector a negative effect the output of manufacturing sector to service sector exceeds the output from service to manufacturing as a contributor manufacturing sector gives more to service sector than it receives from service sector which plays a role as a consumer the direct relationships of waste and gas production sector and mining and gas production sector are neutral the emission flow in two directions is equal instead of nonexistent indicating that the opposing transactions between sector 5 and sector 7 sector 3 and sector 7 are identical respectively the integral utility intensity matrix could provide a more comprehensive analysis of the integral relationships among various sectors three kinds of relationships including exploitation competition and mutualism can be seen from table s8 accounting for 70 51 15 38 and 14 10 respectively fig s2 for exploitation u 12 4 u 4 12 0 076 0 020 indicates that the positive utility of manufacturing sector to service sector is 0 076 accounting for 6 5 of all positive utilities in service sector excluding self self compared to other sectors the impact of manufacturing sector on service sector is still significant there are 12 pairs of competitive sectors in the integral utility matrix such as esw sector and gas sector indicating that the two sectors are competitors in the carbon emission flows s u 67 s u 76 indicates that the transactions between esw sector and gas sector are conducive to emission reduction there are 11 pairs of mutualism relationship in this system fig 3 could visually indicate the direct and integral relationships among sectors for the overall analysis different colors represent different data as the illustration on the right for fig 3 b the column on behalf of the con sector is all white or yellow showing that the carbon emissions input by other sectors to con is higher than the output of con to the others as an exploiter the con sector obtains positive effects from other twelve sectors and it is controlled by other sectors through the emission relationship the con sector can trace its emission source further adjust its industrial structure to achieve the emission goal the numbers in the row of the tra sector are positive which further indicate that the tra sector is exploited by most of the sectors as a contributor the tra sector transfers more carbon emissions to other sectors than it receives the tra sector have positive effects on other sectors while others exert negative utilities on tra sector that is reducing the interflows of the tra sector with other sectors would have a positive impact on emissions produced in the process of trading with agr cpg min was gas con and other sectors the same phenomenon can be detected in the esw sector the color of the main diagonal is white showing that the utility of itself is positive symmetric color blocks represent two sectors with the main diagonal as the symmetric axis if the colors of the two blocks are the same or similar showing that they are competitive or mutual relationship for was and esw sectors the colors of the two blocks are dark red giving an adequate illustration of the competitive relationship between the two sectors which leads to negative impacts for both sectors from the perspective of negative resource competition relationship is conductive to the reduction of carbon emissions because of their mutual restriction relationship the relationship between gas and con sectors is mutualism and they can benefit from their interaction but from the perspective of negative resource it is an unfavorable relationship that is the two sectors are mutually reinforcing the emission of carbon dioxide and the status quo should be changed which provides an opportunity to reduce the carbon emissions for example reducing the carbon emissions from the gas sector will lead to a reduction of carbon emissions in the con sector it can be seen from both fig 3 a and b that three kinds of imparities occurred in the system from 0 0 to from to and from to for instance the direct relationship was neutral 0 0 while the integral relationship was mutualism between mining and gas supply industries this result shows that the direct flows in opposite directions between two sectors tend to be equal but the two sectors are mutually reinforcing in the integral relationship in another case the direct relationship between the esw sector and gas sector is exploitative while the integral relationship is competitive gas sector give esw sector more carbon emissions than esw to gas when two sectors are involved in carbon emission activities of multiple nodes they are competitors which are invisible in physical data in addition the mutualism index is equal to 1 0 in matrix d while m j u 90 79 1 14 in matrix u showed that the number of positive signs is more than negative signs the system was in a symbiotic and orderly state and guangdong province had a relatively stable environment from the perspective of mutualism index m 3 3 the dependence on other sectors fig 4 shows the dependence of one sector on other sectors from center to the outside the value increase gradually ranging from 0 to 1 each sector s reliance on other sectors is represented by points in different colors for example a red dot representing dom sector in the middle of the line segment of gas sector illustrates the dependency of dom on gas is 55 69 detailed data is shown in table s9 with elements ranging from 0 to 0 99 in the control matrix c n 19 0 96 means the dependence of con sector on agr sector is 96 there are 12 sectors having reliance on cpg sector while the number of sectors depending on con sector is zero compared to other sectors numbers of points in the two sectors of cpg and esw are placed away from the center and near the margin that is many other sectors are heavily dependent on the two sectors almost more than 50 the behavior of these two sectors will influence the carbon emission of other sectors there are many sectors having reliance on tw gas and was sectors with the number of 7 8 and 10 respectively accounting for less than 50 the technologies in the above sectors should be improved to reduce carbon emissions i e upgrading the clean combustion technology to drive other sectors to cut emissions all data in the column of con sector found to be zero illustrate that no sectors have reliance on con sector while con sector is heavily dependent on others from the perspective of carbon emissions con is a sector that requires support from other sectors and the behavior of other sectors has a significance impact on the con sector contrarily points colored by dark grey are located close to the outermost location illustrating that the dependence of con sector on other sectors is always more than 90 the input of other sectors would determine the carbon emissions of the con sector and the production structure of the con sector must be adjusted to achieving the reduction goal which can be used as a reference for decision makers to formulate the reduction policies it was in line with the industrial restructuring plan of guangdong province in 2012 which advocated the development of construction sector in the second industry the same phenomenon can be detected in the man and wrc sectors 3 4 network efficiency analysis of carbon emissions comparison of carbon emission rate of 13 sectors in guangdong province can be found in fig 5 with a largest slope esw sector produces more carbon emissions than other sectors by generating economic value per unit with a large population and a serious demand of energy carbon emission rate of esw sector in guangdong province is almost ten times as much as wrc sector man sector has a relatively high level of economic value and a relatively high level of carbon emissions but the carbon emission rate is at a moderate level comparing with other sectors i e 0 468 the reason for this phenomenon is that as two important components of man sector metal and nonmetal industry accounting for the largest share of carbon emissions and food production industry with less carbon emissions can lower the average economic value and carbon emissions of dom sector are also significant among 13 sectors while the carbon emission rate of dom is at a moderate level from the perspective of carbon emission dom sector is a very flexible sector in reducing carbon emissions by enhancing the diathesis of residents table 1 there are blue and orange dots representing carbon emission rate of the nation and guangdong province in fig 6 respectively the emission rate of nine sectors in guangdong province including agr min man was gas tw con ser dom are basically the same as china in fig 6 the orange spot of tra sector is located below the blue point indicating that the carbon emission rate of guangdong province is lower than the national level because of the large scale introduction of electric buses and private cars instead of gasoline vehicles the carbon emission rate of cpg sector is also lower than the national level because of the energy shortage in guangdong province the import rate is up to 90 and almost all depend on the outside world in contrast the carbon emission rate of wrc sector in guangdong province is higher than the national level the pillar industry is the tertiary industry with a proportion of over 50 of the total gdp of guangdong and the wrc sector as an important component of the tertiary industry has a high carbon emission rate 4 discussion this study integrates the notion of carbon emission metabolism and highlights the importance of the direct and indirect flows among sectors which could be calculated by various formulas referring to the economic input output analysis ecological network analysis uncovers the mutual relationships between pairwise sectors and the control and dependence intensity in addition network efficiency analysis derived from the painting of lorenz curve is conductive to compare the amount of carbon dioxide discharged by producing per unit of monetary value within the overall system configuration by comparing the carbon emission rate of guangdong province and the whole country this study provides a foundation to analyze the functional and structural attributes 4 1 sectors with large embodied carbon emissions in this study as a pillar sector of guangdong province the embodied carbon emission of man sector is the largest among the thirteen sectors with indirect carbon emissions are ten times higher than the direct emissions which should be paid much attention to in formulating the reduction policies policies should be proposed to adjust the proportion of relevant components with large carbon emissions such as mental and nonmetallic industries included in man sector esw sector has a large amount of carbon emissions which is consistent with the actual situation as a power supply sector esw sector makes great contributions to the normal operation of cities and inevitably emits a lot of carbon emissions which is closely related to the nature of the sectors specially because of the small direct carbon emissions agr sector and tra sector are likely to be easily overlooked in the formulation of emission reduction policies in the case of guangdong province carbon emissions from agr sector and tra sector take place in the utilization of products in various sectors rather than direct consumption although dom sector doesn t produce products residents consumption leads to much carbon emissions calling for a low carbon life is a quick and simple way to reduce the emissions effectively which could not be ignored and should be paid much attention to 4 2 mutual relationships this system has more positive utility relationships from the perspective of mutualism index which is higher than 1 it indicates that this system is in a symbiotic state with a relatively stable environment exploitation relationships exist in the pairwise sectors in which esw sector receives more carbon emissions than it transfers to wrc sector as an example there are 55 pairs of sectors with exploitation relationships accounting for nearly 70 of the total relationships whereas the competition and mutualism relationships remain less than 30 sectors with damaging relationships such as gas and tra sectors are harmed mutually by the relationship it is necessary to improve the level of mutualism in guangdong s metabolic system for its characteristics of mutual promotion 4 3 dependency intensity nca is a powerful tool which can be used to find out the implied dependence intensity between sectors there are several sectors having dependence on esw sector and cpg sector and the dependence is almost over 50 indicating that reduction policies on the two sectors would have a significant impact on other sectors specifically the con sector dependents heavily on other twelve sectors for over 90 whereas no sectors have dependence on it from the perspective of network control analysis the input of other sectors would determine the carbon emissions of the con sector and the production structure of the con sector must be changed in order to achieving the reduction goal this is in line with the industrial structure adjustment plan of guangdong province in 2012 to promote the development of the second industry especially in the con sector 4 4 efficiency comparison in the network efficiency analysis eff lorenz curve is used to compare the efficiency of carbon emissions by producing per unit of monetary value esw has the lowest efficiency due to the large consumption of energy consumed in the operation of the sector which is consistent with the sector s characteristic as guangdong has maintained a steady state of population growth dom is a resilient sector with much carbon emissions and lower efficiency the result of comparison with the nation is that the carbon emission rate of wrc sector of guangdong province is higher than the national level due to the developed light industry in guangdong province the low cost of products can attract external consumption and stimulate the economy it is in conformity with the principle of supporting the development of the tertiary industry 5 conclusions the innovation of this study is summarized as follows firstly for carbon emission the competition relationships reveal good interactions in terms of emission reduction while a mutualism relationship provides effective pathways to mitigate carbon emissions between pairwise sectors simultaneously secondly the analysis of dependency intensity could help identify whether the sectors should adjust their production structure or upgrade the clean combustion technology thirdly comparing emission efficiency of different sectors with other sectors could help find out the hidden sectors with large carbon emission rate it provides a new insight into the potential sectors which play an important role in the emission reduction we hope this paper could help decision makers better control the source of the carbon emissions which is conducive to the development of industrial structure towards low energy consumption and low carbon emissions in the future more insights could be found accurately if more detailed data is available which will facilitate the development of the target policies and corrective measures unfortunately there is no way to find specific data to a certain area such as the pearl river delta whereas we can provide more precise advice for smaller regions acknowledgements
