12740,nature based solutions nbs to treat wastewater are ecological treatments that work to mitigate the impact of conventional systems in wastewater treatment processes in this study the efficiency of an innovative wastewater tertiary treatment based on daphnia filtration in removing suspended solids and e coli is evaluated in combination with either vermifiltration or conventional secondary treatments daphnia filtration nbs was found to increase particle removal and e coli inactivation over a wide range of water temperatures solar radiation intensities and hydraulic residence times moreover two models to predict the quality of the treated wastewater one that describes the removal of particles and another for e coli inactivation are developed and presented here both models depend on water temperature the exposure to solar radiation and the hydraulic residence time in the reactor the results using these models align with the experimental results in all cases hydraulic residence times above 24 h allowed suspended particle concentrations to be reduced by 75 with water temperatures in the range of 10 c to 27 c and for e coli to be inactivated by 1 3 log units in water temperature ranging from 8 c to 27 c the developed models can also be used to provide information regarding the operating conditions i e hydraulic residence times required to obtain the desired regenerated water quality in accordance with reuse purposes and the regulations of different countries graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nature based solution daphnia wastewater tertiary treatment e coli inactivation particle removal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction increased demand for water together with increased water scarcity drives the need to improve wastewater treatment technologies which require investment in supply sanitation and water management 1 the implementation of tertiary wastewater treatments makes it possible to significantly improve the quality of treated wastewater and hence both increase the variety of reuse applications 2 and permit its reintroduction into the environment in better conditions 3 however the widespread adoption of tertiary treatments has been limited by the high energy and chemical dosage requirements 4 nature based solutions nbs are based on the concept of exploiting ecosystem services found in nature to obtain efficient and sustainable technologies that are able to replace conventional energy and resource demanding technologies nbs are innovative solutions that can improve the health and resilience of ecosystems and foster more sustainable low carbon and climate resilient societies 5 providing both sustainability and economic growth 6 access to nbs by vulnerable communities reduces inequalities between societies sdg10 7 and this in turn results in improved health and well being and safer and more sustainable cities sdg3 and sdg11 respectively implementing nbs requires finding the correct balance between a series of benefits and trade offs 8 since nbs are treatments that have low operating costs and capital outlays they are fast becoming an alternative in producing reclaimed wastewater that can reduce pressure on water bodies which is of particular importance in arid and semi arid areas and during periods of water scarcity however before wastewater can be reused it has to fulfil certain water quality conditions that depend on the legislation of each country and that differ depending on the end usage 9 for example in spain aquifer recharge through land percolation can be performed with treated wastewater with a maximum of 1000 cfu 100 ml of e coli and 35 mg l 1 of suspended solids in contrast direct aquifer recharge can only be performed when treated wastewater fulfil 0 cfu 100 ml of e coli and 10 mg l 1 of suspended solids 10 different tertiary treatments have already been studied to evaluate their ability to meet national targets for instance slow sand filtration working together with anaerobic biofilters produce an e coli inactivation of 1 35 log units which is slightly above that obtained for sand filters alone 11 coagulation and filtration are also used for their simplicity and effectiveness 12 wang et al 12 found that the removal of suspended solids ranged from 50 to 74 depending on the dosage of the coagulating agent ultrafiltration of wastewater by membranes removed as much as 94 of suspended solids and completely eliminated e coli 13 although the high cost of this technology may be prohibitive 14 constructed wetlands are a type of nbs in which aquatic plants are used to filter wastewater despite being useful in many settings the large land area required poses practical limitations in their implementation although multilayer constructed wetlands can provide a compact version that allows them to be used in urban areas 15 a pilot project on constructed wetlands by schierano et al 16 succeeded in removing 78 of suspended solids and reduced e coli by one log unit bai et al 17 studied the performance of a constructed wetland and found a 90 reduction in suspended solids that did not increase when the hydraulic retention time hrt was raised from 1 to 3 days in natural wetlands high proportions of e coli isolates can survive in low anthropized environments 18 while wetland lagoons with floodplains populated with different types of vegetation can both improve the retention times of incoming polluted waters and boost the retention of pollutants that would otherwise reach coastal seawaters artificial food web systems using a combination of phytoplankton and zooplankton with daphnia reactors have also been used 19 and are another example of nbs for wastewater treatment in this case a first phytoplankton reactor was used to reduce nutrients and a second reactor with daphnia had the role of biomass regulator a similar combination of phytoplankton and zooplankton reactors has been also applied to treat polluted stream waters 20 the presence of small particles 30 μm which can go through meshes filters or settling tanks reduces water clarity affecting the efficiency of disinfection by uv based technologies the genus daphnia a zooplanktonic population of cladocera has shown its ability to disinfect wastewater 21 23 to remove emerging contaminants 24 and hence have been postulated as filtration organisms for biologically based tertiary wastewater treatments 22 23 25 28 pous et al 26 28 developed a tertiary treatment based on daphnia filtration that was evaluated both by connecting the system to a conventional secondary treatment and a vermifiltration system in both cases the reclaimed water obtained had the required quality to be used for agricultural irrigation furthermore nature based solutions make daily operations easier although tools to optimize the operating conditions are required for this reason the present study aims to develop two models to evaluate the effectiveness of a daphnia based tertiary system in disinfecting and removing particles under different working conditions for this aim two different real case studies have been considered i a daphnia reactor downstream of a conventional secondary treatment i e activated sludge ii a daphnia reactor downstream of a vermifiltration reactor the experimental data obtained will be applied to set and test prediction models for particle removal and e coli disinfection under a set of abiotic variables particularly water temperature and solar radiation daphnia concentrations and operating conditions the great advantage of these models for both particle removal and e coli inactivation is that they can be used as tools to provide information on the water quality of the treated wastewater and its possible reuses which vary depending on each country s specific regulations furthermore they can be used to calculate the operating conditions that are needed to achieve the wastewater quality objectives 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the nbs daphnia magna tertiary treatment the tertiary treatment based on daphnia filtration has been tested on a pilot plant scale using two different set ups the first one consisted of four reactors of 1 m3 each connected sequentially to an activated sludge secondary wastewater treatment with a nitrogen and phosphorus removal unit situated in empuriabrava ne of spain conventional secondary system a ca fig 1 four replicas of this configuration were used in this analysis for this ca site the residence time of wastewater in each reactor was one day and so the daphnia treatment accounted for a total residence time of hrt 24 h in the effluent of the first reactor hrt 48 h in the effluent of the second hrt 72 h in the effluent of the third and hrt 96 h in the fourth reactor fig 1 the water entered from above and flowed out from the bottom of the reactor the reactors were square shaped and had one vertical lamellae from the surface all the way down to the bottom of the reactor dividing it into two parts containing 3 cm diameter holes to permit water to flow from one side to the other the secondary water entered into the system presented 8 9 4 3 mgo2 l 1 chemical oxygen demand cod 9 1 8 5 mgn l 1 4 2 2 5 mgp l 1 tss 8 2 7 1 mg l 1 and e coli 792 8 3007 2 cfu ml 1 the standard deviation given represents the variation over three years large seasonal increases in the local population as a result of tourism explain the greater values corresponding to late spring and summer and the lower values in the winter period this daphnia filtration system was operated for three years to monitor its functioning over a large range of water temperatures and light conditions the knowledge generated at the ca set up was used to redesign the square shaped reactors used in ca into a cylindrical reactor according to daphnia requirements in terms of water circulation inside the reactor and solar radiation 29 31 the second set up conventional secondary system b cb fig 1 was located at the wwtp of quart ne of spain and consisted of a cylindrical reactor 1 5 m3 capacity with two 30 30 cm2 lamellae situated halfway down the reactor at an angle of 45 to enhance the sedimentation of big sludge particles 26 27 the cb influent contained 68 59 mgo2 l 1 29 15 mgn l 1 and 4 7 mgp l 1 mean values and standard deviations over one year in this case the secondary system consisted of a conventional activated sludge system treating urban wastewater for 10 000 p e three residence times were considered hrt 12 h 24 h 48 h the daphnia filtration system was operated for one full year the same daphnia reactor was connected to a vermifiltration system at the same site vermifiltration v fig 1 daphnia influent in this case contained 58 16 mgo2 l 1 2 2 mgn l 1 5 1 mgp l 1 mean values and standard deviations over one year four residence times were considered hrt 12 h 16 h 24 h and 48 h the daphnia filtration reactor connected to the vermifiltration unit was operated for one year 2 2 daphnia magna inoculation in each set up d magna were collected from empuriabrava wwtp ponds 22 which receive inputs of secondary wastewaters and were kept for two years in 50 l aquariums in the laboratory with a continuous air flow daphnia were fed twice a week with a mixture of spirulina sp and yeast and 1 3 of the water was renewed every 15 days this d magna culture was used for inoculating the different reactors reactors were fed with treated wastewater for a month in the ca and for 19 days in both the cb and v systems to allow bacterial and algal biofilm growth in the cb set up approximately 1000 d magna individuals from a laboratory aquarium were added resulting in a daphnia concentration of 0 67 individuals l 1 in the v set up the initial daphnia concentration was 0 1 individuals l 1 the systems were left to stabilise for a period of three months before starting the study reactors in the ca system were fed directly with daphnia from the empuriabrava ponds with an initial concentration of approximately 1 individuals l 1 and the system was left to stabilise for a period of one year before the study begin in the case of the cb and v set ups where high flow rates were studied a venturi system was added to the inlet of the daphnia reactor to oxygenate the influent wastewater 2 3 measurement of suspended particles in each daphnia reactor five samples of 100 ml were taken from both the secondary and the tertiary outlets to measure the concentration of suspended particles by means of a laser particle size analyser lisst 100 sequoia inc the device measures the particle volume concentrations in the size range of 2 5 500 μm using a procedure based on light diffraction theory it can determine the particle size distribution and concentration of either phytoplankton organisms 32 33 or inorganic suspended particles 34 since cladocerans ingest particles within sizes up to 30 μm 35 36 the volumetric concentration of particles within the range of 2 5 to 30 μm was integrated and used as a proxy to evaluate the concentration of suspended particles the particle removal c c0 was calculated as the ratio between the concentrations of particles at the outlet of the daphnia filtration reactor c versus the concentration of particles at the inlet of the daphnia reactor i e the outlet of the secondary treatment c0 the measurement of particle removal was carried out with and without daphnia individuals in all set ups 2 4 measurement of the e coli colonies 1 l water samples were collected at both the outlet of the secondary and the daphnia reactor during the performance of the three set ups fig 1 100 ml samples were filtered through millipore sterile membrane filters of 47 mm diameter and 0 45 μm pore size placed on petri dishes containing a double layer of mb lactose glucuronide agar the petri dishes were then incubated at 44 5 c for 24 h the colony count was calculated from the arithmetic mean of three membrane filter counts to determine e coli colonies at both the inlet ecoli 0 and the outlet ecoli of the daphnia reactor measurements of water disinfection were carried out with and without daphnia individuals in all set ups 2 5 measurement of the water temperature and solar radiation in the ca configuration a water temperature sensor seb 39 seabird electronics inc was deployed mid depth in each daphnia reactor water temperature was recorded in the daphnia reactors at hourly intervals in the second set up cb and v a water temperature sensor with a measuring frequency of 1 hz was submerged in the cylindrical daphnia filtration reactor oxymax cos61d endress hauser germany daily mean water temperature was considered as the characteristic temperature of the wastewater in the daphnia reactors in ca cb and v set ups solar radiation was measured at the closest meteorological stations l estartit meteorological station for the ca set up and the university of girona meteorological station for the cb and v set ups 2 6 measurement of the concentration of daphnia in the reactors in the ca configuration the daphnia concentration was measured monthly for this purpose 1 l water samples were taken at eight positions across the square reactor by means of a syphon tube submerged at a depth of 1 m once a volume of 1 l had entered the tube a valve closed the inlet this was repeated at each of the eight positions and so 8 l of water were collected this water volume was then filtered through a 45 μm mesh size net to retain daphnia to be counted the measurements produced a modification in the daphnia concentration of 1 for the period studied the concentration of daphnia in the reactor varied with the water temperature fig 2a following two different trends depending on whether the water temperature was above or below 20 c 1 c dph 5 10 12 t w 8 14 r 2 0 7851 for t w 20 c 2 c dph 3 10 3 t w 3 51 r 2 0 9628 for t w 20 c in the case of the cylindrical daphnia reactor the lamellae only allowed two sampling points situated across the surface of the reactor measurements were repeated 1 h after the first sample at the same points the daphnia concentration was taken from the mean of the four measurements 2 7 model for the removal of suspended particles the removal of the suspended particles in the daphnia reactors could be attributed to both the particle sedimentation and the daphnia filtration activity through an exponential decrease with a constant rate of decay k and can be represented as k ks kdph where ks and kdph correspond to the contributions of both sedimentation ks and daphnia filtration kdph processes 25 ks was determined from the experiments performed without daphnia in the reactor in which kdph 0 in this case ks 0 05 h 1 in both daphnia reactors connected to the cb and v systems and ks 0 007 h 1 in the daphnia reactor connected to the ca the daphnia filtration rate was assumed to depend on the concentration of daphnia cdph therefore kdph f cdph from which f the filtration rate was calculated from the daphnia filtration and the daphnia concentration 25 the daphnia filtration was found to be a function of the water temperature 37 following different trends depending on whether the water temperature was below 20 c or above 20 c 3 f 2 10 3 t w 2 46 for t w 20 c 4 f 3 10 8 t w 6 07 for t w 20 c using eqs 3 and 4 to calculate the daphnia filtration rate and eqs 1 and 2 to calculate the daphnia concentration methods 2 6 a model eq 5 to predict the removal of particles was obtained 5 c c 0 model e kt where c is the concentration at the outlet of the daphnia treatment c0 was the concentration at the inlet of the daphnia treatment k is the rate of decay defined in section 2 5 and t is the time during which daphnia individuals undergo filtration i e the hrt daphnia filtration was a function of the hours of irradiance 31 and follows a linear decrease as the hours of light increase in the current study the hours of irradiance for both sites ranged from 9 7 h to 12 5 h experimental studies by serra et al 31 determined that the most efficient photoperiod for daphnia filtration 8 h of light and 16 h of darkness therefore considering the range of light hours that reached the surface of the experimental reactors a linear trend was fitted between the ratio f fmax versus the hours of light 6 f f max 0 01 3t light 1 106 where fmax is the maximum filtration rate and tlight is the hours of light during the experimental conditions the results predicted by the model for the predicted particle removal c c0 model were compared with those obtained experimentally c c0 exp 2 8 e coli inactivation model the e coli in the daphnia reactors was inactivated by three mechanisms solar radiation water temperature and filtration by daphnia individuals therefore e coli inactivation could be calculated as the sum of the three processes as 7 i ecoli model i ecoli dph i ecoli light i ecoli temp first the model considers that e coli is inactivated by the daphnia individuals following an exponential decay as has been observed by ismail et al 38 8 ecoli ecoli 0 e k dph t in the current study the e coli inactivation by daphnia was considered to depend on both the daphnia filtration f and concentration cdph through the rate of decay kdph 9 i ecoli dph log ecoli 0 ecoli log e k dph t second e coli inactivation by solar radiation was investigated by mosteo et al 39 nguyen et al 40 and šolić and krstulović 41 šolić and krstulović 41 demonstrated that the time required for the solar radiation to reduce the e coli population by a 90 t90 was 10 t 90 e 3 905 0 0047 r where r is the solar radiation in w m 2 the model considered an exponential reduction of e coli with time due to the solar radiation as 11 ecoli ecoli 0 e k light t where t is the time in hours the rate of decay klight was calculated from t90 as 12 k

but its effect is below the inactivation produced by solar radiation 41 42 šolić and krstulović 41 demonstrated that the time required for the water temperature tw to reduce the e coli population in a 90 t90 was 14 t 90 e 5 93 0 0837 t w the model considered an exponential reduction of e coli with time due to the temperature as 15 ecoli ecoli 0 e k tw t where t is the time in hours the rate ktw can be calculated from t90 as 16 k tw 1 t 90 ln 10 the e coli inactivation due to the temperature can be defined as 17 i ecoli temp log ecoli 0 ecoli log e k tw t the experimental e coli inactivation by

experimentally iecoli exp this result is maintained at the daphnia optimal conditions water temperatures tw 20 c resulting in maximum daphnia filtration rates and a maximum daphnia concentration since daphnia will inactivate e coli as long as they find them to feed on the maximum inactivation achievable in each experiment was calculated as 19 i max log ecoli 0 ecoli min where ecoli min is the minimum concentration of e coli colonies 1 and ecoli 0 is the measured concentration of e coli at the inlet of the daphnia reactor i e at the secondary effluent a constriction to the model was applied for the iecoli model to not surpass imax 3 results 3 1 daphnia concentration the daphnia concentration in ind l 1 increased with water temperature from 10 c to 20 c fig 2 for water temperatures above 20 c the daphnia concentration decreased as the temperature increased fig 2a a power trend for tw 20 c and another for tw 20 c were fitted to data in the ca set up for hrt 24 h fig 2a section 2 4 and was used to predict the daphnia concentration for the other hrts and for the whole range of water temperatures fig 2b c and d for all the hrt studied the daphnia concentration also showed an increase with temperature for tw 20 c in contrast for tw 20 c the daphnia concentration decreased with water temperature the model results for cdph versus tw were close to those obtained experimentally for the ca set up fig 2b c and d the agreement between the values predicted by the model and the experimental ones confirms that the daphnia concentration is mainly dependent on the water temperature therefore the model for ca was used to predict the daphnia concentration in the cylindrical reactor in the two configurations connected to cb or v units and the predicted concentrations were compared to the experimental ones fig 3 3 2 removal of suspended particles due to daphnia filtration in all the set ups the removal of suspended particles c c0 in the daphnia reactors presented a non linear relationship with the water temperature fig 4 the removal increased with tw below 20 c i e c c0 decreased with tw and it decreased with temperature above 20 c i e c c0 increased with tw the particle removal also depended on hrt the higher the hrt the more particles were removed the particle removal in the cylindrical reactor in both cb and v set ups was always greater than in the ca set up with lower values of c c0 3 3 e coli inactivation in the ca set up e coli inactivation had a non linear relationship with water temperature for water temperatures below 20 c e coli inactivation increased as the water temperature increased decreasing afterwards for water temperatures above 20 c the e coli inactivation also depended on hrt the lowest inactivation was achieved for hrt 24 h which was the lowest hrt tested in this set up fig 5 inactivation increased with hrt with maximum inactivation values of 4 7 log units for high hrt and water temperatures of 20 c the results of the e coli inactivation predicted by the model eq 7 present a similar evolution versus the water temperature for the ca system to the experimental values of e coli inactivation 3 4 validation of the models for particle removal and e coli inactivation the models developed in this study for the removal of suspended particles and e coli inactivation were validated by comparing the prediction values calculated by each model with the experimental ones a linear relationship with the experimental values of the particle removal c c0 exp in a log log plot c c0 model 1 00 c c0 exp 0 20 r2 0 7589 p value 0 01 fig 6a was found when both sedimentation and daphnia filtration were considered eq 5 the model of e coli inactivation in the ca set up has been used to predict the e coli inactivation in the cb and v set ups eqs 7 19 a linear relationship between the model predictions and the experimental values of e coli inactivation in all the three set ups studied was found i ecoli model 0 84i ecoli exp 0 50 r2 0 8554 p value 0 01 fig 6b the particle removal effectiveness calculated as 1 c c0 increased with hrt for all the temperatures in the range tw from 10 c to 25 c fig 7a for tw 20 c the system had the maximum effectiveness for all the hrt studied however for temperatures of 15 c the system gave effectiveness above 90 for hrt equal or above 24 h whereas for temperatures of 10 c or 25 c effectiveness 90 were achieved for hrt 48 h the e coli inactivation increased with hrt for all the water temperatures fig 7b inactivation above 3 log units were obtained for all hrt for a water temperature of 20 c however for a water temperature of 15 c e coli inactivation above 3 log units was achieved for hrt 24 h for tw 25 c at hrt 36 h and for tw 10 c at hrt 96 h fig 7b 4 discussion the innovative daphnia filtration tertiary wastewater system presented has been shown to significantly improve the quality of secondary wastewater by both increasing particle removal and inactivating e coli the effectiveness of the system is based on the fact that daphnia are filter feeders that uptake particles and e coli entering from the secondary effluent the removal of particles depends on the hydraulic residence time and the daphnia concentration and its filtration capacity which in turn depend on the water temperature and the degree of light exposure both in terms of time and irradiance long term conditions in the conventional and nature based pilot scale treatments were tracked on a weekly time scale to better observe the reactor response to changing conditions few general differences were noted in the three set ups that we tested on a pilot scale the results obtained in the ca set up were used to optimize the design of a cylindrical daphnia reactor for the cb and v set ups hence a greater particle removal was observed in the improved reactor the efficiency of the tertiary system based on daphnia filtration can be predicted in terms of three outputs modelled daphnia concentration e coli inactivation and the removal of particles 4 1 daphnia development in the wastewater reactor daphnia concentration increased with water temperatures 20 c decreasing afterwards as water temperature increased independently of the upstream treatment used i e conventional activated sludge with or without nitrogen and phosphorus treatment or a nature based solution based on vermifiltration müller et al 37 also examined the daphnia filtration performance in laboratory controlled tests finding that at water temperatures around 20 c daphnia individuals showed a considerable rise in their metabolic rate greater particle uptake rates and faster growth rates the optimum thermal tolerance window for daphnia filtration has been found to be centred at water temperatures of 24 c 44 or between 20 and 21 c 23 37 44 47 water temperatures 27 c in combination with high nitrate concentrations have been found to have a negative impact on the survival of daphnia individuals 46 schalau et al 43 found that water temperature was the key parameter driving the evolution of daphnia populations finding that daphnia concentrations decreased when water temperatures fell below 6 c in the current study water temperature was also found to be a key parameter in determining the evolution of the daphnia population in the reactors and water temperatures of 11 c were less efficient in inactivating e coli presumably due to their low feeding rates at these water temperatures 37 4 2 particle removal by daphnia filtration increased particle removal was found to be dependent on increased hrt in all set ups both particle sedimentation and daphnia filtration in the daphnia reactor improved the removal of particles with diameters below 30 μm this result agrees with our previous findings 29 in which the removal of particles remained low with hrt 3 h and 12 h and increased progressively until reaching a plateau at hrt 24 h however such a plateau was not found in the current investigation since higher hrt always improved the particle removal at the wastewater treatment plants where the daphnia filtration solution was installed the water temperature ranged between 8 c and 27 c all year round the particle removal model at hrt 24 h predicted a removal rate 75 and 90 for the rectangular reactors in ca and cylindrical reactors in cb and v set ups respectively therefore greater particle removal was obtained with both the cb and v set ups at hrt 24 h probably due to the fact that the sedimentation in the optimized reactor was greater than with the rectangular reactors for the cb and v set ups and for an hrt 48 h the model predicts a particle removal 90 in the water temperature range of 8 c to 27 c in contrast to the particle removal 75 predicted for the same set up and the same water temperature range but for a smaller hrt of 24 h moreover the removal of suspended solids depended on the daphnia concentration the daphnia filtration and the hydraulic residence time and ranged between c c0 0 6 40 of particle removal to c c0 0 002 99 8 of particle removal when the cylindrical reactor was connected to the vermifiltration unit with hrt 48 h a particle removal 90 was achieved for all the water temperatures these percentages are similar to those obtained by subsurface constructed wetlands 17 and by ultrafiltration membranes 13 using the same set up at hrt 24 h particle removal was always above 70 which is higher than that obtained in coagulation and filtration 12 effectiveness above 75 was found for the range of water temperatures tw 10 c to 25 c for hrt 24 h for the same range of water temperatures particle removal effectiveness was 90 for hrt 48 h 4 3 e coli disinfection by daphnia filtration hrt fine tuning boosted e coli inactivation up to hrt 24 h after which a further rise in hrt led to no discernible further improvement for hrt 24 h the e coli inactivation by daphnia filtration ranged from 1 log unit to 3 log units for the range of temperatures studied 8 c to 27 c this inactivation is in agreement with the e coli inactivation by daphnia of 1 5 3 log units in 24 h found by ismail et al 38 in ponds and synthetic freshwater respectively e coli inactivation increased with hrt and for hrt 72 h this ranged from 1 log unit to 5 log units for the water temperatures studied however for hrt 72 h a further increase in hrt did not noticeably affect the e coli inactivation the levels of e coli inactivation obtained in the present study are similar to those found with conventional systems such as uv which are in the range of 3 log unit for a uv dose of 10 mj cm 2 to 6 log units for a uv dose of 30 mj cm 2 48 wei et al 49 found an e coli inactivation of 3 5 log units with a uv dose of 7 5 mj cm 2 increasing by one more logarithmic unit when uv was combined with other treatments ozone or chlorine in the current study the e coli inactivation increased with the daphnia concentration aligning with the results of ismail et al 38 therefore the e coli inactivation in the daphnia reactor was higher than that obtained by sand filtration 11 for hrt 24 h and warm temperatures tw 20 c the e coli inactivation reached its maximum value and complete water disinfection was achieved given this under optimal conditions the tertiary treatment based on daphnia filtration produced regenerated wastewater with a reduction of e coli that was similar to that obtained with ultrafiltration membranes 13 the e coli inactivation depended on water temperature between 11 c and 18 c disinfection increased progressively with water temperature finally reaching 2 log units for water temperatures above 16 c the system showed a faster increase in disinfection up to 20 c decreasing afterwards with a further increase in water temperature the low disinfection levels observed at water temperatures below 16 c might be attributed to the fact that daphnia grow more slowly at these water temperatures these results are in accordance with the findings by ismail et al 38 who found that at low water temperatures filter feeding by daphnia was reduced in addition periods of low water temperatures typically go together with fewer hours of solar radiation however for water temperatures above 16 c daphnia growth is enhanced and their filtration activity increases coinciding with longer periods of solar radiation low water temperatures combined with low solar radiation corresponding to the end of the summer are likely to favour e coli development 41 besides this seasonal effect in all of the samples analysed in the ca set up and for all the hrt studied e coli remained below 16 cfu 100 ml based on the e coli inactivation disinfections above 3 log units were achieved for hrt 12 h for a water temperature close to 20 c for water temperatures 15 c and 20 c disinfection was below 3 log units for hrt 48 h 5 conclusions the nature based solution presented in this study successfully develops a wastewater tertiary treatment based on daphnia filtration as a polishing system the daphnia filtration system can be used connected to either conventional wastewater treatment set ups i e activated sludge with and without nitrogen and phosphorus treatment or to nature based solutions such as a vermifiltration system the daphnia filtration system which does not require the use of chemicals has no negative impact on the environment and is highly efficient in removing suspended particles while reducing the production of sludge the deterministic models presented here predict the particle removal and the e coli inactivation in the three systems studied for the different seasons of the year a set of water temperatures and solar radiation and hydraulic residence times have been used to calibrate the models to best predict particle removal and e coli disinfection by the daphnia filtration system hydraulic residence times above 24 h reduced the concentration of suspended particles by 75 with water temperatures in the range of 10 c to 27 c and produced e coli inactivations of 1 3 log units in water temperature ranges from 8 c to 27 c t these models have provided essential data in understanding how to optimize daphnia filtration tertiary treatment informing us for example when the best time to inoculate the daphnia is and determining which operating conditions are the most efficient they also reveal the daphnia filtration and particle sedimentation parameters required to achieve the desired wastewater quality in terms of both particle removal and disinfection the results of the models also allow us to identify the best operating conditions to obtain wastewater of the quality required to meet specific country s regulations for the different reuse applications declaration of

12740,nature based solutions nbs to treat wastewater are ecological treatments that work to mitigate the impact of conventional systems in wastewater treatment processes in this study the efficiency of an innovative wastewater tertiary treatment based on daphnia filtration in removing suspended solids and e coli is evaluated in combination with either vermifiltration or conventional secondary treatments daphnia filtration nbs was found to increase particle removal and e coli inactivation over a wide range of water temperatures solar radiation intensities and hydraulic residence times moreover two models to predict the quality of the treated wastewater one that describes the removal of particles and another for e coli inactivation are developed and presented here both models depend on water temperature the exposure to solar radiation and the hydraulic residence time in the reactor the results using these models align with the experimental results in all cases hydraulic residence times above 24 h allowed suspended particle concentrations to be reduced by 75 with water temperatures in the range of 10 c to 27 c and for e coli to be inactivated by 1 3 log units in water temperature ranging from 8 c to 27 c the developed models can also be used to provide information regarding the operating conditions i e hydraulic residence times required to obtain the desired regenerated water quality in accordance with reuse purposes and the regulations of different countries graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nature based solution daphnia wastewater tertiary treatment e coli inactivation particle removal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction increased demand for water together with increased water scarcity drives the need to improve wastewater treatment technologies which require investment in supply sanitation and water management 1 the implementation of tertiary wastewater treatments makes it possible to significantly improve the quality of treated wastewater and hence both increase the variety of reuse applications 2 and permit its reintroduction into the environment in better conditions 3 however the widespread adoption of tertiary treatments has been limited by the high energy and chemical dosage requirements 4 nature based solutions nbs are based on the concept of exploiting ecosystem services found in nature to obtain efficient and sustainable technologies that are able to replace conventional energy and resource demanding technologies nbs are innovative solutions that can improve the health and resilience of ecosystems and foster more sustainable low carbon and climate resilient societies 5 providing both sustainability and economic growth 6 access to nbs by vulnerable communities reduces inequalities between societies sdg10 7 and this in turn results in improved health and well being and safer and more sustainable cities sdg3 and sdg11 respectively implementing nbs requires finding the correct balance between a series of benefits and trade offs 8 since nbs are treatments that have low operating costs and capital outlays they are fast becoming an alternative in producing reclaimed wastewater that can reduce pressure on water bodies which is of particular importance in arid and semi arid areas and during periods of water scarcity however before wastewater can be reused it has to fulfil certain water quality conditions that depend on the legislation of each country and that differ depending on the end usage 9 for example in spain aquifer recharge through land percolation can be performed with treated wastewater with a maximum of 1000 cfu 100 ml of e coli and 35 mg l 1 of suspended solids in contrast direct aquifer recharge can only be performed when treated wastewater fulfil 0 cfu 100 ml of e coli and 10 mg l 1 of suspended solids 10 different tertiary treatments have already been studied to evaluate their ability to meet national targets for instance slow sand filtration working together with anaerobic biofilters produce an e coli inactivation of 1 35 log units which is slightly above that obtained for sand filters alone 11 coagulation and filtration are also used for their simplicity and effectiveness 12 wang et al 12 found that the removal of suspended solids ranged from 50 to 74 depending on the dosage of the coagulating agent ultrafiltration of wastewater by membranes removed as much as 94 of suspended solids and completely eliminated e coli 13 although the high cost of this technology may be prohibitive 14 constructed wetlands are a type of nbs in which aquatic plants are used to filter wastewater despite being useful in many settings the large land area required poses practical limitations in their implementation although multilayer constructed wetlands can provide a compact version that allows them to be used in urban areas 15 a pilot project on constructed wetlands by schierano et al 16 succeeded in removing 78 of suspended solids and reduced e coli by one log unit bai et al 17 studied the performance of a constructed wetland and found a 90 reduction in suspended solids that did not increase when the hydraulic retention time hrt was raised from 1 to 3 days in natural wetlands high proportions of e coli isolates can survive in low anthropized environments 18 while wetland lagoons with floodplains populated with different types of vegetation can both improve the retention times of incoming polluted waters and boost the retention of pollutants that would otherwise reach coastal seawaters artificial food web systems using a combination of phytoplankton and zooplankton with daphnia reactors have also been used 19 and are another example of nbs for wastewater treatment in this case a first phytoplankton reactor was used to reduce nutrients and a second reactor with daphnia had the role of biomass regulator a similar combination of phytoplankton and zooplankton reactors has been also applied to treat polluted stream waters 20 the presence of small particles 30 μm which can go through meshes filters or settling tanks reduces water clarity affecting the efficiency of disinfection by uv based technologies the genus daphnia a zooplanktonic population of cladocera has shown its ability to disinfect wastewater 21 23 to remove emerging contaminants 24 and hence have been postulated as filtration organisms for biologically based tertiary wastewater treatments 22 23 25 28 pous et al 26 28 developed a tertiary treatment based on daphnia filtration that was evaluated both by connecting the system to a conventional secondary treatment and a vermifiltration system in both cases the reclaimed water obtained had the required quality to be used for agricultural irrigation furthermore nature based solutions make daily operations easier although tools to optimize the operating conditions are required for this reason the present study aims to develop two models to evaluate the effectiveness of a daphnia based tertiary system in disinfecting and removing particles under different working conditions for this aim two different real case studies have been considered i a daphnia reactor downstream of a conventional secondary treatment i e activated sludge ii a daphnia reactor downstream of a vermifiltration reactor the experimental data obtained will be applied to set and test prediction models for particle removal and e coli disinfection under a set of abiotic variables particularly water temperature and solar radiation daphnia concentrations and operating conditions the great advantage of these models for both particle removal and e coli inactivation is that they can be used as tools to provide information on the water quality of the treated wastewater and its possible reuses which vary depending on each country s specific regulations furthermore they can be used to calculate the operating conditions that are needed to achieve the wastewater quality objectives 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the nbs daphnia magna tertiary treatment the tertiary treatment based on daphnia filtration has been tested on a pilot plant scale using two different set ups the first one consisted of four reactors of 1 m3 each connected sequentially to an activated sludge secondary wastewater treatment with a nitrogen and phosphorus removal unit situated in empuriabrava ne of spain conventional secondary system a ca fig 1 four replicas of this configuration were used in this analysis for this ca site the residence time of wastewater in each reactor was one day and so the daphnia treatment accounted for a total residence time of hrt 24 h in the effluent of the first reactor hrt 48 h in the effluent of the second hrt 72 h in the effluent of the third and hrt 96 h in the fourth reactor fig 1 the water entered from above and flowed out from the bottom of the reactor the reactors were square shaped and had one vertical lamellae from the surface all the way down to the bottom of the reactor dividing it into two parts containing 3 cm diameter holes to permit water to flow from one side to the other the secondary water entered into the system presented 8 9 4 3 mgo2 l 1 chemical oxygen demand cod 9 1 8 5 mgn l 1 4 2 2 5 mgp l 1 tss 8 2 7 1 mg l 1 and e coli 792 8 3007 2 cfu ml 1 the standard deviation given represents the variation over three years large seasonal increases in the local population as a result of tourism explain the greater values corresponding to late spring and summer and the lower values in the winter period this daphnia filtration system was operated for three years to monitor its functioning over a large range of water temperatures and light conditions the knowledge generated at the ca set up was used to redesign the square shaped reactors used in ca into a cylindrical reactor according to daphnia requirements in terms of water circulation inside the reactor and solar radiation 29 31 the second set up conventional secondary system b cb fig 1 was located at the wwtp of quart ne of spain and consisted of a cylindrical reactor 1 5 m3 capacity with two 30 30 cm2 lamellae situated halfway down the reactor at an angle of 45 to enhance the sedimentation of big sludge particles 26 27 the cb influent contained 68 59 mgo2 l 1 29 15 mgn l 1 and 4 7 mgp l 1 mean values and standard deviations over one year in this case the secondary system consisted of a conventional activated sludge system treating urban wastewater for 10 000 p e three residence times were considered hrt 12 h 24 h 48 h the daphnia filtration system was operated for one full year the same daphnia reactor was connected to a vermifiltration system at the same site vermifiltration v fig 1 daphnia influent in this case contained 58 16 mgo2 l 1 2 2 mgn l 1 5 1 mgp l 1 mean values and standard deviations over one year four residence times were considered hrt 12 h 16 h 24 h and 48 h the daphnia filtration reactor connected to the vermifiltration unit was operated for one year 2 2 daphnia magna inoculation in each set up d magna were collected from empuriabrava wwtp ponds 22 which receive inputs of secondary wastewaters and were kept for two years in 50 l aquariums in the laboratory with a continuous air flow daphnia were fed twice a week with a mixture of spirulina sp and yeast and 1 3 of the water was renewed every 15 days this d magna culture was used for inoculating the different reactors reactors were fed with treated wastewater for a month in the ca and for 19 days in both the cb and v systems to allow bacterial and algal biofilm growth in the cb set up approximately 1000 d magna individuals from a laboratory aquarium were added resulting in a daphnia concentration of 0 67 individuals l 1 in the v set up the initial daphnia concentration was 0 1 individuals l 1 the systems were left to stabilise for a period of three months before starting the study reactors in the ca system were fed directly with daphnia from the empuriabrava ponds with an initial concentration of approximately 1 individuals l 1 and the system was left to stabilise for a period of one year before the study begin in the case of the cb and v set ups where high flow rates were studied a venturi system was added to the inlet of the daphnia reactor to oxygenate the influent wastewater 2 3 measurement of suspended particles in each daphnia reactor five samples of 100 ml were taken from both the secondary and the tertiary outlets to measure the concentration of suspended particles by means of a laser particle size analyser lisst 100 sequoia inc the device measures the particle volume concentrations in the size range of 2 5 500 μm using a procedure based on light diffraction theory it can determine the particle size distribution and concentration of either phytoplankton organisms 32 33 or inorganic suspended particles 34 since cladocerans ingest particles within sizes up to 30 μm 35 36 the volumetric concentration of particles within the range of 2 5 to 30 μm was integrated and used as a proxy to evaluate the concentration of suspended particles the particle removal c c0 was calculated as the ratio between the concentrations of particles at the outlet of the daphnia filtration reactor c versus the concentration of particles at the inlet of the daphnia reactor i e the outlet of the secondary treatment c0 the measurement of particle removal was carried out with and without daphnia individuals in all set ups 2 4 measurement of the e coli colonies 1 l water samples were collected at both the outlet of the secondary and the daphnia reactor during the performance of the three set ups fig 1 100 ml samples were filtered through millipore sterile membrane filters of 47 mm diameter and 0 45 μm pore size placed on petri dishes containing a double layer of mb lactose glucuronide agar the petri dishes were then incubated at 44 5 c for 24 h the colony count was calculated from the arithmetic mean of three membrane filter counts to determine e coli colonies at both the inlet ecoli 0 and the outlet ecoli of the daphnia reactor measurements of water disinfection were carried out with and without daphnia individuals in all set ups 2 5 measurement of the water temperature and solar radiation in the ca configuration a water temperature sensor seb 39 seabird electronics inc was deployed mid depth in each daphnia reactor water temperature was recorded in the daphnia reactors at hourly intervals in the second set up cb and v a water temperature sensor with a measuring frequency of 1 hz was submerged in the cylindrical daphnia filtration reactor oxymax cos61d endress hauser germany daily mean water temperature was considered as the characteristic temperature of the wastewater in the daphnia reactors in ca cb and v set ups solar radiation was measured at the closest meteorological stations l estartit meteorological station for the ca set up and the university of girona meteorological station for the cb and v set ups 2 6 measurement of the concentration of daphnia in the reactors in the ca configuration the daphnia concentration was measured monthly for this purpose 1 l water samples were taken at eight positions across the square reactor by means of a syphon tube submerged at a depth of 1 m once a volume of 1 l had entered the tube a valve closed the inlet this was repeated at each of the eight positions and so 8 l of water were collected this water volume was then filtered through a 45 μm mesh size net to retain daphnia to be counted the measurements produced a modification in the daphnia concentration of 1 for the period studied the concentration of daphnia in the reactor varied with the water temperature fig 2a following two different trends depending on whether the water temperature was above or below 20 c 1 c dph 5 10 12 t w 8 14 r 2 0 7851 for t w 20 c 2 c dph 3 10 3 t w 3 51 r 2 0 9628 for t w 20 c in the case of the cylindrical daphnia reactor the lamellae only allowed two sampling points situated across the surface of the reactor measurements were repeated 1 h after the first sample at the same points the daphnia concentration was taken from the mean of the four measurements 2 7 model for the removal of suspended particles the removal of the suspended particles in the daphnia reactors could be attributed to both the particle sedimentation and the daphnia filtration activity through an exponential decrease with a constant rate of decay k and can be represented as k ks kdph where ks and kdph correspond to the contributions of both sedimentation ks and daphnia filtration kdph processes 25 ks was determined from the experiments performed without daphnia in the reactor in which kdph 0 in this case ks 0 05 h 1 in both daphnia reactors connected to the cb and v systems and ks 0 007 h 1 in the daphnia reactor connected to the ca the daphnia filtration rate was assumed to depend on the concentration of daphnia cdph therefore kdph f cdph from which f the filtration rate was calculated from the daphnia filtration and the daphnia concentration 25 the daphnia filtration was found to be a function of the water temperature 37 following different trends depending on whether the water temperature was below 20 c or above 20 c 3 f 2 10 3 t w 2 46 for t w 20 c 4 f 3 10 8 t w 6 07 for t w 20 c using eqs 3 and 4 to calculate the daphnia filtration rate and eqs 1 and 2 to calculate the daphnia concentration methods 2 6 a model eq 5 to predict the removal of particles was obtained 5 c c 0 model e kt where c is the concentration at the outlet of the daphnia treatment c0 was the concentration at the inlet of the daphnia treatment k is the rate of decay defined in section 2 5 and t is the time during which daphnia individuals undergo filtration i e the hrt daphnia filtration was a function of the hours of irradiance 31 and follows a linear decrease as the hours of light increase in the current study the hours of irradiance for both sites ranged from 9 7 h to 12 5 h experimental studies by serra et al 31 determined that the most efficient photoperiod for daphnia filtration 8 h of light and 16 h of darkness therefore considering the range of light hours that reached the surface of the experimental reactors a linear trend was fitted between the ratio f fmax versus the hours of light 6 f f max 0 01 3t light 1 106 where fmax is the maximum filtration rate and tlight is the hours of light during the experimental conditions the results predicted by the model for the predicted particle removal c c0 model were compared with those obtained experimentally c c0 exp 2 8 e coli inactivation model the e coli in the daphnia reactors was inactivated by three mechanisms solar radiation water temperature and filtration by daphnia individuals therefore e coli inactivation could be calculated as the sum of the three processes as 7 i ecoli model i ecoli dph i ecoli light i ecoli temp first the model considers that e coli is inactivated by the daphnia individuals following an exponential decay as has been observed

krstulović 41 demonstrated that the time required for the solar radiation to reduce the e coli population by a 90 t90 was 10 t 90 e 3 905 0 0047 r where r is the solar radiation in w m 2 the model considered an exponential reduction of e coli with time due to the solar radiation as 11 ecoli ecoli 0 e k light t where t is the time in hours the rate of decay klight was calculated from t90 as 12 k

but its effect is below the inactivation produced by solar radiation 41 42 šolić and krstulović 41 demonstrated that the time required for the water temperature tw to reduce the e coli population in a 90 t90 was 14 t 90 e 5 93 0 0837 t w the model considered an exponential reduction of e coli with time due to the temperature as 15 ecoli ecoli 0 e k tw t where t is the time in hours the rate ktw can

daphnia will inactivate e coli as long as they find them to feed on the maximum inactivation achievable in each experiment was calculated as 19 i max log ecoli 0 ecoli min where ecoli min is the minimum concentration of e coli colonies 1 and ecoli 0 is the measured concentration of e coli at the inlet of the daphnia reactor i e at the secondary effluent a constriction to the model was applied for the iecoli model to not surpass imax 3 results 3 1 daphnia concentration the daphnia concentration in ind l 1 increased with water temperature from 10 c to 20 c fig 2 for water temperatures above 20 c the daphnia concentration decreased as the temperature increased fig 2a a power trend for tw 20 c and another for tw 20 c were fitted to data in the ca set up for hrt 24 h fig 2a section 2 4 and was used to predict the daphnia concentration for the other hrts and for the whole range of water temperatures fig 2b c and d for all the hrt studied the daphnia concentration also showed an increase with temperature for tw 20 c in contrast for tw 20 c the daphnia concentration decreased with water temperature the model results for cdph versus tw were close to those obtained experimentally for the ca set up fig 2b c and d the agreement between the values predicted by the model and the experimental ones confirms that the daphnia concentration is mainly dependent on the water temperature therefore the model for ca was used to predict the daphnia concentration in the cylindrical reactor in the two configurations connected to cb or v units and the predicted concentrations were compared to the experimental ones fig 3 3 2 removal of suspended particles due to daphnia filtration in all the set ups the removal of suspended particles c c0 in the daphnia reactors presented a non linear relationship with the water temperature fig 4 the removal increased with tw below 20 c i e c c0 decreased with tw and it decreased with temperature above 20 c i e c c0 increased with tw the particle removal also depended on hrt the higher the hrt the more particles were removed the particle removal in the cylindrical reactor in both cb and v set ups was always greater than in the ca set up with lower values of c c0 3 3 e coli inactivation in the ca set up e coli inactivation had a non linear relationship with water temperature for water temperatures below 20 c e coli inactivation increased as the water temperature increased decreasing afterwards for water temperatures above 20 c the e coli inactivation also depended on hrt the lowest inactivation was achieved for hrt 24 h which was the lowest hrt tested in this set up fig 5 inactivation increased with hrt with maximum inactivation values of 4 7 log units for high hrt and water temperatures of 20 c the results of the e coli inactivation predicted by the model eq 7 present a similar evolution versus the water temperature for the ca system to the experimental values of e coli inactivation 3 4 validation of the models for particle removal and e coli inactivation the models developed in this study for the removal of suspended particles and e coli inactivation were validated by comparing the prediction values calculated

8554 p value 0 01 fig 6b the particle removal effectiveness calculated as 1 c c0 increased with hrt for all the temperatures in the range tw from 10 c to 25 c fig 7a for tw 20 c the system had the maximum effectiveness for all the hrt studied however for temperatures of 15 c the system gave effectiveness above 90 for hrt equal or above 24 h whereas for temperatures of 10 c or 25 c effectiveness 90 were achieved for hrt 48 h the e coli inactivation increased with hrt for all the water temperatures fig 7b inactivation above 3 log units were obtained for all hrt for a water temperature of 20 c however for a water temperature of 15 c e coli inactivation above 3 log units was achieved for hrt 24 h for tw 25 c at hrt 36 h and for tw 10 c at hrt 96 h fig 7b 4 discussion the innovative daphnia filtration tertiary wastewater system presented has been shown to significantly improve the quality of secondary wastewater by both increasing particle removal and inactivating e coli the effectiveness of the system is based on the fact that daphnia are filter feeders that uptake particles and e coli entering from the secondary effluent the removal of particles depends on the hydraulic residence time and the daphnia concentration and its filtration capacity which in turn depend on the water temperature and the degree of light exposure both in terms of time and irradiance long term conditions in the conventional and nature based pilot scale treatments were tracked on a weekly time scale to better observe the reactor response to changing conditions few general differences were noted in the three set ups that we tested on a pilot scale the results obtained in the ca set up were used to optimize the design of a cylindrical daphnia reactor for the cb and v set ups hence a greater particle removal was observed in the improved reactor the efficiency of the tertiary system based on daphnia filtration can be predicted in terms of three outputs modelled daphnia concentration e coli inactivation and the removal of particles 4 1 daphnia development in the wastewater reactor daphnia concentration increased with water temperatures 20 c decreasing afterwards as water temperature increased independently of the upstream treatment used i e conventional activated sludge with or without nitrogen and phosphorus treatment or a nature based solution based on vermifiltration müller et al 37 also examined the daphnia filtration performance in laboratory controlled tests finding that at water temperatures around 20 c daphnia individuals showed a considerable rise in their metabolic rate greater particle uptake rates and faster growth rates the optimum thermal tolerance window for daphnia filtration has been found to be centred at water temperatures of 24 c 44 or between 20 and 21 c 23 37 44 47 water temperatures 27 c in combination with high nitrate concentrations have been found to have a negative impact on the survival of daphnia individuals 46 schalau et al 43 found that water temperature was the key parameter driving the evolution of daphnia populations finding that daphnia concentrations decreased when water temperatures fell below 6 c in the current study water temperature was also found to be a key parameter in determining the evolution of the daphnia population in the reactors and water temperatures of 11 c were less efficient in inactivating e coli presumably due to their low feeding rates at these water temperatures 37 4 2 particle removal by daphnia filtration increased particle removal was found to be dependent on increased hrt in all set ups both particle sedimentation and daphnia filtration in the daphnia reactor improved the removal of particles with diameters below 30 μm this result agrees with our previous findings 29 in which the removal of particles remained low with hrt 3 h and 12 h and increased progressively until reaching a plateau at hrt 24 h however such a plateau was not found in the current investigation since higher hrt always improved the particle removal at the wastewater treatment plants where the daphnia filtration solution was installed the water temperature ranged between 8 c and 27 c all year round the particle removal model at hrt 24 h predicted a removal rate 75 and 90 for the rectangular reactors in ca and cylindrical reactors in cb and v set ups respectively therefore greater particle removal was obtained with both the cb and v set ups at hrt 24 h probably due to the fact that the sedimentation in the optimized reactor was greater than with the rectangular reactors for the cb and v set ups and for an hrt 48 h the model predicts a particle removal 90 in the water temperature range of 8 c to 27 c in contrast to the particle removal 75 predicted for the same set up and the same water temperature range but for a smaller hrt of 24 h moreover the removal of suspended solids depended on the daphnia concentration the daphnia filtration and the hydraulic residence time and ranged between c c0 0 6 40 of particle removal to c c0 0 002 99 8 of particle removal when the cylindrical reactor was connected to the vermifiltration unit with hrt 48 h a particle removal 90 was achieved for all the water temperatures these percentages are similar to those obtained by subsurface constructed wetlands 17 and by ultrafiltration membranes 13 using the same set up at hrt 24 h particle removal was always above 70 which is higher than that obtained in coagulation and filtration 12 effectiveness above 75 was found for the range of water temperatures tw 10 c to 25 c for hrt 24 h for the same range of water temperatures particle removal effectiveness was 90 for hrt 48 h 4 3 e coli disinfection by daphnia filtration hrt fine tuning boosted e coli inactivation up to hrt 24 h after which a further rise in hrt led to no discernible further improvement for hrt 24 h the e coli inactivation by daphnia filtration ranged from 1 log unit to 3 log units for the range of temperatures studied 8 c to 27 c this inactivation is in agreement with the e coli inactivation by daphnia of 1 5 3 log units in 24 h found by ismail et al 38 in ponds and synthetic freshwater respectively e coli inactivation increased with hrt and for hrt 72 h this ranged from 1 log unit to 5 log units for the water temperatures studied however for hrt 72 h a further increase in hrt did not noticeably affect the e coli inactivation the levels of e coli inactivation obtained in the present study are similar to those found with conventional systems such as uv which are in the range of 3 log unit for a uv dose of 10 mj cm 2 to 6 log units for a uv dose of 30 mj cm 2 48 wei et al 49 found an e coli inactivation of 3 5 log units with a uv dose of 7 5 mj cm 2 increasing by one more logarithmic unit when uv was combined with other treatments ozone or chlorine in the current study the e coli inactivation increased with the daphnia concentration aligning with the results of ismail et al 38 therefore the e coli inactivation in the daphnia reactor was higher than that obtained by sand filtration 11 for hrt 24 h and warm temperatures tw 20 c the e coli inactivation reached its maximum value and complete water disinfection was achieved given this under optimal conditions the tertiary treatment based on daphnia filtration produced regenerated wastewater with a reduction of e coli that was similar to that obtained with ultrafiltration membranes 13 the e coli inactivation depended on water temperature between 11 c and 18 c disinfection increased progressively with water temperature finally reaching 2 log units for water temperatures above 16 c the system showed a faster increase in disinfection up to 20 c decreasing afterwards with a further increase in water temperature the low disinfection levels observed at water temperatures below 16 c might be attributed to the fact that daphnia grow more slowly at these water temperatures these results are in accordance with the findings by ismail et al 38 who found that at low water temperatures filter feeding by daphnia was reduced in addition periods of low water temperatures typically go together with fewer hours of solar radiation however for water temperatures above 16 c daphnia growth is enhanced and their filtration activity increases coinciding with longer periods of solar radiation low water temperatures combined with low solar radiation corresponding to the end of the summer are likely to favour e coli development 41 besides this seasonal effect in all of the samples analysed in the ca set up and for all the hrt studied e coli remained below 16 cfu 100 ml based on the e coli inactivation disinfections above 3 log units were achieved for hrt 12 h for a water temperature close to 20 c for water temperatures 15 c and 20 c disinfection was below 3 log units for hrt 48 h 5 conclusions the nature based solution presented in this study successfully develops a wastewater tertiary treatment based on daphnia filtration as a polishing system the daphnia filtration system can be used connected to either conventional wastewater treatment set ups i e activated sludge with and without nitrogen and phosphorus treatment or to nature based solutions such as a vermifiltration system the daphnia filtration system which does not require the use of chemicals has no negative impact on the environment and is highly efficient in removing suspended particles while reducing the production of sludge the deterministic models presented here predict the particle removal and the e coli inactivation in the three systems studied for the different seasons of the year a set of water temperatures and solar radiation and hydraulic residence times have been used to calibrate the models to best predict particle removal and e coli disinfection by the daphnia filtration system hydraulic residence times above 24 h reduced the concentration of suspended particles by 75 with water temperatures in the range of 10 c to 27 c and produced e coli inactivations of 1 3 log units in water temperature ranges from 8 c to 27 c t these models have provided essential data in understanding how to optimize daphnia filtration tertiary treatment informing us for example when the best time to inoculate the daphnia is and determining which operating conditions are the most efficient they also reveal the daphnia filtration and particle sedimentation parameters required to achieve the desired wastewater quality in terms of both particle removal and disinfection the results of the models also allow us to identify the best operating conditions to obtain wastewater of the quality required to meet specific country s regulations for the different reuse applications declaration of

12741,when implementing an electrochemical advanced oxidation process eaop for wastewater treatment the composition of the wastewater to be treated and the selection of the reactor operating mode are key parameters to be considered given their strong influence on the degradation kinetics energy consumption operating costs and environmental impacts to this end this study investigated the degradation of carbamazepine cbz in different matrices i e pure water vs synthetic secondary effluent high vs low organic ion content single vs multicomponent systems and under several reactor

opportunities for developing more efficient eaops where no additional chemicals are needed and hence where secondary waste streams can be mitigated while energy consumption is minimized and degradation efficiency is enhanced in particular treating cbz polluted secondary wastewater effluent in fed batch mode could lead to up to a 2 1 fold increase in degradation and a 60 reduction in

persistence was in the same study the most frequently detected api with a frequency of 62 for the river catchments under study followed by metformin and caffeine with 61 1 and 56 1 respectively 1 2 as already manifested in the united nations sustainable development goals 3 there is no doubt that water pollution is a global threat to both environmental and human health and that it needs to be approached at the source by developing more advanced wastewater treatment methods among novel treatments electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops have been effectively applied to degrade contaminants of emerging concern cecs in various wastewater streams 4 7 in our previous work an eaop treatment based on a boron doped diamond bdd anode effectively removed carbamazepine cbz in pure water by electrogenerated hydroxyl oh and sulfate so 4 radicals 8 an advantage of such a treatment relied on the lower chemical use in comparison to others previously reported in the literature 5 9 given that sulfate so4 2 and nitrate no3 ions which promoted the generation of oxidative species were used at similar concentrations to those found in wastewater effluents hence it can be argued that there is a potential for promoting a self cleaning effect when these ionic species are present in wastewater thereby avoiding additional chemicals and their subsequent secondary waste streams and extra costs currently one of the main shortcomings in the industrial roll out of eaops is ascribed to the limited space time yield i e amount of contaminant removed per unit volume and unit time and subsequent high energy consumption that arise when dealing with real wastewater effluents due to the parasitic reactions that may take place 6 9 in addition mass transfer limitations and low current efficiencies are also key challenges when translating a laboratory electrochemical cell into a reactor at the industrial scale with the additional obstacle that information on reactor operating modes other than batch systems is scarce 6 10 the goal of this study was to fill the existing knowledge gap on wastewater composition and reactor operation effects so that eaops can be designed more effectively for practical applications in tertiary wastewater treatment therefore our work evaluated 8 scenarios for the degradation of carbamazepine cbz which generated insights into the influence of i the wastewater matrix considering several pure and synthetic wastewater compositions ii the reactor operating mode namely batch fed batch and continuous iii the amount of nitrate and sulfate species as promoters of oxidative species and iv the degradation of single and multicomponent systems 2 materials methods 2 1 chemicals carbamazepine c15h12n2o cbz 98 and sulfamethoxazole c10h11n3o3s smx

experimental design degradation experiments were performed in a chambered 1 l electrochemical cell as previously described by feijoo et al 8 the working electrode consisted of a boron doped diamond

especially in wastewater effluents of pharmaceutical origin in the study of multicomponent systems caffeine cff diclofenac dfc and sulfamethoxazole smx were also degradation targets together with cbz given their recurring presence and persistence 1 14 real effluent information was retrieved from the norman database and visualized in fig 1 15 as a result in the experiments in batch and fed batch mode where cbz was the only target pollutant its initial concentration was set to 236 μg l while the analogous multicomponent systems with cbz cff dfc and smx consisted of a mix of 250 μg l for each compound in the continuous operation experiments the cbz inlet concentration was 148 μg l as the eaop system under study is intended for tertiary wastewater treatment synthetic wastewater was prepared based on common secondary effluent compositions where a high content and a low content scenario were selected fig 2 16 19 in addition cl and br containing compounds were assumed not to be present to prevent the possible formation of toxic byproducts such as chlorate perchlorate and bromate 5 6 for this purpose a pretreatment of the wastewater by means of chemical precipitation adsorption oxidation or membrane separation could be carried out in practice 20 a detailed overview of the synthetic wastewater components can be found in table a 1 a summary of other experimental parameters including current density applied electrical power consumed initial and final ph and wastewater initial conductivity are included in table a 2 the influence of the wastewater composition reactor operating mode and initial concentration of ionic species as radical sources was investigated through 8 scenarios fig 3 designed as follows scenario of regulatory limits for ion discharge conducted in batch mode rl b the eu nitrates directive classified polluted water containing a concentration of more than 50 mg l nitrate especially if used or intended for the abstraction of drinking water 21 similarly a limit of 250 mg l of sulfate was defined in the council directive on the quality of water intended for human consumption by the eu 22 both limits were considered for this scenario as reasonable concentrations to enter tertiary wastewater treatment the target pollutant was solely cbz present in pure water and degradation was conducted in batch operation scenario of enhanced conductivity medium conducted in batch mode ec b since several works have reported higher concentrations of nitrate between 52 and 93 mg l in secondary effluents 17 and up to 137 mg l in wastewater treatment plants 23 and sulfate up to 500 mg l in domestic sewage 24 630 mg l in surface water 25 and up to 284 g l in industrial wastewater 26 this enhanced conductivity scenario was assumed to double the regulatory limits with 100 mg l and 500 mg l nitrate and sulfate respectively the target pollutant was solely cbz present in pure water and degradation was conducted in batch operation scenario of enhanced conductivity medium in synthetic wastewater with low ion organic content conducted in batch mode ecswl b this variation to the ec b scenario consisted of the degradation of cbz in a synthetic wastewater matrix with a low ion and organic composition as indicated in fig 2 scenario of enhanced conductivity medium in synthetic wastewater with high ion organic content conducted in batch mode ecswh b as opposed to the ecswl b scenario this scenario consisted of the degradation of cbz in a synthetic wastewater matrix with a high ion and organic composition as depicted in fig 2 scenario of enhanced conductivity medium in synthetic wastewater with low ion organic content conducted in fed batch mode ecswl fb this first alternative to the ecswl b consisted of the operation of the electrochemical cell in fed batch mode where pollutant spikes were added at the beginning of each 60 min cycle as a result the same initial cbz concentration was supplied in each cycle while keeping the rest of the wastewater matrix intact treatment was carried out for a total of 6 cycles scenario of enhanced conductivity medium in synthetic wastewater with low ion organic content conducted in continuous mode ecswl c this second alternative to the ecswl b consisted of the operation of the electrochemical cell with a continuous flow of cbz and synthetic wastewater components the inlet and outlet flows were set to 25 ml min leading to a retention time of 30 min scenario of multicomponent system in synthetic wastewater with low ion organic content conducted in batch mode mswl b the same conditions as in scenario ecswl b were used in a multicomponent system where cbz was degraded together with cff dfc and smx scenario of multicomponent system in synthetic wastewater with low ion organic content conducted in fed batch mode mswl fb this variation to the mswl b scenario consisted of the operation of the electrochemical cell in fed batch mode and thus for 6 cycles of 60 min with multicomponent spikes 2 3 chemical analysis the concentration of the selected target pollutants was quantified using a method based on that by baena nogueras et al 27 with an ultra high

the percentage of b was increased linearly up to 100 during the first 5 min and kept at 100 for 1 min the total run time was 8 min including a re equilibration time of 2 min the selected uv detection wavelength was 272 nm 2 4 data analysis degradation kinetics were modelled under pseudo first order kinetics eq 1 and fitted by nonlinear regressions with rstudio software 28 details on the

results discussion to equitably compare the 8 scenarios under study 73 cbz degradation equivalent to the average steady state conversion in continuous mode was taken as a common removal target for all treatments since it was the lowest value attained experimentally figs a 1 to a 8 for all other 7 scenarios the effective time to attain such degradation for the same initial concentration was calculated based on the retrieved kinetics fig 4 as a result it was possible to evaluate the degradation performance of all scenarios as the ratio of μg of cbz removed per min of effective treatment in addition the electrical energy consumption for each scenario expressed as kwh per g of cbz removed was determined based on experimental data regarding power consumption table a 2 as a result a comparison among scenarios is depicted in fig 5 from this comparative analysis it was observed that the scenarios with the lowest cbz degradation in relation to the required energy consumption were those where the wastewater matrix included either a high organic ion load i e ecswh b or a combination of multiple target pollutants i e mswl b being in both cases operated in batch mode and with enhanced concentrations of ionic species the hindering effect of the increased wastewater matrix complexity was also observed when comparing these two scenarios with ec b and ecswl b going from pure water to a synthetic wastewater matrix simulating a secondary effluent was translated into a 57 81 reduction in degradation performance with a 2 4 3 9 fold increase in energy consumption however an increase in ionic species that promoted the generation of oxidative species could significantly boost the degradation ratio as shown between scenarios ec b and rl b in addition the electrical energy per mass consumption was slightly lower in ec b due to the faster kinetics and thus reduced operation time on the other hand the two scenarios that allowed for the highest cbz degradation at the lowest energy consumption were ec b i e degradation of cbz in pure water with enhanced concentrations of ionic species and operated in batch mode and ecswl fb i e degradation of cbz in synthetic wastewater with a low organic ion content with enhanced concentrations of ionic species and operated in fed batch mode even if both scenarios led to similar results ec b is considered less realistic since it was dedicated to the treatment of a pure water matrix which is unlikely to be found in a real wastewater treatment plant therefore it is noteworthy to highlight the performance of scenario ecswl fb where the adverse effects of the wastewater composition were mitigated with the selection of the fed batch operation enabling a similar performance as the more idealistic scenario ec b in fact in contrast to its batch counterpart i e scenario ecswl b the fed batch operation in ecswl fb allowed for a 2 1 fold increase in degradation and a 60 reduction in energy consumption the enhanced performance in fed batch mode occurred because in the first cycle which was equivalent to a batch operation a wide set of competition as well as radical scavenging reactions originating from the wastewater components hindered cbz degradation however as these compounds were also degraded with successive cycles the degradation kinetics of cbz showcased rapid growth reaching over a 4 fold increase within 6 cycles fig 4 in a fed batch multicomponent system i e mswl fb the same behavior was observed for all four contaminants targeted fig 6 leading to a 79 increase in degradation and a 37 decrease in energy consumption with respect to the batch treatment i e mswl b finally the operation in continuous mode i e ecswl c was better than the batch equivalent given that it led to the same degradation while consuming 19 less energy although it did not outperform the fed batch operation 4 conclusions the performance of the electrochemical oxidation process under study both in terms of degradation efficiency and electrical energy consumption was found to be enhanced when promoting the following conditions i higher concentrations of ionic species that may lead to the generation of oxidative species although the bottom line was that it was possible to operate at their naturally occurring concentrations in wastewater effluents and induce a self cleaning effect ii lower wastewater complexity in terms of other ions and organic species as they caused scavenging and parasitic reactions iii targeting a single pollutant over a multicomponent system to avoid competition reactions and iv operating in fed batch over conventional batch mode in terms of the reactor operating mode the results showed that continuous operation would also outperform batch treatment as significant energy savings could be attained from an implementation point of view it was advantageous to observe that the 8 scenarios under study could operate at low concentrations of sulfate and nitrate ions and promote the sufficient generation of oxidative species to degrade cbz therefore a tertiary wastewater treatment plant could benefit from the intrinsic self cleaning capabilities of the influent wastewater when implementing eaop treatment if these ionic species were not naturally present at the influent and hence were added as reactants the selection of the reactor operating mode would play a more determinant role in this case it would be more beneficial to operate in fed batch mode given that the reactants are only added at the start and are further reused across the successive cycles while enhancing the degradation kinetics and minimizing energy consumption nevertheless it should be noted that operating in fed batch mode could be constrained to having a secondary concentrated stream of pollutant to be used for the spikes such a stream could either originate from hospitals or the pharmaceutical industry given their higher pollution levels or could also be prepared in house by including a pre concentration unit operation for a part of the influent in the wastewater treatment process to further evaluate the suitability of these treatments an evaluation of their

12741,when implementing an electrochemical advanced oxidation process eaop for wastewater treatment the composition of the wastewater to be treated and the selection of the reactor operating mode are key parameters to be considered given their strong influence on the degradation kinetics energy consumption operating costs and environmental impacts to this end this study investigated the degradation of carbamazepine cbz in different matrices i e pure water vs synthetic secondary effluent high vs low organic ion content single vs multicomponent systems and under several reactor operating modes i e batch fed batch and continuous the key findings of this research are i the self cleaning capabilities that naturally occurring ionic species in wastewater i e sulfate and nitrate ions offer even if present at low concentrations and ii the significant performance implications resulting from the reactor operation selection by combining both insights this study illustrates the opportunities for developing more efficient eaops where no additional chemicals are needed and hence where secondary waste streams can be mitigated while energy consumption is minimized and degradation efficiency is enhanced in particular treating cbz polluted secondary wastewater effluent in fed batch mode could lead to up to a 2 1 fold increase in degradation and a 60 reduction in energy with respect to a batch equivalent despite the hindering effects that competition reactions from other wastewater constituents entailed keywords electrochemical advanced oxidation processes

promote the sufficient generation of oxidative species to degrade cbz therefore a tertiary wastewater treatment plant could benefit from the intrinsic self cleaning capabilities of the influent wastewater when implementing eaop treatment if these ionic species were not naturally present at the influent and hence were added as reactants the selection of the reactor operating mode would play a more determinant role in this case it would be more beneficial to operate in fed batch mode given that the reactants are only added at the start and are further reused across the successive cycles while enhancing the degradation kinetics and minimizing energy consumption nevertheless it should be noted that operating in fed batch mode could be constrained to having a secondary concentrated stream of pollutant to be used for the spikes such a stream could either originate from hospitals or the pharmaceutical industry given their higher pollution levels or could also be prepared in house by including a pre concentration unit operation for a part of the influent in the wastewater treatment process to further evaluate the suitability of these treatments an evaluation of their environmental and economic implications at a larger scale is recommended credit authorship contribution statement sara feijoo conceptualization formal analysis investigation methodology visualization

12742,sustainable waste management practices embrace integrating renewable resources such as biomass production and utilisation as an alternative means of waste disposal cobalt was selected as a target heavy metal because it is anticipated to be a human carcinogen which finds its way into surface waters via industrial applications such as mining electroplating paints pigments and electronics and anticipated advanced oxidation processes using cobalt catalysed peroxymonosulphate in this study we applied waste derived from pineapple in pristine rpp and modified form carbonised cpp and chemically treated ctpp for removing co ii ions from the aqueous system the biosorbents were characterised using ftir sem and bet techniques results from batch studies were subjected to relevant kinetic and equilibrium modelling best performing cpp was applied to removing co ii from simulated and real wastewater in column studies kinetic and equilibrium data were better described with the pseudo second order and freundlich isotherm respectively column data shows a saturation value ts 22 90 mg g that agreed with langmuir s predicted qmax qe 22 31 mg g and was best fitted with the yoon

biosorption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction remediation of heavy metals such as as cd cr co pb ni etc from aqueous industrial streams is of environmental interest due to the recalcitrant and persistent nature of heavy metals in the environment 1 heavy metals go on to bioaccumulate in organic tissue where they cause several metabolic dysfunctions 2 cobalt a first row transition element is a heavy metal of industrial interest cobalt is considered an energy transition metal etm and a strategic or critical raw material for which global stockpiling is desired 3 world cobalt production and terrestrial cobalt reserves are estimated to be 2 million and 25 million tonnes respectively 3 industrial uses include super and magnetic alloys 4 cement 5 lithium batteries in electronic devices as a catalyst in petrochemical processes as a pigment in glass paints inks and enamelware 6 although cobalt is required to activate carboxypeptidase vitamin b 12 and methylcobalamin 7 it can go on to bioaccumulate in organic tissue at excessive dosages with related health implications based on its toxicity the un ghs mixture rules apply to cobalt salts 0 3 3000 ppm are reproductive toxicants and 3 30 000 ppm are suspected of harming the unborn child 8 the government of british columbia and the european chemicals agency set the limit of aqueous cobalt for downstream users at 0 11 and 0 01 mg l respectively 9 10 the who does not stipulate a limit on drinking water the cobalt industry responsible assessment framework ciraf enables a coherent and consistent approach to cobalt due diligence and reporting by the cobalt industry in line with sustainable cobalt production and sourcing 11 the new harmonised eu classification of cobalt metal effective october 2021 considers cobalt a presumed human carcinogen category 1b for all routes of exposure cobalt is also considered a reproductive toxicant category 1b and a suspected mutagen category 2 cobalt salts including sulphate dinitrate oxalates etc are classified as reproductive toxicants that may damage fertility and are suspected of harming the unborn child repr 2 h361d 8 11 the associated risk of cobalt trade include environmental air water soil environmental impacts biodiversity occupational health and safety and community livelihoods cobalt surface water contamination may occur from natural sources anthropogenic discharges mine runoffs or blow dust 12 reported surface and well water values ranged from 0 03 to 15 20 mg l 13 15 conventional treatment technologies for removing heavy metals from aqueous streams include chemical precipitation solvent extraction electrolytic extraction ion exchange cementation filtration adsorption and reverse osmosis 16 17 these methods suffer from drawbacks such as high capital cost or regeneration of residual sludge 18 20 new sulphate radical advanced oxidation processes that are developed for the treatment of textile wastewater could potentially add to residual cobalt in treated water 21 23 since cobalt was found to be the best activator of peroxymonosulphate therefore low cost efficient technologies are needed to remove these toxic heavy metals from industrial wastewater before discharge biosorption the passive uptake of metals by biomass has demonstrated great potential as an emerging technology for heavy metal remediation in aqueous streams the focus on biomass applied for biosorption has shifted to the abundant supply of agricultural waste generated in agrarian nations these agricultural wastes are considered economic sorbents because they are plentiful and require little or no processing before application agricultural wastes reportedly used for biosorption include rice husks and barn 24 26 coconut coir 27 fruit wastes 28 31 and more recently activated carbons derived from agricultural waste 32 36 these materials contain cellulose hemicellulose lignin starch sugars and other functional groups capable of binding and chelating metals out of solution 37 the application of fruit and vegetable waste for wastewater remediation is a sustainable integrated waste management iwm approach that is strategic practical and efficient the approach is anchored on the pillars of sustainability which include environmental economic and social responsibility 38 a review highlighted the versatility of agricultural waste peels such as orange pomelo grapefruit lemon banana cassava jackfruit garlic and pomegranate peels for heavy metal biosorption from wastewater 39 reports have shown that world industries produce 25 million tonnes of pineapples with 50 65 of total produce turning out as waste 40 41 south africa produces 115 000 tonnes of pineapples making it the seventh highest fruit crop 42 ahmad khatoon 30 demonstrated the efficiency of pristine and chemically modified pineapple peels for metal biosorption in batch systems to develop the thrusts of integrated waste management this study extended the work of ahmad khatoon 30 keying into the abundant supply of pineapple peels preliminary testing of literature treatment procedures in batch processes showed that the instability of the pristine and chemically treated pineapple peels could be overcome by pyrolytically converting the peels to activated carbon moreover the batch process was developed into a continuous column system because industrial continuous fixed bed absorbers do not run under equilibrium conditions 43 the experimental findings from a continuous column bed are necessary for developing industrial scale treatment plants 31 to date no one has yet extended the lab studies to test performance on real wastewater treated with cobalt catalysed sulphate radical advanced oxidation process in this work the pineapple peel based activated carbon after batch testing was used in a column system and further extended to remediate cobalt ions from a real wastewater matrix in column mode 2 materials and method 2 1 reagents cobalt chloride hexahydrate cocl2 6h2o mm 237 93 g mol and 1000 ppm stock cobalt solution for instrument calibration was obtained from sigma aldrich south africa activated carbon ac used as a control was purchased from bdh chemicals england all plastic beakers and reagent bottles were washed soaked in 5 nitric acid overnight and rinsed copiously with deionized water prior to use 2 2 preparation of biosorbents and wastewater waste pineapple peels were collected from a local fruit and vegetable market in the cape town business district samples were washed and oven dried at 60 c until completely dry the dried biosorbent was converted to powder by mechanical grinding in a ball mill ground biosorbent was subjected to physical and chemical treatment for physical treatment 50 g of biosorbent was carbonised under nitrogen 10 ml min at 600 c for 2 h in a pyro therm tube furnace alser teknik seramik ptf series turkey the heated sample was cooled down overnight chemical treatment was done according to ahmad khatoon 30 briefly 50 g of pristine pineapple peels were treated with 380 ml kmno4 and subsequently with 380 ml 0 1 m h2so4 the treated sample was washed with milliq water until the solution was neutral to litmus paper the treated samples were oven dried at 60 c for 24 h pristine carbonised and chemically treated pineapple peels were sieved to a uniform size 150 μm and labelled rpp cpp and ctpp respectively real wastewater was obtained from the sump of a dye house in cape town south africa the wastewater was treated for colour using cobalt based advanced oxidation process see supplementary data 2 3 batch biosorption experiments batch biosorption experiments were conducted by contacting 30 ml of co ii ion solution with biomass in a 200 ml plastic beaker for the desired time at a fixed shaking speed 100 rpm on a linear orbital shaker we varied the following biosorption parameters contact time 0 180 min initial co ii ion concentration 1 200 mg l ph 2 9 and biosorbent mass 0 05 g 1 g for rpp only the solution ph was adjusted using 0 1 m naoh or 0 1 m hcl hanna instrument 2211 romania after each batch experiment samples were filtered through a whatman filter no 1 paper and cobalt ions in clear supernatant were analysed by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy perkin elmer aa200 usa eq 1 was used to calculate the removal efficiency of co ii ions deionized water was used as the negative control while a blank co ii solution without biosorbent with a concentration equivalent to the experiment conducted was used as the positive control 1 adsorption c i c t c i 100 the biosorption capacities of the rpp cpp ctpp and ac for co ii ions at equilibrium were calculated as 2 q e mg g c i c e m v where c i c e and c t are the initial equilibrium and concentration at time t respectively v is the volume of aqueous solution l and m is the mass of biosorbent g used in the experiment 44 45 2 4 column design and experimental procedure column studies were carried out in a 19 cm plastic column 1 7 cm id filled with a known quantity of cpp to ensure a closely packed arrangement cpp was placed in between glass wool co ii solutions were pumped with a peristaltic pump watson marlow 205s england connected to the top of the column with a downward flow 31 the treated co ii solution was collected at the bottom of the column and analysed for co ii by aas all experiments were conducted at 26 c ph 6 and under atmospheric pressure the volume of effluent treated at bed saturation v s ml per gram of cpp was calculated using the following equation 3 v s q t s where t s min is the time taken to reach bed saturation and q is the volumetric flowrate of co ii ion solution through the column ml min the point t s was identified from the breakthrough curve as the point of inflexion of the second half of the curve approx 0 90c i this was because experiments conducted at low co ii ion concentration never reached t s as defined previously 46 likewise t b described the breaking point which was read off from the breakthrough curve as the point where the first half of the curve showed an inflexion approx 0 05c i 47 amount of co ii ions absorbed mg g at t b and t s by a given weight of biosorbent w were given as q b and q s respectively and calculated by eqs 4 and 5 the fractional bed utilisation fbu was calculated by eq 6 4

characterised using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy perkin elmer uatir ftir llantrisant uk spectra of the dry biosorbents were measured between 4000 cm 1 to 400 cm 1 the surface texture and morphology of samples were analysed by high resolution scanning electron microscopy auriga instruments hr sem usa equipped with secondary electron detectors coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds samples for hr sem were applied to double sided carbon tape mounted on the sem stub before microscopy imaging samples were then coated with a thin layer of au pd to eliminate charging artefacts using a q150t turbo pumped sputter equipped with an edwards vacuum pump bet surface area pore size and pore volume were determined using a micrometrics tristar ii 3020 usa prior to analysis samples were degassed at 200 c under a vacuum for 12 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterisation sem micrographs of biosorbents before and after biosorption are shown in figs 1 and 2 rpp samples before and after biosorption fig 1 1a and 1b respectively showed an uneven texture exhibiting both thick threads and irregular shapes the morphology of the ctpp in fig 1 2a and 2b respectively showed smaller fragments due to increased surface area the surface of the cpp before and after biosorption shown in fig 2 1a and 1b respectively appeared to be decorated with smaller particles compared to the smooth texture of the rpp and ctpp the ac samples before and after adsorption shown in fig 2 2a and 2b were decorated with finer dust like particles there were no observable changes in the morphology of all materials after sorption experiments eds in conjunction with sem was used to determine the elemental composition of biosorbents before and after biosorption in general the eds results summarised in table 1 showed a high percentage of c and o as expected from an organic matrix the o content of cpp was significantly lower than rpp and ctpp the presence of o on the activated carbon ac which was used as received may be attributed to adsorbed water molecules on the ac before biosorption the biosorbents showed no cobalt in their elemental composition rpp and ac did not show any traces of co after sorption experiments table 1 however ctpp and cpp showed the presence of co ii in their eds spectrum after biosorption 0 06 and 0 2 respectively a representative eds spectrum showing co ii peaks on cpp is shown in fig 3 while a comparative spectrum with unused cpp is given in supplementary data fig s1 the ftir of rpp fig 4a resembles superimposed spectra of cellulose and lignin which are the significant components of pineapple peels the bands at 3307 and 2910 cm 1 correspond to oh and ch stretching vibrations of lignin and cellulose 44 45 48 this oh band that ranges from 3200 to 3500 cm 1 is observed in all tested biosorbents except cpp lignin specific peaks appeared at 2846 and 1712 cm 1 and correspond to the stretching of methyl methoxy and carbonyl of unconjugated ketones respectively aromatic skeletal vibrations in lignin are represented in the range 1598 1235 cm 1 fig 4 the intense 1030 band is indicative of the c o c pyranose ring stretching of cellulose 30 we observed a significant decrease in intensities of all lignin and cellulose characteristic bands fig 4b indicating the involvement of the identified functional groups after co ii biosorption ctpp fig 4c showed a significant reduction of cellulose pyranose band and aromatic fingerprint bands of lignin after oxidation and complete elimination of these peaks in cpp upon carbonisation fig 4e there was no significant or observable difference in the ftir spectrum of ctpp and cpp before and after application for the sorption of co ii fig 4d and f respectively the ftir spectrum of pristine and used ac showed broad absorbed water stretching oh band at 3214 cm 1 and 3352 cm 1 respectively fig 4g h the specific surface area and other bet parameters could not be determined for rpp because the biosorbent was unstable at the degassing temperature of 200 c the treated samples were however stable and their bet parameters are summarised in table 2 it should be mentioned that the treatment processes to give ctpp and cpp gave only 30 product yield and such mass losses during assay were unsuitable for bet measurement biosorbent obtained by chemical treatment ctpp had a higher surface area and pore size 1 23 m2 g and 470 25 å than that obtained from carbonisation 0 23 m2 g and 69 56 å 3 2 effect of various operating variables on biosorption of cobalt ions 3 2 1 effect of biosorbent dose the effect of biosorbent dose was determined for rpp by equilibrating 30 ml 50 mg l co ii solution with masses increased from 0 05 to 0 5 g removal efficiency increased with increasing mass fig 5 from 35 0 05 g to 40 0 1 g after which removal efficiency reduced markedly dropping to 28 0 4 g the initial increase in co ii removal is attributed to an increase in active sites for metal sorption with an increase in biosorbent mass a further increase in biosorbent mass under the experimental conditions brought about a decrease in removal efficiency due to aggregation of particles resulting in a reduction of surface area 0 05 g of the other biosorbents was selected as the dose for the comparative study this selection is despite a higher percentage removal given by 0 1 g it was rationalised that a better result was obtained when 0 05 g was used in two cycles compared to using 0 1 g in a single exercise 3 2 2 effect of ph the ph of the solution is the most critical parameter as it controls the overall reaction and mechanism of the ions involved in the biosorption process including metal precipitation as hydroxides ph in this study was surveyed in the range 3 9 fig 5b shows the effect of solution ph on cobalt ion removal as shown the removal of cobalt improves with increasing ph reaching a plateau for rpp and ctpp and finally reaching a peak at ph 6 for cpp and ac after ph 6 biosorption decreases with a further increase in ph this phenomenon is explained based on less competition between positively charged h and co2 ions for the active sites on the biosorbent as the ph increases more negatively charged sites are exposed on the biosorbent matrix and account for the improved removal of cationic species 49 the reduction of co ii ion removal beyond ph 6 is presumably due to the formation of soluble hydroxylated complexes of the metal ion 3 2 3 effect of contact time in general co ii removal was rapid at 0 5 min co ii removal was above 20 for all biosorbents and increased steadily for cpp which finally plateaued after 60 min fig 5c rpp which started with a rapid reduction of 45 began to undergo significant desorption of cobalt ions reaching equilibrium after 90 min fig 5b conversely ctpp with a much lower immediate removal 21 0 5 min rose steadily plateauing at 90 min the initially rapid metal biosorption has been due to the abundant active sites 48 while the subsequent slower biosorption rate has been previously attributed to metal saturation of active sites 50 3 2 4 effect of initial metal ion the effect of initial co ii ion concentration on co ii ion sorption was studied in the range of 1 mg l 200 mg l fig 5d at low concentrations 10 mg l biosorption by cpp and ctpp was identical but varied markedly above 25 mg l maximum quantity of co ii ions qe mg g for cpp 16 87 mg g and ctpp 15 84 mg g was obtained when initial co ii ion was 100 mg l the higher sorption character of cpp suggests an inverse relationship between pore size pore volume and cobalt biosorption both modified samples displayed superior biosorption capacity compared to the raw biosorbent rpp and the activation carbon control ac the behaviour of rpp suggests that concentrations above 50 mg l favour metal desorption from the biomass 3 3 biosorption kinetic modelling the process of co ii uptake and rate controlling mechanism may be analysed by kinetic models which often give good predictions of qe these may be extrapolated to designing and modelling a fixed bed biosorption system 51 the linearised pseudo first eq 7 and pseudo second eq 8 order equations were applied to interpret the kinetic data 7 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t 8 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where q e and q t in mg g are the biosorption capacitates at equilibrium and at time t min respectively a plot of log q e q t versus time was drawn for eq 7 and the values of q e and k 1 min 1 were estimated from intercept and slope respectively for eq 8 a plot of t q t versus t was used to estimate q e and k 2 g mg min from the slope and intercept respectively a summary of the kinetic parameters obtained from the models is shown in table 3 lagergren s eq 7 depicts the biosorption of solids liquid systems based on the sorption capacity of the solid 52 while ho s eq 8 describes the chemisorption kinetics from liquid solutions 53 as seen in table 3 the pseudo first order kinetic model fails to estimate the experimentally observed q e which was better predicted by the pseudo second order model accuracy 90 100 r2 0 98 hence it may be concluded that the rate limiting step is based on the chemisorption of co ii ions onto biosorbent surfaces this finding agrees with previous studies 30 44 45 the intraparticle diffusion model proposed by weber and morris 54 argues that the metal sorption mechanism occurs on the surface of the biosorbent this model provided an insight into mechanisms for rpp and cpp and is mathematically illustrated by eq 9 9 q t k id t 0 5 c where k id is the intraparticle diffusion constant mg g min0 5 and c is a constant which gives an idea about the boundary layer a linear plot of q t versus t 0 5 gives k id and c as slope and intercept respectively the regressions obtained for eq 9 showed that only ctpp agreed with the intraparticle diffusion model with a boundary layer half that of rpp on closer inspection of the intraparticle diffusion plots for rpp and cpp we observed that the graph presented several linear regions fig 6 with different operating mechanisms the absorption by rpp is instantaneous with a maximum reached within 30 s the first region and second regions of the diffusion plot fig 6a are due to film diffusion of co ii molecules from and onto the surface of the biosorbent as dynamic equilibrium is attained up until a stabilisation point at region three 3 where intraparticle diffusion becomes the controlling factor on the other hand cpp did not show instantaneous biosorption as with rpp and displayed only two regions fig 6b the first region was due to fil diffusion into the biosorbent and the second region was due to intraparticle diffusion of co ii into active sites these multilinear plots have been previously used to describe kinetic data in the literature 44 55 they are evidence that mechanisms are usually simultaneously based on multiple theories the maxima qe obtained in fig 5d also agree with experimentally observed qe a complete plot of kinetic models is presented in figs s2 and s3 3 4 equilibrium modelling langmuir 56 and freundlich 57 adsorption isotherms were used to evaluate the effect of initial co ii ion concentration and the data is given in table 4 the linearised forms of both isotherms are given in eqs 10 and 11 10 1 q e 1 q m b c e 1 q m 11 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where q e mg g q m mg g b and c e in eq 10 are the amount of co ii sorbed per unit mass of biosorbent at a given concentration maximum monolayer biosorption capacity langmuir affinity constant and concentration of co ii ions in solution at equilibrium respectively q e mg g k f mg g l mg 1 n and c e in eq 11 are amount of co ii sorbed per unit mass of biosorbent at a given concentration freundlich constant and equilibrium concentration of co ii in solution 1 n is related to the intensity of biosorption in general the biosorption character of the biosorbents for co ii was better described by the freundlich model r2 0 85 0 99 compared to the langmuir model r2 0 34 0 76 and supports the theory of surface heterogeneity and an exponential distribution of site and energies 45 langmuir model overestimates the batch biosorption capacities as shown from qmax and qe obs in table 4 values of 1 n between 0 and 1 indicate favourable co ii biosorption under the studied condition 45 when 1 n is close to 1 biosorption interactions occur via physisorption 58 the inner and outer sphere complexation mechanism has contributed to increased co ii removal and a reduced value of freundlich intensity constant 1 n 59 the order of favourable biosorption based on 1 n values was cpp ctpp rpp ac notably the biosorbents all outperformed the ac used as experimental control demonstrating the advantage posed by utilising this waste material for metal remediation furthermore cpp qmax situates well in the literature on materials used for co biosorption it performed better than recently tested rafsanjan pistachio shell barley straw ash sunflower and nut seed powder table 5 and may be improved via composite mixtures as demonstrated in the literature 3 5 continuous biosorption in a packed column cpp showed promise as a suitable biosorbent outperforming the pristine rpp and the chemically treated ctpp also unlike the latter two biosorbents cpp did not leave organic matter residue in the final remediated water see fig s5 this problem is reportedly encountered while working with untreated biomass and is overcome by carbonisation 70 the carbonised cpp was subsequently subjected to column studies to ascertain continuous fixed bed parameters necessary for industrial scale treatment column performance was studied by varying the efficiency of flowrate bed height and initial concentration of co ii feed solution 3 5 1 effect of bed mass height co ii ions uptake in a fixed bed depends on the quantity of solid biosorbent in the bed the effect of bed height was studied by varying cpp packing in the column 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 g corresponding to 0 96 1 8 and 2 8 cm respectively other parameters were held constant flow rate ph and co ii ion concentration were 3 ml min 6 and 50 mg l as shown in fig 7a an increase in the bed mass and consequently bed height leads to a less steep breakthrough curve as bed saturation is achieved less quickly bed saturation increases from 31 min at a packing mass of 0 5 g to 75 min at a packing mass of 1 5 g increased bed mass also increases residence time and the fractional bed utilisation of the column fbu response factors tb ts vs qb qs and fbu for the experimental condition are summarised in table 6 3 5 2 effect of flowrate the effect of flowrate on co ii biosorption was studied by varying the flowrate from 1 to 5 ml min while other parameters were held constant ph 6 co ii 50 mg l bed mass 1 g experimental breakthrough curves are illustrated in fig 7b and depict that tb and ts vary inversely with flow rate the functional bed utilisation fbu however decreased with increasing flowrate due to the shorter residence time of the fluid passing through the bed at a higher flow rate table 6 3 5 3 effect of co ii feed concentration the effect of concentration was studied by varying concentrations from 10 mg l to 50 mg l the results are shown in fig 7c tb decreased with increase in co ii concentration from tb 20 min at 10 mg l to tb 8 min at 50 mg l table 6 in a similar manner ts decreased with increasing co ii from ts 150 min at 10 mg l to ts 42 min at 50 mg l a shorter breakpoint and saturation point are obtained at higher concentrations due to the increased co ii ions per unit volume of treated solution sorbed by the biosorbent maximum quantity at saturation was obtained when co ii ion in solution was 25 mg l 3 6 modelling of column data the adams bohart thomas and yoon nelson models were studied to determine biosorption capacity kinetic constants and column breakthrough performance 3 6 1 adams bohart model adams bohart model originally developed to describe the adsorption behaviour of chlorine onto charcoal 71 when extended to metal sorption the model assumes that biosorbent residual capacity and heavy metal concentration are proportional to biosorption rate and equilibrium is not spontaneous the model describes the column s operating limit or the breakthrough curve s fledging stage 72 the linearised bohart adam model is given as 12 ln c t c 0 k ba c 0 t k ba n ba h v where c 0 and c t are initial and concentrations in mg l at a time t respectively k ba is bohart adams kinetic constant l mg min v is linear flow velocity in cm min n ba is saturated concentration in mg l a plot of ln c t c 0 versus t was extended to data on bed mass flowrate and co ii ion concentration and are given in fig s6a d and g respectively a summary of constants is shown in table 7 an increase in co ii concentration is expected to give an increase in k ba as previously reported 47 due to kinetically driven mass transfer of co ii ions however the bohart adams model was unsuitable for explaining other aspects of the biosorption process since r2 values were comparatively less than other models 3 6 2 thomas model the thomas model infers packed column plug flow behaviour and uses the langmuir model for equilibrium 73 the model is applicable for biosorption study only when the limitations for external and internal wide distributions are neglected 31 the linearised thomas model is given by eq 13 13 ln c 0 c t 1 k th q th m q k th c 0 v q where k th is the rate constant in ml mg min q th is the biosorption capacity in mg g c 0 and c t are co ii ion concentration at the inlet and at a time t respectively v is the volume of treated solution a plot of ln c 0 c t 1 versus v for data on the effect of mass flowrate and co ii concentration provide values of thomas constants for these experiments fig s6b e f a summary of these constants is given in table 7 thomas rate constant k th increased with increasing concentration and flowrate and decreased with increased mass of bed the maximum predicted biosorption capacity 24 38 mg g was obtained when the inlet volume was 10 mg l while this was in close agreement with the maximum observed biosorption capacity 22 89 mg g the experimental conditions were not identical in general despite the high regression values the predictions provided by the thomas model did not fit with the experimentally observed values they would suggest that other external factors are limiting variables in the biosorption process 3 6 3 yoon nelson model the yoon nelson model assumes that the reduction in biosorption probability for every adsorbate molecule is equivalent to sorbate biosorption probability and is given by eq 14 14 ln c t c 0 c t k yn t k yn τ where k yn represents the rate constant in l min and τ represents the required time for column outlet concentration to reach 50 c 0 74 graph of ln c t c 0 c t versus t provided the values of constants the values of r2 for the yoon nelson model better fit experimental data yoon nelson biosorption constant k yn expectedly increased with increasing concentration due to an increased rate of saturation 3 7 remediation of real wastewater the goal of developing low cost biosorbents is to seek application in industrial settings where the biomass would encounter a myriad of metals organics and other variable factors under such conditions the behaviour of the biosorbent can be assessed for its ultimate suitability for metal remediation under the advised experimental conditions for this reason cpp was applied for treating dye sump wastewater obtained from a dye house in cape town south africa obtained wastewater was subjected to an advanced oxidation process based on cobalt oxide mediated sulphate radicals generated from peroxymonosulphate supplementary section the final treated water had a residual cobalt concentration of 16 34 mg l and was subjected to remediation for co ii ions using cpp breakthrough curves for the removal of co ii ions from the remediated wastewater are shown in fig 8a and the predictions offered by various models are shown in fig 8b modelling parameters applied were drawn from constants obtained from experiments conducted at co ii concentration 25 mg l 3 ml min flowrate and 1 g bed mass the breakpoint time tb and saturation time ts for the removal of co ii ions were observed at 20 min and 100 min respectively with the bed reaching saturation after treating 300 ml of cobalt contaminated wastewater the thomas model best interpreted the breakthrough curve in the studied time range 4 conclusion this study modified biomass derived from pineapple peels by physical and chemical methods and applied biosorbents for aqueous co ii ions biosorption batch results showed that the optimal biosorption ph was 6 and maximum sorption occurred within 90 min chemically modified pineapple peels ctpp and carbonised pineapple peels cpp with a maximum biosorption capacity of 16 73 mg g and 22 31 mg g respectively both performed better than the raw biosorbent rpp 8 96 mg g batch sorption experiments were best fitted to the freundlich isotherm and the biosorption process followed second order chemisorption kinetics the intraparticle diffusion model predicted multiple mechanistic co ii ion removal pathways in rpp and cpp column study using cpp showed that column breakpoint and saturation times varied directly with bed mass and inversely with cobalt concentration and flow rate the maximum column qs 22 90 mg g agreed with the predicted langmuir qmax breakthrough curves were better fitted with the thomas model which also better predicted the metal profile when cpp was applied to treat real wastewater this study demonstrates the potential advantage of pineapple peels when used in their modified form especially by carbonisation for the remediation of real wastewater contaminated with cobalt declaration of

target heavy metal because it is anticipated to be a human carcinogen which finds its way into surface waters via industrial applications such as mining electroplating paints pigments and electronics and anticipated advanced oxidation processes using cobalt catalysed peroxymonosulphate in this study we applied waste derived from pineapple in pristine rpp and modified form carbonised cpp and chemically treated ctpp for removing co ii ions from the aqueous system the biosorbents were characterised using ftir sem and bet techniques results from batch studies were subjected to relevant

biosorption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction remediation of heavy metals such as as cd cr co pb ni etc from aqueous industrial streams is of environmental interest due to the recalcitrant and persistent nature of heavy metals in the environment 1 heavy metals go on to bioaccumulate in organic tissue where they cause several metabolic dysfunctions 2 cobalt a first row transition element is a heavy metal of industrial interest cobalt is considered an energy transition metal etm and a strategic or critical raw material for which global stockpiling is desired 3 world cobalt production and terrestrial cobalt reserves are estimated to be 2 million and 25 million tonnes respectively 3 industrial uses include super and magnetic alloys 4 cement 5 lithium batteries in electronic devices as a catalyst in petrochemical processes as a pigment in glass paints inks and enamelware 6 although cobalt is required to activate carboxypeptidase vitamin b 12 and methylcobalamin 7 it can go on to bioaccumulate in organic tissue at excessive dosages with related health implications based on its toxicity the un ghs mixture rules apply to cobalt salts 0 3 3000 ppm are reproductive toxicants and 3 30 000 ppm are suspected of harming the unborn child 8 the government of british columbia and the european chemicals agency set the limit of aqueous cobalt for downstream users at 0 11 and 0 01 mg l respectively 9 10 the who does not stipulate a limit on drinking water the cobalt industry responsible assessment framework ciraf enables a coherent and consistent approach to cobalt due diligence and reporting by the cobalt industry in line with sustainable cobalt production and sourcing 11 the new harmonised eu classification of cobalt metal effective october 2021 considers cobalt a presumed human carcinogen category 1b for all routes of exposure cobalt is also considered a reproductive toxicant category 1b and a suspected mutagen category 2 cobalt salts including sulphate dinitrate oxalates etc are classified as reproductive toxicants that may damage fertility and are suspected of harming the unborn child repr 2 h361d 8 11 the associated risk of cobalt trade include environmental air water soil environmental impacts biodiversity occupational health and safety and community livelihoods cobalt surface water contamination may occur from natural sources anthropogenic discharges mine runoffs or blow dust 12 reported surface and well water values ranged from 0 03 to 15 20 mg l 13 15 conventional treatment technologies for removing heavy metals from aqueous streams include chemical precipitation solvent extraction electrolytic extraction ion exchange cementation filtration adsorption and reverse osmosis 16 17 these methods suffer from drawbacks such as high capital cost or regeneration of residual sludge 18 20 new sulphate radical advanced oxidation processes that are developed for the treatment of textile wastewater could potentially add to residual cobalt in treated water 21 23 since cobalt was found to be the best activator of peroxymonosulphate therefore low cost efficient technologies are needed to remove these toxic heavy metals from industrial wastewater before discharge biosorption the passive uptake of metals by biomass has demonstrated great potential as an emerging technology for heavy metal remediation in aqueous streams the focus on biomass applied for biosorption has shifted to the abundant supply of agricultural waste generated in agrarian nations these agricultural wastes are considered economic sorbents because they are plentiful and require little or no processing before application agricultural wastes reportedly used for biosorption include rice husks and barn 24 26 coconut coir 27 fruit wastes 28 31 and more recently activated carbons derived from agricultural waste 32 36 these materials contain cellulose hemicellulose lignin starch sugars and other functional groups capable of binding and chelating metals out of solution 37 the application of fruit and vegetable waste for wastewater remediation is a sustainable integrated waste management iwm approach that is strategic practical and efficient the approach is anchored on the pillars of sustainability which include environmental economic and social responsibility 38 a review highlighted the versatility of agricultural waste peels such as orange pomelo grapefruit lemon banana cassava jackfruit garlic and pomegranate peels for heavy metal biosorption from wastewater 39 reports have shown that world industries produce 25 million tonnes of pineapples with 50 65 of total produce turning out as waste 40 41 south africa produces 115 000 tonnes of pineapples making it the seventh highest fruit crop 42 ahmad khatoon 30 demonstrated the efficiency of pristine and chemically modified pineapple peels for metal biosorption in batch systems to develop the thrusts of integrated waste management this study extended the work of ahmad khatoon 30 keying into the abundant supply of pineapple peels preliminary testing of literature treatment procedures in batch processes showed that the instability of the pristine and chemically treated pineapple peels could be overcome by pyrolytically converting the peels to activated carbon moreover the batch process was developed into a continuous column system because industrial continuous fixed bed absorbers do not run under equilibrium conditions 43 the experimental findings from a continuous column bed are necessary for developing industrial scale treatment plants 31 to date no one has yet extended the lab studies to test performance on real wastewater treated with cobalt catalysed sulphate radical advanced oxidation process in this work the pineapple peel based activated carbon after batch testing was used in a column system and further extended to remediate cobalt ions from a real wastewater matrix in column mode 2 materials and method 2 1 reagents cobalt chloride hexahydrate cocl2 6h2o mm 237 93 g mol and 1000 ppm stock cobalt solution for instrument calibration was obtained from sigma aldrich south africa activated carbon ac used as a control was purchased from bdh chemicals england all plastic beakers and reagent bottles were washed soaked in 5 nitric acid overnight and rinsed copiously with deionized water prior to use 2 2 preparation of biosorbents and wastewater waste pineapple peels were collected from a local fruit and vegetable market in the cape town business district samples were washed and oven dried at 60 c until completely dry the dried biosorbent was converted to powder by mechanical grinding in a ball mill ground biosorbent was subjected to physical and chemical treatment for physical treatment 50 g of biosorbent was carbonised under nitrogen 10 ml min at 600 c for 2 h in a pyro therm tube furnace alser teknik seramik ptf series turkey the heated sample was cooled down overnight chemical treatment was done according to ahmad khatoon 30 briefly 50 g of pristine pineapple peels were treated with 380 ml kmno4 and subsequently with 380 ml 0 1 m h2so4 the treated sample was washed with milliq water until the solution was neutral to litmus paper the treated samples were oven dried at 60 c for 24 h pristine carbonised and chemically treated pineapple peels were sieved to a uniform size 150 μm and labelled rpp cpp and ctpp respectively real wastewater was obtained from the sump of a dye house in cape town south africa the wastewater was treated for colour using cobalt based advanced oxidation process see supplementary data 2 3 batch biosorption experiments batch biosorption experiments were conducted by contacting 30 ml of co ii ion solution with biomass in a 200 ml plastic beaker for the desired time at a fixed shaking speed 100 rpm on a linear orbital shaker we varied the following biosorption parameters contact time 0 180 min initial co ii ion concentration 1 200 mg l ph 2 9 and biosorbent mass 0 05 g 1 g for rpp only the solution ph was adjusted using 0 1 m naoh or 0 1 m hcl hanna instrument 2211 romania after each batch experiment samples were filtered through a whatman filter no 1 paper and cobalt ions in clear supernatant were analysed by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy perkin elmer aa200 usa eq 1 was used to calculate the removal efficiency of co ii ions deionized water was used as the negative control while a blank co ii solution without biosorbent with a concentration equivalent to the experiment conducted was used as the positive control 1 adsorption c i c t c i 100 the biosorption capacities of the rpp cpp ctpp and ac for co ii ions at equilibrium were calculated as 2 q e mg g c i c e m v where c i c e and c t are the initial equilibrium and concentration at time t respectively v is the volume of aqueous solution l and m is the mass of biosorbent g used in the experiment 44 45 2 4 column design and experimental procedure column studies were carried out in a 19 cm plastic column 1 7 cm id filled with a known quantity of cpp to ensure a closely packed arrangement cpp was placed in between glass wool co ii solutions were pumped with a peristaltic pump watson marlow 205s england connected to the top of the column with a downward flow 31 the treated co ii solution was collected at the bottom of the column and analysed for co ii by aas all experiments were conducted at 26 c ph 6 and under atmospheric pressure the volume of effluent treated at bed saturation v s ml per gram of cpp was calculated using the following equation 3 v s q t s where t s min is the time taken to reach bed saturation and q is the volumetric flowrate of co ii ion solution through the column ml min the point t s was identified from the breakthrough curve as the point of inflexion of the second half of the curve approx 0 90c i this was because experiments conducted at low co ii ion concentration never reached t s as defined previously 46 likewise t b described the breaking point which was read off from the breakthrough curve as the point where the first half of the curve showed an inflexion approx 0 05c i 47 amount of co ii ions absorbed mg g at t b and t s by a given weight of biosorbent w were given as q b and q s respectively and calculated by eqs 4 and 5 the fractional bed utilisation fbu was calculated by eq 6 4

characterised using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy perkin elmer uatir ftir llantrisant uk spectra of the dry biosorbents were measured between 4000 cm 1 to 400 cm 1 the surface texture and morphology of samples were analysed by high resolution scanning electron microscopy auriga instruments hr sem usa equipped with secondary electron detectors coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds samples for hr sem were applied to double sided carbon tape mounted on the sem stub before microscopy imaging samples were then coated with a thin layer of au pd to eliminate charging artefacts using a q150t turbo pumped sputter equipped with an edwards vacuum pump bet surface area pore size and pore volume were determined using a micrometrics tristar ii 3020 usa prior to analysis samples were degassed at 200 c under a vacuum for 12 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterisation sem micrographs of biosorbents before and after biosorption are shown in figs 1 and 2 rpp samples before and after biosorption fig 1 1a and 1b respectively showed an uneven texture exhibiting both thick threads and irregular shapes the morphology of the ctpp in fig 1 2a and 2b respectively showed smaller fragments due to increased surface area the surface of the cpp before and after biosorption shown in fig 2 1a and 1b respectively appeared to be decorated with smaller particles compared to the smooth texture of the rpp and ctpp the ac samples before and after adsorption shown in fig 2 2a and 2b were decorated with finer dust like particles there were no observable changes in the morphology of all materials after sorption experiments eds in conjunction with sem was used to determine the elemental composition of biosorbents before and after biosorption in general the eds results summarised in table 1 showed a high percentage of c and o as expected from an organic matrix the o content of cpp was significantly lower than rpp and ctpp the presence of o on the activated carbon ac which was used as received may be attributed to adsorbed water molecules on the ac before biosorption the biosorbents showed no cobalt in their elemental composition rpp and ac did not show any traces of co after sorption experiments table 1 however ctpp and cpp showed the presence of co ii in their eds spectrum after biosorption 0 06 and 0 2 respectively a representative eds spectrum showing co ii peaks on cpp is shown in fig 3 while a comparative spectrum with unused cpp is given in supplementary data fig s1 the ftir of rpp fig 4a resembles superimposed spectra of cellulose and lignin which are the significant components of pineapple peels the bands at 3307 and 2910 cm 1 correspond to oh and ch stretching vibrations of lignin and cellulose 44 45 48 this oh band that ranges from 3200 to 3500 cm 1 is observed in all tested biosorbents except cpp lignin specific peaks appeared at 2846 and 1712 cm 1 and correspond to the stretching of methyl methoxy and carbonyl of unconjugated ketones respectively aromatic skeletal vibrations in lignin are represented in the range 1598 1235 cm 1 fig 4 the intense 1030 band is indicative of the c o c pyranose ring stretching of cellulose 30 we observed a significant decrease in intensities of all lignin and cellulose characteristic bands fig 4b indicating the involvement of the identified functional groups after co ii biosorption ctpp fig 4c showed a significant reduction of cellulose pyranose band and aromatic fingerprint bands of lignin after oxidation and complete elimination of these peaks in cpp upon carbonisation fig 4e there was no significant or observable difference in the ftir spectrum of ctpp and cpp before and after application for the sorption of co ii fig 4d and f respectively the ftir spectrum of pristine and used ac showed broad absorbed water stretching oh band at 3214 cm 1 and 3352 cm 1 respectively fig 4g h the specific surface area and other bet parameters could not be determined for rpp because the biosorbent was unstable at the degassing temperature of 200 c the treated samples were however stable and their bet parameters are summarised in table 2 it should be mentioned that the treatment processes to give ctpp and cpp gave only 30 product yield and such mass losses during assay were unsuitable for bet measurement biosorbent obtained by chemical treatment ctpp had a higher surface area and pore size 1 23 m2 g and 470 25 å than that obtained from carbonisation 0 23 m2 g and 69 56 å 3 2 effect of various operating variables on biosorption of cobalt ions 3 2 1 effect of biosorbent dose the effect of biosorbent dose was determined for rpp by equilibrating 30 ml 50 mg l co ii solution with masses increased from 0 05 to 0 5 g removal efficiency increased with increasing mass fig 5 from 35 0 05 g to 40 0 1 g after which removal efficiency reduced markedly dropping to 28 0 4 g the initial increase in co ii removal is attributed to an increase in active sites for metal sorption with an increase in biosorbent mass a further increase in biosorbent mass under the experimental conditions brought about a decrease in removal efficiency due to aggregation of particles resulting in a reduction of surface area 0 05 g of the other biosorbents was selected as the dose for the comparative study this selection is despite a higher percentage removal given by 0 1 g it was rationalised that a better result was obtained when 0 05 g was used in two cycles compared to using 0 1 g in a single exercise 3 2 2 effect of ph the ph of the solution is the most critical parameter as it controls the overall reaction and mechanism of the ions involved in the biosorption process including metal precipitation as hydroxides ph in this study was surveyed in the range 3 9 fig 5b shows the effect of solution ph on cobalt ion removal as shown the removal of cobalt improves with increasing ph reaching a plateau for rpp and ctpp and finally reaching a peak at ph 6 for cpp and ac after ph 6 biosorption decreases with a further increase in ph this phenomenon is explained based on less competition between positively charged h and co2 ions for the active sites on the biosorbent as the ph increases more negatively charged sites are exposed on the biosorbent matrix and account for the improved removal of cationic species 49 the reduction of co ii ion removal beyond ph 6 is presumably due to the formation of soluble hydroxylated complexes of the metal ion 3 2 3 effect of contact time in general co ii removal was rapid at 0 5 min co ii removal was above 20 for all biosorbents and increased steadily for cpp which finally plateaued after 60 min fig 5c rpp which started with a rapid reduction of 45 began to undergo significant desorption of cobalt ions reaching equilibrium after 90 min fig 5b conversely ctpp with a much lower immediate removal 21 0 5 min rose steadily plateauing at 90 min the initially rapid metal biosorption has been due to the abundant active sites 48 while the subsequent slower biosorption rate has been previously attributed to metal saturation of active sites 50 3 2 4 effect of initial metal ion the effect of initial co ii ion concentration on co ii ion sorption was studied in the range of 1 mg l 200 mg l fig 5d at low concentrations 10 mg l biosorption by cpp and ctpp was identical but varied markedly above 25 mg l maximum quantity of co ii ions qe mg g for cpp 16 87 mg g and ctpp 15 84 mg g was obtained when initial co ii ion was 100 mg l the higher sorption character of cpp suggests an inverse relationship between pore size pore volume and cobalt biosorption both modified samples displayed superior biosorption capacity compared to the raw biosorbent rpp and the activation carbon control ac the behaviour of rpp suggests that concentrations above 50 mg l favour metal desorption from the biomass 3 3 biosorption kinetic modelling the process of co ii uptake and rate controlling mechanism may be analysed by kinetic models which often give good predictions of qe these may be extrapolated to designing and modelling a fixed bed biosorption system 51 the linearised pseudo first eq 7 and pseudo second eq 8 order equations were applied to interpret the kinetic data 7 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t 8 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where q e and q t in mg g are the biosorption capacitates at equilibrium and at time t min respectively a plot of log q e q t versus time was drawn for eq 7 and the values of q e and k 1 min 1 were estimated from intercept and slope respectively for eq 8 a plot of t q t versus t was used to estimate q e and k 2 g mg min from the slope and intercept respectively a summary of the kinetic parameters obtained from the models is shown in table 3 lagergren s eq 7 depicts the biosorption of solids liquid systems based on the sorption capacity of the solid 52 while ho s eq 8 describes the chemisorption kinetics from liquid solutions 53 as seen in table 3 the pseudo first order kinetic model fails to estimate the experimentally observed q e which was better predicted by the pseudo second order model accuracy 90 100 r2 0 98 hence it may be concluded that the rate limiting step is based on the chemisorption of co ii ions onto biosorbent surfaces this finding agrees with previous studies 30 44 45 the intraparticle diffusion model proposed by weber and morris 54 argues that the metal sorption mechanism occurs on the surface of the biosorbent this model provided an insight into mechanisms for rpp and cpp and is mathematically illustrated by eq 9 9 q t k id t 0 5 c where k id is the intraparticle diffusion constant mg g min0 5 and c is a constant which gives an idea about the boundary layer a linear plot of q t versus t 0 5 gives k id and c as slope and intercept respectively the regressions obtained for eq 9 showed that only ctpp agreed with the intraparticle diffusion model with a boundary layer half that of rpp on closer inspection of the intraparticle diffusion plots for rpp and cpp we observed that the graph presented several linear regions fig 6 with different operating mechanisms the absorption by rpp is instantaneous with a maximum reached within 30 s the first region and second regions of the diffusion plot fig 6a are due to film diffusion of co ii molecules from and onto the surface of the biosorbent as dynamic equilibrium is attained up until a stabilisation point at region three 3 where intraparticle diffusion becomes the controlling factor on the other hand cpp did not show instantaneous biosorption as with rpp and displayed only two regions fig 6b the first region was due to fil diffusion into the biosorbent and the second region was due to intraparticle diffusion of co ii into active sites these multilinear plots have been previously used to describe kinetic data in the literature 44 55 they are evidence that mechanisms are usually simultaneously based on multiple theories the maxima qe obtained in fig 5d also agree with experimentally observed qe a complete plot of kinetic models is presented in figs s2 and s3 3 4 equilibrium modelling langmuir 56 and freundlich 57 adsorption isotherms were used to evaluate the effect of initial co ii ion concentration and the data is given in table 4 the linearised forms of both isotherms are given in eqs 10 and 11 10 1 q e 1 q m b c e 1 q m 11 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where q e mg g q m mg g b and c e in eq 10 are the amount of co ii sorbed per unit mass of biosorbent at a given concentration maximum monolayer biosorption capacity langmuir affinity constant and concentration of co ii ions in solution at equilibrium respectively q e mg g k f mg g l mg 1 n and c e in eq 11 are amount of co ii sorbed per unit mass of biosorbent at a given concentration freundlich constant and equilibrium concentration of co ii in solution 1 n is related to the intensity of biosorption in general the biosorption character of the biosorbents for co ii was better described by the freundlich model r2 0 85 0 99 compared to the langmuir model r2 0 34 0 76 and supports the theory of surface heterogeneity and an exponential distribution of site and energies 45 langmuir model overestimates the batch biosorption capacities as shown from qmax and qe obs in table 4 values of 1 n between 0 and 1 indicate favourable co ii biosorption under the studied condition 45 when 1 n is close to 1 biosorption interactions occur via physisorption 58 the inner and outer sphere complexation mechanism has contributed to increased co ii removal and a reduced value of freundlich intensity constant 1 n 59 the order of favourable biosorption based on 1 n values was cpp ctpp rpp ac notably the biosorbents all outperformed the ac used as experimental control demonstrating the advantage posed by utilising this waste material for metal remediation furthermore cpp qmax situates well in the literature on materials used for co biosorption it performed better than recently tested rafsanjan pistachio shell barley straw ash sunflower and nut seed powder table 5 and may be improved via composite mixtures as demonstrated in the literature 3 5 continuous biosorption in a packed column cpp showed promise as a suitable biosorbent outperforming the pristine rpp and the chemically treated ctpp also unlike the latter two biosorbents cpp did not leave organic matter residue in the final remediated water see fig s5 this problem is reportedly encountered while working with untreated biomass and is overcome by carbonisation 70 the carbonised cpp was subsequently subjected to column studies to ascertain continuous fixed bed parameters necessary for industrial scale treatment column performance was studied by varying the efficiency of flowrate bed height and initial concentration of co ii feed solution 3 5 1 effect of bed mass height co ii ions uptake in a fixed bed depends on the quantity of solid biosorbent in the bed the effect of bed height was studied by varying cpp packing in the column 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 g corresponding to 0 96 1 8 and 2 8 cm respectively other parameters were held constant flow rate ph and co ii ion concentration were 3 ml min 6 and 50 mg l as shown in fig 7a an increase in the bed mass and consequently bed height leads to a less steep breakthrough curve as bed saturation is achieved less quickly bed saturation increases from 31 min at a packing mass of 0 5 g to 75 min at a packing mass of 1 5 g increased bed mass also increases residence time and the fractional bed utilisation of the column fbu response factors tb ts vs qb qs and fbu for the experimental condition are summarised in table 6 3 5 2 effect of flowrate the effect of flowrate on co ii biosorption was studied by varying the flowrate from 1 to 5 ml min while other parameters were held constant ph 6 co ii 50 mg l bed mass 1 g experimental breakthrough curves are illustrated in fig 7b and depict that tb and ts vary inversely with flow rate the functional bed utilisation fbu however decreased with increasing flowrate due to the shorter residence time of the fluid passing through the bed at a higher flow rate table 6 3 5 3 effect of co ii feed concentration the effect of concentration was studied by varying concentrations from 10 mg l to 50 mg l the results are shown in fig 7c tb decreased with increase in co ii concentration from tb 20 min at 10 mg l to tb 8 min at 50 mg l table 6 in a similar manner ts decreased with increasing co ii from ts 150 min at 10 mg l to ts 42 min at 50 mg l a shorter breakpoint and saturation point are obtained at higher concentrations due to the increased co ii ions per unit volume of treated solution sorbed by the biosorbent maximum quantity at saturation was obtained when co ii ion in solution was 25 mg l 3 6 modelling of column data the adams bohart thomas and yoon nelson models were studied to determine biosorption capacity kinetic constants and column breakthrough performance 3 6 1 adams bohart model adams bohart model originally developed to describe the adsorption behaviour of chlorine onto charcoal 71 when extended to metal sorption the model assumes that biosorbent residual capacity and heavy metal concentration are proportional to biosorption rate and equilibrium is not spontaneous the model describes the column s operating limit or the breakthrough curve s fledging stage 72 the linearised bohart adam model is given as 12 ln c t c 0 k ba c 0 t k ba n ba h v where c 0 and c t are initial and concentrations in mg l at a time t respectively k ba is bohart adams kinetic constant l mg min v is linear flow velocity in cm min n ba is saturated concentration in mg l a plot of ln c t c 0 versus t was extended to data on bed mass flowrate and co ii ion concentration and are given in fig s6a d and g respectively a summary of constants is shown in table 7 an increase in co ii concentration is expected to give an increase in k ba as previously reported 47 due to kinetically driven mass transfer of co ii ions however the bohart adams model was unsuitable for explaining other aspects of the biosorption process since r2 values were comparatively less than other models 3 6 2 thomas model the thomas model infers packed column plug flow behaviour and uses the langmuir model for equilibrium 73 the model is applicable for biosorption study only when the limitations for external and internal wide distributions are neglected 31 the linearised thomas model is given by eq 13 13 ln c 0 c t 1 k th q th m q k th c 0 v q where k th is the rate constant in ml mg min q th is the biosorption capacity in mg g c 0 and c t are co ii ion concentration at the inlet and at a time t respectively v is the volume of treated solution a plot of ln c 0 c t 1 versus v for data on the effect of mass flowrate and co ii concentration provide values of thomas constants for these experiments fig s6b e f a summary of these constants is given in table 7 thomas rate constant k th increased with increasing concentration and flowrate and decreased with increased mass of bed the maximum predicted biosorption capacity 24 38 mg g was obtained when the inlet volume was 10 mg l while this was in close agreement with the maximum observed biosorption capacity 22 89 mg g the experimental conditions were not identical in general despite the high regression values the predictions provided by the thomas model did not fit with the experimentally observed values they would suggest that other external factors are limiting variables in the biosorption process 3 6 3 yoon nelson model the yoon nelson model assumes that the reduction in biosorption probability for every adsorbate molecule is equivalent to sorbate biosorption probability and is given by eq 14 14 ln c t c 0 c t k yn t k yn τ where k yn represents the rate constant in l min and τ represents the required time for column outlet concentration to reach 50 c 0 74 graph of ln c t c 0 c t versus t provided the values of constants the values of r2 for the yoon nelson model better fit experimental data yoon nelson biosorption constant k yn expectedly increased with increasing concentration due to an increased rate of saturation 3 7 remediation of real wastewater the goal of developing low cost biosorbents is to seek application in industrial settings where the biomass would encounter a myriad of metals organics and other variable factors under such conditions the behaviour of the biosorbent can be assessed for its ultimate suitability for metal remediation under the advised experimental conditions for this reason cpp was applied for treating dye sump wastewater obtained from a dye house in cape town south africa obtained wastewater was subjected to an advanced oxidation process based on cobalt oxide mediated sulphate radicals generated from peroxymonosulphate supplementary section the final treated water had a residual cobalt concentration of 16 34 mg l and was subjected to remediation for co ii ions using cpp breakthrough curves for the removal of co ii ions from the remediated wastewater are shown in fig 8a and the predictions offered by various models are shown in fig 8b modelling parameters applied were drawn from constants obtained from experiments conducted at co ii concentration 25 mg l 3 ml min flowrate and 1 g bed mass the breakpoint time tb and saturation time ts for the removal of co ii ions were observed at 20 min and 100 min respectively with the bed reaching saturation after treating 300 ml of cobalt contaminated wastewater the thomas model best interpreted the breakthrough curve in the studied time range 4 conclusion this study modified biomass derived from pineapple peels by physical and chemical methods and applied biosorbents for aqueous co ii ions biosorption batch results showed that the optimal biosorption ph was 6 and maximum sorption occurred within 90 min chemically modified pineapple peels ctpp and carbonised pineapple peels cpp with a maximum biosorption capacity of 16 73 mg g and 22 31 mg g respectively both performed better than the raw biosorbent rpp 8 96 mg g batch sorption experiments were best fitted to the freundlich isotherm and the biosorption process followed second order chemisorption kinetics the intraparticle diffusion model predicted multiple mechanistic co ii ion removal pathways in rpp and cpp column study using cpp showed that column breakpoint and saturation times varied directly with bed mass and inversely with cobalt concentration and flow rate the maximum column qs 22 90 mg g agreed with the predicted langmuir qmax breakthrough curves were better fitted with the thomas model which also better predicted the metal profile when cpp was applied to treat real wastewater this study demonstrates the potential advantage of pineapple peels when used in their modified form especially by carbonisation for the remediation of real wastewater contaminated with cobalt declaration of

12743,the widespread use of plastic products has led to large amounts of micro nano plastics in sludge affecting the performance of biochemical treatment processes anammox is a cost effective biological nitrogen removal process however the effect of micro nano plastic exposure on the nitrogen removal performance and structural stability of anammox sludge is unclear in this study the ability of anammox granular sludge angs to cope with nanoplastic exposure was investigated by an acute exposure test and the related mechanism was revealed the effect of acute exposure to nanoplastics on the performance of angs showed a dose effect the saanh 4 n and saano2 n decreased by 26 1 and 19 3 and structural stability reduced 42 9 after acute exposure with 0 5 mg ml polystyrene nanoplastics ps nps the elevated oxidative stress increased the dead bacteria decreasing the nitrogen removal performance of the sludge the decrease in the structural stability of angs was attributed to the decrease in zeta potential and sludge hydrophobicity the structural research provides a theoretical basis for assessing the effect on the anammox process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anammox granular sludge eps nanoplastic structural stability toxicity effect data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anammox is a cost effective biological nitrogen removal process commonly used to treat high ammonia nitrogen wastewater such as sludge digestate and landfill leachate 1 2 and its application to the mainstream treatment of municipal wastewater has received much attention anammox bacteria tend to grow in aggregates hence could form compact granular sludge 3 4 anammox granular sludge angs enriched with many microorganisms can cope with higher nitrogen loads and low concentrations of toxic substances and therefore is often used in anammox processes to improve efficiency and stability the widespread use of plastic products has led to the presence of a large number of micro nano plastics in wastewater 5 plastic particles with sizes 5 mm are considered microplastics while plastic particles smaller than 1 μm are nanoplastics 6 8

huang et al found that 0 1 wt and 1 wt polyethylene microplastic exposure could promote the growth of anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria in freshwater sediments thus accelerating the anammox process 17 however tang et al 13 found a 6 2 and 11 6 decrease in ammonia nitrogen and nitrite removal from angs respectively after 0 5 g l polyvinyl chloride microplastic exposure and suggested that this was related to the reduced abundance of anammox bacteria xu et al 18 found that the saanh4 n and saano2 n of angs decreased by 44 5 and 57 6 after 225 days continuous exposure of polystyrene nanoplastic although scholars have explored the effect of micro nano plastics on anammox performance from a microbial perspective the mechanisms are unclear micro nano plastic exposure can affect the content of granular sludge extracellular polymeric substance eps 19 which is an important functional substance for maintaining the structure of granular sludge 20 a significant decrease in hydrophobicity of eps can lead to sludge disintegration 21 up to now the effect of micro nano plastics on the structural stability of angs has been rarely reported and there are no studies that cut from eps to explain the effect of micro nano plastic exposure on the structural stability of granular sludge the nitrogen removal performance and structural stability of angs are crucial for the efficient operation of the

shown in the supplementary material the reactor used synthetic wastewater and nh4cl and nano2 supplied 200 mg l of the influent nh4 n and no2 n the total nitrogen volumetric load of the reactor was 2 5 kg n m3 d and the removal efficiency of nh4 n no2 n and tn were 90 7 1 2 98 9 0 9 and 81 2 1 0 respectively granular sludge with a granule size close to 2 0 mm was selected for the test through a 10

electron microscopy sem quattros thermo usa was used to observe the microscopic morphology of angs a certain amount of angs was removed and washed several times with deionized water samples were then washed several times with 1 pbs buffer ph 7 4 and dewatered sequentially in 50 70 80 90 and anhydrous ethanol the dehydrated samples were freeze dried and goal coated with an ion sputterer the saa of angs was tested using the method of wang et al 23 to characterize the changes in nitrogen removal performance ros and ldh were determined by a kit solarbio beijing china 24 and the detailed method is described in the supplementary material multifluorescent labeling combined with a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm is a convenient and powerful tool for identifying live and dead bacteria the dual use of syto9 and propidium iodide pi dyes allowed for the discrimination of bacteria with intact cell membranes live bacteria and bacteria with damaged cell membranes dead bacteria 25 syto9 and pi were used to stain sludge samples after ps nps exposure the stained sludge samples were observed under a clsm tcssp8csu leica germany at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm the optimum emission wavelengths were 500 540 nm and 598 660 nm for syto9 and pi respectively las x software counted the fluorescence intensities of live and dead bacteria and the total live and dead bacteria the fluorescence intensity ratio of live to dead bacteria was used to indicate the ratio of live to dead bacteria the strength of angs was determined by the ultrasonication method 26 an appropriate amount of granular sludge was collected in 15 ml of deionized water and sonicated scientz iid china at 25 khz 65 w the od600 values of the supernatant were measured within 40 min a linear relationship between time and od600 values was established using sampling time as the abscissa and od600 ordinate the larger the slope the lower the granular sludge particle strength and the corresponding structural stability decrease the zeta potential of angs was measured using a zeta potential analyzer zetasizernanozs90 malvern uk 2 3 2 extraction and testing of eps eps was extracted using a modified thermal extraction method 27 angs was collected washed with deionized water fully ground and dispersed to 20 ml of 0 05 nacl solution the solution was heated at 60 c in a water bath for 30 min and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min the supernatant was filtered with a 0 45 μm acetate membrane and the resulting filtrate was the eps extract eps is a complex polymer secreted by microorganisms 19 where the sum of protein and polysaccharide counts for 70 80 of the total eps and mainly affect the surface charge hydrophobicity and spatial structure of aggregates 28 in this study protein and polysaccharide were determined based on the large proportion in eps and the important influence on the surface characteristics of granular sludge protein and polysaccharide contents were determined separately and their sum was used to represent the total eps the protein content was determined by the bca method 29 and the polysaccharide content was determined by the anthrone sulfuric acid colorimetric method 30 the eps solution was freeze dried and the powder was obtained the elemental composition and functional groups of 20 mg of eps powder were analyzed using an x ray

replicate test results the variability among the test data was analyzed by one way analysis of variance anova 3 results 3 1 microscopic morphology fig 1 shows the sem imaging of the surface of angs after 10 h of ps nps exposure ps nps were enriched on the surface of angs and their amount increased with the ps nps exposure concentration according to the results of li et al 7 activated sludge could adsorb 94 6 of ps nps thus almost all the ps nps were transferred to the angs surface due to the adsorption of angs the number of pores and the pore size on the surface of angs decreased with increasing ps nps concentration 3 2 nitrogen removal performance the saanh4 n and saano2 n of angs after 10 h of exposure to ps nps are shown in fig 2a the acute ps nps exposure effect on the nitrogen removal performance of the sludge was concentration dependent the saanh4 n and saano2 n of angs did not change significantly after 0 1 mg ml ps nps acute exposure saanh4 n and saano2 n decreased by 26 1 and 19 3 after 0 5 mg ml ps nps acute exposure respectively when ps nps concentration achieve 1 mg ml saanh4 n and saano2 n decreased by 33 7 and 25 7 respectively the angs showed good resistance to the acute exposure of ps nps at low concentrations in contrast the resistance to the acute exposure of ps nps at high concentrations was reduced it should be noted that saanh4 n decreased less than saano2 n it has been reported that nanoplastics can suppress the nitrogen metabolism of microorganisms in constructed wetlands by inhibiting the activities of ammonia monooxygenase nitrite reductase and nitrate reductase and the effects of different enzyme activities are different 32 therefore it is inferred that acute exposure of ps nps may affect the nitrite reductase more than hydrazine synthase resulting in greater inhibition of saano2 n than saanh4 n 3 3 live dead bacterial ratios laminar scans with a 5 μm step size were performed on the top 100 μm microzone of the arammox granular sludge the superimposed map of the layer sweep is shown in fig s4 of the supplementary material the ratio of live dead bacteria in the top 100 μm micro zone of granular sludge was counted and the results are shown in fig 2b the ratio of live dead bacteria in angs under acute exposure of 0 1 mg ml ps nps did not change significantly p 0 05 compared to control however the ratio of live dead bacteria in the sludge increased significantly p 0 05 after exposure of 0 5 mg ml and 1 mg ml ps nps respectively indicating that the bacteria in the sludge were poisoned at this time 3 4 ros and ldh next the toxic effects of acute exposure to ps nps on sludge cells the changes in ros content and ldh release in sludge cells after acute exposure to ps nps were analyzed and the results are shown in fig 2c the ros content of angs cells did not change significantly compared to control under 0 1 mg ml ps nps acute exposure however the ros content increased significantly p 0 05 after 0 5 mg ml and 1 mg ml ps nps exposure by 9 5 and 20 0 respectively elevated levels of oxidative stress have been reported to disrupt the balance of oxidative and antioxidant effects in sludge cells causing toxic effects on cells and consequently affecting sludge activity 33 wei et al 34 found that oxidative stress induced by polystyrene nanoplastics played an important role in reducing methane production from anaerobic granular sludge thus it was hypothesized that the acute exposure to ps nps induced elevated levels of oxidative stress in angs cells causing a decrease in sludge nitrogen removal activity the effect of acute exposure of ps nps on the cell membrane integrity of angs cells was not significant 3 5 the granule strength of angs the granule strength of angs under acute ps nps exposure was examined by ultrasonic fragmentation and the results are shown in fig 3a the slope of od600 value with time in the fig 3a represents the destabilization coefficient of angs the larger the destabilization coefficient the lower the granular strength of granular sludge and the less stable the corresponding structure as shown in fig 3a the destabilization coefficient of anammox granules under acute exposure of 0 1 mg ml ps nps did not change compared with control indicating that the granular strength of granular sludge was not affected when the ps nps concentration increased to 0 5 mg ml and 1 mg ml the destabilization coefficients of angs increased by 42 9 and 85 7 respectively indicating that the strength of granular sludge decreased and the corresponding structural stability decreased acute exposure of 0 1 mg ml ps nps does not affect the structural stability of angs while acute exposure of 0 5 mg ml and 1 mg ml leads to a decrease in the structural strength of angs 3 6 zeta potential fig 3b shows the changes in the zeta potential of angs under acute exposure to ps nps compared to the control group the zeta potential of angs did not change significantly at 0 1 mg ml ps nps exposure p 0 05 whereas it decreased significantly by 9 9 and 19 2 after acute exposure to 0 5 mg ml and 1 mg ml ps nps respectively p 0 05 the zeta potential changes were mainly from the adsorption of negatively charged ps nps by angs lower values of zeta potential indicate stronger electrostatic repulsion between sludge cells which is not conducive to maintaining the structural stability of sludge 35 3 7 eps content and functional groups eps is an important functional substance for maintaining the structure of granular sludge 36 37 and the changes in sludge eps content and functional groups after acute exposure to ps nps were investigated separately ① eps content the total eps extracellular protein content and extracellular polysaccharide content of angs under acute exposure of 0 1 mg ml ps nps did not change significantly p 0 05 compared to control as shown in fig 4a the total eps extracellular protein content and extracellular polysaccharide content of angs decreased significantly p 0 05 with ps nps concentration the total eps extracellular protein content and extracellular polysaccharide content of sludge decreased by 11 4 12 3 and 4 8 after 0 5 mg ml ps nps acute exposure compared to control respectively after 1 mg ml exposure total sludge eps extracellular protein content and extracellular polysaccharide content decreased by 19 7 19 8 and 11 2 respectively compared to control the decrease in extracellular protein content was greater compared to extracellular polysaccharides decreasing the ratio of extracellular protein to extracellular polysaccharides ② eps functional groups the ftir spectra of angs eps under acute exposure to ps nps are shown in fig 4b the peak positions and numbers of eps were close to those of control indicating that the acute exposure to ps nps did not change the functional groups in eps however the intensity of each characteristic peak changed the oh or nh ch and co stretching vibration signal peaks located at 3300 cm 1 2938 cm 1 and 1632 cm 1 respectively the 1410 cm 1 and 1120 cm 1 peaks correspond to the co symmetric stretching of the protein amide ii region coo and the co symmetric stretching respectively the intensity of the peaks at 1040 cm 1 associated with the co stretching vibration of polysaccharide and the coc stretching vibration increased after acute exposure to ps nps it was reported that oh nh co co and coc are hydrophilic functional groups and ch is a hydrophobic functional group 21 thus it is speculated that the increased hydrophilic functional groups in eps after acute exposure to ps nps affects its hydrophobicity three carbon signal peaks were detected in angs eps corresponding to binding energies of 284 08 ev 285 46 ev and 287 67 ev as shown in fig 5 and table s1 of the supplementary material the c1s peak with a binding energy of 284 08 ev was attributed to amino acids or lipid side chains of c c h 31 this peak appears to decrease in the sludge after acute exposure to ps nps c c h is the most abundant hydrophobic functional group in eps 21 the decrease in its signal peak intensity indicates a decrease in the number of corresponding functional groups and the hydrophobicity of eps the c1s peak with a binding energy of 285 46 ev attributed to co and oco on carboxylate carbonyl amide acetal or hemiacetal correspond to hydrophilic functional groups 38 the intensity of this signal peak did not change significantly in eps of angs after acute exposure to ps nps the signal peak at the binding energy of 287 67 ev was attributed to ocoh of glyoxalate 38 which is responsible for the hydrophilicity of eps 39 the ocoh peak intensity increase in angs eps after acute exposure to ps nps indicates that the number of this functional group increased and the hydrophilicity of eps was enhanced consistent with the ir spectroscopy results in summary the acute exposure to ps nps led to a hydrophobicity decrease and a hydrophilicity increase of eps in angs ③ protein secondary structure the compositional features of protein secondary structure influence the structure and properties of sludge 40 table 1 and fig s5 show the protein secondary structure information of eps under acute exposure to ps nps the amide i region of angs eps contained polymeric chains 1625 1610 cm 1 β fold 1640 1630 cm 1 α helix 1657 1648 cm 1 3 turned helix 1666 1659 cm 1 and antiparallel β fold polymeric chains 1695 1680 cm 1 of which the relative content of α helix 1657 1648 cm 1 was the highest the relative proportions of the polymeric chain β fold α helix and antiparallel β fold polymeric chain in angs eps decreased and the relative proportion of 3 turned helix increased after acute exposure to ps nps hou et al 21 concluded that the lower the α helix content and the higher the β fold and random coil content the looser the protein structure so the α helix β fold random coil ratio is often used to measure the looseness of the protein structure as shown in table 1 the angs α helix β fold random curl values decreased after the acute phase exposure of 1 mg ml ps nps indicating that the protein structure was affected 4 discussion this study investigated the effect of acute exposure of ps nps on the nitrogen removal performance of angs it was found that saanh4 n and saano2 n of angs did not change significantly under acute exposure of 0 1 mg ml ps nps indicating that angs has some ability to tolerate ps nps exposure the endogenous respiration rate of activated sludge decreased significantly after acute exposure to 0 1 mg ml ps nps which may be related to the structural properties of the sludge the angs has a compact structure 41 42 and large granule size making it difficult for ps nps to cause toxic effects on bacteria inside the granular sludge in a short time other studies have come to a similar conclusion that nanoparticles are mainly concentrated on the surface or outer layer of anaerobic granular sludge making it difficult to enter the interior of the particles 43 on the contrary the larger specific surface area and looser structure of activated sludge facilitates the contact of ps nps with many sludge cells and causes toxicity 44 in addition angs has more eps than activated sludge 45 eps is the first barrier for ps nps to contact microorganisms and can protect cells from toxicity by adsorption on ps nps 19 however it should be noted that angs has a limited ability to tolerate acute exposure to ps nps the saanh4 n and saano2 n of the sludge were significantly reduced when the ps nps concentration was 0 5 mg ml the decrease in nitrogen removal performance of angs after high acute exposure was attributed to the toxic effect of ps nps on the sludge resulting in increase the proportion of dead bacteria in the sludge in this study high concentration ps nps acute exposure increased the oxidative stress level of cells in general most cells can mediate ros through enzymatic reactions but produce a limited amount of antioxidant enzymes 46 in addition as the concentration of ps nps exposure increases the concentration of eps decreases weakening the protective effect on granular sludge cells when too much ros is produced in the cells it leads to membrane lipid peroxidation and dna damage 47 48 thereby reducing the anammox activity wei et al 34 found similar results and concluded that ps nps induced ros is one of the key toxicity mechanisms leading to the deterioration of anaerobic granular sludge performance during wastewater treatment therefore it can be concluded that the increase in dead bacteria due to increased level of oxidative stress is responsible for the decrease in nitrogen removal performance of angs the granular structure s stability helps maintain the anammox process s efficient operation 49 acute exposure with high concentrations of ps nps affects the structural stability of angs for two main reasons 1 previous studies have shown that the electrostatic force between cells is important in maintaining sludge s structural stability 50 51 in this work the zeta potential of angs decreased after acute exposure to ps nps lower zeta potential means stronger electrostatic repulsion between cells which impairs the structural stability of sludge 35 2 extracellular proteins contain many negatively charged amino acids which can form electrostatic bonds with multivalent cations that maintain the structural stability of sludge 52 at the same time extracellular polysaccharides serve as the sludge s skeleton playing an important role in maintaining the structural stability of granular sludge 53 after acute exposure of ps nps to angs the contents of extracellular proteins and polysaccharides of angs decreased some scholars 54 found that polystyrene nanoplastic had a strong adsorption effect on organics therefore it is inferred that ps nps can adsorb eps making it difficult to be extracted the decrease in extracellular protein content under acute exposure to ps nps was greater than that of extracellular polysaccharides indicating that the acute exposure to ps nps had a more significant effect on extracellular proteins the hydrophilic extracellular polysaccharides to hydrophobic extracellular proteins 40 ratio affects the surface hydrophobicity of granular sludge 55 a large decrease in extracellular protein leads to a decrease in the ratio of extracellular protein to extracellular polysaccharides in eps making the sludge less hydrophobic the hydrophobicity of sludge is a key factor in maintaining its structural stability of sludge 56 xps and ir spectroscopy showed an increase in hydrophilic functional groups such as oh ocoh co and oco and a decrease in hydrophobic groups such as c c h and ch after ps nps exposure confirming the hydrophobicity decrease in the sludge therefore an increase in the proportion of dead bacteria in angs also led to the deterioration of sludge structural stability in conclusion the increase in electrostatic repulsion between cells and the decrease in hydrophobicity of eps deteriorate the structural stability of angs anammox is used to treat high ammonia nitrogen wastewater such as sludge digester and landfill leachate 57 58 previous studies have pointed out that 97 of micro nano plastics in the waste water treatment plant will be transferred to sludge 10 and the concentration of microplastics in the landfill was also high about 20 000 91 000 kg 59 micro nano plastics in sludge and liquid supernatant are much higher in concentration than in sediment wastewater and agricultural soil and these micro nano plastics can enter the supernatant 60 when treating waste leachate the anammox process may have acute exposure to high ps nps concentrations therefore a wide range of ps nps concentrations was selected for testing to reveal the acute effects of this condition on sludge the results of the study can provide a theoretical basis for practical engineering however due to the short exposure duration it is unclear whether nanoplastic exposure affects the metabolic capacity of anammox bacteria and whether the effects of nanoplastic exposure on sludge performance are reversible which will be further investigated in the future 5 conclusion the effect of acute exposure to ps nps on the angs performance showed a dose dependent effect 0 1 mg ml acute exposure still maintained good nitrogen removal performance and structural stability of the sludge mainly due to the compact structure of the granular sludge acute exposure of 0 5 mg ml and 1 mg ml ps nps significantly reduced the sludge s nitrogen removal performance and structural stability the increase in dead bacteria due to elevated levels of oxidative stress was responsible for the decrease in sludge nitrogen removal performance the decrease in the structural stability of angs was mainly dependent on the sludge s decrease in the zeta potential and hydrophobicity and the increase

removal process commonly used to treat high ammonia nitrogen wastewater such as sludge digestate and landfill leachate 1 2 and its application to the mainstream treatment of municipal wastewater has received much attention anammox bacteria tend to grow in aggregates hence could form compact granular sludge 3 4 anammox granular sludge angs enriched with many microorganisms can cope with higher nitrogen loads and low concentrations of toxic substances and therefore is often used in anammox processes to improve efficiency and stability the widespread use of plastic products has led to the presence of a large number of micro nano plastics in wastewater 5 plastic particles with sizes 5 mm are considered microplastics while plastic particles smaller than 1 μm are nanoplastics 6 8 wastewater treatment plants are both recipients and producers of nanoplastics 9 microplastics in wastewater are fragmented by mechanical agitation air and shear forces of the treatment process 10

observed by high resolution scanning 70 0 ev the xps spectral data were analyzed using the avantage software ten milligrams of eps powder were mixed with kbr at a mass ratio of 1 200 the sample was analyzed using an ftir spectrometer nicolet is50 thermo fisher scientific usa in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 and the collected data were normalized detailed information on protein secondary structure and hydrogen bonding were obtained by resolving the broad peaks at 1700 1600 cm 1 and 3700 3000 cm 1 using peakfit software 31 and the relative ratios of different secondary protein structures were calculated based on the subpeak area ratios 2 4 statistical analysis the tests and analyses were replicated three times and the error lines in the graphs indicate the standard deviations of the replicate test results the variability among the test data was analyzed by one way analysis of variance anova 3 results 3 1 microscopic morphology fig 1 shows the sem imaging of the surface of angs after 10 h of ps nps exposure ps nps were enriched on the surface of angs and their amount increased with the ps nps exposure concentration according to the results of li et al 7 activated sludge could adsorb 94 6 of ps nps thus almost all the ps nps were transferred to the angs surface due to the adsorption of angs the number of pores and the pore size on the surface of angs decreased with increasing ps nps concentration 3 2 nitrogen removal performance the saanh4 n and saano2 n of angs after 10 h of exposure to ps nps are shown in fig 2a the acute ps nps exposure effect on the nitrogen removal performance of the sludge was concentration dependent the saanh4 n and saano2 n of angs did not change significantly after 0 1 mg ml ps nps acute exposure saanh4 n and saano2 n decreased by 26 1 and 19 3 after 0 5 mg ml ps nps acute exposure respectively when ps nps concentration achieve 1 mg ml saanh4 n and saano2 n decreased by 33 7 and 25 7 respectively the angs showed good resistance to the acute exposure of ps nps at low concentrations in contrast the resistance to the acute exposure of ps nps at high concentrations was reduced it should be noted that saanh4 n decreased less than saano2 n it has been reported that nanoplastics can suppress the nitrogen metabolism of microorganisms in constructed wetlands by inhibiting the activities of ammonia monooxygenase nitrite reductase and nitrate reductase and the effects of different enzyme activities are different 32 therefore it is inferred that acute exposure of ps nps may affect the nitrite reductase more than hydrazine synthase resulting in greater inhibition of saano2 n than saanh4 n 3 3 live dead bacterial ratios laminar scans with a 5 μm step size were performed on the top 100 μm microzone of the arammox granular sludge the superimposed map of the layer sweep is shown in fig s4 of the supplementary material the ratio of live dead bacteria in the top 100 μm micro zone of granular sludge was counted and the results are shown in fig 2b the ratio of live dead bacteria in angs under acute exposure of 0 1 mg ml ps nps did not change significantly p 0 05 compared to control however the ratio of live dead bacteria in the sludge increased significantly p 0 05 after exposure of 0 5 mg ml and 1 mg ml ps nps respectively indicating that the bacteria in the sludge were poisoned at this time 3 4 ros and ldh next the toxic effects of acute exposure to ps nps on sludge cells the changes in ros content and ldh release in sludge cells after acute exposure to ps nps were analyzed and the results are shown in fig 2c the ros content of angs cells did not change significantly compared to control under 0 1 mg ml ps nps acute exposure however the ros content increased significantly p 0 05 after 0 5 mg ml and 1 mg ml ps nps exposure by 9 5 and 20 0 respectively elevated levels of oxidative stress have been reported to disrupt the balance of oxidative and antioxidant effects in sludge cells causing toxic effects on cells and consequently affecting sludge activity 33 wei et al 34 found that oxidative stress induced by polystyrene nanoplastics played an important role in reducing methane production from anaerobic granular sludge thus it was hypothesized that the acute exposure to ps nps induced elevated levels of oxidative stress in angs cells causing a decrease in sludge nitrogen removal activity the effect of acute exposure of ps nps on the cell membrane integrity of angs cells was not significant 3 5 the granule strength of angs the granule strength of angs under acute ps nps exposure was examined by ultrasonic fragmentation and the results are shown in fig 3a the slope of od600 value with time in the fig 3a represents the destabilization coefficient of angs the larger the destabilization coefficient the lower the granular strength of granular sludge and the less stable the corresponding structure as shown in fig 3a the destabilization coefficient of anammox granules under acute exposure of 0 1 mg ml ps nps did not change compared with control indicating that the granular strength of granular sludge was not affected when the ps nps concentration increased to 0 5 mg ml and 1 mg ml the destabilization coefficients of angs increased by 42 9 and 85 7 respectively indicating that the strength of granular sludge decreased and the corresponding structural stability decreased acute exposure of 0 1 mg ml ps nps does not affect the structural stability of angs while acute exposure of 0 5 mg ml and 1 mg ml leads to a decrease in the structural strength of angs 3 6 zeta potential fig 3b shows the changes in the zeta potential of angs under acute exposure to ps nps compared to the control group the zeta potential of angs did not change significantly at 0 1 mg ml ps nps exposure p 0 05 whereas it decreased significantly by 9 9 and 19 2 after acute exposure to 0 5 mg ml and 1 mg ml ps nps respectively p 0 05 the zeta potential changes were mainly from the adsorption of negatively charged ps nps by angs lower values of zeta potential indicate stronger electrostatic repulsion between sludge cells which is not conducive to maintaining the structural stability of sludge 35 3 7 eps content and functional groups eps is an important functional substance for maintaining the structure of granular sludge 36 37 and the changes in sludge eps content and functional groups after acute exposure to ps nps were investigated separately ① eps content the total eps extracellular protein content and extracellular polysaccharide content of angs under acute exposure of 0 1 mg ml ps nps did not change significantly p 0 05 compared to control as shown in fig 4a the total eps extracellular protein content and extracellular polysaccharide content of angs decreased significantly p 0 05 with ps nps concentration the total eps extracellular protein content and extracellular polysaccharide content of sludge decreased by 11 4 12 3 and 4 8 after 0 5 mg ml ps nps acute exposure compared to control respectively after 1 mg ml exposure total sludge eps extracellular protein content and extracellular polysaccharide content decreased by 19 7 19 8 and 11 2 respectively compared to control the decrease in extracellular protein content was greater compared to extracellular polysaccharides decreasing the ratio of extracellular protein to extracellular polysaccharides ② eps functional groups the ftir spectra of angs eps under acute exposure to ps nps are shown in fig 4b the peak positions and numbers of eps were close to those of control indicating that the acute exposure to ps nps did not change the functional groups in eps however the intensity of each characteristic peak changed the oh or nh ch and co stretching vibration signal peaks located at 3300 cm 1 2938 cm 1 and 1632 cm 1 respectively the 1410 cm 1 and 1120 cm 1 peaks correspond to the co symmetric stretching of the protein amide ii region coo and the co symmetric stretching respectively the intensity of the peaks at 1040 cm 1 associated with the co stretching vibration of polysaccharide and the coc stretching vibration increased after acute exposure to ps nps it was reported that oh nh co co and coc are hydrophilic functional groups and ch is a hydrophobic functional group 21 thus it is speculated that the increased hydrophilic functional groups in eps after acute exposure to ps nps affects its hydrophobicity three carbon signal peaks were detected in angs eps corresponding to binding energies of 284 08 ev 285 46 ev and 287 67 ev as shown in fig 5 and table s1 of the supplementary material the c1s peak with a binding energy of 284 08 ev was attributed to amino acids or lipid side chains of c c h 31 this peak appears to decrease in the sludge after acute exposure to ps nps c c h is the most abundant hydrophobic functional group in eps 21 the decrease in its signal peak intensity indicates a decrease in the number of corresponding functional groups and the hydrophobicity of eps the c1s peak with a binding energy of 285 46 ev attributed to co and oco on carboxylate carbonyl amide acetal or hemiacetal correspond to hydrophilic functional groups 38 the intensity of this signal peak did not change significantly in eps of angs after acute exposure to ps nps the signal peak at the binding energy of 287 67 ev was attributed to ocoh of glyoxalate 38 which is responsible for the hydrophilicity of eps 39 the ocoh peak intensity increase in angs eps after acute exposure to ps nps indicates that the number of this functional group increased and the hydrophilicity of eps was enhanced consistent with the ir spectroscopy results in summary the acute exposure to ps nps led to a hydrophobicity decrease and a hydrophilicity increase of eps in angs ③ protein secondary structure the compositional features of protein secondary structure influence the structure and properties of sludge 40 table 1 and fig s5 show the protein secondary structure information of eps under acute exposure to ps nps the amide i region of angs eps contained polymeric chains 1625 1610 cm 1 β fold 1640 1630 cm 1 α helix 1657 1648 cm 1 3 turned helix 1666 1659 cm 1 and antiparallel β fold polymeric chains 1695 1680 cm 1 of which the relative content of α helix 1657 1648 cm 1 was the highest the relative proportions of the polymeric chain β fold α helix and antiparallel β fold polymeric chain in angs eps decreased and the relative proportion of 3 turned helix increased after acute exposure to ps nps hou et al 21 concluded that the lower the α helix content and the higher the β fold and random coil content the looser the protein structure so the α helix β fold random coil ratio is often used to measure the looseness of the protein structure as shown in table 1 the angs α helix β fold random curl values decreased after the acute phase exposure of 1 mg ml ps nps indicating that the protein structure was affected 4 discussion this study investigated the effect of acute exposure of ps nps on the nitrogen removal performance of angs it was found that saanh4 n and saano2 n of angs did not change significantly under acute exposure of 0 1 mg ml ps nps indicating that angs has some ability to tolerate ps nps exposure the endogenous respiration rate of activated sludge decreased significantly after acute exposure to 0 1 mg ml ps nps which may be related to the structural properties of the sludge the angs has a compact structure 41 42 and large granule size making it difficult for ps nps to cause toxic effects on bacteria inside the granular sludge in a short time other studies have come to a similar conclusion that nanoparticles are mainly concentrated on the surface or outer layer of anaerobic granular sludge making it difficult to enter the interior of the particles 43 on the contrary the larger specific surface area and looser structure of activated sludge facilitates the contact of ps nps with many sludge cells and causes toxicity 44 in addition angs has more eps than activated sludge 45 eps is the first barrier for ps nps to contact microorganisms and can protect cells from toxicity by adsorption on ps nps 19 however it should be noted that angs has a limited ability to tolerate acute exposure to ps nps the saanh4 n and saano2 n of the sludge were significantly reduced when the ps nps concentration was 0 5 mg ml the decrease in nitrogen removal performance of angs after high acute exposure was attributed to the toxic effect of ps nps on the sludge resulting in increase the proportion of dead bacteria in the sludge in this study high concentration ps nps acute exposure increased the oxidative stress level of cells in general most cells can mediate ros through enzymatic reactions but produce a limited amount of antioxidant enzymes 46 in addition as the concentration of ps nps exposure increases the concentration of eps decreases weakening the protective effect on granular sludge cells when too much ros is produced in the cells it leads to membrane lipid peroxidation and dna damage 47 48 thereby reducing the anammox activity wei et al 34 found similar results and concluded that ps nps induced ros is one of the key toxicity mechanisms leading to the deterioration of anaerobic granular sludge performance during wastewater treatment therefore it can be concluded that the increase in dead bacteria due to increased level of oxidative stress is responsible for the decrease in nitrogen removal performance of angs the granular structure s stability helps maintain the anammox process s efficient operation 49 acute exposure with high concentrations of ps nps affects the structural stability of angs for two main reasons 1 previous studies have shown that the electrostatic force between cells is important in maintaining sludge s structural stability 50 51 in this work the zeta potential of angs decreased after acute exposure to ps nps lower zeta potential means stronger electrostatic repulsion between cells which impairs the structural stability of sludge 35 2 extracellular proteins contain many negatively charged amino acids which can form electrostatic bonds with multivalent cations that maintain the structural stability of sludge 52 at the same time extracellular polysaccharides serve as the sludge s skeleton playing an important role in maintaining the structural stability of granular sludge 53 after acute exposure of ps nps to angs the contents of extracellular proteins and polysaccharides of angs decreased some scholars 54 found that polystyrene nanoplastic had a strong adsorption effect on organics therefore it is inferred that ps nps can adsorb eps making it difficult to be extracted the decrease in extracellular protein content under acute exposure to ps nps was greater than that of extracellular polysaccharides indicating that the acute exposure to ps nps had a more significant effect on extracellular proteins the hydrophilic extracellular polysaccharides to hydrophobic extracellular proteins 40 ratio affects the surface hydrophobicity of granular sludge 55 a large decrease in extracellular protein leads to a decrease in the ratio of extracellular protein to extracellular polysaccharides in eps making the sludge less hydrophobic the hydrophobicity of sludge is a key factor in maintaining its structural stability of sludge 56 xps and ir spectroscopy showed an increase in hydrophilic functional groups such as oh ocoh co and oco and a decrease in hydrophobic groups such as c c h and ch after ps nps exposure confirming the hydrophobicity decrease in the sludge therefore an increase in the proportion of dead bacteria in angs also led to the deterioration of sludge structural stability in conclusion the increase in electrostatic repulsion between cells and the decrease in hydrophobicity of eps deteriorate the structural stability of angs anammox is used to treat high ammonia nitrogen wastewater such as sludge digester and landfill leachate 57 58 previous studies have pointed out that 97 of micro nano plastics in the waste water treatment plant will be transferred to sludge 10 and the concentration of microplastics in the landfill was also high about 20 000 91 000 kg 59 micro nano plastics in sludge and liquid supernatant are much higher in concentration than in sediment wastewater and agricultural soil and these micro nano plastics can enter the supernatant 60 when treating waste leachate the anammox process may have acute exposure to high ps nps concentrations therefore a wide range of ps nps concentrations was selected for testing to reveal the acute effects of this condition on sludge the results of the study can provide a theoretical basis for practical engineering however due to the short exposure duration it is unclear whether nanoplastic exposure affects the metabolic capacity of anammox bacteria and whether the effects of nanoplastic exposure on sludge performance are reversible which will be further investigated in the future 5 conclusion the effect of acute exposure to ps nps on the angs performance showed a dose dependent effect 0 1 mg ml acute exposure still maintained good nitrogen removal performance and structural stability of the sludge mainly due to the compact structure of the granular sludge acute exposure of 0 5 mg ml and 1 mg ml ps nps significantly reduced the sludge s nitrogen removal performance and structural stability the increase in dead bacteria due to elevated levels of oxidative stress was responsible for the decrease in sludge nitrogen removal performance the decrease in the structural stability of angs was mainly dependent on the sludge s decrease in the zeta potential and hydrophobicity and the increase in the proportion of dead bacteria declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

12744,phosphorous loading in the natural waters is a current issue that is caused by the discharge of industrial water agriculture run off and municipal releases membrane technology is an emerging method to target the removal of phosphorous from wastewater and has several advantages over the traditional methods however the main challenge of membrane technology is membrane fouling the main goal of this study was to optimize nanofiltration process of phosphates using electromagnetic field emf as an eco friendly membrane fouling remediation technique to obtain this several test runs were performed on a commercial membrane dow nf270 for nanofiltration of synthesized water with various concentrations of phosphate the application of emf altered the particle size of phosphate that resulted in a significant decrease in membrane fouling while obtaining maximum flux in situ synchrotron based micro computed tomography imaging sr μct available at the canadian light source cls was conducted to assess membrane fouling with and without emf influence across layer by layer across membrane thickness synchrotron x ray analysis revealed the decrease in internal membrane pores fouling caused by increase of phosphate particles size when using emf in addition sem images of membrane showed reduced fouling the influence of flowrate pressure ph and phosphate concentration was observed on permeate volume permeate flux and membrane fouling it was determined that flowrate transmembrane pressure and ph had were directly proportional to the permeate volume while the phosphate concentration was indirectly proportional mathematical models were developed to obtain the optimized operating conditions and to determine which factor influenced water flux and membrane fouling the most the transmembrane pressure was the most significant factor for water permeate flux while the combination of the influence of ph and feed flowrate had also a positive effect on the other hand the feed concentration was the most significant for membrane fouling according to mathematical model the optimized conditions with the highest desirability had the concentration of phosphate at 0 368 mg l pressure at 97 8 psi 6 98 ph and flowrate of 5 13 l min under these conditions maximum flux of 7 43 ml cm2 min and minimum fouling of 0 046 mg cm2 was achieved graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nanofiltration membrane fouling phosphorous removal remediation electromagnetic field mathematical model synchrotron x ray imaging data availability the raw processed data obtained at the canadian light source required to reproduce these findings of this study are available from the corresponding author amira abdelrasoul on reasonable request 1 introduction water security is an important part of canadian economy as the challenges of climate change and scarcity of fresh water arise with many cases of contamination in various water bodies water security has been an area of focus that requires action 1 one of the methods to ensure the availability of water is wastewater treatment while there are a variety of pollutants present in wastewater that carry the potential to harm the ecosystem and human health excessive phosphorous is one of the main components although phosphorous exists naturally in the environment majority of this is in such a form which limits its solubility and uptake by the plants 2 about 30 65 of total phosphorous is in organic form which is not available to plants while 35 70 is in inorganic form 3 decay of organic matter under anaerobic conditions results in release of phosphorous which is easily available for the plants 2 other sources of phosphorous include agricultural and storm water runoff industrial waste and municipal water releases 4 these human sources of phosphorous are in the form where they are used by the plants 2 according to several studies by environment canada phosphorous loading in canadian waters particularly the great lakes and lake winnipeg has been greatly increasing 5 this accelerates the algae growth due to a process called eutrophication where dissolved oxygen levels in water are decreased due to excessive amounts of phosphorous this leads to a decline in aquatic life such as fish due to a lack of oxygen as well as cyanobacteria production that releases toxins with the canada us great lakes water quality agreement canadian government is focused on reducing the phosphorous loading into the canadian waters 6 with projects funded by the environment canada such as at lake winnipeg hundreds of thousands kgs of phosphorous loading has been reduced by means of retention ponds riverbank stabilization wetland restoration and management practices to bar livestock from entering the waters fig 1 shows the estimated reduction in amount of phosphorous reaching lake winnipeg 5 the traditional methods of phosphorous removal from water include chemical biological and physical methods 7 14 one of the physical methods include membrane technology which is a relatively new method membrane technology has advantages over other methods due to low capital cost and its ability to achieve extremely low concentrations of phosphate in the permeate thus good phosphate rejection ratios up to 97 for polymer membranes were achieved 15 22 the importance of phosphorus recovery from the wastewater is hard to overestimate currently phosphorous containing natural sourced minerals are mined about 18 million tons annually whereas nearly 19 of them go to waste water streams due to human activity 23 approximately 82 of these phosphates are used to produce fertilizers which arises from their continuous demand increase by about 2 5 per year 24 thus the risk of depletion of phosphorous containing minerals requires the development of phosphorous recovery technology which is estimated to be able to provide 15 20 of the world phosphate demand 25 moreover phosphorous release in natural water results in eutrophication when explosive growth of algae occurs consequently affecting the ecological health of water bodies 26 electro spun polyethersulfone pes nonwoven membrane material shows different efficacy for phosphates removal demonstrating maximal value at ph 4 19 the decrease in membrane performance at higher ph was associated with electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged pes membrane and phosphate particles significant improvement in phosphorus removal was achieved when pes membrane was modified with gold nanoparticles 15 that were synthesized using laser ablation method phosphate rejection rate is improved with the increase of gold nanoparticles np content and maximal rejection rate 96 7 were detected for 0 1 mass of gold np immobilization of polyamide pa on pes membrane resulted in phosphate maximal rejection rate only up to 90 16 high phosphate removal up to 96 was also demonstrated for aminated polyacrylonitrile pan membrane modified with lanthanum la3 ions 17 the maximum membrane efficiency was observed at ph range from 5 to 7 good results in phosphorous removal were demonstrated for poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane modified with siloxane quaternary ammonium loaded activated carbon siqa 20 besides high rejection rate for phosphorous removal phosphorous concentration dropped from 1 mg l for feed solution to 0 2 mg l for permeate this membrane has also possessed a significant reduction of the irreversible membrane fouling by 67 compared to an unmodified membrane which is attributed to the introduced positively charged quaternary ammonium groups the improved antibacterial activity was also demonstrated for the modified membrane other membrane based methods of phosphate removal comprise using of ceramic 27 metal organic frameworks 28 inorganic mno2 ceo2 29 nanowires cationic hydrogel 30 and ion exchange 31 32 membranes however a major disadvantage is membrane fouling in this process 33 34 current techniques used in fouling control include pre treatment of feedwater with coagulants flocculants modification of membrane surface and modification of spacers within the process 35 however these controls are inadequate and there is a need for alternative methods that would be efficient one of the emerging eco friendly alternatives is the application of electromagnetic field emf this method is relatively less researched and needs further investigation 10 using emf installed into water supply pipes showed good results in terms of reducing deposition of scaling and other inorganic salts on the pipe walls thus preventing pipes from clotting and damaging 36 38 the influence of emf on salts crystals formation was used to improve the performance of reverse osmosis ro pilot desalination unit showing the reduction of membrane fouling by 38 3 in terms of normalized water permeability 39 other examples of successful use of emf for improving membrane performance include nano filtration 40 ultra filtration 41 and membrane distillation membranes 42 though there are reports claiming no noticeable effect of emf on the membrane performance 43 44 the aim of this paper is to use emf for reducing membrane fouling with phosphate salts during nanofiltration process and optimize its conditions using mathematical modeling the objectives of the study were to i investigate the influence of emf on membrane on membrane fouling as an effective membrane fouling remediation technique in nanofiltration of phosphorus ii comprehensively examine membrane fouling layer by layer using in situ sr μct and iii develop mathematical models to optimize operating conditions and to determine which factor influenced water flux and membrane fouling 2 mechanism of emf influence on salt crystals growth there are basically two main mechanisms represent how emf affects the salt deposit formation discussed in literature 37 the first mechanism involves the changes in hydration layer of ions induced by emf that results in acceleration of crystallization of such salts as phosphates and carbonates 45 48 thus it has been observed that emf is able to induce change in hydration of ions and interfaces between liquid and gas or solid surfaces 49 emf is believed to change the orientation of proton spin causing its hindered transfer to a water molecule which in turn results in disturbing of hydration layer 47 the second mechanism called magnetohydrodynamic phenomena assumes the effect of magnetic field on moving charged particles lorentz force that are present only in the case of water flow this effect is believed to be responsible for induction and distortion particles surface charge that affect crystals growth 50 51 besides that some authors noticed the effect of emf on salt solution surface tension that also has some effect on the salt deposit formation 52 53 despite of significant number over 4000 of studies related to the influence of emf on salt crystal growth and anti scaling effect there is still no clear understanding of mechanism how emf affects salt precipitation and deposit formation nevertheless there are studies showing the acceleration effect of emf both on nucleation 54 57 and crystal growth 58 61 rates this effect in alternating salt crystal nucleation and growth behavior change was successfully used to reduce scaling formation on laboratory 40 62 and pilot 63 64 water systems 3 materials and methods 3 1 design of experiment design of experiment doe was created using statease designexpert v13 there were four variables that were analyzed below table 1 presents the variables along with the coded factors an initial run was required to find the boundary conditions of the process especially with the relationship between flowrate and pressure after the initial run statease software was used to determine different combinations for the runs the combinations were determined using levels ranging from 2 to 2 there were several runs that were duplicated to test the stability and accuracy of the system using response surface method rsm multiple combinations of the four mentioned variables were produced for a total of 26 simulations table 2 below outlines the design of experiment with various run conditions to determine the optimal conditions for highest flux and lowest fouling rate 3 2 experimental setup and procedure 3 2 1 materials since the feedwater conditions were controlled to determine the optimal conditions samples were prepared with known concentrations of phosphate and ph lab grade dicalcium phosphate cahpo4 from sigma aldrich was used to make the proper concentration of feedwater to adjust the ph 37 hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh were used from fisher scientific hanna hi5522 bench meter hanna instruments usa was used to determine the final ph of the water sample dow filmtec nf270 commercial membrane was used for this experiment the pore size of this membrane peaks at around 0 65 nm the feedwater conditions used in this study satisfied the operating limits set out by the membrane manufacturer dow 65 nf270 has significantly low roughness compared to some other commercialized membranes available in the market 66 which directly correlates to the reducing membrane fouling 67 3 2 2 experimental setup fig 2 shows a schematic of experimental setup controlled concentration and ph solution were added to the feed tank 5 l which fed into a forward displacement pump the outlet valve of the pump controlled the water flowrate that would flow into the unit venturi meter was used to measure the flowrate through the system a pressure gauge was installed to measure the inlet pressure to the nf membrane unit nf membrane unit inlet pipe was equipped with a commercial emf device hydroflow s 38 on the inlet feedwater the hydroflow s 38 device has 1 2 w electromagnetic field which was designed to make scale form a suspension in water for easier removal hydroflow s 38 is powered by 110 240 v ac with further conversion to 12 v ac dc it has h 110 w 67 d 30 mm dimensions 175 g weight and can be installed on pipes with maximum outer diameter 38 mm dow nf270 membranes were cut to size and placed within the unit permeate was collected and the volume was recorded via a digital balance the reject was recycled back into the feed tank the valve on the reject line was used to throttle the flow in case the inlet valve was not enough to adjust the flowrate the mass of retained particles was measured by drying and weighting of fouled membranes the used membranes fouled membranes were kept at room temperature 25 c for 48 h until they reached a constant weight and remained unchanged this approach has been successfully used by our research group before 68 69 a total of 27 runs were conducted with each run lasting 20 min out of those 27 runs 26 were with emf under various conditions controlled within the lab as mentioned in table 2 above and one without emf to observe the effects of emf finally after each run sem was conducted for membranes fouling assessment this determined the total fouling taking place within that membrane at certain feed conditions with emf application 3 3 in situ synchrotron imaging the synchrotron based x ray microtomography sr μct system is a powerful method that is used to investigate various porous materials including filtration membranes this method is based on the ability of different materials to attenuate x ray emission in various extent the transmitted x ray emission is then recorded and processed to generate three dimensional image of internal structure of the investigated material this method was successfully used before in our research group for estimation the fouling across the thickness of ceramic and polymeric membranes 70 74 experimental setup used at the 05id 2 beamline of the biomedical imaging and therapy bmit at the canadian light source cls is shown in fig 3 to visualize the presence of phosphate particles the images were recorded using monochromatic 20 kev beam detected by beam monitor aa 40 500 μm luag scintillator hamamatsu japan coupled with a high resolution camera pco dimax hs pco germany membrane thickness was conventionally divided into 5 regions of interest roi as presented in fig 4 each roi included 12 slices of the membrane layers the recorded x ray based radiograms were converted into graphical images using ufo kit software with further analysis of resulted images in imagej software 70 71 3 4 analytical methods 3 4 1 zeta potential zeta potential of phosphate particles in the solution and nf270 membrane was determined using zetasizer nano analyzer malvern instruments ltd uk the purpose of this was to determine the general effect of ph of water on the surface charge of the membrane surface and pollutant particles this device is able to measure zeta potential both for particles and for polymer film membrane surfaces and at different ph values an accessory cell for the zetasizer enables a small piece of the flat membrane to be mounted between two electrodes the presence of the material modifies the pattern of electroosmosis between the electrodes when a field is applied which can be detected the measurement of zeta potential at a number of distances from the surface of the material to detect the charge on the membrane surface to improve results accuracy measurements were performed 3 times for each sample 3 4 2 particle size analysis phosphate particle size analysis was performed with varying time of emf application the distribution of particles size was determined using malvern mastersizer 3000 analyzer this instrument has a range of measuring particle size of 0 01 3500 μm 3 4 3 scanning electron microscopy sem imaging cold cathode field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem su8010 hitachi japan was used to obtain sem analysis of the nf270 membrane images of clean membrane were compared with the membrane that experienced less fouling as well as a highly fouled membrane 4 results and discussion 4 1 influence of water ph on pollutant and membrane surface charges the effect of changing ph was monitored on the membrane and the pollutant surface charges as seen in fig 5 with increasing ph as alkalinity is added the negative charge is increased which drives zeta potential lower the zeta potential of the phosphate particles in the solution decreased along with increasing ph as well as nf270 membrane it is also evident that after the ph of 7 the zeta potential of membrane surface and the phosphate particles in the solution were significantly negative which increases the repulsion forces of the particles and hence reduce membrane fouling our study covered range of ph from 2 to 12 to check the application of emf at various feed conditions that may be present within different industries such as industrial setting where ph of feed is usually high for asset integrity low ph is usually found in surface water such as lakes or rivers 4 2 effects of emf on particle size and membrane fouling application of an electromagnetic field emf device changed the particle size of phosphate as shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows the curve of particle size distribution and it is evident that the size of phosphate particles increased as emf device was left online for longer period of time without emf majority of the particles were 20 μm however just after 20 min of emf application a drastic shift was noticed where the particle size increased to 60 μm as time progressed the size continued to increase and a shift to the graph was noticed it was observed that 90 min was the peak of highest size at 91 μm for majority of the particles even though phosphate particles having the peak size around 20 μm without emf nevertheless a broad size distribution of nanoscale size of phosphate particles has been existed as presented in fig 6 when emf is applied to feed solution not only peak position shit to higher sizes occurs but also the distribution becomes significantly narrower which means a significant reduction in small sized phosphate particles that are able to penetrate nano size membrane pores with the opportunity to eliminate feed pre treatment with chemicals ion exchange units or any descaling equipment prior to effectively removing phosphate using nanofiltration emf was observed to alternate the particle size which would eliminate pore blocking as the particle size of phosphate particles would be much greater than the pore size of membrane and hence minimize membrane fouling this results in more cake build up and reversible fouling that can easily be removed by means of backwashing or flushing membrane surface sem analysis images are demonstrated on fig 7 fig 7a and fig 7b compare the 20 minute run at coded factor of 0 0 0 0 without and with emf respectively without emf there is heavy fouling that has taken place of small particle that blocked membrane pores and would contribute to irreversible fouling the deposit seems packed down and would require increased pressure and flowrate to push the permeate through water pretreatment with emf resulted in formation of voluminous and loose reversible deposit that can be easily removed thus providing restore of membrane permeability the decay of flux was 75 after 20 min nanofiltration without emf on the other hand decay of flux after 20 min was only 20 in the presence of emf fig 8 represents imaging from synchrotron analysis that provides membrane fouling with phosphate deposit across the membrane thickness for convenient representation of resulted data different phases were highlighted with specific colors thus when no emf was applied for phosphate particles solution the membrane polymer is colored with blue whereas deposited phosphate salt particles are presented as black pixels see left images on fig 8 when phosphate feed solution was treated with emf red color for membrane polymer and white color for indicating phosphate particles was used see right images on fig 8 the majority of phosphate particles are located at the low index layers when feed solution was subjected by emf the quantitative analysis of synchrotron data showing the fouled are at each level is depicted on fig 9 bigger phosphate particles being formed during emf treatment result in membrane fouling only at the top layers index less than 17 and almost no fouling is observed inside the members when water was not treated with emf smaller phosphate particles are able to penetrate membrane across whole thickness resulting in significant membrane fouling of layers with higher index 4 3 effects of feedwater conditions on permeate flux and membrane fouling with varying feedwater conditions the permeate flux and membrane fouling were main outlet responses that were investigated table 3 below shows the results that were obtained each run was for 20 min and the filtration area of the membrane was determined to be 94 77 cm2 the permeate flux was determined by measuring the volume of clean water ml from the permeate and filtration area membrane fouling was determined by measuring the weight of phosphate collected on the membrane surface by weighing the membrane before and after the experiment the mass of retained particles was measured by drying and weighting of fouled membranes the used membranes fouled membranes were kept at room temperature 25 c for 48 h until they reached a constant weight and remained unchanged the data in table 3 was analyzed and prediction models for maximizing flux and minimizing fouling were determined fig 11a d shows the correlation between the volume of permeate obtained vs each parameter changes while holding the other 3 parameters constant at a time while there are differences between each trendline due to multiple factors it can be said with confidence that there is a positive correlation between flowrate and inlet pressure vs permeate volume and there is a negative correlation between phosphate concentration and permeate volume it also should to be noted that we have demonstrated positive correlation between permeate flux and ph since some studies reported negative effect of ph on permeate flux in case of using such salts as kcl cacl2 and mgso4 75 in our study we used calcium phosphate salt that changes its composition with the change of ph see fig 10 these different phosphate anions affect the resultant salt solubility drastically see table 4 thus at higher ph the solubility of calcium phosphate salt is significantly lower that with combination of emf results in increased surface cake layer formation but at the same time it results in lowering the membrane internal pores fouling that is accompanied with improved permeability 4 4 model development and statistical analysis of permeate flux flux response was analyzed in design expert and a quadratic model was chosen for the accuracy of the model the model f value was 9 03 indicating that it is significant with a p value of 0 0004 it is implied that there is very slight chance of 0 04 that this large of f value could occur due to noise the standard deviation was 0 778 mean was 2 95 and r2 value of 0 92 eq 1 was developed to accurately predict the permeate flux using the feed concentration pressure feed flow rate and ph which is useful for identifying the relative impact of all the four factors by comparing the factor coefficients 1 ф 1 89 0 0383 c 3 28 p 0 716 ph 0 367 q 0 698 c p 0 206 c ph 0 219 c q 0 448 p ph 0 638 p q 1 25 ph q 1 62 c 2 1 48 p 2 0 255 ph 2 1 55 q 2 where ф flux ml cm2 min c concentration mg l p pressure psi ph ph q flowrate l min the transmembrane pressure is the most significant factor affecting the permeate flux followed by the influence of the interaction between the ph and flowrate influences when the latter two factors interact an effect on permeate flux is noticed to a greater degree than each of the individual variables increasing the transmembrane pressure increases the force required to push clean water through the nanofilter with an extremely small pore size which results in higher volume of clean water flux fig 12 shows the agreement between the actual vs predicted permeate using the developed model using the 3d model graphs the interactions between 4 factors were assessed it is worth noticing that out the pressure has more significant effect on the flux as opposed to concentration which aligns with the model in eq 1 fig 13a represents the permeate flux as ph and flowrate were both at minimum of 2 and 1 l min respectively as the ph starts changing in fig 13b and fig 13c there is a slight shift in the graph as the overall permeate flux decreases in fig 13d and fig 13e presented the influence when the ph was at minimum and flowrate was increased slowly as expected the flowrate has more effect on the shift of the graph due to the water throughput fig 13f represents both ph and flowrate to be moderate fig 13g represents maximum ph of 12 and maximum flowrate of 7 l min it is implied that at these conditions the flux is high compared to previous conditions at the same concentration and flowrate 4 5 membrane fouling model development and statistical analysis membrane fouling response was also analyzed in design expert and a quadratic model was chosen the model f value was 20 708 indicating that it is significant with a p value of less than 0 0001 it is implied that there is very slight chance of 0 01 that this large of f value could occur due to noise the standard deviation was 0 012 mean was 2 67 and r2 value of 1 00 eq 2 was developed to accurately predict membrane fouling using the feed concentration pressure feed flow rate and ph which is useful for identifying the relative impact of all the four factors by comparing the factor coefficients 2 ξ 2 65 2 63 c 6 x 10 4 p 4 x 10 4 ph 1 6 x 10 3 q 5 x 10 3 c p 3 6 x 10 3 c ph 4 x 10 3 c q 8 x 10 4 p ph 6 x 10 3 p q 4

variable that significantly influenced membrane fouling and as concentration increased the membrane fouling rate increased the other three parameters were insignificant and had negligible effect on membrane fouling rate compared to feed concentration while discussed in fig 3 that the zeta potential is affected by the ph there was a change noticed only in the 8 10 ph range at lower ph the change is negligible due to the wide range of ph in the experiment ph was not a major factor that affected the results in the model fig 14 represents the agreement between the predicted vs actual fouling and fits the model precisely as indicated by the r2 value due to only 1 major contributor to membrane fouling rate the 3d model did not change significantly by manually altering various factors as indicated in fig 15 there was no visual shift in the model by increasing and or decreasing ph and flowrate 4 6 model optimization to select the best fit model the criteria selected was to maximize permeate flux while minimizing membrane fouling to minimize the energy consumption and to increase the membrane lifetime with many operating conditions provided the selected optimum condition had the desirability of 1 00 table 5 summarizes the feed conditions to achieve optimized model all four factors had varying effect on the desirability of the optimized model figs 16 a f represent the effects of changing all variables at a given time the largest effect was noticed in fig 16d where the desirability dropped to 0 for a large amount of area under the curve at minimum ph and moderate flowrate it is indicative of the interactions between ph and flowrate and effects on the model the three model graphs for the optimized solution indicated in table 5 are given below as seen in the fig 17 a c maximum flux of 7 43 ml cm2 and minimum fouling of 0 046 mg cm2 were achieved with a desirability of 1 00 5 conclusion phosphates removal is an important part of water treatment as excess nutrients can lead to issues in the surface water contamination and pose harm to the ecosystem membrane filtration specifically nanofiltration was provided as an alternative to conventional methods of removing phosphates due to several advantages that membrane technology has over those methods however fouling is a critical issue that leads to downtimes for cleans and reduced system efficiency emf was applied to pre treat the feed and particle size analysis showed positive results with shift of the particle size to be larger that will prevent the irreversible fouling emf resulted in formation of reversible cake layer on the membrane surface that can easily be removed in situ synchrotron based micro computed tomography imaging sr μct available at the canadian light source cls was conducted to assess membrane fouling with and without emf influence across layer by layer across membrane thickness synchrotron analysis revealed the reduction of membrane internal volume fouling due to increase the particles size that retains membrane permeability increased particle size also results in less block of surface pores in addition operational parameters such as concentration pressure ph and flowrate were also investigated as it contributes to the fouling mechanism with the help of predictive models optimized operating conditions were determined to minimize membrane fouling of the nanofiltration while maximizing the flux throughput it was determined that pressure has a strong effect on the permeate flux while flowrate combined with ph can shift the permeate flux on the other hand the membrane fouling was directly proportional to feed concentration of phosphate combining the two models led to optimal operating conditions with high desirability further work is recommended to determine the application of this work in an industrial setting with varying feed contaminants and conditions along with evaluating financial feasibility of a system with emf as a pre treatment

12744,phosphorous loading in the natural waters is a current issue that is caused by the discharge of industrial water agriculture run off and municipal releases membrane technology is an emerging method to target the removal of phosphorous from wastewater and has several advantages over the traditional methods however the main challenge of membrane technology is membrane fouling the main goal of this study was to optimize nanofiltration process of phosphates using electromagnetic field emf as an eco friendly membrane fouling remediation technique to obtain this several test runs were performed on a commercial membrane dow nf270 for nanofiltration of synthesized water with various concentrations of phosphate the application of emf altered the particle size of phosphate that resulted in a significant decrease in membrane fouling while obtaining maximum flux in situ synchrotron based micro computed tomography imaging sr μct available at the canadian light source cls was conducted to assess membrane fouling with and without emf influence across layer by layer across membrane thickness synchrotron x ray analysis revealed the decrease in internal membrane pores fouling caused by increase of phosphate particles size when using emf in addition sem images of membrane showed reduced fouling the influence of flowrate pressure ph and phosphate concentration was observed on permeate volume permeate flux and membrane fouling it was determined that flowrate transmembrane pressure and ph had were directly proportional to the permeate volume while the phosphate concentration was indirectly proportional mathematical models were developed to obtain the optimized operating conditions and to determine which factor influenced water flux and membrane fouling the most the transmembrane pressure was the most significant factor for water permeate flux while the combination of the influence of ph and feed flowrate had also a positive effect on the other hand the feed concentration was the most significant for membrane fouling according to mathematical model the optimized conditions with the highest desirability had the concentration of phosphate at 0 368 mg l pressure at 97 8 psi 6 98 ph and flowrate of 5 13 l min under these conditions maximum flux of 7 43 ml cm2 min and minimum fouling of 0 046 mg cm2 was achieved graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nanofiltration membrane fouling phosphorous removal remediation electromagnetic field mathematical model synchrotron x ray imaging data availability the raw processed data obtained at the canadian light source required to reproduce these findings of this study are available from the corresponding author amira abdelrasoul on reasonable request 1 introduction water security is an important part of canadian economy as the challenges of climate change and scarcity of fresh water arise with many cases of contamination in various water bodies water security has been an area of focus that requires action 1 one of the methods to ensure the availability of water is wastewater treatment while there are a variety of pollutants present in wastewater that carry the potential to harm the ecosystem and human health excessive phosphorous is one of the main components although phosphorous exists naturally in the environment majority of this is in such a form which limits its solubility and uptake by the plants 2 about 30 65 of total phosphorous is in organic form which is not available to plants while 35 70 is in inorganic form 3 decay of organic matter under anaerobic conditions results in release of phosphorous which is easily available for the plants 2 other sources of phosphorous include agricultural and storm water runoff industrial waste and municipal water releases 4 these human sources of phosphorous are in the form where they are used by the plants 2 according to several studies by environment canada phosphorous loading in canadian waters particularly the great lakes and lake winnipeg has been greatly increasing 5 this accelerates the algae growth due to a process called eutrophication where dissolved oxygen levels in water are decreased due to excessive amounts of phosphorous this leads to a decline in aquatic life such as fish due to a lack of oxygen as well as cyanobacteria production that releases toxins with the canada us great lakes water quality agreement canadian government is focused on reducing the phosphorous loading into the canadian waters 6 with projects funded by the environment canada such as at lake winnipeg hundreds of thousands kgs of phosphorous loading has been reduced by means of retention ponds riverbank stabilization wetland restoration and management practices to bar livestock from entering the waters fig 1 shows the estimated reduction in amount of phosphorous reaching lake winnipeg 5 the traditional methods of phosphorous removal from water include chemical biological and physical methods 7 14 one of the physical methods include membrane technology which is a relatively new method membrane technology has advantages over other methods due to low capital cost and its ability to achieve extremely low concentrations of phosphate in the permeate thus good phosphate rejection ratios up to 97 for polymer membranes were achieved 15 22 the importance of phosphorus recovery from the wastewater is hard to overestimate currently phosphorous containing natural sourced minerals are mined about 18 million tons annually whereas nearly 19 of them go to waste water streams due to human activity 23 approximately 82 of these phosphates are used to produce fertilizers which arises from their continuous demand increase by about 2 5 per year 24 thus the risk of depletion of phosphorous containing minerals requires the development of phosphorous recovery technology which is estimated to be able to provide 15 20 of the world phosphate demand 25 moreover phosphorous release in natural water results in eutrophication when explosive growth of algae occurs consequently affecting the ecological health of water bodies 26 electro spun polyethersulfone pes nonwoven membrane material shows different efficacy for phosphates removal demonstrating maximal value at ph 4 19 the decrease in membrane performance at higher ph was associated with electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged pes membrane and phosphate particles significant improvement in phosphorus removal was achieved when pes membrane was modified with gold nanoparticles 15 that were synthesized using laser ablation method phosphate rejection rate is improved with the increase of gold nanoparticles np content and maximal rejection rate 96 7 were detected for 0 1 mass of gold np immobilization of polyamide pa on pes membrane resulted in phosphate maximal rejection rate only up to 90 16 high phosphate removal up to 96 was also demonstrated for aminated polyacrylonitrile pan membrane modified with lanthanum la3 ions 17 the maximum membrane efficiency was observed at ph range from 5 to 7 good results in phosphorous removal were demonstrated for poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane modified with siloxane quaternary ammonium loaded activated carbon siqa 20 besides high rejection rate for phosphorous removal phosphorous concentration dropped from 1 mg l for feed solution to 0 2 mg l for permeate this membrane has also possessed a significant reduction of the irreversible membrane fouling by 67 compared to an unmodified membrane which is attributed to the introduced positively charged quaternary ammonium groups the improved antibacterial activity was also demonstrated for the modified membrane other membrane based methods of phosphate removal comprise using of ceramic 27 metal organic frameworks 28 inorganic mno2 ceo2 29 nanowires cationic hydrogel 30 and ion exchange 31 32 membranes however a major disadvantage is membrane fouling in this process 33 34 current techniques used in fouling control include pre treatment of feedwater with coagulants flocculants modification of membrane surface and modification of spacers within the process 35 however these controls are inadequate and there is a need for alternative methods that would be efficient one of the emerging eco friendly alternatives is the application of electromagnetic field emf this method is relatively less researched and needs further investigation 10 using emf installed into water supply pipes showed good results in terms of reducing deposition of scaling and other inorganic salts on the pipe walls thus preventing pipes from clotting and damaging 36 38 the influence of emf on salts crystals formation was used to improve the performance of reverse osmosis ro pilot desalination unit showing the reduction of membrane fouling by 38 3 in terms of normalized water permeability 39 other examples of successful use of emf for improving membrane performance include nano filtration 40 ultra filtration 41 and membrane distillation membranes 42 though there are reports claiming no noticeable effect of emf on the membrane performance 43 44 the aim of this paper is to use emf for reducing membrane fouling with phosphate salts during nanofiltration process and optimize its conditions using mathematical modeling the objectives of the study were to i investigate the influence of emf on membrane on membrane fouling as an effective membrane fouling remediation technique in nanofiltration of phosphorus ii comprehensively examine membrane fouling layer by layer using in situ sr μct and iii develop mathematical models to optimize operating conditions and to determine which factor influenced water flux and membrane fouling 2 mechanism of emf influence on salt crystals growth there are basically two main mechanisms represent how emf affects the salt deposit formation discussed in literature 37 the first mechanism involves the changes in hydration layer of ions induced by emf that results in acceleration of crystallization of such salts as phosphates and carbonates 45 48 thus it has been observed that emf is able to induce change in hydration of ions and interfaces between liquid and gas or solid surfaces 49 emf is believed to change the orientation of proton spin causing its hindered transfer to a water molecule which in turn results in disturbing of hydration layer 47 the second mechanism called magnetohydrodynamic phenomena assumes the effect of magnetic field on moving charged particles lorentz force that are present only in the case of water flow this effect is believed to be responsible for induction and distortion particles surface charge that affect crystals growth 50 51 besides that some authors noticed the effect of emf on salt solution surface tension that also has some effect on the salt deposit formation 52 53 despite of significant number over 4000 of studies related to the influence of emf on salt crystal growth and anti scaling effect there is still no clear understanding of mechanism how emf affects salt precipitation and deposit formation nevertheless there are studies showing the acceleration effect of emf both on nucleation 54 57 and crystal growth 58 61 rates this effect in alternating salt crystal nucleation and growth behavior change was successfully used to reduce scaling formation on laboratory 40 62 and pilot 63 64 water systems 3 materials and methods 3 1 design of experiment design of experiment doe was created using statease designexpert v13 there were four variables that were analyzed below table 1 presents the variables along with the coded factors an initial run was required to find the boundary conditions of the process especially with the relationship between flowrate and pressure after the initial run statease software was used to determine different combinations for the runs the combinations were determined using levels ranging from 2 to 2 there were several runs that were duplicated to test the stability and accuracy of the system using response surface method rsm multiple combinations of the four mentioned variables were produced for a total of 26 simulations table 2 below outlines the design of experiment with various run conditions to determine the optimal conditions for highest flux and lowest fouling rate 3 2 experimental setup and procedure 3 2 1 materials since the feedwater conditions were controlled to determine the optimal conditions samples were prepared with known concentrations of phosphate and ph lab grade dicalcium phosphate cahpo4 from sigma aldrich was used to make the proper concentration of feedwater to adjust the ph 37 hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh were used from fisher scientific hanna hi5522 bench meter hanna instruments usa was used to determine the final ph of the water sample dow filmtec nf270 commercial membrane was used for this experiment the pore size of this membrane peaks at around 0 65 nm the feedwater conditions used in this study satisfied the operating limits set out by the membrane manufacturer dow 65 nf270 has significantly low roughness compared to some other commercialized membranes available in the market 66 which directly correlates to the reducing membrane fouling 67 3 2 2 experimental setup fig 2 shows a schematic of experimental setup controlled concentration and ph solution were added to the feed tank 5 l which fed into a forward displacement pump the outlet valve of the pump controlled the water flowrate that would flow into the unit venturi meter was used to measure the flowrate through the system a pressure gauge was installed to measure the inlet pressure to the nf membrane unit nf membrane unit inlet pipe was equipped with a commercial emf device hydroflow s 38 on the inlet feedwater the hydroflow s 38 device has 1 2 w electromagnetic field which was designed to make scale form a suspension in water for easier removal hydroflow s 38 is powered by 110 240 v ac with further conversion to 12 v ac dc it has h 110 w 67 d 30 mm dimensions 175 g weight and can be installed on pipes with maximum outer diameter 38 mm dow nf270 membranes were cut to size and placed within the unit permeate was collected and the volume was recorded via a digital balance the reject was recycled back into the feed tank the valve on the reject line was used to throttle the flow in case the inlet valve was not enough to adjust the flowrate the mass of retained particles was measured by drying and weighting of fouled membranes the used membranes fouled membranes were kept at room temperature 25 c for 48 h until they reached a constant weight and remained unchanged this approach has been successfully used by our research group before 68 69 a total of 27 runs were conducted with each run lasting 20 min out of those 27 runs 26 were with emf under various conditions controlled within the lab as mentioned in table 2 above and one without emf to observe the effects of emf finally after each run sem was conducted for membranes fouling assessment this determined the total fouling taking place within that membrane at certain feed conditions with emf application 3 3 in situ synchrotron imaging the synchrotron based x ray microtomography sr μct system is a powerful method that is used to investigate various porous materials including filtration membranes this method is based on the ability of different materials to attenuate x ray emission in various extent the transmitted x ray emission is then recorded and processed to generate three dimensional image of internal structure of the investigated material this method was successfully used before in our research group for estimation the fouling across the thickness of ceramic and polymeric membranes 70 74 experimental setup used at the 05id 2 beamline of the biomedical imaging and therapy bmit at the canadian light source cls is shown in fig 3 to visualize the presence of phosphate particles the images were recorded using monochromatic 20 kev beam detected by beam monitor aa 40 500 μm luag scintillator hamamatsu japan coupled with a high resolution camera pco dimax hs pco germany membrane thickness was conventionally divided into 5 regions of interest roi as presented in fig 4 each roi included 12 slices of the membrane layers the recorded x ray based radiograms were converted into graphical images using ufo kit software with further analysis of resulted images in imagej software 70 71 3 4 analytical methods 3 4 1 zeta potential zeta potential of phosphate particles in the solution and nf270 membrane was determined using zetasizer nano analyzer malvern instruments ltd uk the purpose of this was to determine the general effect of ph of water on the surface charge of the membrane surface and pollutant particles this device is able to measure zeta potential both for particles and for polymer film membrane surfaces and at different ph values an accessory cell for the zetasizer enables a small piece of the flat membrane to be mounted between two electrodes the presence of the material modifies the pattern of electroosmosis between the electrodes when a field is applied which can be detected the measurement of zeta potential at a number of distances from the surface of the material to detect the charge on the membrane surface to improve results accuracy measurements were performed 3 times for each sample 3 4 2 particle size analysis phosphate particle size analysis was performed with varying time of emf application the distribution of particles size was determined using malvern mastersizer 3000 analyzer this instrument has a range of measuring particle size of 0 01 3500 μm 3 4 3 scanning electron microscopy sem imaging cold cathode field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem su8010 hitachi japan was used to obtain sem analysis of the nf270 membrane images of clean membrane were compared with the membrane that experienced less fouling as well as a highly fouled membrane 4 results and discussion 4 1 influence of water ph on pollutant and membrane surface charges the effect of changing ph was monitored on the membrane and the pollutant surface charges as seen in fig 5 with increasing ph as alkalinity is added the negative charge is increased which drives zeta potential lower the zeta potential of the phosphate particles in the solution decreased along with increasing ph as well as nf270 membrane it is also evident that after the ph of 7 the zeta potential of membrane surface and the phosphate particles in the solution were significantly negative which increases the repulsion forces of the particles and hence reduce membrane fouling our study covered range of ph from 2 to 12 to check the application of emf at various feed conditions that may be present within different industries such as industrial setting where ph of feed is usually high for asset integrity low ph is usually found in surface water such as lakes or rivers 4 2 effects of emf on particle size and membrane fouling application of an electromagnetic field emf device changed the particle size of phosphate as shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows the curve of particle size distribution and it is evident that the size of phosphate particles increased as emf device was left online for longer period of time without emf majority of the particles were 20 μm however just after 20 min of emf application a drastic shift was noticed where the particle size increased to 60 μm as time progressed the size continued to increase and a shift to the graph was noticed it was observed that 90 min was the peak of highest size at 91 μm for majority of the particles even though phosphate particles having the peak size around 20 μm without emf nevertheless a broad size distribution of nanoscale size of phosphate particles has been existed as presented in fig 6 when emf is applied to feed solution not only peak position shit to higher sizes occurs but also the distribution becomes significantly narrower which means a significant reduction in small sized phosphate particles that are able to penetrate nano size membrane pores with the opportunity to eliminate feed pre treatment with chemicals ion exchange units or any descaling equipment prior to effectively removing phosphate using nanofiltration emf was observed to alternate the particle size which would eliminate pore blocking as the particle size of phosphate particles would be much greater than the pore size of membrane and hence minimize membrane fouling this results in more cake build up and reversible fouling that can easily be removed by means of backwashing or flushing membrane surface sem analysis images are demonstrated on fig 7 fig 7a and fig 7b compare the 20 minute run at coded factor of 0 0 0 0 without and with emf respectively without emf there is heavy fouling that has taken place of small particle that blocked membrane pores and would contribute to irreversible fouling the deposit seems packed down and would require increased pressure and flowrate to push the permeate through water pretreatment with emf resulted in formation of voluminous and loose reversible deposit that can be easily removed thus providing restore of membrane permeability the decay of flux was 75 after 20 min nanofiltration without emf on the other hand decay of flux after 20 min was only 20 in the presence of emf fig 8 represents imaging from synchrotron analysis that provides membrane fouling with phosphate deposit across the membrane thickness for convenient representation of resulted data different phases were highlighted with specific colors thus when no emf was applied for phosphate particles solution the membrane polymer is colored with blue whereas deposited phosphate salt particles are presented as black pixels see left images on fig 8 when phosphate feed solution was treated with emf red color for membrane polymer and white color for indicating phosphate particles was used see right images on fig 8 the majority of phosphate particles are located at the low index layers when feed solution was subjected by emf the quantitative analysis of synchrotron data showing the fouled are at each level is depicted on fig 9 bigger phosphate particles being formed during emf treatment result in membrane fouling only at the top layers index less than 17 and almost no fouling is observed inside the members when water was not treated with emf smaller phosphate particles are able to penetrate membrane across whole thickness resulting in significant membrane fouling of layers with higher index 4 3 effects of feedwater conditions on permeate flux and membrane fouling with varying feedwater conditions the permeate flux and membrane fouling were main outlet responses that were investigated table 3 below shows the results that were obtained each run was for 20 min and the filtration area of the membrane was determined to be 94 77 cm2 the permeate flux was determined by measuring the volume of clean water ml from the permeate and filtration area membrane fouling was determined by measuring the weight of phosphate collected on the membrane surface by weighing the membrane before and after the experiment the mass of retained particles was measured by drying and weighting of fouled membranes the used membranes fouled membranes were kept at room temperature 25 c for 48 h until they reached a constant weight and remained unchanged the data in table 3 was analyzed and prediction models for maximizing flux and minimizing fouling were determined fig 11a d shows the correlation between the volume of permeate obtained vs each parameter changes while holding the other 3 parameters constant at a time while there are differences between each trendline due to multiple factors it can be said with confidence that there is a positive correlation between flowrate and inlet pressure vs permeate volume and there is a negative correlation between phosphate concentration and permeate volume it also should to be noted that we have demonstrated positive correlation between permeate flux and ph since some studies reported negative effect of ph on permeate flux in case of using such salts as kcl cacl2 and mgso4 75 in our study we used calcium phosphate salt that changes its composition with the change of ph see fig 10 these different phosphate anions affect the resultant salt solubility drastically see table 4 thus at higher ph the solubility of calcium phosphate salt is significantly lower that with combination of emf results in increased surface cake layer formation but at the same time it results in lowering the membrane internal pores fouling that is accompanied with improved permeability 4 4 model development and statistical analysis of permeate flux flux response was analyzed in design expert and a quadratic model was chosen for the accuracy of the model the model f value was 9 03 indicating that it is significant with a p value of 0 0004 it is implied that there is very slight chance of 0 04 that this large of f value could occur due to noise the standard deviation was 0 778 mean was 2 95 and r2 value of 0 92 eq 1 was developed to accurately predict the permeate flux using the feed concentration pressure feed flow rate and ph which is useful for identifying the relative impact of all the four factors by comparing the factor coefficients 1 ф 1 89 0 0383 c 3 28 p 0 716 ph 0 367 q 0 698 c p 0 206 c ph 0 219 c q 0 448 p ph 0 638 p q 1 25 ph q 1 62 c 2 1 48 p 2 0 255 ph 2 1 55 q 2 where ф flux ml cm2 min c concentration mg l p pressure psi ph ph q flowrate l min the transmembrane pressure is the most significant factor affecting the permeate flux followed by the influence of the interaction between the ph and flowrate influences when the latter two factors interact an effect on permeate flux is noticed to a greater degree than each of the individual variables increasing the transmembrane pressure increases the force required to push clean water through the nanofilter with an extremely small pore size which results in higher volume of clean water flux fig 12 shows the agreement between the actual vs predicted permeate using the developed model using the 3d model graphs the interactions between 4 factors were assessed it is worth noticing that out the pressure has more significant effect on the flux as opposed to concentration which aligns with the model in eq 1 fig 13a represents the permeate flux as ph and flowrate were both at minimum of 2 and 1 l min respectively as the ph starts changing in fig 13b and fig 13c there is a slight shift in the graph as the overall permeate flux decreases in fig 13d and fig 13e presented the influence when the ph was at minimum and flowrate was increased slowly as expected the flowrate has more effect on the shift of the graph due to the water throughput fig 13f represents both ph and flowrate to be moderate fig 13g represents maximum ph of 12 and maximum flowrate of 7 l min it is implied that at these conditions the flux is high compared to previous conditions at the same concentration and flowrate 4 5 membrane fouling model development and statistical analysis membrane fouling response was also analyzed in design expert and a quadratic model was chosen the model f value was 20 708 indicating that it is significant with a p value of less than 0 0001 it is implied that there is very slight chance of 0 01 that this large of f value could occur due to noise the standard deviation was 0 012 mean was 2 67 and r2 value of 1 00 eq 2 was developed to accurately predict membrane fouling using the feed concentration pressure feed flow rate and ph which is useful for identifying the relative impact of all the four factors by comparing the factor coefficients 2 ξ 2 65 2 63 c 6 x 10 4 p 4 x 10 4 ph 1 6 x 10 3 q 5 x 10 3 c p 3 6 x 10 3 c ph 4 x 10 3 c q 8 x 10 4 p ph 6 x 10 3 p q 4

variable that significantly influenced membrane fouling and as concentration increased the membrane fouling rate increased the other three parameters were insignificant and had negligible effect on membrane fouling rate compared to feed concentration while discussed in fig 3 that the zeta potential is affected by the ph there was a change noticed only in the 8 10 ph range at lower ph the change is negligible due to the wide range of ph in the experiment ph was not a major factor that affected the results in the model fig 14 represents the agreement between the predicted vs actual fouling and fits the model precisely as indicated by the r2 value due to only 1 major contributor to membrane fouling rate the 3d model did not change significantly by manually altering various factors as indicated in fig 15 there was no visual shift in the model by increasing and or decreasing ph and flowrate 4 6 model optimization to select the best fit model the criteria selected was to maximize permeate flux while minimizing membrane fouling to minimize the energy consumption and to increase the membrane lifetime with many operating conditions provided the selected optimum condition had the desirability of 1 00 table 5 summarizes the feed conditions to achieve optimized model all four factors had varying effect on the desirability of the optimized model figs 16 a f represent the effects of changing all variables at a given time the largest effect was noticed in fig 16d where the desirability dropped to 0 for a large amount of area under the curve at minimum ph and moderate flowrate it is indicative of the interactions between ph and flowrate and effects on the model the three model graphs for the optimized solution indicated in table 5 are given below as seen in the fig 17 a c maximum flux of 7 43 ml cm2 and minimum fouling of 0 046 mg cm2 were achieved with a desirability of 1 00 5 conclusion phosphates removal is an important part of water treatment as excess nutrients can lead to issues in the surface water contamination and pose harm to the ecosystem membrane filtration specifically nanofiltration was provided as an alternative to conventional methods of removing phosphates due to several advantages that membrane technology has over those methods however fouling is a critical issue that leads to downtimes for cleans and reduced system efficiency emf was applied to pre treat the feed and particle size analysis showed positive results with shift of the particle size to be larger that will prevent the irreversible fouling emf resulted in formation of reversible cake layer on the membrane surface that can easily be removed in situ synchrotron based micro computed tomography imaging sr μct available at the canadian light source cls was conducted to assess membrane fouling with and without emf influence across layer by layer across membrane thickness synchrotron analysis revealed the reduction of membrane internal volume fouling due to increase the particles size that retains membrane permeability increased particle size also results in less block of surface pores in addition operational parameters such as concentration pressure ph and flowrate were also investigated as it contributes to the fouling mechanism with the help of predictive models optimized operating conditions were determined to minimize membrane fouling of the nanofiltration while maximizing the flux throughput it was determined that pressure has a strong effect on the permeate flux while flowrate combined with ph can shift the permeate flux on the other hand the membrane fouling was directly proportional to feed concentration of phosphate combining the two models led to optimal operating conditions with high desirability further work is recommended to determine the application of this work in an industrial setting with varying feed contaminants and conditions along with evaluating financial feasibility of a system with emf as a pre treatment
