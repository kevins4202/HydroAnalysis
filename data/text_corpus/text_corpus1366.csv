6830,various natural and anthropogenic factors affect the formation of gleyed soil it is a major challenge to identify the key hazard factors and evaluate the dynamic evolutionary process of soil gleyization at a regional scale under future climate change this study addressed this complex challenge based on regional groundwater modelling for a typical agriculture region located in the ganjiang river delta grd of poyang lake basin china we first implemented in situ soil sampling analysis and column experiments under different water depths to examine the statistical relationship between groundwater depth gd and gleyization indexes including active reducing substance ferrous iron content and redox potential subsequently a three dimensional groundwater flow numerical model for the grd was established to evaluate the impacts of the historical average level and future climate change on vadose saturation and soil gleyization averaged over 2016 2050 in the irrigated farmland three climate change scenarios associated with carbon dioxide emission a1b a2 and b1 were predicted by the echam5 global circulation model published in ipcc assessment report 2007 the echam5 outputs were applied to quantify the variation of groundwater level and to identify the potential maximum gleyed zones affected by the changes of meteorological and hydrological conditions the results of this study indicate that gd is an indirect indicator for predicting the gradation of soil gleyization at the regional scale and that the grd will suffer considerable soil gleyization by 2050 due to fluctuations of the water table induced by future climate changes compared with the annually average condition the climate scenario b1 will probably exacerbate soil gleyization with an 8 8 increase in total gleyed area in grd on average the highly gleyed areas will increase in area by 29 7 km2 mainly on the riverside area and the medium slightly gleyed area will increase by 19 2 km2 in the middle region keywords soil gleyization groundwater depth numerical modeling climate change poyang lake 1 introduction soil gleyization is a process of soil formation due to lack of oxygen under an anaerobic environment that results in the development of a gley horizon in the soil profile this process is highly dependent on poor drainage conditions that result from land depressions with low topographic elevation continuous water recharge with water logged conditions impervious soil parent materials and lack of aeration brammer and brinkman 1977 lin et al 2007 singh and chandran 2015 the gleyed soil is oxygen poor and contains much reductive material which weakens the biological activity of soil inhibits the mineralization of organic matter restricts plant root growth and results in late maturity and low yield grain crops rowell 1988 verheye 2007 liu et al 2015 gleyed soils are widespread across the world such as in the north german plain german soil science society www dbges de burbaum et al 2016 new zealand wetlands webb and lilburne 2011 scotland brown 2017 and the middle reaches of the yangtze river china pan 1996 in the middle reaches of the yangtze river about 30 40 of total paddy soil has suffered from gleyization and its extent is undergoing dramatic changes due to global environmental changes ye et al 2011 therefore it is important to identify the key hazard factors for soil gleyization and evaluate the dynamic evolutionary process of gleyization at the regional scale in addition identification of the potential maximum gleyed zones that are likely to be affected by changes in meteorological and hydrological conditions are of great importance for regional land resource planning and management soil gleyization takes hundreds of years and is still developing due to changes in many controlling factors including climate land use and parent material climate is one of the most important factors affecting the soil saturation conditions defra 2005 karmakar et al 2016 and hence soil gleyization evaluation of the dynamic evolutionary process of gleyization at the regional scale under changing climate has posed major challenges however relatively few studies have undertaken qualitative assessments at the regional scale lai et al 1989 lin et al 2009 and quantitative analysis at the field scale schlichting and schwertmann 1973 pan 1996 pan 1996 determined the quantitative evaluation indexes of soil gleyization through principal component analysis i e active reducing substance ars cmolc kg ferrous iron content fe2 cmolc kg and redox potential eh mv in the middle reaches of the yangtze river the use of these indexes can elucidate vadose saturation conditions in the soil which result in the cut off of oxygen supply and the occurrence of reducing reactions lin et al 2009 suggested that under the necessary conditions e g depressions in the land surface water logged conditions impervious soil media and a lack of aeration groundwater level or depth is an indirect indicator for predicting soil gleyization this conclusion provides us with new directions for the study of the evolutionary tendency of gleyed soil based on establishing the relationship between groundwater depth gd and soil gleyization in which the regional variable of gd can be predicted by groundwater modelling furthermore the successful selection and implementation of engineering measures to mitigate soil gleyization of low lying and water logged reclaimed farmland will also require a sound knowledge of soil forming processes and the hydrogeological processes governing the groundwater flow system therefore in this study we attempted to establish a statistical relationship between gd and gleyization indexes based on the physical and chemical data of soil collected by field soil sampling laboratory testing and soil column experiments poyang lake is the largest freshwater lake in china its major functions include ecological security hydrological adjustment and climate regulation these are important for the jiangxi provinces and municipalities in the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river zhang et al 2014 the poyang lake basin plb is the most densely populated and economically developed area in jiangxi province and is a major rice production area for the province and more generally the nation with 19 08 of the total rice production in jiangxi li et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 as the plb lies in the low lying rainy and humid region surrounded by a complicated surface water system the surface water in the lake and rivers has a close hydraulic connection with the shallow groundwater zhan et al 2016 however the hydrological process in plb has experienced substantial changes due to natural variables and human activities and will subsequently change with future natural or man made disturbances ye et al 2011 2013 mei et al 2015 liu and wu 2016 indicated that in the past decade the plb was six times more likely to suffer droughts due to decreased inflow increased outflow reduced precipitation and increased evapotranspiration lai et al 2014 studied the impoundment effects of the three gorges dam on flow regimes which significantly reduces run off in the yangtze river during the dry season september to the next february resulting in increasing lake discharge to yangtze river thus prolonging the dry period and threatening the regional ecological environment ye et al 2011 implemented a modeling study to examine changing water levels in the poyang lake due to future climate change the results demonstrated that the changing monthly catchment inflow resulted in an increase of the lake level from february to july and a reduction from september to the next february the spatiotemporal variability of hydrologic processes in watersheds caused by climate change will change the groundwater level dynamics which further modifies the soil physical and chemical properties as well as the agronomical characteristics and affects a series of soil process hundreds of studies on surface water and groundwater interactions in plb have been conducted since the late 1990 s e g wagner et al 2016 zhan et al 2016 however to our knowledge no studies have implemented regional groundwater modeling to evaluate groundwater dynamics regimes a regional groundwater flow model will help land resource and water resource managers better understand the interrelated groundwater and surface water systems and the effects of groundwater level variation under different hydrological processes balbarini et al 2017 havril et al 2017 epting et al 2018 the objective of our study was to quantify the possible impacts of climate change on soil gleyization on a regional scale in the plb we therefore constructed a three dimensional numerical model for shallow aquifers to simulate the hydrogeological system behavior for changing boundary conditions and to quantify the dynamic evolutionary process of soil gleyization based on the resultant groundwater fluctuations the innovative aspects of this research were the exploration of the formative mechanism of soil gleyization at the regional scale by statistically analyzing the relationship between gd and gradation of soil gleyization based on soil sampling analysis and column experiments in addition the groundwater dynamics were quantified using groundwater modeling under a changing climate we believe that this study provides an important new laboratory case study furthermore the impact of groundwater dynamic patterns on the plb soil gleyization due to future climate change could be applied to other low lying deltas in the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river and other parts of the world with similar hydrogeological conditions 2 methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 description of study area poyang lake the largest freshwater lake in china is located in the middle reaches of the yangtze river with a catchment area of 162 000 km2 five tributaries run separately from the east rao river south ganjiang river fu river and xinjiang river and west xiu river into the lake through the plb and forms fluvial deltas plain around the lakeshore area the ganjiang river delta grd is the largest scale of the alluvial lacustrine low lying area in the plb was selected as the detailed evaluation area in this study we focus on the low lying agriculture catchment of grd for several reasons 1 the grd a closed and independent hydrogeologic area is already being threatened by a relatively high degree of soil gleyization in the middle reaches of the yangtze river 2 the grd is rich in agricultural resources fig 1 and intensive socioeconomic activities torbick et al 2011 and it is thus urgent at the national level to conduct scientific land resource planning and management for further climate change 3 the formative mechanism of soil gleyization in this region possess direct or indirect relation with the hydrogeological system lin et al 2009 and 4 an enormous amount of different types of hydrological and hydrogeological data conducted by geological survey geological data information network of jiangxi province http www jxgtt gov cn dzzlg index shtml national meteorological information center http www nmic cn web index htm has allowed us to establish a three dimensional groundwater model to evaluate the processes in the alluvial lacustrine groundwater system the ganjiang river is the largest river in the grd flowing north through nanchang city which is the economic and administrative center of jiangxi province as shown in fig 1 the main branch of ganjiang river is divided into the north branch middle branch and south branch before finally entering into poyang lake the study area receives about 1343 1834 mm of precipitation and loses about 1044 mm through surface evaporation per year 1960 2014 average national meteorological information center it is therefore a humid environment zhang et al 2014 in general annual precipitation consists of dense rain in the rainy season from april to august accounting for 74 of the total rainfall and a small fraction occurs from september to the following march groundwater withdrawals have increased since the 1960s by the 1990s with significant continued groundwater extraction a large cone of depression had formed in quaternary shallow aquifers beneath nanchang city in the last 10 years the local enforcement of pumping limits has restored groundwater levels by as much as 5 6 m in the most depressed area according to groundwater extraction statistics 89 7 of total groundwater extraction is dispersedly extracted for irrigation and domestic usage and 10 3 of the total amount is associated with centralized groundwater pumping in nanchang city for industrial use xiao et al 2001 the gleyization of irrigated farmland is a serious soil degradation problem in this region according to an investigation of farmland soil in the 1950s small scale primary soil gleyization began to place in the low lying lakeside areas and some cold invasive paddy fields in the surrounding hilly areas from the 1950s to the 1980s secondary gleyization of paddy soil became serious and the gleyed soil area accounted for 15 of the total area of paddy field in the grd lai et al 1989 there are three main reasons for the formation of soil gleyization in this area 1 favorable hydrogeological conditions for soil gleyization with poorly drained conditions water logged conditions and a reductive soil environment 2 land reclamation of meadow soil into paddy soil and further development of gleyed paddy soil and 3 groundwater table rise caused by regional scale water conservation measures since 1970 and regularization and networking of the river system jiangxi institute of red soil 1987 some paddy soils are in a saturated condition perennially which result in a loss of oxygen supply and the occurrence of reducing reactions in the last 10 years the process of soil gleyization has been effectively controlled as the result of agricultural management measures such as establishment of a ditch drainage network system auxiliary treatment with continuous flooding and ridge agriculture jiangxi institute of red soil 1987 shiratori et al 2007 li et al 2015 clagnan et al 2018 2 1 2 hydrogeology the grd can be considered to be a relatively independent hydrogeological unit covering 3649 km2 of the western part of the plb the regional boundaries of the study area follow the edges of poyang lake and its branches fig 2 for example the northern boundary is the xiu river the southeastern boundary is the fu river the western boundary is the ganjiang river and the eastern boundary is poyang lake principal surficial geological units within the study area include the holocene and upper pleistocene unit and the middle lower pleistocene unit both mainly made of fluvial facies alluvium and fluvial lacustrine facies alluvium in the quaternary age the holocene and upper pleistocene unit comprises two distinct sedimentary formations the upper layer of this geologic formation is the sandy silt clay mainly distributed in the surface of the fluvial deltas plain and the underlying layer is coarse sand and gravel comprising the alluvial aquifer which is the principal aquifer in the study area aquifer thickness increases from upstream to downstream in the ganjiang fu river plain locally up to thickness of 36 m the aquifer has a high productivity with a potential yield of 17 200 m3 day per well from southern xiangtang town to northern nanchang city holocene and upper pleistocene unit s in fig 2 and a moderate productivity with a yield of 3456 10 264 m3 day per well in other areas holocene and upper pleistocene unit m in fig 2 the middle lower pleistocene unit consists of red clay gravel residual slope deposit glacial clay and reticulated red clay and is distributed in the border area of the fluvial deltas plain especially in the hillock plain area e g in xinqizhou in the northern part of nanchang city this unit has a variable thickness from 3 to 15 m and a low productivity with a potential yield of 35 166 m3 day per well the older geological units are the tertiary and cretaceous red clastic rock formation underlying the alluvial aquifer and forming a no flow bottom boundary the surficial hydrogeology fig 2 was mapped by combining multiple data sets from the geological data information network of jiangxi province http www jxgtt gov cn dzzlg index shtml and the geological survey 1986 1988 conducted by the jiangxi geology mineral exploration bureau guo and chen 2008 in this region the five tributaries and poyang lake are deeply downcut with an average river bed elevation of 3 7 m and lake channel bed elevation of 4 6 m above sea level based on the 90 m strm version1 http dds cr usgs gov srtm digital elevation model dem data in addition high linear correlation coefficients rsg were determined between groundwater level and nearby surface water level based on observation data from three stages of groundwater and surface water monitoring 1986 1988 guo and chen 2008 the average rsg was 0 70 at waizhou station ganjiang river 0 69 at zajing station xiu river 0 78 at lijiadu station fu river 0 81 at wucheng station junction between ganjiang river and poyang lake and 0 77 at kangshan station interaction joint of fu river and poyang lake based on the above dem data and the dynamic relationship between surface water level and groundwater level we conclude that the channels of the ganjiang river xiu river fu river and poyang lake cut through the alluvial aquifer the area enclosed by these water bodies is an independent hydrogeological unit surrounded by specified head boundaries local bodies of surface water and their seasonal variations strongly affect the direction and magnitude of groundwater flow therefore groundwater and river water exchange seasonally groundwater flowing into rivers along the exposing aquifers in the dry and flat seasons and river water also recharging aquifers replenishing the aquifer in the wet season 2 2 measurement methods for identifying gleyization in this region the extent of soil gleyization can be broadly classified into four types highly gleyed medium gleyed slightly gleyed and ungleyed lai et al 1989 pan 1996 the main characteristics of each type are as follows 1 highly gleyed type the gley horizon covers the whole soil profile and poor drainage conditions including surface water logged soil groundwater saturated low temperature and poor ventilation of soil a large amount of toxic reducing substance in strong reduction state and extremely negative effects on plants growth 2 medium gleyed type the gley horizon exists below the plough layer a depth of 20 40 cm below the ground surface oxidation environment in the upper layer poor ventilation and reduction state in middle layer generating a large amount of toxic reducing substance and interference with plant root development 3 slightly gleyed type gley horizon declines about 60 cm below the ground surface with an increasingly deep groundwater level and well drained conditions but inundated by intermittent flooding with less effect on plant growth 4 ungleyed type the gley horizon does not exist in the soil profile oxidation environment exists throughout the whole soil layer with a much deeper groundwater level and far superior drainage conditions to explore the formative mechanism of soil gleyization and identify the impacts of gd on soil gleyization at a regional scale we first describe the principal indexes for predicting the different type of soil gleyization and then develop the measurement methods including soil sampling analysis and column experiments for testing each index for different depths to water table 2 2 1 identification indexes the formation of soil gleyization is characteristic of poorly drained conditions in the middle reaches of the yangtze river as the groundwater slowly saturates the soil the soil environment converts to a reduced state when it loses oxygen and it is acidified by effect of the organic matter in reducing conditions the iron and manganese compounds in the soil are reduced to mobilizable fe2 and mn2 depending on the existing redox potential eh which is defined as the potential between a couple of oxidation reduction electrodes measured in a galvanic cell against the standard hydrogen electrode fiedler et al 2007 the eh can be measured as an indicator of the relative abundance of oxidized and reduced substances if the groundwater level is maintained constant throughout the year reducing conditions predominate generating more ars including fe2 and mn2 and gradually forming the gleyed horizon in the soil profile it is a fundamental issue to establish an identification index system for distinguishing different types of soil gleyization soil scientists have studied the description and prediction criteria for this issue from different perspectives for some time pu et al 1994 pan 1996 liu et al 2015 pan 1996 determined the quantitative evaluation indexes of soil gleyization by principal component analysis with 13 factors in the middle reaches of yangtze river the results indicated that the cumulative variance contribution rates of three principal factors the total amount of ars cmolc kg the quantity of fe2 cmolc kg and eh mv explained 79 3 of observed differences and hence distinguishing various gleyization types these three indexes contain most of the soil information for determining the soil gleyization classification the ranges of three principle indexes for the gradation of soil gleyization are given in table 1 this indexing system in combination with ars fe2 and eh has been widely applied in the fluvial alluvial plains in the middle reaches of the yangtze river such as the four lake region chang lake san lake bailu lake and hong lake in the jianghan plain the dongting lake basin and the plb 2 2 2 in situ sampling and testing according to the geological survey groundwater monitoring and land information provided by the jiangxi institute of red soil 5 soil sampling sites s 01 s 05 have been selected and their locations are as shown in fig 2 the soil samples are collected from soil depths of 0 30 cm within the soil plough layer and 30 60 cm below the plough layer at each site once every month for a whole year as shown in the schematic diagram in fig 3 a representative soil samples were obtained using a core sampling tool and a total of 120 soil samples were collected to test the three key indexes of gleyization at different depths of the water table below the ground surface in each sample site a fully penetrating well was installed in the upper unconfined layer and gd in the well was monitored monthly at the same time with soil sampling the annual average gds at the 5 sampling sites were 0 30 50 70 and 90 cm as shown in fig 3 b the eh of the sample sites were measured in situ the measurements are actually recordings of voltage over 10 mins when a steady value was obtained between a reference electrode and a sensor electrode inserted into the soil the oxidation reduction potentiometer orion 9180bn was used to check the eh in the two layers for 3 4 times to obtain mean eh values the moist field soil was divided into two subsamples which were immediately processed by vacuum packaging and transported to the laboratory to analyze the content of ars and fe2 within 3 days reducing substances were extracted by 50 ml of 0 1 mol l al2 so4 3 solution ph 2 5 the ars in the extracts of reducing substances include fe2 and organic compounds the fe2 was determined calorimetrically by taking an aliquot of the extracts and the ars was determined by titration of an aliquot of the extract with kmno4 solution after acidification with h2so4 solution 2 2 3 laboratory experiments the experimental design includes the main device of the soil column water table control system and sampling and monitoring system a schematic diagram of the experimental equipment is shown in fig 4 the test cylinder consists of a translucent acrylic tube 120 cm in height with a 40 cm internal diameter the soil used in the column tests was undisturbed samples collected from the grd and covered with paddy straw the column was instrumented with 4 in situ testing and sampling holes l1 l2 l3 and l4 at depths of 10 30 45 and 55 cm respectively to measure the oxidation reduction potential and take soil samples the water pressure at the bottom of the gravel filter was generated using a constant head tank fed by a submersible pump from a large reservoir so the water moved upward into the soil the constant head tank was connected to a manually driven rolling wheel and was lifted to the given position over a period of about 3 days until the soil column was naturally saturated a piezometric tube was installed at the bottom of the soil column to measure the total head of the saturated soil five different water table depths with water table depths of 0 20 40 60 and 80 cm were established using control water valves so that if the water table were to move upward above the specified height internal runoff of excess water would be diverted into a collector for each water table condition eh was measured through the sampling hole and the total amount of ars and fe2 were obtained by sampling tests after the saturated soil column had settled in the laboratory for a period of 2 months at ambient room temperature in this study soil gleyization due to the variation of the water table was studied by the above in situ sampling analysis and laboratory experiments the results were then used to establish a statistical relationship between gd and the gradation of soil gleyization 2 3 groundwater modeling to quantify changes in the lakeside groundwater flow regime we established a transient three dimensional groundwater flow model based on the widely used feflow code diersch 2014 feflow enables modeling of surface water and groundwater interactions in saturated and unsaturated porous media the groundwater modeling software combines gis graphical features with finite element solution techniques 2 3 1 model setup based on stratigraphic records from 276 boreholes collected from the geological survey report by zhang 2008 the groundwater model consists of two aquifers and a bedrock basement fig 5 the upper aquifer layer 1 is an unconfined and low permeability layer comprising fine grained sediments silty clay to silty loam this layer is approximately 10 20 m thick and was largely formed from the upper pleistocene and middle lower pleistocene to current holocene the lower aquifer layer 2 is a confined aquifer composed of mostly alluvial materials sand and gravel it was mainly deposited in a fluvial setting during the holocene and upper pleistocene the thickness of this layer increases from upstream to downstream 7 16 m in general and locally up to 20 36 m the bedrock layer layer 3 represents the red clastic rock formation formed during the tertiary and cretaceous periods the bedrock was treated as a zero permeability layer as no apparent joints and fissures were found each water bearing layer layer 1 and layer 2 was divided into 7 zones fig 6 based on surficial hydrogeological mapping see above fig 2 and in situ survey parameters collected from the pumping tests report an affiliated document of investigation report on groundwater resources guo and chen 2008 a total of 110 pumping tests were conducted in 1986 1988 throughout the region jiangxi geology mineral exploration bureau 1986 1988 statistical analysis shows that the hydraulic conductivity differed significantly between layer 1 and layer 2 but did not differ significantly among different zones within each layer hence we assigned the same range of hydraulic conductivity to all the zones within each layer as initial guesses i e 0 005 5 0 m d for layer 1 and 8 150 m d for layer 2 other parameters e g porosity and specific storage ss specific yield sy required model parameters the initial parameter ranges were obtained from the geological survey by wei et al 2005 on the basis of established aquifer characteristics the actual hydrogeological parameters for different zones were optimized through model calibration as described below the model domain was bounded by poyang lake and the tributary streams fig 1 which were assigned as specified head boundary conditions see section 2 2 in comparison to river boundaries the northern to northeast boundaries were strongly affected by the size of poyang lake monthly landsat remote sensing images 2004 2016 show that the lake size changed dramatically between wet and dry seasons fig 1 hence the poyang lake boundary was assigned as a specific head boundary condition but the size and head were adjusted monthly in accordance with the monthly landsat remote sensing images 2004 2016 constant heads along the river and lake boundaries were interpolated between monitored transient water levels recorded at six gauging stations e g the northern boundary of xiu river between zajin and wucheng stations western boundary of ganjiang river between waizhou and wucheng stations southwestern boundary of fu river between lijiadu and kangshan stations the poyang lake between kangshan tangyin and wucheng stations jiangxi hydrology information center for the period 1960 2014 the top of the model was assigned as flux boundary condition to represent groundwater recharge derived from precipitation infiltration the fluxes were treated as a model calibration parameter for net recharge rate the bottom of the model was assigned as a zero permeability boundary condition as the bedrock was simulated as the bottom layer the three dimensional groundwater flow model was discretized into 34 951 triangular prismatic mesh elements with 22 262 nodes for each layer in the horizontal orientation the mesh was moderately refined along the river and lake boundaries interior stream nodes and also in the neighborhood of observation wells the lateral size of the mesh elements varied from 100 to 680 m vertically the model extended from the ground surface to 100 m below sea level the mesh was tested based on the delaunay criterion in order to avoid numerical problems the flow time step t was set at a fixed number of 5 days the convergence criterion for the groundwater flow equation was 0 001 m 2 3 2 model scenarios relevant to climate changes the objective of this modeling study was to investigate how the changing climate affects the groundwater system and the process of soil gleyization in this low lying alluvial lacustrine plain by 2050 therefore to reasonably forecast the effects we considered ongoing global climate change with different regional climate models and their consequences for future meteorological and hydrological conditions such as precipitation and surface water level popular climate models have generated different scenarios of future water level and river discharge at the catchment scale in the plb guo et al 2008 ye et al 2011 sun et al 2012 however we took the results by ye et al 2011 and li et al 2016 because they have been devoted to studying the evolution of the river lake relationship influenced by climate changes and have accumulated substantial local information for the plb for 10 years furthermore they have established a regression model to calculate the change of surface water level a key input for groundwater modeling in response to inflow variations under different climate scenarios these climate scenarios of a2 high carbon dioxide emission a1b mid range carbon dioxide emission and b1 low carbon dioxide emission were based on the global circulation model echam5 ipcc 2007 for the plb prediction for long term average changes in precipitation and hydrologic conditions have been made with the large scale distributed hydrological model watlac zhang and werner 2009 based on these three carbon dioxide emission scenarios fig 7 ye et al 2011 the results indicated that changes in the annual cycle of precipitation were mostly projected to increase in march october and decrease in november february moreover the total inflows from the catchment will increase in the wet period and decrease in the dry period under future climate conditions resulting in possible changes in water levels for the wet 0 1 1 34 m and dry 0 32 to 1 31 m seasons in the river lake system the changing meteorological and hydrological data 2016 2050 predicted by ye et al 2011 was applied as future boundary conditions in our modeling to forecast the future hydrogeological system response and in turn the process of soil gleyization using a well calibrated groundwater model 3 results and discussion 3 1 relationship between groundwater depth and gleyization 3 1 1 in situ sampling results the main indicators of ars fe2 and eh of 120 soil samples collected at the depths of 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm at the 5 sampling sites s 01 s 05 fig 2 were analyzed in the soil testing laboratory the ars and fe2 contents were plotted in a base 10 logarithmic coordinate system as shown in fig 8 a a linearly increasing correlation between ars and fe2 was obtained indicating that fe2 ions made up the major components about 89 of acting reducing substances leaving 11 of the organic compounds the ars content and eh was plotted in a linear coordinate system as shown in fig 8 b the eh decreased as the ars increased showing a descending relationship the eh represents the degree of reduction in the soil mainly because the quantity of the reduced material determines the measured mixed potential at the platinum electrode however the quantity of ars in reduced soil determines the intensity of damage to plant growth taking the s 01 series with a small variation of the eh value as an example the soil fertility will decrease as the ars content increases because of different gds in different seasons based on the test results a statistical analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between gd and the gradation of gleyization statistical results of gd corresponding to different intervals of ars fe2 and eh values table 1 were visualized in a box and whisker plot fig 9 the maximum minimum and average values along with the interquartile range of gd were also tabulated for each interval of index characterizing gleyization table 2 when ars 3 0 cmolc kg fe2 2 5 cmolc kg and eh 100 mv defined as highly gleyed soil the variation ranges of gd were all between 0 and 9 cm when 0 7 ars 3 0 cmolc kg 0 5 fe2 2 5 cmolc kg and 100 eh 300 mv defined as medium gleyed soil the variation ranges of gd are between 15 and 46 cm 17 and 47 cm and 16 and 49 cm respectively when 0 1 ars 0 7 cmolc kg 0 05 fe2 0 5 cmolc kg and 300 eh 500 mv defined as slightly gleyed soil the variation ranges of gd were between 38 and 83 cm 38 and 85 cm and 37 and 84 cm respectively when ars 0 1 cmolc kg fe2 0 05 cmolc kg and eh 500 mv defined as ungleyed soil the variation ranges of gd were between80 and 100 cm 80 and 99 cm and 78 and 102 cm respectively therefore from the viewpoint of field testing the four types of gleyed soil highly gleyed medium gleyed slightly gleyed and ungleyed are related to the gd of 10 cm 10 50 cm 50 85 cm 85 cm in grd area respectively as shown in table 3 3 1 2 laboratory experiment results the experimental results fig 10 show that under the same experimental conditions of temperature precipitation and basic physical properties of soil that as eh values increased the ars and fe2 content decreased with the lowing of the water table the degree of soil gleyization was positively associated with the groundwater level the change of gleyed indexes was quite prominent in the top soil layer l1 as the inundated condition was greatly influenced by the groundwater fluctuations however the variability of indexes of soil gleyization in deep soil layers l3 and l4 were smaller especially when the groundwater level fluctuated at the depth of 0 40 cm the laboratory experiment results indicates that the flooded conditions have a great influence on indexes of soil gleyization the saturated soil layers had larger ars and fe2 contents and smaller eh values than in layers under unsaturated conditions with gd 0 cm the average gleyization indexes represented as ars fe2 eh from here on of the 4 soil layers were 4 4 cmolc kg 3 7 cmolc kg 90 1 mv belonging to the highly gleyed soil with gd 20 cm soil layer l1 with average 2 5 cmolc kg 1 9 cmolc kg 167 6 mv belonging to the medium gleyed soil and layers l2 l4 with average 3 7 cmolc kg 3 1 cmolc kg 96 5 mv belonging to the highly gleyed soil with gd 40 cm soil layers l1 l2 with average 1 2 cmolc kg 0 8 cmolc kg 236 5 mv belonging to the medium gleyed soil and layers l3 l4 with average 3 0 cmolc kg 2 7 cmolc kg 115 3 mv belonging to the highly gleyed soil with gd 60 cm soil layers l1 l4 with average 1 3 cmolc kg 0 9 cmolc kg 385 9 mv belonging to the medium slightly gleyed soil with gd 80 cm soil layers l1 l4 with average 0 13 cmolc kg 0 07 cmolc kg 507 7 mv belonging to the slightly ungleyed soil the results of the laboratory experiment investigation of gleyed indexes verifies the relationship between gd and gradation of soil gleyization identified in the in situ sampling in this study in situ sampling and testing and laboratory experiments have their respective limitations the testing results from in situ sampling at different sampling sites ignored the effects of soil properties on soil gleyization the laboratory experiments used the same undisturbed soil samples but each soil saturated condition was established under steady state conditions with a constant water table in reality soil gleyization will be time dependent due to the fluctuations of the water table these limitations of the in situ sampling and testing and laboratory experiments may affect model predictions about future soil gleyization at smaller local scale however given the focus of this study is on the much larger regional scale these limitations are not expected to have a strong influence on the predicted patterns of future soil gleyization notwithstanding these limitations the relationship between gd and gradation of soil gleyization obtained with these two measurement methods was cross verified the relationship indicated that the groundwater depth is an indirect indicator for classifying soil gleyization in which the regional variable of gd can be predicted by groundwater modelling 3 2 model results and discussion 3 2 1 model calibration and validation the numerical model was calibrated and validated under transient conditions by trial and error procedure firstly a steady state model generated the initial conditions for the transient model secondly the measured groundwater heads of 19 observation wells from 1 1 1986 to 31 12 1986 were chosen as transient calibration targets calibration was performed by a trial and error procedure until a reasonable agreement was achieved between the simulated and measured groundwater levels fig 11 thirdly the calibrated model was validated based on whether it matched the set of field data of 11 observation wells from 1 1 2010 to 31 12 2010 which were independent of the data used for model validation we used 456 head measurements 19 wells 24 transient data per well in 1986 for model calibration which were distributed through all aquifers the median of the difference between the calculated minus measured groundwater heads was 0 12 m the median of the absolute difference was 0 43 m with a standard deviation of 0 41 m after model calibration we selected 264 transient observed data in 2010 for model validation the median of the difference and absolute difference between transient series of simulated and observed values are 0 23 m and 0 45 m with a standard deviation of 0 33 m scatter diagrams of simulated groundwater level against the observed value and the histogram of differences between simulated and observed groundwater head after transient calibration and validation are shown in fig 11 we believe these differences represent good calibration and validation results relative to maximum and minimum ground surface elevation in this area though calibration of heads of the model domain was difficult in the cone of depression in nanchang city where significant centralized groundwater extraction occurred in addition the calculated gd and corresponding soil gleyization type of the 5 soil sampling sites s 01 s 05 see fig 2 were compared with measured ones table 4 the calculated gleyization type was determined by the statistical relation to gd as described above in table 3 the calculated type for the sampling sites were consistent with the results measured in situ except for minor difference in s 03 and s 04 sites for s 03 site the measured gleyization type was defined as medium slightly gleyed compared to the calculated type of medium gleyed in flat and dry seasons the soil in s 03 site was slightly gleyed as the measured average gd was 53 7 cm 50 gd 85 cm while in wet season the soil became medium gleyed as the water table rose to the minimum gd of 38 5 cm 10 gd 50 cm the overall calibration results indicate that the applied groundwater modeling can serve as an indirect tool for evaluating the degree of soil gleyization at regional scale therefore the net recharge rate of the top layer and the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the principal aquifers that are improved i e optimized after model calibration and validation were implemented in the model assessment and prediction table 5 3 2 2 model climate scenario assessment in response to the changes of future long term average meteorological and hydrological conditions the groundwater flow will also change according to changes in the corresponding boundary conditions and source sinks the anticipated long term average surface water level and precipitation were set as specified head boundary conditions and repeated annually in the transient predictive model the constant head boundaries of poyang lake and the three perimeter rivers ganjiang river xiu river and fu river were set at the predicted values and the parameter of net recharge rate was scaled up or down corresponding to an increased or decreased ratio of precipitation for all climate scenarios for example in the scenario a2 the constant head boundaries of the poyang lake and three perimeter rivers were set with an increased surface water level between 0 29 m and 0 65 m from february to july and a reduced level between 0 15 m and 1 04 m from august to january meanwhile the recharge rate was assigned an increased value between 1 6 and 14 3 from april to july and a reduced value between 0 4 and 15 2 from august to march the hydraulic heads resulting from the calibrated three dimensional model were set as the initial condition for the transient prediction model while all the other input hydrogeological parameters remained unchanged the model was run for 34 years 2016 2050 in transient conditions the long term average groundwater levels at four observation points op1 op4 predicted using three climate scenarios were compared with results from the model based on annual averages as shown in fig 12 op1 and op2 were located close to the bank of poyang lake and ganjiang river while op3 and op4 were placed in the middle part of the study region between the watercourses respectively from the prediction results at op1 and op2 sites fig 12a b the groundwater levels of three climate scenarios were lower than the levels of annual average conditions because of the reduction in surface water levels caused by climate changes in the dry season after september the period of the maximum decline was the driest period between november and december and the maximum decline of groundwater level was 1 1 m for the scenario a1b after march the river level affected by climate change was higher than the average data and the groundwater level gradually increased by may the groundwater heads recovered to the annual average state and gradually exceeded the predicted results for the average scenario in the lakeside area the period of the maximum increase in groundwater level was the wettest period between june and july corresponding to a maximum increase of 1 2 m for the scenario b1 we also compared the predicted long term average groundwater level with the average surface water levels at a nearby gauging station as shown in fig 12a b the results highlight that both the surface water level and groundwater level showed obvious annual variation and the trends in their change were largely consistent indicating that a close hydraulic connection exists between the main watercourses and the alluvial aquifer based on the relative elevations of stream stage and the groundwater head adjacent to the stream groundwater mainly discharged to surface water bodies at the sites close to the lake and rivers while surface water recharged groundwater between june and august when surface water level rapidly increases with the increasing of inflow from upstream areas in addition the prediction results in op3 and op4 sites fig 12c d had yearly groundwater level fluctuation ranges of 0 6 and 0 3 m respectively which are much smaller than the variation range of level in the nearest river however the trend of changing groundwater level was consistent with the variation of precipitation and the increase or decline in groundwater level was coherent with changes in precipitation under the three climate scenarios compared with the annual average conditions the decline in groundwater levels of the scenarios a2 and b1 was higher than the decreasing scope of a1b and average conditions due to the decrease in precipitation caused by climate changes in the dry season after september the period of the maximum decline was the dry period between december and january and the maximum decline of groundwater level was 0 13 m for the scenario a2 after april the precipitation affected by the scenarios a2 and b1 was higher than the a1b and average data and the groundwater level was at a corresponding higher level the period of the maximum increase in groundwater level was the wet period between june and july with corresponding maximum increase of 0 1 m for the scenario b1 the prediction results for op3 and op4 sites indicate that in the middle region between river courses the groundwater level was relatively affected by changing precipitation and had a much weeker hydraulic connection with surface water the groundwater level in the aquifer increased from march and reached the peak in late june to early august then decreased from september and hit the lowest point in late december to january the highest groundwater heads of the prediction models corresponding to peaks in groundwater head fluctuations for the three climate scenarios and annual average conditions fig s1 were selected to evaluate the greatest influence level of groundwater saturation conditions on soil gleyization based on the statistical relationship between gd and the gradation of soil gleyization discussed in table 3 of section 3 1 1 the potential soil gleyization estimated with the groundwater model for all four scenarios is shown in fig 13 the alluvial area among the three branches of the ganjiang river and the area of the lower reaches of the fu river are the low lying region in the grd causing poor drainage condition with water logged conditions in impervious paddy soils that resulted in highly gleyed irrigation farmland in the wettest season from june to august during this period when the early season rice is at the reproductive phases of heading grain filling and maturity and the late season rice is at the vegetative stages of seeding development and tillering in plb the hydrogeological environment will accelerate soil gleyization and lead to the reduction of oxygen and the generation of significant reductive substances thereby widely and negatively affecting rice production liu et al 2015 for the scenario b1 highly and medium gleyed areas will increase substantially near the three branches of the ganjiang river and the lower reach of the fu river this is because of the maximum increase of surface water level and expansion of the medium slightly gleyed area in the middle region between river courses due to the maximum increase of precipitation in june july season for the scenario a1b the highly medium gleyed area will increase slightly along the three branches of ganjiang river due to a slight increase of surface water level in the wettest season in contrast for the scenario a2 medium slightly gleyed area will expand considerably in the middle region due to the large increase of precipitation in the wettest season therefore compared with annual conditions the scenario a1b will result in comparatively small impacts on soil gleyization the scenario a2 will increase 16 3 km2 of medium slightly gleyed area and the scenario b1 will exert an influence of 48 9 km2 of total gleyed area including 29 7 km2 of highly gleyed area and 19 2 km2 of medium slightly gleyed area table 6 to summarize the predicted changes of the surface water level and precipitation suggest higher potential severity in the expansion of soil gleyization in the wettest season under the climate scenario b1 although the underlying science for climate change adaption and the selection of climate scenarios are highly uncertain the variation tendency of groundwater level in the model output was consistent with that of surface water level and precipitation if more accurate and reliable climate scenarios are obtained in the future relying on different types of newly available data the corresponding groundwater level should achieve annual change trends that are consistent with the trends in meteorological and hydrological conditions thus more accurate impacts on soil gleyization could be predicted by the three dimensional groundwater model proposed in this study 4 conclusions in this study the alluvial lacustrine low lying area of the ganjiang river delta grd in the western poyang lake basin already endangered by soil gleyization was selected to investigate the effect of future climate change on the formation of gleyed farmland soil sampling analysis and column experiments were implemented to explore the formative mechanism of soil gleyization at a regional scale and to establish the statistical relationship between groundwater depth gd and the gradation of soil gleyization in the grd a three dimensional groundwater flow model was developed and calibrated to implement four model scenarios to forecast the impacts of the projected annual average condition and three climate scenarios a2 a1b and b1 on the average changes of groundwater level and the potential maximum severity of soil gleyization from 2016 to 2050 results show that the grd with depressed land surfaces water logged conditions and impervious soil medium possessed the hydrological and hydrogeological conditions favorable for soil gleyization the quantity of the active reducing substance ferrous iron content and redox potential were the three principal indexes for identification of the types of soil gleyization each index contributing to the consequence of groundwater saturation conditions in terms of gd the statistical relationship between gd and gradation of soil gleyization was established by comparing results of field soil sampling analysis and laboratory experimental results it was shown that four types of gleyed soil highly gleyed medium gleyed slightly gleyed and ungleyed were related to the gds of 10 10 50 50 85 85 cm respectively in the grd area scenario modeling results of the long term average groundwater level 2016 2050 showed annual change trends consistent with the meteorological and hydrological conditions in the riverside area a close hydraulic connection was present between the main watercourses and the alluvial aquifer whereas in the middle region between rivers the groundwater was relatively affected by changes in precipitation and had much weeker hydraulic connection with surface water for the scenario b1 low carbon dioxide emission the groundwater level was shown to increase in the riverside area of three branches of the ganjiang river and lower reaches of the fu river due to the increase of surface water level it was shown to increase in the middle region between the river courses under the increase of precipitation and accordingly gleyization of these low lying regions would intensify compared with the annual conditions highly gleyed areas increased by 29 7 km2 mainly in the riverside area and the medium slightly gleyed areas increased by 19 2 km2 in the middle region under the scenario b1 the climate scenario b1 would very likely exacerbate the soil gleyization already experienced by these reclaimed farmlands this study has contributed to identifying the impacts of gd on soil gleyization at the regional scale it has established a three dimensional groundwater flow model in the grd shallow aquifer to demonstrate the major impact of climate changes on soil gleyization it is of great importance to land resource managers to plan choices and implementation of engineering measures to mitigate soil gleyization of low lying and water logged reclaimed farmland future research should focus on the implementation of mitigation initiatives such as ditch drainage network systems and ridge agriculture in the simulation

6830,various natural and anthropogenic factors affect the formation of gleyed soil it is a major challenge to identify the key hazard factors and evaluate the dynamic evolutionary process of soil gleyization at a regional scale under future climate change this study addressed this complex challenge based on regional groundwater modelling for a typical agriculture region located in the ganjiang river delta grd of poyang lake basin china we first implemented in situ soil sampling analysis and column experiments under different water depths to examine the statistical relationship between groundwater depth gd and gleyization indexes including active reducing substance ferrous iron content and redox potential subsequently a three dimensional groundwater flow numerical model for the grd was established to evaluate the impacts of the historical average level and future climate change on vadose saturation and soil gleyization averaged over 2016 2050 in the irrigated farmland three climate change scenarios associated with carbon dioxide emission a1b a2 and b1 were predicted by the echam5 global circulation model published in ipcc assessment report 2007 the echam5 outputs were applied to quantify the variation of groundwater level and to identify the potential maximum gleyed zones affected by the changes of meteorological and hydrological conditions the results of this study indicate that gd is an indirect indicator for predicting the gradation of soil gleyization at the regional scale and that the grd will suffer considerable soil gleyization by 2050 due to fluctuations of the water table induced by future climate changes compared with the annually average condition the climate scenario b1 will probably exacerbate soil gleyization with an 8 8 increase in total gleyed area in grd on average the highly gleyed areas will increase in area by 29 7 km2 mainly on the riverside area and the medium slightly gleyed area will increase by 19 2 km2 in the middle region keywords soil gleyization groundwater depth numerical modeling climate change poyang lake 1 introduction soil gleyization is a process of soil formation due to lack of oxygen under an anaerobic environment that results in the development of a gley horizon in the soil profile this process is highly dependent on poor drainage conditions that result from land depressions with low topographic elevation continuous water recharge with water logged conditions impervious soil parent materials and lack of aeration brammer and brinkman 1977 lin et al 2007 singh and chandran 2015 the gleyed soil is oxygen poor and contains much reductive material which weakens the biological activity of soil inhibits the mineralization of organic matter restricts plant root growth and results in late maturity and low yield grain crops rowell 1988 verheye 2007 liu et al 2015 gleyed soils are widespread across the world such as in the north german plain german soil science society www dbges de burbaum et al 2016 new zealand wetlands webb and lilburne 2011 scotland brown 2017 and the middle reaches of the yangtze river china pan 1996 in the middle reaches of the yangtze river about 30 40 of total paddy soil has suffered from gleyization and its extent is undergoing dramatic changes due to global environmental changes ye et al 2011 therefore it is important to identify the key hazard factors for soil gleyization and evaluate the dynamic evolutionary process of gleyization at the regional scale in addition identification of the potential maximum gleyed zones that are likely to be affected by changes in meteorological and hydrological conditions are of great importance for regional land resource planning and management soil gleyization takes hundreds of years and is still developing due to changes in many controlling factors including climate land use and parent material climate is one of the most important factors affecting the soil saturation conditions defra 2005 karmakar et al 2016 and hence soil gleyization evaluation of the dynamic evolutionary process of gleyization at the regional scale under changing climate has posed major challenges however relatively few studies have undertaken qualitative assessments at the regional scale lai et al 1989 lin et al 2009 and quantitative analysis at the field scale schlichting and schwertmann 1973 pan 1996 pan 1996 determined the quantitative evaluation indexes of soil gleyization through principal component analysis i e active reducing substance ars cmolc kg ferrous iron content fe2 cmolc kg and redox potential eh mv in the middle reaches of the yangtze river the use of these indexes can elucidate vadose saturation conditions in the soil which result in the cut off of oxygen supply and the occurrence of reducing reactions lin et al 2009 suggested that under the necessary conditions e g depressions in the land surface water logged conditions impervious soil media and a lack of aeration groundwater level or depth is an indirect indicator for predicting soil gleyization this conclusion provides us with new directions for the study of the evolutionary tendency of gleyed soil based on establishing the relationship between groundwater depth gd and soil gleyization in which the regional variable of gd can be predicted by groundwater modelling furthermore the successful selection and implementation of engineering measures to mitigate soil gleyization of low lying and water logged reclaimed farmland will also require a sound knowledge of soil forming processes and the hydrogeological processes governing the groundwater flow system therefore in this study we attempted to establish a statistical relationship between gd and gleyization indexes based on the physical and chemical data of soil collected by field soil sampling laboratory testing and soil column experiments poyang lake is the largest freshwater lake in china its major functions include ecological security hydrological adjustment and climate regulation these are important for the jiangxi provinces and municipalities in the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river zhang et al 2014 the poyang lake basin plb is the most densely populated and economically developed area in jiangxi province and is a major rice production area for the province and more generally the nation with 19 08 of the total rice production in jiangxi li et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 as the plb lies in the low lying rainy and humid region surrounded by a complicated surface water system the surface water in the lake and rivers has a close hydraulic connection with the shallow groundwater zhan et al 2016 however the hydrological process in plb has experienced substantial changes due to natural variables and human activities and will subsequently change with future natural or man made disturbances ye et al 2011 2013 mei et al 2015 liu and wu 2016 indicated that in the past decade the plb was six times more likely to suffer droughts due to decreased inflow increased outflow reduced precipitation and increased evapotranspiration lai et al 2014 studied the impoundment effects of the three gorges dam on flow regimes which significantly reduces run off in the yangtze river during the dry season september to the next february resulting in increasing lake discharge to yangtze river thus prolonging the dry period and threatening the regional ecological environment ye et al 2011 implemented a modeling study to examine changing water levels in the poyang lake due to future climate change the results demonstrated that the changing monthly catchment inflow resulted in an increase of the lake level from february to july and a reduction from september to the next february the spatiotemporal variability of hydrologic processes in watersheds caused by climate change will change the groundwater level dynamics which further modifies the soil physical and chemical properties as well as the agronomical characteristics and affects a series of soil process hundreds of studies on surface water and groundwater interactions in plb have been conducted since the late 1990 s e g wagner et al 2016 zhan et al 2016 however to our knowledge no studies have implemented regional groundwater modeling to evaluate groundwater dynamics regimes a regional groundwater flow model will help land resource and water resource managers better understand the interrelated groundwater and surface water systems and the effects of groundwater level variation under different hydrological processes balbarini et al 2017 havril et al 2017 epting et al 2018 the objective of our study was to quantify the possible impacts of climate change on soil gleyization on a regional scale in the plb we therefore constructed a three dimensional numerical model for shallow aquifers to simulate the hydrogeological system behavior for changing boundary conditions and to quantify the dynamic evolutionary process of soil gleyization based on the resultant groundwater fluctuations the innovative aspects of this research were the exploration of the formative mechanism of soil gleyization at the regional scale by statistically analyzing the relationship between gd and gradation of soil gleyization based on soil sampling analysis and column experiments in addition the groundwater dynamics were quantified using groundwater modeling under a changing climate we believe that this study provides an important new laboratory case study furthermore the impact of groundwater dynamic patterns on the plb soil gleyization due to future climate change could be applied to other low lying deltas in the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river and other parts of the world with similar hydrogeological conditions 2 methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 description of study area poyang lake the largest freshwater lake in china is located in the middle reaches of the yangtze river with a catchment area of 162 000 km2 five tributaries run separately from the east rao river south ganjiang river fu river and xinjiang river and west xiu river into the lake through the plb and forms fluvial deltas plain around the lakeshore area the ganjiang river delta grd is the largest scale of the alluvial lacustrine low lying area in the plb was selected as the detailed evaluation area in this study we focus on the low lying agriculture catchment of grd for several reasons 1 the grd a closed and independent hydrogeologic area is already being threatened by a relatively high degree of soil gleyization in the middle reaches of the yangtze river 2 the grd is rich in agricultural resources fig 1 and intensive socioeconomic activities torbick et al 2011 and it is thus urgent at the national level to conduct scientific land resource planning and management for further climate change 3 the formative mechanism of soil gleyization in this region possess direct or indirect relation with the hydrogeological system lin et al 2009 and 4 an enormous amount of different types of hydrological and hydrogeological data conducted by geological survey geological data information network of jiangxi province http www jxgtt gov cn dzzlg index shtml national meteorological information center http www nmic cn web index htm has allowed us to establish a three dimensional groundwater model to evaluate the processes in the alluvial lacustrine groundwater system the ganjiang river is the largest river in the grd flowing north through nanchang city which is the economic and administrative center of jiangxi province as shown in fig 1 the main branch of ganjiang river is divided into the north branch middle branch and south branch before finally entering into poyang lake the study area receives about 1343 1834 mm of precipitation and loses about 1044 mm through surface evaporation per year 1960 2014 average national meteorological information center it is therefore a humid environment zhang et al 2014 in general annual precipitation consists of dense rain in the rainy season from april to august accounting for 74 of the total rainfall and a small fraction occurs from september to the following march groundwater withdrawals have increased since the 1960s by the 1990s with significant continued groundwater extraction a large cone of depression had formed in quaternary shallow aquifers beneath nanchang city in the last 10 years the local enforcement of pumping limits has restored groundwater levels by as much as 5 6 m in the most depressed area according to groundwater extraction statistics 89 7 of total groundwater extraction is dispersedly extracted for irrigation and domestic usage and 10 3 of the total amount is associated with centralized groundwater pumping in nanchang city for industrial use xiao et al 2001 the gleyization of irrigated farmland is a serious soil degradation problem in this region according to an investigation of farmland soil in the 1950s small scale primary soil gleyization began to place in the low lying lakeside areas and some cold invasive paddy fields in the surrounding hilly areas from the 1950s to the 1980s secondary gleyization of paddy soil became serious and the gleyed soil area accounted for 15 of the total area of paddy field in the grd lai et al 1989 there are three main reasons for the formation of soil gleyization in this area 1 favorable hydrogeological conditions for soil gleyization with poorly drained conditions water logged conditions and a reductive soil environment 2 land reclamation of meadow soil into paddy soil and further development of gleyed paddy soil and 3 groundwater table rise caused by regional scale water conservation measures since 1970 and regularization and networking of the river system jiangxi institute of red soil 1987 some paddy soils are in a saturated condition perennially which result in a loss of oxygen supply and the occurrence of reducing reactions in the last 10 years the process of soil gleyization has been effectively controlled as the result of agricultural management measures such as establishment of a ditch drainage network system auxiliary treatment with continuous flooding and ridge agriculture jiangxi institute of red soil 1987 shiratori et al 2007 li et al 2015 clagnan et al 2018 2 1 2 hydrogeology the grd can be considered to be a relatively independent hydrogeological unit covering 3649 km2 of the western part of the plb the regional boundaries of the study area follow the edges of poyang lake and its branches fig 2 for example the northern boundary is the xiu river the southeastern boundary is the fu river the western boundary is the ganjiang river and the eastern boundary is poyang lake principal surficial geological units within the study area include the holocene and upper pleistocene unit and the middle lower pleistocene unit both mainly made of fluvial facies alluvium and fluvial lacustrine facies alluvium in the quaternary age the holocene and upper pleistocene unit comprises two distinct sedimentary formations the upper layer of this geologic formation is the sandy silt clay mainly distributed in the surface of the fluvial deltas plain and the underlying layer is coarse sand and gravel comprising the alluvial aquifer which is the principal aquifer in the study area aquifer thickness increases from upstream to downstream in the ganjiang fu river plain locally up to thickness of 36 m the aquifer has a high productivity with a potential yield of 17 200 m3 day per well from southern xiangtang town to northern nanchang city holocene and upper pleistocene unit s in fig 2 and a moderate productivity with a yield of 3456 10 264 m3 day per well in other areas holocene and upper pleistocene unit m in fig 2 the middle lower pleistocene unit consists of red clay gravel residual slope deposit glacial clay and reticulated red clay and is distributed in the border area of the fluvial deltas plain especially in the hillock plain area e g in xinqizhou in the northern part of nanchang city this unit has a variable thickness from 3 to 15 m and a low productivity with a potential yield of 35 166 m3 day per well the older geological units are the tertiary and cretaceous red clastic rock formation underlying the alluvial aquifer and forming a no flow bottom boundary the surficial hydrogeology fig 2 was mapped by combining multiple data sets from the geological data information network of jiangxi province http www jxgtt gov cn dzzlg index shtml and the geological survey 1986 1988 conducted by the jiangxi geology mineral exploration bureau guo and chen 2008 in this region the five tributaries and poyang lake are deeply downcut with an average river bed elevation of 3 7 m and lake channel bed elevation of 4 6 m above sea level based on the 90 m strm version1 http dds cr usgs gov srtm digital elevation model dem data in addition high linear correlation coefficients rsg were determined between groundwater level and nearby surface water level based on observation data from three stages of groundwater and surface water monitoring 1986 1988 guo and chen 2008 the average rsg was 0 70 at waizhou station ganjiang river 0 69 at zajing station xiu river 0 78 at lijiadu station fu river 0 81 at wucheng station junction between ganjiang river and poyang lake and 0 77 at kangshan station interaction joint of fu river and poyang lake based on the above dem data and the dynamic relationship between surface water level and groundwater level we conclude that the channels of the ganjiang river xiu river fu river and poyang lake cut through the alluvial aquifer the area enclosed by these water bodies is an independent hydrogeological unit surrounded by specified head boundaries local bodies of surface water and their seasonal variations strongly affect the direction and magnitude of groundwater flow therefore groundwater and river water exchange seasonally groundwater flowing into rivers along the exposing aquifers in the dry and flat seasons and river water also recharging aquifers replenishing the aquifer in the wet season 2 2 measurement methods for identifying gleyization in this region the extent of soil gleyization can be broadly classified into four types highly gleyed medium gleyed slightly gleyed and ungleyed lai et al 1989 pan 1996 the main characteristics of each type are as follows 1 highly gleyed type the gley horizon covers the whole soil profile and poor drainage conditions including surface water logged soil groundwater saturated low temperature and poor ventilation of soil a large amount of toxic reducing substance in strong reduction state and extremely negative effects on plants growth 2 medium gleyed type the gley horizon exists below the plough layer a depth of 20 40 cm below the ground surface oxidation environment in the upper layer poor ventilation and reduction state in middle layer generating a large amount of toxic reducing substance and interference with plant root development 3 slightly gleyed type gley horizon declines about 60 cm below the ground surface with an increasingly deep groundwater level and well drained conditions but inundated by intermittent flooding with less effect on plant growth 4 ungleyed type the gley horizon does not exist in the soil profile oxidation environment exists throughout the whole soil layer with a much deeper groundwater level and far superior drainage conditions to explore the formative mechanism of soil gleyization and identify the impacts of gd on soil gleyization at a regional scale we first describe the principal indexes for predicting the different type of soil gleyization and then develop the measurement methods including soil sampling analysis and column experiments for testing each index for different depths to water table 2 2 1 identification indexes the formation of soil gleyization is characteristic of poorly drained conditions in the middle reaches of the yangtze river as the groundwater slowly saturates the soil the soil environment converts to a reduced state when it loses oxygen and it is acidified by effect of the organic matter in reducing conditions the iron and manganese compounds in the soil are reduced to mobilizable fe2 and mn2 depending on the existing redox potential eh which is defined as the potential between a couple of oxidation reduction electrodes measured in a galvanic cell against the standard hydrogen electrode fiedler et al 2007 the eh can be measured as an indicator of the relative abundance of oxidized and reduced substances if the groundwater level is maintained constant throughout the year reducing conditions predominate generating more ars including fe2 and mn2 and gradually forming the gleyed horizon in the soil profile it is a fundamental issue to establish an identification index system for distinguishing different types of soil gleyization soil scientists have studied the description and prediction criteria for this issue from different perspectives for some time pu et al 1994 pan 1996 liu et al 2015 pan 1996 determined the quantitative evaluation indexes of soil gleyization by principal component analysis with 13 factors in the middle reaches of yangtze river the results indicated that the cumulative variance contribution rates of three principal factors the total amount of ars cmolc kg the quantity of fe2 cmolc kg and eh mv explained 79 3 of observed differences and hence distinguishing various gleyization types these three indexes contain most of the soil information for determining the soil gleyization classification the ranges of three principle indexes for the gradation of soil gleyization are given in table 1 this indexing system in combination with ars fe2 and eh has been widely applied in the fluvial alluvial plains in the middle reaches of the yangtze river such as the four lake region chang lake san lake bailu lake and hong lake in the jianghan plain the dongting lake basin and the plb 2 2 2 in situ sampling and testing according to the geological survey groundwater monitoring and land information provided by the jiangxi institute of red soil 5 soil sampling sites s 01 s 05 have been selected and their locations are as shown in fig 2 the soil samples are collected from soil depths of 0 30 cm within the soil plough layer and 30 60 cm below the plough layer at each site once every month for a whole year as shown in the schematic diagram in fig 3 a representative soil samples were obtained using a core sampling tool and a total of 120 soil samples were collected to test the three key indexes of gleyization at different depths of the water table below the ground surface in each sample site a fully penetrating well was installed in the upper unconfined layer and gd in the well was monitored monthly at the same time with soil sampling the annual average gds at the 5 sampling sites were 0 30 50 70 and 90 cm as shown in fig 3 b the eh of the sample sites were measured in situ the measurements are actually recordings of voltage over 10 mins when a steady value was obtained between a reference electrode and a sensor electrode inserted into the soil the oxidation reduction potentiometer orion 9180bn was used to check the eh in the two layers for 3 4 times to obtain mean eh values the moist field soil was divided into two subsamples which were immediately processed by vacuum packaging and transported to the laboratory to analyze the content of ars and fe2 within 3 days reducing substances were extracted by 50 ml of 0 1 mol l al2 so4 3 solution ph 2 5 the ars in the extracts of reducing substances include fe2 and organic compounds the fe2 was determined calorimetrically by taking an aliquot of the extracts and the ars was determined by titration of an aliquot of the extract with kmno4 solution after acidification with h2so4 solution 2 2 3 laboratory experiments the experimental design includes the main device of the soil column water table control system and sampling and monitoring system a schematic diagram of the experimental equipment is shown in fig 4 the test cylinder consists of a translucent acrylic tube 120 cm in height with a 40 cm internal diameter the soil used in the column tests was undisturbed samples collected from the grd and covered with paddy straw the column was instrumented with 4 in situ testing and sampling holes l1 l2 l3 and l4 at depths of 10 30 45 and 55 cm respectively to measure the oxidation reduction potential and take soil samples the water pressure at the bottom of the gravel filter was generated using a constant head tank fed by a submersible pump from a large reservoir so the water moved upward into the soil the constant head tank was connected to a manually driven rolling wheel and was lifted to the given position over a period of about 3 days until the soil column was naturally saturated a piezometric tube was installed at the bottom of the soil column to measure the total head of the saturated soil five different water table depths with water table depths of 0 20 40 60 and 80 cm were established using control water valves so that if the water table were to move upward above the specified height internal runoff of excess water would be diverted into a collector for each water table condition eh was measured through the sampling hole and the total amount of ars and fe2 were obtained by sampling tests after the saturated soil column had settled in the laboratory for a period of 2 months at ambient room temperature in this study soil gleyization due to the variation of the water table was studied by the above in situ sampling analysis and laboratory experiments the results were then used to establish a statistical relationship between gd and the gradation of soil gleyization 2 3 groundwater modeling to quantify changes in the lakeside groundwater flow regime we established a transient three dimensional groundwater flow model based on the widely used feflow code diersch 2014 feflow enables modeling of surface water and groundwater interactions in saturated and unsaturated porous media the groundwater modeling software combines gis graphical features with finite element solution techniques 2 3 1 model setup based on stratigraphic records from 276 boreholes collected from the geological survey report by zhang 2008 the groundwater model consists of two aquifers and a bedrock basement fig 5 the upper aquifer layer 1 is an unconfined and low permeability layer comprising fine grained sediments silty clay to silty loam this layer is approximately 10 20 m thick and was largely formed from the upper pleistocene and middle lower pleistocene to current holocene the lower aquifer layer 2 is a confined aquifer composed of mostly alluvial materials sand and gravel it was mainly deposited in a fluvial setting during the holocene and upper pleistocene the thickness of this layer increases from upstream to downstream 7 16 m in general and locally up to 20 36 m the bedrock layer layer 3 represents the red clastic rock formation formed during the tertiary and cretaceous periods the bedrock was treated as a zero permeability layer as no apparent joints and fissures were found each water bearing layer layer 1 and layer 2 was divided into 7 zones fig 6 based on surficial hydrogeological mapping see above fig 2 and in situ survey parameters collected from the pumping tests report an affiliated document of investigation report on groundwater resources guo and chen 2008 a total of 110 pumping tests were conducted in 1986 1988 throughout the region jiangxi geology mineral exploration bureau 1986 1988 statistical analysis shows that the hydraulic conductivity differed significantly between layer 1 and layer 2 but did not differ significantly among different zones within each layer hence we assigned the same range of hydraulic conductivity to all the zones within each layer as initial guesses i e 0 005 5 0 m d for layer 1 and 8 150 m d for layer 2 other parameters e g porosity and specific storage ss specific yield sy required model parameters the initial parameter ranges were obtained from the geological survey by wei et al 2005 on the basis of established aquifer characteristics the actual hydrogeological parameters for different zones were optimized through model calibration as described below the model domain was bounded by poyang lake and the tributary streams fig 1 which were assigned as specified head boundary conditions see section 2 2 in comparison to river boundaries the northern to northeast boundaries were strongly affected by the size of poyang lake monthly landsat remote sensing images 2004 2016 show that the lake size changed dramatically between wet and dry seasons fig 1 hence the poyang lake boundary was assigned as a specific head boundary condition but the size and head were adjusted monthly in accordance with the monthly landsat remote sensing images 2004 2016 constant heads along the river and lake boundaries were interpolated between monitored transient water levels recorded at six gauging stations e g the northern boundary of xiu river between zajin and wucheng stations western boundary of ganjiang river between waizhou and wucheng stations southwestern boundary of fu river between lijiadu and kangshan stations the poyang lake between kangshan tangyin and wucheng stations jiangxi hydrology information center for the period 1960 2014 the top of the model was assigned as flux boundary condition to represent groundwater recharge derived from precipitation infiltration the fluxes were treated as a model calibration parameter for net recharge rate the bottom of the model was assigned as a zero permeability boundary condition as the bedrock was simulated as the bottom layer the three dimensional groundwater flow model was discretized into 34 951 triangular prismatic mesh elements with 22 262 nodes for each layer in the horizontal orientation the mesh was moderately refined along the river and lake boundaries interior stream nodes and also in the neighborhood of observation wells the lateral size of the mesh elements varied from 100 to 680 m vertically the model extended from the ground surface to 100 m below sea level the mesh was tested based on the delaunay criterion in order to avoid numerical problems the flow time step t was set at a fixed number of 5 days the convergence criterion for the groundwater flow equation was 0 001 m 2 3 2 model scenarios relevant to climate changes the objective of this modeling study was to investigate how the changing climate affects the groundwater system and the process of soil gleyization in this low lying alluvial lacustrine plain by 2050 therefore to reasonably forecast the effects we considered ongoing global climate change with different regional climate models and their consequences for future meteorological and hydrological conditions such as precipitation and surface water level popular climate models have generated different scenarios of future water level and river discharge at the catchment scale in the plb guo et al 2008 ye et al 2011 sun et al 2012 however we took the results by ye et al 2011 and li et al 2016 because they have been devoted to studying the evolution of the river lake relationship influenced by climate changes and have accumulated substantial local information for the plb for 10 years furthermore they have established a regression model to calculate the change of surface water level a key input for groundwater modeling in response to inflow variations under different climate scenarios these climate scenarios of a2 high carbon dioxide emission a1b mid range carbon dioxide emission and b1 low carbon dioxide emission were based on the global circulation model echam5 ipcc 2007 for the plb prediction for long term average changes in precipitation and hydrologic conditions have been made with the large scale distributed hydrological model watlac zhang and werner 2009 based on these three carbon dioxide emission scenarios fig 7 ye et al 2011 the results indicated that changes in the annual cycle of precipitation were mostly projected to increase in march october and decrease in november february moreover the total inflows from the catchment will increase in the wet period and decrease in the dry period under future climate conditions resulting in possible changes in water levels for the wet 0 1 1 34 m and dry 0 32 to 1 31 m seasons in the river lake system the changing meteorological and hydrological data 2016 2050 predicted by ye et al 2011 was applied as future boundary conditions in our modeling to forecast the future hydrogeological system response and in turn the process of soil gleyization using a well calibrated groundwater model 3 results and discussion 3 1 relationship between groundwater depth and gleyization 3 1 1 in situ sampling results the main indicators of ars fe2 and eh of 120 soil samples collected at the depths of 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm at the 5 sampling sites s 01 s 05 fig 2 were analyzed in the soil testing laboratory the ars and fe2 contents were plotted in a base 10 logarithmic coordinate system as shown in fig 8 a a linearly increasing correlation between ars and fe2 was obtained indicating that fe2 ions made up the major components about 89 of acting reducing substances leaving 11 of the organic compounds the ars content and eh was plotted in a linear coordinate system as shown in fig 8 b the eh decreased as the ars increased showing a descending relationship the eh represents the degree of reduction in the soil mainly because the quantity of the reduced material determines the measured mixed potential at the platinum electrode however the quantity of ars in reduced soil determines the intensity of damage to plant growth taking the s 01 series with a small variation of the eh value as an example the soil fertility will decrease as the ars content increases because of different gds in different seasons based on the test results a statistical analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between gd and the gradation of gleyization statistical results of gd corresponding to different intervals of ars fe2 and eh values table 1 were visualized in a box and whisker plot fig 9 the maximum minimum and average values along with the interquartile range of gd were also tabulated for each interval of index characterizing gleyization table 2 when ars 3 0 cmolc kg fe2 2 5 cmolc kg and eh 100 mv defined as highly gleyed soil the variation ranges of gd were all between 0 and 9 cm when 0 7 ars 3 0 cmolc kg 0 5 fe2 2 5 cmolc kg and 100 eh 300 mv defined as medium gleyed soil the variation ranges of gd are between 15 and 46 cm 17 and 47 cm and 16 and 49 cm respectively when 0 1 ars 0 7 cmolc kg 0 05 fe2 0 5 cmolc kg and 300 eh 500 mv defined as slightly gleyed soil the variation ranges of gd were between 38 and 83 cm 38 and 85 cm and 37 and 84 cm respectively when ars 0 1 cmolc kg fe2 0 05 cmolc kg and eh 500 mv defined as ungleyed soil the variation ranges of gd were between80 and 100 cm 80 and 99 cm and 78 and 102 cm respectively therefore from the viewpoint of field testing the four types of gleyed soil highly gleyed medium gleyed slightly gleyed and ungleyed are related to the gd of 10 cm 10 50 cm 50 85 cm 85 cm in grd area respectively as shown in table 3 3 1 2 laboratory experiment results the experimental results fig 10 show that under the same experimental conditions of temperature precipitation and basic physical properties of soil that as eh values increased the ars and fe2 content decreased with the lowing of the water table the degree of soil gleyization was positively associated with the groundwater level the change of gleyed indexes was quite prominent in the top soil layer l1 as the inundated condition was greatly influenced by the groundwater fluctuations however the variability of indexes of soil gleyization in deep soil layers l3 and l4 were smaller especially when the groundwater level fluctuated at the depth of 0 40 cm the laboratory experiment results indicates that the flooded conditions have a great influence on indexes of soil gleyization the saturated soil layers had larger ars and fe2 contents and smaller eh values than in layers under unsaturated conditions with gd 0 cm the average gleyization indexes represented as ars fe2 eh from here on of the 4 soil layers were 4 4 cmolc kg 3 7 cmolc kg 90 1 mv belonging to the highly gleyed soil with gd 20 cm soil layer l1 with average 2 5 cmolc kg 1 9 cmolc kg 167 6 mv belonging to the medium gleyed soil and layers l2 l4 with average 3 7 cmolc kg 3 1 cmolc kg 96 5 mv belonging to the highly gleyed soil with gd 40 cm soil layers l1 l2 with average 1 2 cmolc kg 0 8 cmolc kg 236 5 mv belonging to the medium gleyed soil and layers l3 l4 with average 3 0 cmolc kg 2 7 cmolc kg 115 3 mv belonging to the highly gleyed soil with gd 60 cm soil layers l1 l4 with average 1 3 cmolc kg 0 9 cmolc kg 385 9 mv belonging to the medium slightly gleyed soil with gd 80 cm soil layers l1 l4 with average 0 13 cmolc kg 0 07 cmolc kg 507 7 mv belonging to the slightly ungleyed soil the results of the laboratory experiment investigation of gleyed indexes verifies the relationship between gd and gradation of soil gleyization identified in the in situ sampling in this study in situ sampling and testing and laboratory experiments have their respective limitations the testing results from in situ sampling at different sampling sites ignored the effects of soil properties on soil gleyization the laboratory experiments used the same undisturbed soil samples but each soil saturated condition was established under steady state conditions with a constant water table in reality soil gleyization will be time dependent due to the fluctuations of the water table these limitations of the in situ sampling and testing and laboratory experiments may affect model predictions about future soil gleyization at smaller local scale however given the focus of this study is on the much larger regional scale these limitations are not expected to have a strong influence on the predicted patterns of future soil gleyization notwithstanding these limitations the relationship between gd and gradation of soil gleyization obtained with these two measurement methods was cross verified the relationship indicated that the groundwater depth is an indirect indicator for classifying soil gleyization in which the regional variable of gd can be predicted by groundwater modelling 3 2 model results and discussion 3 2 1 model calibration and validation the numerical model was calibrated and validated under transient conditions by trial and error procedure firstly a steady state model generated the initial conditions for the transient model secondly the measured groundwater heads of 19 observation wells from 1 1 1986 to 31 12 1986 were chosen as transient calibration targets calibration was performed by a trial and error procedure until a reasonable agreement was achieved between the simulated and measured groundwater levels fig 11 thirdly the calibrated model was validated based on whether it matched the set of field data of 11 observation wells from 1 1 2010 to 31 12 2010 which were independent of the data used for model validation we used 456 head measurements 19 wells 24 transient data per well in 1986 for model calibration which were distributed through all aquifers the median of the difference between the calculated minus measured groundwater heads was 0 12 m the median of the absolute difference was 0 43 m with a standard deviation of 0 41 m after model calibration we selected 264 transient observed data in 2010 for model validation the median of the difference and absolute difference between transient series of simulated and observed values are 0 23 m and 0 45 m with a standard deviation of 0 33 m scatter diagrams of simulated groundwater level against the observed value and the histogram of differences between simulated and observed groundwater head after transient calibration and validation are shown in fig 11 we believe these differences represent good calibration and validation results relative to maximum and minimum ground surface elevation in this area though calibration of heads of the model domain was difficult in the cone of depression in nanchang city where significant centralized groundwater extraction occurred in addition the calculated gd and corresponding soil gleyization type of the 5 soil sampling sites s 01 s 05 see fig 2 were compared with measured ones table 4 the calculated gleyization type was determined by the statistical relation to gd as described above in table 3 the calculated type for the sampling sites were consistent with the results measured in situ except for minor difference in s 03 and s 04 sites for s 03 site the measured gleyization type was defined as medium slightly gleyed compared to the calculated type of medium gleyed in flat and dry seasons the soil in s 03 site was slightly gleyed as the measured average gd was 53 7 cm 50 gd 85 cm while in wet season the soil became medium gleyed as the water table rose to the minimum gd of 38 5 cm 10 gd 50 cm the overall calibration results indicate that the applied groundwater modeling can serve as an indirect tool for evaluating the degree of soil gleyization at regional scale therefore the net recharge rate of the top layer and the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the principal aquifers that are improved i e optimized after model calibration and validation were implemented in the model assessment and prediction table 5 3 2 2 model climate scenario assessment in response to the changes of future long term average meteorological and hydrological conditions the groundwater flow will also change according to changes in the corresponding boundary conditions and source sinks the anticipated long term average surface water level and precipitation were set as specified head boundary conditions and repeated annually in the transient predictive model the constant head boundaries of poyang lake and the three perimeter rivers ganjiang river xiu river and fu river were set at the predicted values and the parameter of net recharge rate was scaled up or down corresponding to an increased or decreased ratio of precipitation for all climate scenarios for example in the scenario a2 the constant head boundaries of the poyang lake and three perimeter rivers were set with an increased surface water level between 0 29 m and 0 65 m from february to july and a reduced level between 0 15 m and 1 04 m from august to january meanwhile the recharge rate was assigned an increased value between 1 6 and 14 3 from april to july and a reduced value between 0 4 and 15 2 from august to march the hydraulic heads resulting from the calibrated three dimensional model were set as the initial condition for the transient prediction model while all the other input hydrogeological parameters remained unchanged the model was run for 34 years 2016 2050 in transient conditions the long term average groundwater levels at four observation points op1 op4 predicted using three climate scenarios were compared with results from the model based on annual averages as shown in fig 12 op1 and op2 were located close to the bank of poyang lake and ganjiang river while op3 and op4 were placed in the middle part of the study region between the watercourses respectively from the prediction results at op1 and op2 sites fig 12a b the groundwater levels of three climate scenarios were lower than the levels of annual average conditions because of the reduction in surface water levels caused by climate changes in the dry season after september the period of the maximum decline was the driest period between november and december and the maximum decline of groundwater level was 1 1 m for the scenario a1b after march the river level affected by climate change was higher than the average data and the groundwater level gradually increased by may the groundwater heads recovered to the annual average state and gradually exceeded the predicted results for the average scenario in the lakeside area the period of the maximum increase in groundwater level was the wettest period between june and july corresponding to a maximum increase of 1 2 m for the scenario b1 we also compared the predicted long term average groundwater level with the average surface water levels at a nearby gauging station as shown in fig 12a b the results highlight that both the surface water level and groundwater level showed obvious annual variation and the trends in their change were largely consistent indicating that a close hydraulic connection exists between the main watercourses and the alluvial aquifer based on the relative elevations of stream stage and the groundwater head adjacent to the stream groundwater mainly discharged to surface water bodies at the sites close to the lake and rivers while surface water recharged groundwater between june and august when surface water level rapidly increases with the increasing of inflow from upstream areas in addition the prediction results in op3 and op4 sites fig 12c d had yearly groundwater level fluctuation ranges of 0 6 and 0 3 m respectively which are much smaller than the variation range of level in the nearest river however the trend of changing groundwater level was consistent with the variation of precipitation and the increase or decline in groundwater level was coherent with changes in precipitation under the three climate scenarios compared with the annual average conditions the decline in groundwater levels of the scenarios a2 and b1 was higher than the decreasing scope of a1b and average conditions due to the decrease in precipitation caused by climate changes in the dry season after september the period of the maximum decline was the dry period between december and january and the maximum decline of groundwater level was 0 13 m for the scenario a2 after april the precipitation affected by the scenarios a2 and b1 was higher than the a1b and average data and the groundwater level was at a corresponding higher level the period of the maximum increase in groundwater level was the wet period between june and july with corresponding maximum increase of 0 1 m for the scenario b1 the prediction results for op3 and op4 sites indicate that in the middle region between river courses the groundwater level was relatively affected by changing precipitation and had a much weeker hydraulic connection with surface water the groundwater level in the aquifer increased from march and reached the peak in late june to early august then decreased from september and hit the lowest point in late december to january the highest groundwater heads of the prediction models corresponding to peaks in groundwater head fluctuations for the three climate scenarios and annual average conditions fig s1 were selected to evaluate the greatest influence level of groundwater saturation conditions on soil gleyization based on the statistical relationship between gd and the gradation of soil gleyization discussed in table 3 of section 3 1 1 the potential soil gleyization estimated with the groundwater model for all four scenarios is shown in fig 13 the alluvial area among the three branches of the ganjiang river and the area of the lower reaches of the fu river are the low lying region in the grd causing poor drainage condition with water logged conditions in impervious paddy soils that resulted in highly gleyed irrigation farmland in the wettest season from june to august during this period when the early season rice is at the reproductive phases of heading grain filling and maturity and the late season rice is at the vegetative stages of seeding development and tillering in plb the hydrogeological environment will accelerate soil gleyization and lead to the reduction of oxygen and the generation of significant reductive substances thereby widely and negatively affecting rice production liu et al 2015 for the scenario b1 highly and medium gleyed areas will increase substantially near the three branches of the ganjiang river and the lower reach of the fu river this is because of the maximum increase of surface water level and expansion of the medium slightly gleyed area in the middle region between river courses due to the maximum increase of precipitation in june july season for the scenario a1b the highly medium gleyed area will increase slightly along the three branches of ganjiang river due to a slight increase of surface water level in the wettest season in contrast for the scenario a2 medium slightly gleyed area will expand considerably in the middle region due to the large increase of precipitation in the wettest season therefore compared with annual conditions the scenario a1b will result in comparatively small impacts on soil gleyization the scenario a2 will increase 16 3 km2 of medium slightly gleyed area and the scenario b1 will exert an influence of 48 9 km2 of total gleyed area including 29 7 km2 of highly gleyed area and 19 2 km2 of medium slightly gleyed area table 6 to summarize the predicted changes of the surface water level and precipitation suggest higher potential severity in the expansion of soil gleyization in the wettest season under the climate scenario b1 although the underlying science for climate change adaption and the selection of climate scenarios are highly uncertain the variation tendency of groundwater level in the model output was consistent with that of surface water level and precipitation if more accurate and reliable climate scenarios are obtained in the future relying on different types of newly available data the corresponding groundwater level should achieve annual change trends that are consistent with the trends in meteorological and hydrological conditions thus more accurate impacts on soil gleyization could be predicted by the three dimensional groundwater model proposed in this study 4 conclusions in this study the alluvial lacustrine low lying area of the ganjiang river delta grd in the western poyang lake basin already endangered by soil gleyization was selected to investigate the effect of future climate change on the formation of gleyed farmland soil sampling analysis and column experiments were implemented to explore the formative mechanism of soil gleyization at a regional scale and to establish the statistical relationship between groundwater depth gd and the gradation of soil gleyization in the grd a three dimensional groundwater flow model was developed and calibrated to implement four model scenarios to forecast the impacts of the projected annual average condition and three climate scenarios a2 a1b and b1 on the average changes of groundwater level and the potential maximum severity of soil gleyization from 2016 to 2050 results show that the grd with depressed land surfaces water logged conditions and impervious soil medium possessed the hydrological and hydrogeological conditions favorable for soil gleyization the quantity of the active reducing substance ferrous iron content and redox potential were the three principal indexes for identification of the types of soil gleyization each index contributing to the consequence of groundwater saturation conditions in terms of gd the statistical relationship between gd and gradation of soil gleyization was established by comparing results of field soil sampling analysis and laboratory experimental results it was shown that four types of gleyed soil highly gleyed medium gleyed slightly gleyed and ungleyed were related to the gds of 10 10 50 50 85 85 cm respectively in the grd area scenario modeling results of the long term average groundwater level 2016 2050 showed annual change trends consistent with the meteorological and hydrological conditions in the riverside area a close hydraulic connection was present between the main watercourses and the alluvial aquifer whereas in the middle region between rivers the groundwater was relatively affected by changes in precipitation and had much weeker hydraulic connection with surface water for the scenario b1 low carbon dioxide emission the groundwater level was shown to increase in the riverside area of three branches of the ganjiang river and lower reaches of the fu river due to the increase of surface water level it was shown to increase in the middle region between the river courses under the increase of precipitation and accordingly gleyization of these low lying regions would intensify compared with the annual conditions highly gleyed areas increased by 29 7 km2 mainly in the riverside area and the medium slightly gleyed areas increased by 19 2 km2 in the middle region under the scenario b1 the climate scenario b1 would very likely exacerbate the soil gleyization already experienced by these reclaimed farmlands this study has contributed to identifying the impacts of gd on soil gleyization at the regional scale it has established a three dimensional groundwater flow model in the grd shallow aquifer to demonstrate the major impact of climate changes on soil gleyization it is of great importance to land resource managers to plan choices and implementation of engineering measures to mitigate soil gleyization of low lying and water logged reclaimed farmland future research should focus on the implementation of mitigation initiatives such as ditch drainage network systems and ridge agriculture in the simulation

6831,the applicability of the traditionally used overall decomposition based odb sampling technique in the development of forecasting models is controversial this study first conducts a systematic investigation of the performance of models developed using the odb sampling technique a stepwise decomposition based sdb sampling technique that is consistent with actual forecasting practice is then proposed moreover a novel calibration algorithm that couples a two stage calibration strategy with a shuffled complex evolutionary approach is formulated to help maintain the performance of models the application of models produced using these different sampling techniques to four gauging stations in china and canada indicates that 1 the odb sampling technique that employ the discrete wavelet transform dwt empirical mode decomposition emd and variational mode decomposition vmd as series decomposition techniques do not produce convincing forecasting models because additional information on the future streamflow that is to be predicted is introduced into the explanatory variables of the samples 2 the sdb sampling technique strictly excludes information on future streamflow from the explanatory variables and is thus as an appropriate alternative for developing forecasting models 3 the dwt and vmd techniques benefit models by enhancing their performance on the other hand the emd is unsuitable for use in forecasting due to the variable number of subseries that result from the implementation of the stepwise decomposition strategy finally methods that can be used to enhance the performance of decomposition based models and the prediction accuracy of nonstationary streamflow are suggested keywords streamflow forecasting series decomposition nonstationarity variational mode decomposition 1 introduction accurate streamflow forecasts are crucial to the decision making concerning water supplies flood control drought mitigation hydropower generation and navigation anghileri et al 2016 fang et al 2017 yaseen et al 2016 yu and li 2018 the last two decades have witnessed a growing interest in the development of hybrid streamflow forecasting models that couple various decomposition approaches and fitting techniques however the performance of such models in actual forecasting practice is currently in doubt du et al 2017 karthikeyan and kumar 2013 quilty and adamowski 2018 tongal and booij 2018 zhang et al 2015 inconsistent sampling processes are reported to be responsible for the decreases in performance that may occur when decomposition based models are applied in forecasting therefore it is of great significance to systematically investigate the applicability of the traditionally used sampling technique for developing decomposition based models such investigations help in exploring feasible alternatives as benchmark sampling techniques streamflow forecasting models can be categorized into process based models and data driven models peugeot et al 2003 process based or physically based models provide an idealized representation of hydrological processes by simulating the complicated interactions between meteorological land surface and subsurface components of the water cycle wang et al 2016 the other type of forecasting models data driven models capture the linear or nonlinear relationships between streamflow and its explanatory variables mathematically di et al 2014 the least squares ls autoregression ar moving average ma autoregressive moving average arma multiple linear regression mlr and stepwise cluster analysis sca as well as their variants are fitting techniques extensively employed in data driven models carlson et al 1970 cheng et al 2016 fan et al 2015 2016 noakes et al 1985 smith and stockton 1981 wang et al 2015 the development of computational intelligence ci during the past two decades has also provided powerful tools such as artificial neural networks anns support vector regression svr adaptive neural fuzzy inference systems anfiss and deep learning algorithms which are helpful in identifying the inherent nonlinearity in hydrological process allawi and el shafie 2016 choubin et al 2018 yaseen et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 no consensus has been easily achieved on which fitting approach displays consistently superior performance in streamflow forecasting over other counterparts due to the spatial heterogeneity of the relationship between streamflow and its explanatory variables valipour et al 2013 data driven models have several advantages over physically based models such as lower data requirements simpler model structures and shorter development cycles however they have long been criticized by hydrologists for a lack of physical modeling and mathematical reasoning and are merely considered computational exercises see et al 2007 time series including hydrological series are assumed to be composed of stochastic and periodic terms superimposed on overall trends salas et al 1985 numerous studies in hydrology have utilized series decomposition techniques to extract the trends and periodic oscillations that operate on multiple time scales from streamflow series which are helpful in revealing the driving forces of streamflow regimes fang et al 2018b nalley et al 2012 tosunoğlu and kaplan 2018 successful applications of decomposition techniques in the analysis of trends and periodic behavior have subsequently inspired researchers to introduce them to data driven models thus leading to the development of decomposition based models in decomposition based models streamflow series are decomposed prior to the fitting process and streamflow forecasts are obtained by aggregating the forecasts corresponding to each subseries one merit of such models is that the geophysical drivers of streamflow regimes can often be uncovered during the decomposition process a group of studies huang et al 2014 kim et al 2018 loboda et al 2006 sagarika et al 2015 wei et al 2014 have found that some geophysical phenomena mainly the large scale atmospheric circulations such as the el niño southern oscillation the pacific decadal oscillation and the atlantic multidecadal oscillation vary at the same pace with periodic components of hydrological series in many parts of the world thus deducing the possible role of relevant geophysical phenomena in driving the periodic oscillations in various hydrological variables in comparison with directly fitting the original streamflow series reduced modeling effort is required to fit individual subseries with limited bandwidth in the frequency domain which is the other advantage commonly used decomposition techniques include the discrete wavelet transform dwt empirical mode decomposition emd and singular spectrum analysis ssa previous studies on decomposition based streamflow forecasting models have made continuous efforts to employ increasingly advanced decomposition and fitting techniques to enhance the model performance however a crucial step in model development how to organize the calibration and validation samples has received insufficient attention because many decomposition based models that adopt the traditionally used overall decomposition based odb sampling technique displays superior performance in fitting streamflow records over other types of data driven models without series decomposition involved in the odb sampling technique the whole streamflow series is decomposed just once before all of the samples belonging to the calibration and validation periods are extracted from each subseries in spite of satisfactory performance of decomposition based models in fitting historical records no further study has been extended to investigating their skill in real forecasting practice a study by napolitano et al 2011 explicitly pointed out that the emd based models developed using the odb sampling technique were hindcast models instead of the forecasting ones since decomposing the overall series using emd and then sampling from each subseries mean that the explanatory variables in all of the samples are actually computed using information on future streamflow that is unavailable in the current time step zhang et al 2015 further assessed the performance of decomposition based modeling techniques such as emd arma emd ann dwt arma and dwt ann models in hindcasting and forecasting experiments these models were found to display noticeably inferior performance in forecasting experiments relative to hindcasting experiments and a conclusion was drawn that emd or dwt based models were unsuitable to forecast streamflow one month ahead at the study sites latest studies on this topic du et al 2017 quilty and adamowski 2018 also revealed that hybrid models based on the dwt and ssa may cause incorrect high prediction performance and cannot properly be used to deal with real world forecasting problems a modified forecasting framework was proposed by quilty and adamowski 2018 to overcome the limitations of many earlier wavelet based models moreover similar conclusions were presented by wang and wu 2016 who undertook forecasting studies on solar irradiation and wind speed they emphasized that the traditionally used sampling technique assumes that future data are known during the decomposition procedure thus emd based models do not perform effectively in practical cases the current study systematically assesses the applicability of various sampling techniques in data driven forecasting models that utilize three different decomposition approaches as streamflow preprocessing tools these decomposition approaches include the extensively used emd and dwt techniques and a novel alternative variational mode decomposition vmd the detailed objectives are to 1 investigate whether the odb sampling technique is applicable in the development of forecasting models for the practical use as well as the underlying reasons 2 explore the use of an appropriate alternative as a benchmark sampling technique for decomposition based models 3 further analyze the role of series decomposition in enhancing model skill through comparisons with non decomposition based models the results of this study may have important implications for developing decomposition based models with convincing forecasting skill 2 methods the method section presents three decomposition approaches that are used to extract trends and periodic and stochastic components from streamflow series followed by three types of sampling techniques and a novel algorithm for calibrating fitting techniques 2 1 an overview of decomposition based models developing decomposition based forecasting models follows the decomposition prediction aggregation principle which is depicted in fig 1 unlike many previous studies attempting to improve model skill using increasingly sophisticated decomposition and fitting techniques this study places more emphasis on looking for a feasible sampling technique among three alternatives for the use in decomposition based models 2 2 three decomposition methods changes in climate and intensified human activity have resulted in nonstationary streamflow observed over large parts of the world more computational efforts are likely required in the process of modeling the nonstationary streamflow the dwt and emd two widely used preprocessing techniques have positive effects on streamflow modeling in view of their ability to decompose both stationary and nonstationary time series into collections of simpler components these simpler components can be modeled more easily than the original series karthikeyan and kumar 2013 in essence the dwt and emd are analogous to filter banks which recursively sift high frequency components from residual series until a specified stopping criterion is satisfied and finally treat the residual series obtained in the last iteration as the trend term in addition the vmd is introduced to determine whether the investigated sampling techniques are generally applicable to the development of forecasting models coupled with different types of decomposition methods vmd is an emerging technique used for decomposing time series at multiple resolution levels shi et al 2019 unlike the emd and dwt vmd addresses series decomposition problem in an optimization framework through concurrently searching for an ensemble of intrinsic mode functions imfs that can optimally reconstruct the original time series in a least squares sense and are sparsely distributed in the frequency domain the appendix part presents a brief description of the emd and dwt more details of these decomposition techniques can be found in mallat 1989 huang et al 1998 and dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 the decomposition outcomes of the dwt are sensitive to the selection of the mother wavelet and the decomposition level however scientific support for the optimal determination of these two influential factors in hydrological applications is still lacking in practice many studies greedily test numerous combinations of mother wavelets and decomposition levels the optimal combination is then chosen through evaluating the performance of the corresponding forecasting models this task is quite labor intensive in contrast the emd does not require the selection of an appropriate mother wavelet and the number of subseries solely depends on the sifting process instead of the specified decomposition level these features are the key advantages of the emd over the dwt for the vmd algorithm two parameters namely the decomposition level k and the penalty parameter for balancing the data fidelity constraint α need to be predetermined upadhyay and pachori 2015 α is inversely proportional to the bandwidths of the imfs meaning that smaller values of α produce imfs having broader bandwidths and vice versa k controls how much information regarding the original time series can be provided by imfs overestimates of k will likely result in mode duplication or frequency mixing in which at least one center frequency is overlapped by several imfs conversely if k is underestimated one or more modes may be shared by the neighboring imfs when α is small or discarded when α is large in this study numerous combinations of α and k are tested to address the parametric uncertainty of the vmd 2 3 overall decomposition based odb sampling technique fig 2 intuitively depicts the foundational differences among the three sampling techniques which lie in how long a given series needs to be decomposed during the extraction of individual samples the following three subsections provide detailed descriptions of the three sampling techniques the traditionally used odb sampling technique which has been utilized by a large number of studies to develop dwt based and emd based forecasting models can be explained as follows 1 the entire streamflow record is decomposed into individual subseries using the dwt emd or vmd 2 for each subseries the correlation between past observations and the response variables is measured using linear and nonlinear correlation analysis as shown in fig 3 the past observations that have significant correlations with the response variables are taken as the explanatory variables and all of the samples for the calibration and validation periods are extracted 3 an appropriate fitting method is selected to fit the samples extracted from each subseries parameters of the fitting method that govern the model size and generalization ability are tuned the calibration processes aim to produce robust forecasting models that simultaneously present satisfactory performance in both the calibration and validation periods 4 send the explanatory variables to the forecasting model to generate forecasts of the response variables corresponding to the individual subseries finally the forecasts of the response variables across all of the subseries are aggregated to obtain the streamflow forecast 2 4 karthikeyan nagesh kn sampling technique future streamflow is undeniably unknown at the forecasting stage as a result a stepwise decomposition strategy has to be adopted in order to predict streamflow over time in actual forecasting as illustrated in fig 4 however in the odb sampling technique the overall streamflow series is decomposed only once before all of the samples are extracted which is obviously based on the assumption that in each time step the future streamflow is already known therefore significant concern exists as to whether the explanatory variables of the samples obtained using the odb sampling technique contain additional information on the future streamflow to be predicted relative to their counterparts obtained using stepwise decomposition to address the forecasting risk that may arise from the unequal amount of information contained in the explanatory variables karthikeyan and kumar 2013 modified the odb sampling technique by employing a sampling method in the validation period that imitates the actual forecasting practice the kn sampling technique depicted in fig 2 b is formulated as follows 1 a streamflow series is split into two parts that are used for model calibration and validation respectively 2 the entire calibration series is decomposed to extract the explanatory variables of all of the samples in the calibration period to acquire the samples in the validation period each streamflow record in the validation period is appended to the calibration series sequentially note that after each extension of the series the extended series is decomposed to extract the explanatory variables for only one sample this appending decomposing sampling operation is repeated until all of the streamflow records in the validation period have been successively appended to the calibration series for the modeling targets the response variables in both the calibration and validation periods are acquired by simply decomposing the entire streamflow series the remaining two steps of the kn sampling technique are the same as those of the odb sampling technique the first two steps explicitly indicate that kn sampling technique separately imitates the odb sampling technique and actual forecasting practice in generating samples for the calibration and validation periods hence forecasting models developed using the kn sampling technique provide a practical means of examining whether knowing future streamflow to be predicted before the series decomposition is performed will introduce additional information into the explanatory variables of the samples if model overfitting is observed it will be reasonable to deduce that the explanatory variables obtained using the odb sampling technique carry a significantly different amount of information relative to their counterparts obtained through the stepwise decomposition strategy the use of such models in actual forecasting practice will generate streamflow forecasts with unknown accuracy 2 5 stepwise decomposition based sdb sampling technique to help forecasting models keep consistent performance throughout the calibration period validation period and actual forecasting practices this study proposes an sdb sampling technique which thoroughly follows the stepwise decomposition strategy to extract all calibration and validation samples the sdb sampling technique depicted in fig 2 c is further elaborated as follows assume s to be streamflow records with a length of n the m past observations lagging behind the streamflow to be forecasted serve as candidate explanatory variables 1 series decomposition and sample extraction the parameters and stopping criterion of the decomposition method the dwt emd or vmd are configured to acquire explanatory variables of the first sample which are used to predict s m 1 the series segment s 1 s m is decomposed to obtain k subseries the last m elements of each subseries are extracted as potential explanatory variables of subsamples 1 1 1 2 1 k to obtain explanatory variables of the second sample which are used to forecast s m 2 the observed streamflow s m 1 is appended to s 1 s m and the extended series segment s 1 s m 1 is decomposed the last m elements of each subseries are extracted to constitute potential explanatory variables of subsamples 2 1 2 2 2 k the series segment is gradually extended by appending the newly observed streamflow values one by one and then the corresponding samples are extracted for the last sample the sample n m used to fit s n the series segment s 1 s n 1 is decomposed and the potential explanatory variables of subsamples n m 1 n m 2 n m k are extracted the response variables of all samples are obtained by decomposing the overall streamflow records s all of the samples are split to make up the calibration and validation datasets 2 input variable selection ivs ivs also challenges the development of forecasting models may et al 2011 because numerous fitting methods are rooted in multiple regression theory it can be expected that well calibrated fitting methods will assign large weights to inputs that are relevant to the response variables while giving nearly zero weights to the irrelevant inputs therefore the ivs task is incorporated into model calibration in this study meaningful explanatory variables can be identified from the candidate pool by inspecting weights attached to them 3 model calibration model calibration is conducted using a newly proposed tsc sce algorithm that integrates a two stage calibration strategy and the shuffled complex evolution method the tsc sce algorithm is presented in the next subsection note that a total of k models corresponding to each subseries should be trained the future streamflow of interest is acquired through the aggregation of the response variables of the k models 4 model selection to further address the model uncertainties arising from the configuration of the decomposition methods numerous combinations of the decomposition levels and other influential factors are tested by repeating steps 1 3 therefore this step is quite computationally demanding finally the model that yields the maximum value of the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse is selected as the optimal model for use in actual forecasting in comparison with the odb sampling technique the sdb sampling technique produces explanatory variables of all of the samples completely depending on decomposing past observations lagging behind the streamflow to be forecasted as a result information on future streamflow can be strictly excluded from the explanatory variables 2 6 tsc sce algorithm for calibrating support vector regression svr many previous studies have reported the favorable generalization ability of the support vector regression svr chen et al 2010 chiogna et al 2018 fang et al 2018a mehr et al 2018 therefore the svr is employed to identify the relationships between explanatory and response variables in the obtained samples based on the principle of structural risk minimization rather than the principle of empirical risk minimization used by anns the svr models nonlinear relationships within a linear framework with the help of appropriate kernel functions more details of the svr are available in chang and lin 2011 the generalization ability of svr largely depends on the regularization parameter c the error tolerance coefficient ε and the kernel parameter γ which deserve to be carefully tuned herein a tsc sce algorithm that joins a two stage calibration strategy with a shuffled complex evolution approach sce ua is proposed to calibrate svr to help the models maintain consistent skill the novel calibration algorithm is formulated as follows 1 the sce ua is a global optimization method that was proposed by duan et al 1992 and has been proven to be effective in calibrating process based models in hydrology kwon et al 2011 the use of the sce ua for the svr calibration is intended to find out the globally optimal combination of c γ ε within a three dimensional parameter space 2 a two stage calibration strategy to prevent forecasting models from overfitting samples the two stage calibration strategy divides the calibration period into two parts namely the calibration and testing subperiods for a parameter combination c γ ε to be evaluated an svr trained using samples derived from the calibration subperiod is applied to the testing subperiod prior to the validation period the modified fitness function as described in the eq 1 characterizes the fitness of a parameter combination with a smaller nse value in the calibration and testing subperiods eventually the parameter combination with the maximum fitness is considered to be the optimal one 1 max c γ ε min nse cal nse tes compared with evaluating the fitness of model parameter combinations merely based on the performance during the calibration period the two stage strategy is obviously a more conservative alternative for model calibration such efforts help the forecasting models to maintain the consistent in sample and out of sample performance 2 7 performance evaluation criteria this study follows a general guideline proposed by moriasi et al 2007 to evaluate the goodness of fit of developed models the guideline recommends the use of the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse the percent bias pbias and the ratio of the rmse to the standard deviation of the observations rsr for model evaluation in this framework different types of forecasting biases are standardized benefiting the model performance assessment across different watersheds the nse is formulated as the eq 2 2 nse 1 i 1 n q i obs q i for 2 i 1 n q i obs q obs 2 where n is the total number of observations in the streamflow records q obs denotes the mean of all observations and q i obs and q i for represent the i th observation and forecast value of streamflow respectively as is shown by the eq 3 the pbias measures the tendency of forecast values to be smaller or larger than that of the observed values 3 pbias i 1 n q i obs q i for 100 i 1 n q i obs the rsr in the eq 4 standardizes the rmse between the forecast and observed values depending on the standard deviation of the observed values this metric ranges from its optimal value of zero to positive infinity 4 rsr rmse stdev obs i 1 n q i obs q i for 2 i 1 n q i obs q obs 2 3 study area and data the wei river basin china and the athabasca river basin canada are employed as study areas 3 1 an overview of the wei river and athabasca river basins the wei river stems from the niaoshu mountains in gansu province and drains into the yellow river meng et al 2018 as shown in fig 5 a the wei river flows 818 km across the loess plateau and annually transfers 6 09 million tons of sediment to the yellow river by its mean annual discharge of 10 04 billion m3 liu et al 2019a the wei river basin wrb 33 40 37 26 n 103 57 110 27 e covers an area of 134 800 km2 and has sub humid and semi arid climates huang et al 2017 up to 6 billion m3 of runoff and groundwater are withdrawn annually within the wrb for the agricultural irrigation industrial production and domestic use liu et al 2019b therefore developing robust streamflow forecasting techniques is crucial to making sound decisions in the water resource allocation and supporting sustainable economic growth in the wrb the athabasca river which originates from the columbia glacier in the rocky mountains is an undammed river in alberta canada as shown in fig 5 b the athabasca river runs 1538 km from the southwest to the northeast and eventually drains into lake athabasca the athabasca river basin arb 52 58 n 119 107 w covers an area of 159 000 km2 cheng et al 2017 and produces a mean annual runoff of 20 86 billion m3 in 2005 the withdrawal of surface and groundwater was estimated to be 850 million m3 68 of which was utilized for the exploitation of the oil sand deposits in the lower reach of the basin note that the arb is less subject to the influence of human activities than the wrb 3 2 data streamflow records of four gauging stations in the wrb and arb are employed to develop decomposition based models for implementing the one month ahead rolling forecasting hydrological stations within the wrb are the huanxian zhuangjiashan and zhuangtou stations in situ monthly streamflow observations during the period from january 1960 to december 2010 were acquired from the hydrology and water resource survey bureau of shaanxi province huang et al 2016 meantime monthly streamflow records at the fort mcmurray station station number 07da001 within the arb covering the analysis period 1965 1995 were retrieved from the water survey of canada https wateroffice ec gc ca the stationarity of the streamflow series is evaluated using a heuristic segmentation algorithm which can identify significant variations in the local means of time series based on a student s test bernaola galván et al 2001 the results indicate that the annual streamflow records from the huaxian zhangjiashan and zhuangtou stations present noticeable changes in 1991 1994 and 1994 respectively whereas no significant change point of the annual streamflow is detected at the fort mcmurray meaning that the streamflow keeps stationary at this site streamflow records are first divided into calibration and validation periods to prevent the models from overfitting the calibration period is further split into the calibration and testing subperiods according to a two stage calibration strategy as shown in table 1 4 results analysis 4 1 comparative analysis of different parameter optimization techniques in this study the sce ua a global optimization algorithm is employed to tune the three influential parameters of svr to determine whether the sce ua is capable of identifying the optimal parameter combination for use in the svr a comparative analysis is conducted among four kinds of parameter optimization techniques which include a grid search gs a genetic algorithm ga particle swarm optimization pso and sce ua as in previous studies the three influential parameters of the svr c γ and ε are set to vary from 2 10 2 10 2 8 to 2 10 2 10 2 1 respectively in gs the step size of the exponent is specified to be 0 5 parameters of the sce ua are configured by following duan et al 1994 which are summarized in table 2 note that lags up to 12 months serve as potential explanatory variables of the response variables and the forecasting model to be tuned is a naïve svr model that does not include any series decomposition the four parameter optimization techniques compete with each other to maximize the smaller nse value in the calibration and testing subperiods which is formulated in the eq 1 the resulting values of the other evaluation criteria such as the pbias and the rsr are also listed in table 3 the results shown in table 3 indicate that models calibrated by the gs and sce ua invariably have larger nse values in the calibration and testing subperiods compared with their counterparts calibrated using the ga and pso obviously the parameter combinations c γ ε obtained using the ga and pso get stuck in local optima which is a primary drawback observed in various evolutionary algorithms therefore the gs and sce ua benefit the improved model performance throughout the calibration subperiod the testing subperiod and the validation period relative to ga and pso theoretically the gs is the most promising solution for identifying globally optimal parameter combinations for svr as long as the step size can be infinitely small on the other hand the elapsed time shows that exhaustive searches even using a coarse grid is time consuming in contrast the sce ua presents almost the same performance as the gs and require the least computational effort as a result the sce ua can be used as an effective and efficient parameter tuning technique to calibrate models developed in the study note that the naïve svr models calibrated using the sce ua act as benchmark models for comparison purposes in the following subsections 4 2 applicability of the odb sampling technique for developing decomposition based models this subsection investigates whether the odb sampling technique can be used to develop decomposition based models for use in actual forecasting the emd the dwt and vmd are three decomposition methods that are used to preprocess streamflow series for the emd the use of different stopping criteria may result in quite dissimilar decomposition outcomes tabrizi et al 2014 this study adopts the cauchy type convergence criterion sd 0 01 with respect to the dwt the daubechies 5 db5 mother wavelet used by karthikeyan and kumar 2013 is chosen as the basis function and decomposition levels changing from 3 to 12 are tested for the vmd a gs is conducted to determine the optimal values of the decomposition level k and penalty parameter α k and α are set to vary from 3 100 to 12 3000 with step sizes of 1 and 100 respectively model calibration is undertaken using the proposed tsc sce algorithm 4 2 1 model performance gap between hindcasting and forecasting exercises the model performance presented in tables 4 6 and figs 6 8 can be used to assess the applicability of the odb sampling technique for developing decomposition based forecasting models tables 4 and 5 and fig 6 display values of the three evaluation indices obtained from the models developed using the odb sampling technique the emd svr models underperform the naïve svr models during the validation period at three of the four gauging stations additionally the presence of overfitting suggests that the emd svr models have unstable performance previous studies by huang et al 2014 and zhang et al 2016 represented some attempt to improve the performance of the emd svr models by removing the highest frequency or stochastic component during the modeling process table 5 indicates that the dwt svr models display consistently superior performance throughout the calibration subperiod the testing subperiod and the validation period with the nse values in the validation period all exceeding 0 9 at all four stations as the decomposition level varies from 3 to 12 fig 6 indicates that the vmd svr models display desirable performance that is similar to that of their dwt svr counterparts and no overfitting is observed the encouraging results presented above appear to demonstrate that the dwt svr and vmd svr models developed using the odb sampling technique can be implemented in actual forecasting and that their forecasting skill will be analogous to the model performance in the validation period however the odb sampling technique decomposes the whole series only once before all of the samples are extracted thus the sample extraction assumes that at every time step the future streamflow is already known in forecasting practice no such assumption can be made because information on future streamflow is not available therefore clarification as to whether knowing the future streamflow to be forecasted prior to performing series decomposition introduces additional information into the explanatory variables in comparison to their counterparts obtained in actual forecasting practice is urgently needed such investigation is crucial to determining whether models developed using the odb sampling technique are applicable to forecasting in practice table 6 and figs 7 and 8 exhibit the values of the three evaluation indices obtained from the models developed using the kn sampling technique the difference between the odb and kn sampling techniques shown clearly in fig 2 is that in the validation period the latter technique adopts the stepwise decomposition strategy to extract samples which is in line with forecasting practice in the stepwise decomposition strategy the decomposition has to be repeatedly performed after newly obtained observations are sequentially appended to the streamflow series to acquire the explanatory variables used to forecast the streamflow in the next time step however for the emd the number of imfs is determined by the sifting progress rather than a specified decomposition level fig 7 displays an upward trend in the number of imfs k along an increase in the series length n at the four gauging stations the relationship between k and n can be roughly concluded as k log 2 n 1 napolitano et al 2011 suggesting that more imfs are expected to be generated by the emd as new observations are gradually appended to streamflow series in decomposition based models each sub model corresponds only to an imf once a new imf emerges not enough sub models can be used to model all of imfs and the model fails to forecast streamflow in the next time step as a result it can be deduced that the emd is inapplicable to actual forecasting practice which utilizes the stepwise decomposition strategy to acquire explanatory variables due to the use of different decomposition strategies in the calibration and validation periods the kn sampling technique provides a practical tool for examining whether the explanatory variables of samples separately obtained using the odb sampling technique and actual forecasting practice contain equivalent amounts of information as to the dwt svr and vmd svr models developed using the kn sampling technique table 6 and fig 8 indicate the noticeable model performance gap therefore it can be deduced from the model overfitting that the odb sampling technique which assumes that future streamflow is known prior to carrying out series decomposition introduces additional information into the explanatory variables of the samples in comparison actual forecasting exercises generate explanatory variables that only contain information on past streamflow records once the explanatory variables contain information on the future streamflow to be predicted the fitting process becomes the hindcasting process as a result the favorable values of the evaluation indices in the validation period presented in table 5 and fig 6 indicate that the dwt svr and vmd svr models developed using the odb sampling technique have superior hindcasting performance on the other hand their inferior forecasting performance is reflected by the undesirable values of the evaluation indices during the validation period shown in table 6 and fig 8 the noticeable model performance gap between the hindcasting and forecasting exercises presented above has also been explicitly reported by du et al 2017 and quilty and adamowski 2018 in their attempt to utilize the wavelet based hybrid models to address the real world forecasting problems therefore when the emd dwt and vmd are utilized as series decomposition tools the odb sampling technique is not able to develop convincing models for forecasting applications 4 2 2 underlying reasons for the observed performance gap the preceding text notes the failure of the odb sampling technique in developing convincing forecasting models it lies in that decomposing the overall series through the emd dwt and vmd generates samples whose explanatory variables simultaneously contain information on streamflow records and future streamflow to be forecasted hence models calibrated using such samples are bound to present noticeable performance gaps when used to forecast out of sample streamflow data whose explanatory variables come only from streamflow records and carry relatively less information the following discussion provides further explanation as to why the odb sampling technique tends to introduce additional information on future streamflow into explanatory variables from the perspective of the details of the decomposition methods 1 boundary distortion as is shown by eqs a 1 a 2 the convolution operation of a time series and a highpass lowpass filter is a crucial step in the dwt however decomposition errors can easily arise due to the incomplete convolution at both ends of the series for the emd decomposition errors arise because it is difficult to determine whether or not the values at the left and right endpoints should be treated as local extrema when using spline interpolation to form the upper and lower envelops of the series as the decomposition level increases decomposition errors will spread from the ends of the series towards its center finally resulting in unsatisfactory decomposition outcomes this issue which commonly appears in the dwt and emd is known as boundary distortion 2 series extension to reduce boundary distortion series must be extended at both ends various extension methods are available including symmetric extension anti symmetric extension and simple constant extrapolation for more details please refer to deng et al 2001 and karthikeyan and kumar 2013 fig 9 a illustrates that in the dwt left and right extension of a series helps achieve complete convolution near both ends of the original series and the values in the extension series also penetrate into the resulting convolution series c thus subseries evolving from the convolution series inevitably carry information on the left and right extensions of the series with regard to the emd as shown in fig 9 b the series extension helps to better identify the local extrema near the ends of the original series and the trend information on the extension series also penetrates into the upper and lower envelops this outcome causes the resulting subseries to carry information on the left and right extension series as well in forecasting exercises that adopt the stepwise decomposition strategy only past streamflow records can be used to extend the streamflow series at both ends because no observations of future streamflow are available and therefore the generated explanatory variables only contain information on the past records fig 10 depicts the reexamination of the odb sampling technique from the perspective of stepwise decomposition the right end of the series segment s 1 s m 1 is extended by s m s n which is the future streamflow for the time step t m 1 thus the explanatory variables of sub sample m 1 to m k used to forecast streamflow at the time step t m contain additional information on future streamflow in strong contrast to the emd and dwt the vmd addresses series decomposition in an optimization framework as a result the reason why the odb sampling technique that employs the vmd as a series decomposition tool tends to incorporate information on future streamflow into the explanatory variables is still unclear and deserves further investigation 4 3 applicability of the sdb sampling technique for developing decomposition based models the analysis above indicates that the odb and kn sampling techniques cannot be used to develop convincing models for forecasting use this subsection explores the applicability of the sdb sampling technique in the sdb sampling technique all of the samples are extracted by following the stepwise decomposition strategy accordingly the emd cannot be employed as a series decomposition tool for the reason stated in the section 4 2 1 in table 7 and fig 11 the dwt svr and vmd svr models are observed to maintain nearly consistent performance throughout the calibration and testing subperiods and the validation period the slight performance gap between the calibration and validation periods is likely to be caused by changes in the streamflow regime once streamflow displays nonstationarity resulting from changes in the streamflow regime models even those that reproduce historical records well are likely to produce inferior forecasts of future streamflow in this study efforts like a two stage calibration strategy have been made to control the potential overfitting by achieving a tradeoff in performance between the calibration and test subperiods the two stage calibration strategy prepares models to gradually adapt to changing flow regimes therefore the results shown in table 7 and fig 11 indicate that the sdb sampling technique represents an alternative method that can be used to develop forecasting models with convincing performance 4 4 contributions of series decomposition to more accurate streamflow forecasts numerous dwt svr and vmd svr models in table 7 and fig 11 have been developed using the sdb sampling technique due to the lack of reliable support for determining the optimal parameter combinations for use in the dwt and vmd the models that have the maximum values of the nse in the validation period are selected out as the optimal models this subsection conducts a comparison between these optimal decomposition based models and the benchmark the naïve svr model in order to investigate the role of decomposition techniques in enhancing model performance table 8 indicates that the decomposition based models display better performance than the naïve svr model in detail the dwt svr model outperforms the naïve svr model during the validation period at two of the four gauging stations in terms of the nse and the rsr the vmd svr model performs better than the naïve svr model at three of the four stations with respect to the nse and the rsr fig 12 shows that the dwt svr and vmd svr models generally produce higher forecasts in comparison with the naïve svr model suggesting that the dwt svr and vmd svr models can more accurately capture the high flow therefore decomposition techniques such as the dwt and vmd can play positive roles in improving model performance in addition among the different study sites the models display more desirable performance characteristics at the fort mcmurray station this result may occur because the annual streamflow series measured at the fort mcmurray station keep stationary from 1965 to 1995 whereas those of the huaixan zhangjiashan and zhuangtou stations present obvious nonstationary behavior from 1960 to 2010 for a stationarity analysis of these streamflow series refer to the section 3 2 hence it is reasonable to deduce that the nonstationarity of streamflow is likely to act as a major barrier to the achievement of favorable model performance even though series decomposition techniques have been introduced 5 discussion 5 1 a crucial step in developing decomposition based forecasting models sample consistency checking the section 4 2 indicates that the traditionally used the odb sampling technique that employs the dwt emd and vmd as decomposition tools are not suitable for the development of forecasting models because information on future streamflow which ought to be forecast is introduced into the explanatory variables of samples models calibrated using such samples will have unknown forecasting accuracy and harmful decisions may be made based on unreliable forecasts of streamflow therefore if the odb sampling technique coupled with other decomposition techniques is used in the model development checking the consistency of the samples is an indispensable step in ensuring that the explanatory variables in the calibration samples and those obtained from actual forecasting practice carry the equivalent amount of past information and information on future streamflow is strictly excluded the kn sampling technique can be used as an effective tool for this purpose because its samples in the calibration period are acquired using the odb sampling technique whereas those in the validation period are obtained using a stepwise decomposition strategy that is also employed in actual forecasting practice as a result the inconsistency of samples can be found as long as the noticeable performance gap or overfitting is observed between calibration and validation periods 5 2 two suggestions for enhancing the performance of models developed using the sdb sampling technique the sections 4 3 and 4 4 show that models developed using the sdb sampling technique display better performance than the naïve svr model nevertheless it is also observed that the performance of these models needs to be further enhanced if the predictability of each subseries is carefully inspected some useful suggestions may be made table 9 indicates the performance of the optimal vmd svr and dwt svr models for each subseries the performance is characterized by the nse in the validation period and all of the subseries are listed in sequence from low to high frequency interestingly the lowest frequency subseries or trend component has nearly the worst predictability in the vmd svr models in contrast the highest frequency subseries or stochastic component is invariably associated with the worst prediction accuracy in the dwt svr models modeling stochastic components precisely is a great challenge in many fields however to improve the predictability of the trend component in the vmd svr models the following measures may be considered trend removal given that the trend component obtained by the vmd is hard to predict some classical trend removal methods may be used prior to performing series decomposition with the vmd removing the tendency of a series is intended to identify the trend component and result in improved predictability denoising under the sdb sampling technique the stepwise decomposition strategy is adopted to extract all of the samples fig 13 compares in the time domain the trend components acquired using stepwise decomposition and overall decomposition respectively the invasion of higher frequency oscillations into the trend component generated by the stepwise decomposition is found higher frequency oscillations can reduce the predictability of the trend component therefore denoising using a lowpass filter may have a positive effect by smoothing the trend component thus improving the modeling accuracy 5 3 towards more accurate forecasts of nonstationary streamflow apart from the forecasting models used unsatisfactory forecasting accuracy can be partly attributed to the nonstationarity of streamflow which results from the changes in streamflow regime that occur in some study areas therefore it is reasonable to further include the various drivers responsible for the changing streamflow regimes such as the land cover changes and global climate indices as additional model inputs identifying exogenous inputs involves addressing complex interactions between numerous potential explanatory variables and response variables and requires support from knowledge of hydrological systems and sophisticated ivs techniques which deserve to be investigated in future studies 6 conclusions in this study the traditionally used odb sampling technique is systematically investigated because recent studies have cast doubt on their applicability in developing decomposition based models with convincing forecasting skill the sdb sampling technique is proposed as a modified alternative in this modified sampling technique a stepwise decomposition strategy is adopted to extract all of the samples which is in line with actual forecasting practice in addition a novel calibration algorithm that couples a two stage calibration strategy and the sce ua is formulated to help the models maintain consistent in sample and out of sample performance models developed using the odb kn and sdb sampling techniques are applied to implement one month ahead streamflow forecasting at four gauging stations in china and canada the results indicate that the odb sampling technique that employs the dwt emd and vmd as series decomposition techniques cannot produce convincing models for forecasting use because the odb sampling technique assumes that future streamflow is known and introduce additional information on future streamflow into the explanatory variables of the samples in contrast the sdb sampling technique which strictly excludes information on future streamflow from the explanatory variables is an appropriate alternative for developing convincing forecasting models moreover the dwt and vmd can play positive roles in enhancing model performance whereas the emd is unsuitable for use in forecasting given the variable number of subseries that are generated during the application of the stepwise decomposition strategy these findings could benefit model developers in adopting appropriate sampling techniques that yield models with convincing skill the inapplicability of the odb sampling technique provides a reminder that the details of series decomposition techniques should receive more attention if these sampling techniques are used to develop data driven models as in the emd and dwt an unremarkable operation may cause the explanatory variables of calibration samples to carry an amount of information that is inconsistent with that of the explanatory variables acquired in real forecasting practice resulting in noticeable overfitting or forecasting risk therefore checking sample consistency is an indispensable step in model development and the kn sampling technique can serve as an effective tool for such purposes additionally given decomposition based models also developed for the precipitation and air temperature forecasting the proposed sdb sampling technique may benefit deriving the convincing forecasts of other hydrological variables in addition to the streamflow specifically investigated in this study acknowledgments this study was joint funded by the national key research and

6831,the applicability of the traditionally used overall decomposition based odb sampling technique in the development of forecasting models is controversial this study first conducts a systematic investigation of the performance of models developed using the odb sampling technique a stepwise decomposition based sdb sampling technique that is consistent with actual forecasting practice is then proposed moreover a novel calibration algorithm that couples a two stage calibration strategy with a shuffled complex evolutionary approach is formulated to help maintain the performance of models the application of models produced using these different sampling techniques to four gauging stations in china and canada indicates that 1 the odb sampling technique that employ the discrete wavelet transform dwt empirical mode decomposition emd and variational mode decomposition vmd as series decomposition techniques do not produce convincing forecasting models because additional information on the future streamflow that is to be predicted is introduced into the explanatory variables of the samples 2 the sdb sampling technique strictly excludes information on future streamflow from the explanatory variables and is thus as an appropriate alternative for developing forecasting models 3 the dwt and vmd techniques benefit models by enhancing their performance on the other hand the emd is unsuitable for use in forecasting due to the variable number of subseries that result from the implementation of the stepwise decomposition strategy finally methods that can be used to enhance the performance of decomposition based models and the prediction accuracy of nonstationary streamflow are suggested keywords streamflow forecasting series decomposition nonstationarity variational mode decomposition 1 introduction accurate streamflow forecasts are crucial to the decision making concerning water supplies flood control drought mitigation hydropower generation and navigation anghileri et al 2016 fang et al 2017 yaseen et al 2016 yu and li 2018 the last two decades have witnessed a growing interest in the development of hybrid streamflow forecasting models that couple various decomposition approaches and fitting techniques however the performance of such models in actual forecasting practice is currently in doubt du et al 2017 karthikeyan and kumar 2013 quilty and adamowski 2018 tongal and booij 2018 zhang et al 2015 inconsistent sampling processes are reported to be responsible for the decreases in performance that may occur when decomposition based models are applied in forecasting therefore it is of great significance to systematically investigate the applicability of the traditionally used sampling technique for developing decomposition based models such investigations help in exploring feasible alternatives as benchmark sampling techniques streamflow forecasting models can be categorized into process based models and data driven models peugeot et al 2003 process based or physically based models provide an idealized representation of hydrological processes by simulating the complicated interactions between meteorological land surface and subsurface components of the water cycle wang et al 2016 the other type of forecasting models data driven models capture the linear or nonlinear relationships between streamflow and its explanatory variables mathematically di et al 2014 the least squares ls autoregression ar moving average ma autoregressive moving average arma multiple linear regression mlr and stepwise cluster analysis sca as well as their variants are fitting techniques extensively employed in data driven models carlson et al 1970 cheng et al 2016 fan et al 2015 2016 noakes et al 1985 smith and stockton 1981 wang et al 2015 the development of computational intelligence ci during the past two decades has also provided powerful tools such as artificial neural networks anns support vector regression svr adaptive neural fuzzy inference systems anfiss and deep learning algorithms which are helpful in identifying the inherent nonlinearity in hydrological process allawi and el shafie 2016 choubin et al 2018 yaseen et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 no consensus has been easily achieved on which fitting approach displays consistently superior performance in streamflow forecasting over other counterparts due to the spatial heterogeneity of the relationship between streamflow and its explanatory variables valipour et al 2013 data driven models have several advantages over physically based models such as lower data requirements simpler model structures and shorter development cycles however they have long been criticized by hydrologists for a lack of physical modeling and mathematical reasoning and are merely considered computational exercises see et al 2007 time series including hydrological series are assumed to be composed of stochastic and periodic terms superimposed on overall trends salas et al 1985 numerous studies in hydrology have utilized series decomposition techniques to extract the trends and periodic oscillations that operate on multiple time scales from streamflow series which are helpful in revealing the driving forces of streamflow regimes fang et al 2018b nalley et al 2012 tosunoğlu and kaplan 2018 successful applications of decomposition techniques in the analysis of trends and periodic behavior have subsequently inspired researchers to introduce them to data driven models thus leading to the development of decomposition based models in decomposition based models streamflow series are decomposed prior to the fitting process and streamflow forecasts are obtained by aggregating the forecasts corresponding to each subseries one merit of such models is that the geophysical drivers of streamflow regimes can often be uncovered during the decomposition process a group of studies huang et al 2014 kim et al 2018 loboda et al 2006 sagarika et al 2015 wei et al 2014 have found that some geophysical phenomena mainly the large scale atmospheric circulations such as the el niño southern oscillation the pacific decadal oscillation and the atlantic multidecadal oscillation vary at the same pace with periodic components of hydrological series in many parts of the world thus deducing the possible role of relevant geophysical phenomena in driving the periodic oscillations in various hydrological variables in comparison with directly fitting the original streamflow series reduced modeling effort is required to fit individual subseries with limited bandwidth in the frequency domain which is the other advantage commonly used decomposition techniques include the discrete wavelet transform dwt empirical mode decomposition emd and singular spectrum analysis ssa previous studies on decomposition based streamflow forecasting models have made continuous efforts to employ increasingly advanced decomposition and fitting techniques to enhance the model performance however a crucial step in model development how to organize the calibration and validation samples has received insufficient attention because many decomposition based models that adopt the traditionally used overall decomposition based odb sampling technique displays superior performance in fitting streamflow records over other types of data driven models without series decomposition involved in the odb sampling technique the whole streamflow series is decomposed just once before all of the samples belonging to the calibration and validation periods are extracted from each subseries in spite of satisfactory performance of decomposition based models in fitting historical records no further study has been extended to investigating their skill in real forecasting practice a study by napolitano et al 2011 explicitly pointed out that the emd based models developed using the odb sampling technique were hindcast models instead of the forecasting ones since decomposing the overall series using emd and then sampling from each subseries mean that the explanatory variables in all of the samples are actually computed using information on future streamflow that is unavailable in the current time step zhang et al 2015 further assessed the performance of decomposition based modeling techniques such as emd arma emd ann dwt arma and dwt ann models in hindcasting and forecasting experiments these models were found to display noticeably inferior performance in forecasting experiments relative to hindcasting experiments and a conclusion was drawn that emd or dwt based models were unsuitable to forecast streamflow one month ahead at the study sites latest studies on this topic du et al 2017 quilty and adamowski 2018 also revealed that hybrid models based on the dwt and ssa may cause incorrect high prediction performance and cannot properly be used to deal with real world forecasting problems a modified forecasting framework was proposed by quilty and adamowski 2018 to overcome the limitations of many earlier wavelet based models moreover similar conclusions were presented by wang and wu 2016 who undertook forecasting studies on solar irradiation and wind speed they emphasized that the traditionally used sampling technique assumes that future data are known during the decomposition procedure thus emd based models do not perform effectively in practical cases the current study systematically assesses the applicability of various sampling techniques in data driven forecasting models that utilize three different decomposition approaches as streamflow preprocessing tools these decomposition approaches include the extensively used emd and dwt techniques and a novel alternative variational mode decomposition vmd the detailed objectives are to 1 investigate whether the odb sampling technique is applicable in the development of forecasting models for the practical use as well as the underlying reasons 2 explore the use of an appropriate alternative as a benchmark sampling technique for decomposition based models 3 further analyze the role of series decomposition in enhancing model skill through comparisons with non decomposition based models the results of this study may have important implications for developing decomposition based models with convincing forecasting skill 2 methods the method section presents three decomposition approaches that are used to extract trends and periodic and stochastic components from streamflow series followed by three types of sampling techniques and a novel algorithm for calibrating fitting techniques 2 1 an overview of decomposition based models developing decomposition based forecasting models follows the decomposition prediction aggregation principle which is depicted in fig 1 unlike many previous studies attempting to improve model skill using increasingly sophisticated decomposition and fitting techniques this study places more emphasis on looking for a feasible sampling technique among three alternatives for the use in decomposition based models 2 2 three decomposition methods changes in climate and intensified human activity have resulted in nonstationary streamflow observed over large parts of the world more computational efforts are likely required in the process of modeling the nonstationary streamflow the dwt and emd two widely used preprocessing techniques have positive effects on streamflow modeling in view of their ability to decompose both stationary and nonstationary time series into collections of simpler components these simpler components can be modeled more easily than the original series karthikeyan and kumar 2013 in essence the dwt and emd are analogous to filter banks which recursively sift high frequency components from residual series until a specified stopping criterion is satisfied and finally treat the residual series obtained in the last iteration as the trend term in addition the vmd is introduced to determine whether the investigated sampling techniques are generally applicable to the development of forecasting models coupled with different types of decomposition methods vmd is an emerging technique used for decomposing time series at multiple resolution levels shi et al 2019 unlike the emd and dwt vmd addresses series decomposition problem in an optimization framework through concurrently searching for an ensemble of intrinsic mode functions imfs that can optimally reconstruct the original time series in a least squares sense and are sparsely distributed in the frequency domain the appendix part presents a brief description of the emd and dwt more details of these decomposition techniques can be found in mallat 1989 huang et al 1998 and dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 the decomposition outcomes of the dwt are sensitive to the selection of the mother wavelet and the decomposition level however scientific support for the optimal determination of these two influential factors in hydrological applications is still lacking in practice many studies greedily test numerous combinations of mother wavelets and decomposition levels the optimal combination is then chosen through evaluating the performance of the corresponding forecasting models this task is quite labor intensive in contrast the emd does not require the selection of an appropriate mother wavelet and the number of subseries solely depends on the sifting process instead of the specified decomposition level these features are the key advantages of the emd over the dwt for the vmd algorithm two parameters namely the decomposition level k and the penalty parameter for balancing the data fidelity constraint α need to be predetermined upadhyay and pachori 2015 α is inversely proportional to the bandwidths of the imfs meaning that smaller values of α produce imfs having broader bandwidths and vice versa k controls how much information regarding the original time series can be provided by imfs overestimates of k will likely result in mode duplication or frequency mixing in which at least one center frequency is overlapped by several imfs conversely if k is underestimated one or more modes may be shared by the neighboring imfs when α is small or discarded when α is large in this study numerous combinations of α and k are tested to address the parametric uncertainty of the vmd 2 3 overall decomposition based odb sampling technique fig 2 intuitively depicts the foundational differences among the three sampling techniques which lie in how long a given series needs to be decomposed during the extraction of individual samples the following three subsections provide detailed descriptions of the three sampling techniques the traditionally used odb sampling technique which has been utilized by a large number of studies to develop dwt based and emd based forecasting models can be explained as follows 1 the entire streamflow record is decomposed into individual subseries using the dwt emd or vmd 2 for each subseries the correlation between past observations and the response variables is measured using linear and nonlinear correlation analysis as shown in fig 3 the past observations that have significant correlations with the response variables are taken as the explanatory variables and all of the samples for the calibration and validation periods are extracted 3 an appropriate fitting method is selected to fit the samples extracted from each subseries parameters of the fitting method that govern the model size and generalization ability are tuned the calibration processes aim to produce robust forecasting models that simultaneously present satisfactory performance in both the calibration and validation periods 4 send the explanatory variables to the forecasting model to generate forecasts of the response variables corresponding to the individual subseries finally the forecasts of the response variables across all of the subseries are aggregated to obtain the streamflow forecast 2 4 karthikeyan nagesh kn sampling technique future streamflow is undeniably unknown at the forecasting stage as a result a stepwise decomposition strategy has to be adopted in order to predict streamflow over time in actual forecasting as illustrated in fig 4 however in the odb sampling technique the overall streamflow series is decomposed only once before all of the samples are extracted which is obviously based on the assumption that in each time step the future streamflow is already known therefore significant concern exists as to whether the explanatory variables of the samples obtained using the odb sampling technique contain additional information on the future streamflow to be predicted relative to their counterparts obtained using stepwise decomposition to address the forecasting risk that may arise from the unequal amount of information contained in the explanatory variables karthikeyan and kumar 2013 modified the odb sampling technique by employing a sampling method in the validation period that imitates the actual forecasting practice the kn sampling technique depicted in fig 2 b is formulated as follows 1 a streamflow series is split into two parts that are used for model calibration and validation respectively 2 the entire calibration series is decomposed to extract the explanatory variables of all of the samples in the calibration period to acquire the samples in the validation period each streamflow record in the validation period is appended to the calibration series sequentially note that after each extension of the series the extended series is decomposed to extract the explanatory variables for only one sample this appending decomposing sampling operation is repeated until all of the streamflow records in the validation period have been successively appended to the calibration series for the modeling targets the response variables in both the calibration and validation periods are acquired by simply decomposing the entire streamflow series the remaining two steps of the kn sampling technique are the same as those of the odb sampling technique the first two steps explicitly indicate that kn sampling technique separately imitates the odb sampling technique and actual forecasting practice in generating samples for the calibration and validation periods hence forecasting models developed using the kn sampling technique provide a practical means of examining whether knowing future streamflow to be predicted before the series decomposition is performed will introduce additional information into the explanatory variables of the samples if model overfitting is observed it will be reasonable to deduce that the explanatory variables obtained using the odb sampling technique carry a significantly different amount of information relative to their counterparts obtained through the stepwise decomposition strategy the use of such models in actual forecasting practice will generate streamflow forecasts with unknown accuracy 2 5 stepwise decomposition based sdb sampling technique to help forecasting models keep consistent performance throughout the calibration period validation period and actual forecasting practices this study proposes an sdb sampling technique which thoroughly follows the stepwise decomposition strategy to extract all calibration and validation samples the sdb sampling technique depicted in fig 2 c is further elaborated as follows assume s to be streamflow records with a length of n the m past observations lagging behind the streamflow to be forecasted serve as candidate explanatory variables 1 series decomposition and sample extraction the parameters and stopping criterion of the decomposition method the dwt emd or vmd are configured to acquire explanatory variables of the first sample which are used to predict s m 1 the series segment s 1 s m is decomposed to obtain k subseries the last m elements of each subseries are extracted as potential explanatory variables of subsamples 1 1 1 2 1 k to obtain explanatory variables of the second sample which are used to forecast s m 2 the observed streamflow s m 1 is appended to s 1 s m and the extended series segment s 1 s m 1 is decomposed the last m elements of each subseries are extracted to constitute potential explanatory variables of subsamples 2 1 2 2 2 k the series segment is gradually extended by appending the newly observed streamflow values one by one and then the corresponding samples are extracted for the last sample the sample n m used to fit s n the series segment s 1 s n 1 is decomposed and the potential explanatory variables of subsamples n m 1 n m 2 n m k are extracted the response variables of all samples are obtained by decomposing the overall streamflow records s all of the samples are split to make up the calibration and validation datasets 2 input variable selection ivs ivs also challenges the development of forecasting models may et al 2011 because numerous fitting methods are rooted in multiple regression theory it can be expected that well calibrated fitting methods will assign large weights to inputs that are relevant to the response variables while giving nearly zero weights to the irrelevant inputs therefore the ivs task is incorporated into model calibration in this study meaningful explanatory variables can be identified from the candidate pool by inspecting weights attached to them 3 model calibration model calibration is conducted using a newly proposed tsc sce algorithm that integrates a two stage calibration strategy and the shuffled complex evolution method the tsc sce algorithm is presented in the next subsection note that a total of k models corresponding to each subseries should be trained the future streamflow of interest is acquired through the aggregation of the response variables of the k models 4 model selection to further address the model uncertainties arising from the configuration of the decomposition methods numerous combinations of the decomposition levels and other influential factors are tested by repeating steps 1 3 therefore this step is quite computationally demanding finally the model that yields the maximum value of the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse is selected as the optimal model for use in actual forecasting in comparison with the odb sampling technique the sdb sampling technique produces explanatory variables of all of the samples completely depending on decomposing past observations lagging behind the streamflow to be forecasted as a result information on future streamflow can be strictly excluded from the explanatory variables 2 6 tsc sce algorithm for calibrating support vector regression svr many previous studies have reported the favorable generalization ability of the support vector regression svr chen et al 2010 chiogna et al 2018 fang et al 2018a mehr et al 2018 therefore the svr is employed to identify the relationships between explanatory and response variables in the obtained samples based on the principle of structural risk minimization rather than the principle of empirical risk minimization used by anns the svr models nonlinear relationships within a linear framework with the help of appropriate kernel functions more details of the svr are available in chang and lin 2011 the generalization ability of svr largely depends on the regularization parameter c the error tolerance coefficient ε and the kernel parameter γ which deserve to be carefully tuned herein a tsc sce algorithm that joins a two stage calibration strategy with a shuffled complex evolution approach sce ua is proposed to calibrate svr to help the models maintain consistent skill the novel calibration algorithm is formulated as follows 1 the sce ua is a global optimization method that was proposed by duan et al 1992 and has been proven to be effective in calibrating process based models in hydrology kwon et al 2011 the use of the sce ua for the svr calibration is intended to find out the globally optimal combination of c γ ε within a three dimensional parameter space 2 a two stage calibration strategy to prevent forecasting models from overfitting samples the two stage calibration strategy divides the calibration period into two parts namely the calibration and testing subperiods for a parameter combination c γ ε to be evaluated an svr trained using samples derived from the calibration subperiod is applied to the testing subperiod prior to the validation period the modified fitness function as described in the eq 1 characterizes the fitness of a parameter combination with a smaller nse value in the calibration and testing subperiods eventually the parameter combination with the maximum fitness is considered to be the optimal one 1 max c γ ε min nse cal nse tes compared with evaluating the fitness of model parameter combinations merely based on the performance during the calibration period the two stage strategy is obviously a more conservative alternative for model calibration such efforts help the forecasting models to maintain the consistent in sample and out of sample performance 2 7 performance evaluation criteria this study follows a general guideline proposed by moriasi et al 2007 to evaluate the goodness of fit of developed models the guideline recommends the use of the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse the percent bias pbias and the ratio of the rmse to the standard deviation of the observations rsr for model evaluation in this framework different types of forecasting biases are standardized benefiting the model performance assessment across different watersheds the nse is formulated as the eq 2 2 nse 1 i 1 n q i obs q i for 2 i 1 n q i obs q obs 2 where n is the total number of observations in the streamflow records q obs denotes the mean of all observations and q i obs and q i for represent the i th observation and forecast value of streamflow respectively as is shown by the eq 3 the pbias measures the tendency of forecast values to be smaller or larger than that of the observed values 3 pbias i 1 n q i obs q i for 100 i 1 n q i obs the rsr in the eq 4 standardizes the rmse between the forecast and observed values depending on the standard deviation of the observed values this metric ranges from its optimal value of zero to positive infinity 4 rsr rmse stdev obs i 1 n q i obs q i for 2 i 1 n q i obs q obs 2 3 study area and data the wei river basin china and the athabasca river basin canada are employed as study areas 3 1 an overview of the wei river and athabasca river basins the wei river stems from the niaoshu mountains in gansu province and drains into the yellow river meng et al 2018 as shown in fig 5 a the wei river flows 818 km across the loess plateau and annually transfers 6 09 million tons of sediment to the yellow river by its mean annual discharge of 10 04 billion m3 liu et al 2019a the wei river basin wrb 33 40 37 26 n 103 57 110 27 e covers an area of 134 800 km2 and has sub humid and semi arid climates huang et al 2017 up to 6 billion m3 of runoff and groundwater are withdrawn annually within the wrb for the agricultural irrigation industrial production and domestic use liu et al 2019b therefore developing robust streamflow forecasting techniques is crucial to making sound decisions in the water resource allocation and supporting sustainable economic growth in the wrb the athabasca river which originates from the columbia glacier in the rocky mountains is an undammed river in alberta canada as shown in fig 5 b the athabasca river runs 1538 km from the southwest to the northeast and eventually drains into lake athabasca the athabasca river basin arb 52 58 n 119 107 w covers an area of 159 000 km2 cheng et al 2017 and produces a mean annual runoff of 20 86 billion m3 in 2005 the withdrawal of surface and groundwater was estimated to be 850 million m3 68 of which was utilized for the exploitation of the oil sand deposits in the lower reach of the basin note that the arb is less subject to the influence of human activities than the wrb 3 2 data streamflow records of four gauging stations in the wrb and arb are employed to develop decomposition based models for implementing the one month ahead rolling forecasting hydrological stations within the wrb are the huanxian zhuangjiashan and zhuangtou stations in situ monthly streamflow observations during the period from january 1960 to december 2010 were acquired from the hydrology and water resource survey bureau of shaanxi province huang et al 2016 meantime monthly streamflow records at the fort mcmurray station station number 07da001 within the arb covering the analysis period 1965 1995 were retrieved from the water survey of canada https wateroffice ec gc ca the stationarity of the streamflow series is evaluated using a heuristic segmentation algorithm which can identify significant variations in the local means of time series based on a student s test bernaola galván et al 2001 the results indicate that the annual streamflow records from the huaxian zhangjiashan and zhuangtou stations present noticeable changes in 1991 1994 and 1994 respectively whereas no significant change point of the annual streamflow is detected at the fort mcmurray meaning that the streamflow keeps stationary at this site streamflow records are first divided into calibration and validation periods to prevent the models from overfitting the calibration period is further split into the calibration and testing subperiods according to a two stage calibration strategy as shown in table 1 4 results analysis 4 1 comparative analysis of different parameter optimization techniques in this study the sce ua a global optimization algorithm is employed to tune the three influential parameters of svr to determine whether the sce ua is capable of identifying the optimal parameter combination for use in the svr a comparative analysis is conducted among four kinds of parameter optimization techniques which include a grid search gs a genetic algorithm ga particle swarm optimization pso and sce ua as in previous studies the three influential parameters of the svr c γ and ε are set to vary from 2 10 2 10 2 8 to 2 10 2 10 2 1 respectively in gs the step size of the exponent is specified to be 0 5 parameters of the sce ua are configured by following duan et al 1994 which are summarized in table 2 note that lags up to 12 months serve as potential explanatory variables of the response variables and the forecasting model to be tuned is a naïve svr model that does not include any series decomposition the four parameter optimization techniques compete with each other to maximize the smaller nse value in the calibration and testing subperiods which is formulated in the eq 1 the resulting values of the other evaluation criteria such as the pbias and the rsr are also listed in table 3 the results shown in table 3 indicate that models calibrated by the gs and sce ua invariably have larger nse values in the calibration and testing subperiods compared with their counterparts calibrated using the ga and pso obviously the parameter combinations c γ ε obtained using the ga and pso get stuck in local optima which is a primary drawback observed in various evolutionary algorithms therefore the gs and sce ua benefit the improved model performance throughout the calibration subperiod the testing subperiod and the validation period relative to ga and pso theoretically the gs is the most promising solution for identifying globally optimal parameter combinations for svr as long as the step size can be infinitely small on the other hand the elapsed time shows that exhaustive searches even using a coarse grid is time consuming in contrast the sce ua presents almost the same performance as the gs and require the least computational effort as a result the sce ua can be used as an effective and efficient parameter tuning technique to calibrate models developed in the study note that the naïve svr models calibrated using the sce ua act as benchmark models for comparison purposes in the following subsections 4 2 applicability of the odb sampling technique for developing decomposition based models this subsection investigates whether the odb sampling technique can be used to develop decomposition based models for use in actual forecasting the emd the dwt and vmd are three decomposition methods that are used to preprocess streamflow series for the emd the use of different stopping criteria may result in quite dissimilar decomposition outcomes tabrizi et al 2014 this study adopts the cauchy type convergence criterion sd 0 01 with respect to the dwt the daubechies 5 db5 mother wavelet used by karthikeyan and kumar 2013 is chosen as the basis function and decomposition levels changing from 3 to 12 are tested for the vmd a gs is conducted to determine the optimal values of the decomposition level k and penalty parameter α k and α are set to vary from 3 100 to 12 3000 with step sizes of 1 and 100 respectively model calibration is undertaken using the proposed tsc sce algorithm 4 2 1 model performance gap between hindcasting and forecasting exercises the model performance presented in tables 4 6 and figs 6 8 can be used to assess the applicability of the odb sampling technique for developing decomposition based forecasting models tables 4 and 5 and fig 6 display values of the three evaluation indices obtained from the models developed using the odb sampling technique the emd svr models underperform the naïve svr models during the validation period at three of the four gauging stations additionally the presence of overfitting suggests that the emd svr models have unstable performance previous studies by huang et al 2014 and zhang et al 2016 represented some attempt to improve the performance of the emd svr models by removing the highest frequency or stochastic component during the modeling process table 5 indicates that the dwt svr models display consistently superior performance throughout the calibration subperiod the testing subperiod and the validation period with the nse values in the validation period all exceeding 0 9 at all four stations as the decomposition level varies from 3 to 12 fig 6 indicates that the vmd svr models display desirable performance that is similar to that of their dwt svr counterparts and no overfitting is observed the encouraging results presented above appear to demonstrate that the dwt svr and vmd svr models developed using the odb sampling technique can be implemented in actual forecasting and that their forecasting skill will be analogous to the model performance in the validation period however the odb sampling technique decomposes the whole series only once before all of the samples are extracted thus the sample extraction assumes that at every time step the future streamflow is already known in forecasting practice no such assumption can be made because information on future streamflow is not available therefore clarification as to whether knowing the future streamflow to be forecasted prior to performing series decomposition introduces additional information into the explanatory variables in comparison to their counterparts obtained in actual forecasting practice is urgently needed such investigation is crucial to determining whether models developed using the odb sampling technique are applicable to forecasting in practice table 6 and figs 7 and 8 exhibit the values of the three evaluation indices obtained from the models developed using the kn sampling technique the difference between the odb and kn sampling techniques shown clearly in fig 2 is that in the validation period the latter technique adopts the stepwise decomposition strategy to extract samples which is in line with forecasting practice in the stepwise decomposition strategy the decomposition has to be repeatedly performed after newly obtained observations are sequentially appended to the streamflow series to acquire the explanatory variables used to forecast the streamflow in the next time step however for the emd the number of imfs is determined by the sifting progress rather than a specified decomposition level fig 7 displays an upward trend in the number of imfs k along an increase in the series length n at the four gauging stations the relationship between k and n can be roughly concluded as k log 2 n 1 napolitano et al 2011 suggesting that more imfs are expected to be generated by the emd as new observations are gradually appended to streamflow series in decomposition based models each sub model corresponds only to an imf once a new imf emerges not enough sub models can be used to model all of imfs and the model fails to forecast streamflow in the next time step as a result it can be deduced that the emd is inapplicable to actual forecasting practice which utilizes the stepwise decomposition strategy to acquire explanatory variables due to the use of different decomposition strategies in the calibration and validation periods the kn sampling technique provides a practical tool for examining whether the explanatory variables of samples separately obtained using the odb sampling technique and actual forecasting practice contain equivalent amounts of information as to the dwt svr and vmd svr models developed using the kn sampling technique table 6 and fig 8 indicate the noticeable model performance gap therefore it can be deduced from the model overfitting that the odb sampling technique which assumes that future streamflow is known prior to carrying out series decomposition introduces additional information into the explanatory variables of the samples in comparison actual forecasting exercises generate explanatory variables that only contain information on past streamflow records once the explanatory variables contain information on the future streamflow to be predicted the fitting process becomes the hindcasting process as a result the favorable values of the evaluation indices in the validation period presented in table 5 and fig 6 indicate that the dwt svr and vmd svr models developed using the odb sampling technique have superior hindcasting performance on the other hand their inferior forecasting performance is reflected by the undesirable values of the evaluation indices during the validation period shown in table 6 and fig 8 the noticeable model performance gap between the hindcasting and forecasting exercises presented above has also been explicitly reported by du et al 2017 and quilty and adamowski 2018 in their attempt to utilize the wavelet based hybrid models to address the real world forecasting problems therefore when the emd dwt and vmd are utilized as series decomposition tools the odb sampling technique is not able to develop convincing models for forecasting applications 4 2 2 underlying reasons for the observed performance gap the preceding text notes the failure of the odb sampling technique in developing convincing forecasting models it lies in that decomposing the overall series through the emd dwt and vmd generates samples whose explanatory variables simultaneously contain information on streamflow records and future streamflow to be forecasted hence models calibrated using such samples are bound to present noticeable performance gaps when used to forecast out of sample streamflow data whose explanatory variables come only from streamflow records and carry relatively less information the following discussion provides further explanation as to why the odb sampling technique tends to introduce additional information on future streamflow into explanatory variables from the perspective of the details of the decomposition methods 1 boundary distortion as is shown by eqs a 1 a 2 the convolution operation of a time series and a highpass lowpass filter is a crucial step in the dwt however decomposition errors can easily arise due to the incomplete convolution at both ends of the series for the emd decomposition errors arise because it is difficult to determine whether or not the values at the left and right endpoints should be treated as local extrema when using spline interpolation to form the upper and lower envelops of the series as the decomposition level increases decomposition errors will spread from the ends of the series towards its center finally resulting in unsatisfactory decomposition outcomes this issue which commonly appears in the dwt and emd is known as boundary distortion 2 series extension to reduce boundary distortion series must be extended at both ends various extension methods are available including symmetric extension anti symmetric extension and simple constant extrapolation for more details please refer to deng et al 2001 and karthikeyan and kumar 2013 fig 9 a illustrates that in the dwt left and right extension of a series helps achieve complete convolution near both ends of the original series and the values in the extension series also penetrate into the resulting convolution series c thus subseries evolving from the convolution series inevitably carry information on the left and right extensions of the series with regard to the emd as shown in fig 9 b the series extension helps to better identify the local extrema near the ends of the original series and the trend information on the extension series also penetrates into the upper and lower envelops this outcome causes the resulting subseries to carry information on the left and right extension series as well in forecasting exercises that adopt the stepwise decomposition strategy only past streamflow records can be used to extend the streamflow series at both ends because no observations of future streamflow are available and therefore the generated explanatory variables only contain information on the past records fig 10 depicts the reexamination of the odb sampling technique from the perspective of stepwise decomposition the right end of the series segment s 1 s m 1 is extended by s m s n which is the future streamflow for the time step t m 1 thus the explanatory variables of sub sample m 1 to m k used to forecast streamflow at the time step t m contain additional information on future streamflow in strong contrast to the emd and dwt the vmd addresses series decomposition in an optimization framework as a result the reason why the odb sampling technique that employs the vmd as a series decomposition tool tends to incorporate information on future streamflow into the explanatory variables is still unclear and deserves further investigation 4 3 applicability of the sdb sampling technique for developing decomposition based models the analysis above indicates that the odb and kn sampling techniques cannot be used to develop convincing models for forecasting use this subsection explores the applicability of the sdb sampling technique in the sdb sampling technique all of the samples are extracted by following the stepwise decomposition strategy accordingly the emd cannot be employed as a series decomposition tool for the reason stated in the section 4 2 1 in table 7 and fig 11 the dwt svr and vmd svr models are observed to maintain nearly consistent performance throughout the calibration and testing subperiods and the validation period the slight performance gap between the calibration and validation periods is likely to be caused by changes in the streamflow regime once streamflow displays nonstationarity resulting from changes in the streamflow regime models even those that reproduce historical records well are likely to produce inferior forecasts of future streamflow in this study efforts like a two stage calibration strategy have been made to control the potential overfitting by achieving a tradeoff in performance between the calibration and test subperiods the two stage calibration strategy prepares models to gradually adapt to changing flow regimes therefore the results shown in table 7 and fig 11 indicate that the sdb sampling technique represents an alternative method that can be used to develop forecasting models with convincing performance 4 4 contributions of series decomposition to more accurate streamflow forecasts numerous dwt svr and vmd svr models in table 7 and fig 11 have been developed using the sdb sampling technique due to the lack of reliable support for determining the optimal parameter combinations for use in the dwt and vmd the models that have the maximum values of the nse in the validation period are selected out as the optimal models this subsection conducts a comparison between these optimal decomposition based models and the benchmark the naïve svr model in order to investigate the role of decomposition techniques in enhancing model performance table 8 indicates that the decomposition based models display better performance than the naïve svr model in detail the dwt svr model outperforms the naïve svr model during the validation period at two of the four gauging stations in terms of the nse and the rsr the vmd svr model performs better than the naïve svr model at three of the four stations with respect to the nse and the rsr fig 12 shows that the dwt svr and vmd svr models generally produce higher forecasts in comparison with the naïve svr model suggesting that the dwt svr and vmd svr models can more accurately capture the high flow therefore decomposition techniques such as the dwt and vmd can play positive roles in improving model performance in addition among the different study sites the models display more desirable performance characteristics at the fort mcmurray station this result may occur because the annual streamflow series measured at the fort mcmurray station keep stationary from 1965 to 1995 whereas those of the huaixan zhangjiashan and zhuangtou stations present obvious nonstationary behavior from 1960 to 2010 for a stationarity analysis of these streamflow series refer to the section 3 2 hence it is reasonable to deduce that the nonstationarity of streamflow is likely to act as a major barrier to the achievement of favorable model performance even though series decomposition techniques have been introduced 5 discussion 5 1 a crucial step in developing decomposition based forecasting models sample consistency checking the section 4 2 indicates that the traditionally used the odb sampling technique that employs the dwt emd and vmd as decomposition tools are not suitable for the development of forecasting models because information on future streamflow which ought to be forecast is introduced into the explanatory variables of samples models calibrated using such samples will have unknown forecasting accuracy and harmful decisions may be made based on unreliable forecasts of streamflow therefore if the odb sampling technique coupled with other decomposition techniques is used in the model development checking the consistency of the samples is an indispensable step in ensuring that the explanatory variables in the calibration samples and those obtained from actual forecasting practice carry the equivalent amount of past information and information on future streamflow is strictly excluded the kn sampling technique can be used as an effective tool for this purpose because its samples in the calibration period are acquired using the odb sampling technique whereas those in the validation period are obtained using a stepwise decomposition strategy that is also employed in actual forecasting practice as a result the inconsistency of samples can be found as long as the noticeable performance gap or overfitting is observed between calibration and validation periods 5 2 two suggestions for enhancing the performance of models developed using the sdb sampling technique the sections 4 3 and 4 4 show that models developed using the sdb sampling technique display better performance than the naïve svr model nevertheless it is also observed that the performance of these models needs to be further enhanced if the predictability of each subseries is carefully inspected some useful suggestions may be made table 9 indicates the performance of the optimal vmd svr and dwt svr models for each subseries the performance is characterized by the nse in the validation period and all of the subseries are listed in sequence from low to high frequency interestingly the lowest frequency subseries or trend component has nearly the worst predictability in the vmd svr models in contrast the highest frequency subseries or stochastic component is invariably associated with the worst prediction accuracy in the dwt svr models modeling stochastic components precisely is a great challenge in many fields however to improve the predictability of the trend component in the vmd svr models the following measures may be considered trend removal given that the trend component obtained by the vmd is hard to predict some classical trend removal methods may be used prior to performing series decomposition with the vmd removing the tendency of a series is intended to identify the trend component and result in improved predictability denoising under the sdb sampling technique the stepwise decomposition strategy is adopted to extract all of the samples fig 13 compares in the time domain the trend components acquired using stepwise decomposition and overall decomposition respectively the invasion of higher frequency oscillations into the trend component generated by the stepwise decomposition is found higher frequency oscillations can reduce the predictability of the trend component therefore denoising using a lowpass filter may have a positive effect by smoothing the trend component thus improving the modeling accuracy 5 3 towards more accurate forecasts of nonstationary streamflow apart from the forecasting models used unsatisfactory forecasting accuracy can be partly attributed to the nonstationarity of streamflow which results from the changes in streamflow regime that occur in some study areas therefore it is reasonable to further include the various drivers responsible for the changing streamflow regimes such as the land cover changes and global climate indices as additional model inputs identifying exogenous inputs involves addressing complex interactions between numerous potential explanatory variables and response variables and requires support from knowledge of hydrological systems and sophisticated ivs techniques which deserve to be investigated in future studies 6 conclusions in this study the traditionally used odb sampling technique is systematically investigated because recent studies have cast doubt on their applicability in developing decomposition based models with convincing forecasting skill the sdb sampling technique is proposed as a modified alternative in this modified sampling technique a stepwise decomposition strategy is adopted to extract all of the samples which is in line with actual forecasting practice in addition a novel calibration algorithm that couples a two stage calibration strategy and the sce ua is formulated to help the models maintain consistent in sample and out of sample performance models developed using the odb kn and sdb sampling techniques are applied to implement one month ahead streamflow forecasting at four gauging stations in china and canada the results indicate that the odb sampling technique that employs the dwt emd and vmd as series decomposition techniques cannot produce convincing models for forecasting use because the odb sampling technique assumes that future streamflow is known and introduce additional information on future streamflow into the explanatory variables of the samples in contrast the sdb sampling technique which strictly excludes information on future streamflow from the explanatory variables is an appropriate alternative for developing convincing forecasting models moreover the dwt and vmd can play positive roles in enhancing model performance whereas the emd is unsuitable for use in forecasting given the variable number of subseries that are generated during the application of the stepwise decomposition strategy these findings could benefit model developers in adopting appropriate sampling techniques that yield models with convincing skill the inapplicability of the odb sampling technique provides a reminder that the details of series decomposition techniques should receive more attention if these sampling techniques are used to develop data driven models as in the emd and dwt an unremarkable operation may cause the explanatory variables of calibration samples to carry an amount of information that is inconsistent with that of the explanatory variables acquired in real forecasting practice resulting in noticeable overfitting or forecasting risk therefore checking sample consistency is an indispensable step in model development and the kn sampling technique can serve as an effective tool for such purposes additionally given decomposition based models also developed for the precipitation and air temperature forecasting the proposed sdb sampling technique may benefit deriving the convincing forecasts of other hydrological variables in addition to the streamflow specifically investigated in this study acknowledgments this study was joint funded by the national key research and

prior studies into the relative contributions of various sources of uncertainty and with little attention to the uncertainty associated with selection of the observation dataset used in bias

temperature was previously assessed by chen et al 2013 and gao et al 2018 however few studies have assessed how these climatic uncertainties propagate through hydrologic models and none in the u s great plains region the combination of climatic variability and the non linearity of hydrologic response to climate makes it unclear how the various uncertainties will propagate through hydrologic models in simulation of hydrologic responses to climate the primary goal of this study was to assess the relative contribution to uncertainty of watershed hydrology and streamflow responses from observed bias correction data sources relative to climate models and emissions radiative forcing scenarios the specific objectives were 1 to demonstrate monthly changes in climate data with bias corrections using different observed data sources 2 to assess the impacts of different data sources used to correct future climate data on streamflow predictions at monthly and yearly scales 3 to identify the relationships between streamflow and raw and corrected climate changes by implementing observation data with without bias correction in swat and 4 to analyze the relative uncertainty from

method the daily translation dt method was used as a bias correction algorithm to establish the relationship between observed and gcm simulated daily data at the historical period mpelasoka and chiew 2009 gao et al 2018 first a distribution mapping technique establishes a relationship between the observed daily precipitation pobs q or temperature tobs q at each percentile and the gcm simulated precipitation pgcm ref q or temperature tgcm ref q at the historical period 1985 2004 the ratio for precipitation or difference for temperature in percentiles between observed and gcm simulated data at the historical period is then multiplied or added to the future daily precipitation pgcm fut q and temperature tgcm fut q for each percentile specifically the adjusted daily precipitation padj fut q and temperature tadj fut q for the future period 2041 2060 for near future and 2081 2100 for distant future are derived using the following equations p adj f u t d p gcm f u t d p obs q p gcm r e f q t adj f u t d t gcm f u t d t obs q t gcm r e f q where the subscript q is a quantile for a specific day and the subscript d represents a specific day empirical quantile mapping was found to be more accurate with more quantile divisions lafon et al 2013 in this study 100 integral quantiles from 1st to 100th percentile were calculated for each day in each stage the primary disadvantage of the daily translation approach is that the scaled daily precipitation sequence wet and dry days is the same as that of the unadjusted raw gcm data which may project too many wet days compared to observed

performance and higher pbias seen in the validation period was caused by several years with extreme high flow events historical floods in 1986 and 1992 that negatively affected calibration results for example several peaks of extreme stream flow of 30 m3 s occurred in the months 3 4 74 75 79 101 152 and 174 during the 18 year validation period significantly exceeded any stream flow during 3 year calibration period fig 2 4 2 data source effects on downscaled precipitation and temperature impact of bias correction data source on precipitation was summarized using the percentage change in future monthly mean precipitation δmmp compared to the unadjusted raw historical gcm data for the six gcms fig 3 where each gcm value was averaged across 54 subbasins and 20 years the δmmp between the historical period 1985 2004 and both near future 2041 2060 fig 3a and distant future 2081 2100 fig 3b increased in all months and for all three rcps except january for rcp 8 5 indicating that unadjusted gcms simulated greater precipitation in the future periods than in the historical period results from a prior study indicated that most gcms overestimated historical period precipitation in the shrw and that bias correction from all three data sources successfully reduced these biases gao et al 2018 thus application of bias corrections to the future gcm projections also attenuated projected precipitation amounts after bias corrections by ncdc prism and nexrad nearly all corrected δmmps decreased but by different amounts in the near future with rcp 2 6 fig 3a top for example the annual median change in precipitation decreased from 5 53 unadjusted to 3 01 ncdc 15 92 prism and 6 66 nexrad it can be speculated that larger negative shifting by prism was contributed by prism s more accurate representation of precipitation spatial distribution than ncdc gao et al 2017a in case of nexrad evidence of the presence of both positive and negative fluctuations yield medians similar to that displayed in ncdc as shown in fig s1 in supplementary material also shown in fig 3a δmmp variability in terms of inter quartile range q1 3 was increased after bias correction in some months and decreased in other months for rcps 2 6 and 4 5 but that δmmp variability was amplified in all months for rcp 8 5 this indicates that monthly response to bias correction was different among the six gcms and among the three rcps overall these results revealed the potential risk of overestimating projected precipitation without bias correction and that the magnitude of bias correction varies temporally by all impacting uncertainty elements bias correction data source gcm and rcp impact of bias correction data source on temperature was summarized using the change in degrees celsius in future monthly mean minimum δmmi and maximum δmmx temperature compared to the unadjusted historical gcm data for the six gcms fig 4 where each gcm value was averaged across 54 subbasins and 20 years both δmmi and δmmx of raw gcms in near future and distant future increased similarly in each month and progressively increased from scenario rcp 2 6 to rcp 8 5 fig 4 after bias correction δmmi corrected by both data sources decreased in all months for all three rcps fig 4a b bias correction had little influence on δmmx in any month fig 4c d as a result in the near future δmmi became negative for all rcps in all months after bias correction by prism and all rcps and months except rcp 8 5 from july to december after bias correction by ncdc fig 4a no such shift on δmmx was observed in any rcp or month fig 4c this was expected since most gcms overestimated historical period minimum temperature but had little bias in estimating maximum temperature in the shrw gao et al 2018 in both near future fig 4a and distant future fig 4b δmmi showed larger q1 3 variability among gcms in the first half of the year and this variability was amplified after bias correction by both data sources overall bias correction by both data sources decreased the increase of gcm simulated future minimum temperature but had little effect on the increase of gcm simulated future maximum temperature for all months and rcps as a result future minimum temperature in the shrw would be expected to decrease rather than increase in most months under most rcps and in near future and distant future with likely impacts on watershed hydrologic response 4 3 data source effects on future streamflow 4 3 1 change in monthly streamflow impact of bias correction data source on monthly streamflow at the usgs stream gauge station location was summarized using the change in future monthly mean streamflow δmmq compared to the one simulated for unadjusted raw historical gcm data for the six gcms fig 5 where each mmq simulated by each gcm value was averaged across 54 subbasins and 20 years the δmmq for the unadjusted gcm showed little change in the future even though both precipitation fig 3 and temperature fig 4 showed substantial increases this result reflects the counterbalancing effects on streamflow of increased precipitation in the basin which contributes to increased streamflow and increased temperature which contributes to decreased streamflow via increased evapotranspiration et in the basin gao et al 2006 this result highlights the utility of hydrologic models and swat in particular in this study to quantify these counterbalancing hydrologic contributors to streamflow this result also highlights the rationale for accurate downscaling and bias correction of gcm results to ensure that future climatic forcing data are representative of both global trends and local influences on climate bias correction by each of the three data sources changed δmmq differently the δmmq from the unadjusted future gcm showed a gradual slight increase from january through june followed by a gradual slight decrease through december for all rcps and both near future and distant future periods fig 5 application of ncdc bias correction data induced the least change from the unadjusted future gcm δmmq but the relative shift varied throughout the year for most rcps and future periods δmmq followed a similar monthly pattern as the unadjusted gcm but with an exaggerated decrease in january that gradually transitioned to an exaggerated increase in june which was then maintained with a gradual slight decline for the remainder of the year monthly trends in δmmq using both nexrad and prism data sources were similar to ncdc but were shifted toward more negative δmmq with lower monthly variation this point further displays that sparsely distributed ncdc stations were used to represent climate condition in sub basins in swat to some extent leading to underestimation in δmmq bias correction data sources also changed the variability as indicated by q1 3 in δmmq variability in δmmq using ncdc bias correction was greater than for the unadjusted future gcm with the greatest increase in variability in may june and the least increase in january february fig 5 in contrast variability in δmmq using prism bias correction was less than for the unadjusted future gcm for almost all months and rcps in the near future except april june for rcp 2 6 and almost all months and rcps in the distant future except april december for rcp 4 5 overall relative to ncdc future streamflow simulated using prism bias correction had the greatest decrease and the least variation in δmmq throughout the year whereas the results with nexrad bias correction were intermediate in both magnitude of decrease and variation in δmmq these changes are mainly contributed by smaller variation in precipitation presented in prism data against the larger variation seen in nexrad data see fig s1 in supplementary material it is impossible to deduce which bias correction dataset provides the correct climatic forcings or results in the correct streamflow magnitude and timing clearly substantially different hydrologic conditions resulted from gcms that were bias corrected with different data sources gao et al 2018 concluded that a selection of the downscaling data source can influence both magnitude and variability of future precipitation and temperature projections notably downscaling gcms using ncdc introduced the greatest variability but the least change in future precipitation whereas prism introduced the least variability with the greatest change the greater variability introduced to the gcm projections by ncdc and nexrad data were consistent with the greater temporal ncdc and spatial nexrad resolutions inherent in these data sources gao et al 2018 if one assumed that it would be preferable to retain precipitation data variability more consistent with the local historical climatological patterns then ncdc or nexrad based streamflow simulations would also be preferable 4 3 2 change in annual streamflow impact of bias correction data source on annual streamflow at the usgs gauge station was summarized individually for each of the six gcms using change in future annual mean streamflow δamq compared to the one simulated with unadjusted historical gcm data fig 6 where each amq simulated by each gcm value was averaged across 54 subbasins changes in δamq across three rcps and two future periods fig 6 followed similar patterns as described previously for δmmq fig 5 however differences among the six gcms were readily apparent in near future for almost all rcps the median change in δamq of unadjusted future gcm values decreased for cnrm cm5 ec earth miroc5 and ccsm4 and increased for cmcc cm and mri cgcm3 the changes in future streamflow δamq were different from the changes in either precipitation or temperatures in the same periods described in gao et al 2018 again due to the hydrologic interaction of precipitation and temperature via et on streamflow in addition the variability q1 3 of δamq was much greater than for future annual mean precipitation δamp in many combinations of gcms rcps and future periods and this was consistent with the results of ouyang et al 2015 after bias correction both increases and decreases in δamq were observed relative to unadjusted raw future gcm values fig 6 in addition the influence of bias correction data source on magnitude direction and variability of δamq was different among gcms for the unadjusted future gcm mri cgcm3 consistently showed the largest increase in median δamq in both near future and distant future while cnrm cm5 and miroc5 provided the largest decreases in median δamq after bias correction with ncdc ec earth gave the largest increases in median δamq in both near future and distant future while mri cgcm3 exhibited the largest decreases in median δamq however after bias correction with prism and nexrad nearly all simulated δamq declined in both near future and distant future under all three rcps fig 6 in both near future and distant future ec earth produced the smallest decreases in median δamq while mri cgcm3 and miroc5 showed the largest decreases in median δamq for almost all rcps the substantial differences in changes to δamq from the various bias correction datasets gcms and emission scenarios indicate a contribution of each element to the overall simulation uncertainty this point is consistent with the conclusion in bosshard et al 2013 that the associated interactions among the gcm downscaling methods and a hydrologic model account for a substantial part of the total uncertainty in predicting streamflow careful study into the possible influences of changes in future precipitation and temperature data sources on these differences found discernable reasonable relationships in some cases but not in others for example δami decreased and δamx increased after bias correction with ncdc which corresponded to a decrease in δamq for miroc5 and mri cgcm3 but also corresponded to an increase in δamq for ec earth this suggests that the differences evident among scenarios relate not only to the annual level differences in future precipitation and temperature but also to the intensity sequencing spatial distribution and seasonal timing of storms as related to antecedent hydrologic conditions such as soil moisture 4 4 relationship between climate change and streamflow in yearly series the impact of bias correction data source precipitation and minimum and maximum temperatures on streamflow in the shrw can be demonstrated by annual time series fig 7 synthesizes the data presented in figs 3 6 reinforces the patterns noted and discussed in previous sections and provides a framework for integrated comparisons the grey band shows 1 standard error of unadjusted future values from the six gcms in the historical period 1985 2004 all bias corrected δamp values were lower than the δamp values for unadjusted historical gcms fig 7b shifts ranged from about 10 for ncdc to about 25 for prism with the prism data generally falling outside the standard error band these shifts generally persisted in the future periods bias corrected δamx showed little difference from the uncorrected historical for future period data fig 7c whereas both bias correction data sources decreased δami outside the standard error band of unadjusted historical or future period data fig 7d the effect of these climatic shifts on streamflow was combined to produce an annual pattern of changing δamq that did not follow either precipitation or temperature trends over time fig 7a although the magnitude of shift in δamq ncdc nexrad prism tended to align with that seen for δamp the annual series followed a more complex pattern for example the alternating generally increasing pattern of low and high δamp from 2041 to the peak in 2053 fig 7b corresponds to an exaggerated steeply increasing alternating pattern of δamq over the same period this pattern cannot be explained on the basis of the annual climatic time series shown in fig 7 but rather indicates that the model is capturing a more complex relationship between climate forcing data and streamflow this reinforces the importance of accurate downscaling and bias correction of gcm results to derive the most accurate future climate forcing data possible 5 uncertainty analysis uncertainties of future climate and streamflow projections associated with each potential uncertainty element gcm rcp data source were assessed by comparing the ranges of projections produced by different options of that element 6 gcm options 3 rcp options 3 data source options a mean annual basin wide average value δamp δamx δami and δamq was generated for each option averaged across all other elements for the near future future period fig 8 each bar in fig 8 therefore represents the range of variation from using the different options of that element for climate or streamflow projections the gcm bars represent the range of values generated by the six different gcms the rcp bars represent the range of values generated by the three different rcps and the data source bars represent the range of values generated by the three different data sources larger bars indicate larger ranges among options within that element and greater sensitivity to selection among those options in generating future climate or streamflow projections these graphs allow direct comparison of the relative uncertainty among the various options of each element in projecting future climate gao et al 2018 provided a preliminary presentation and discussion comparing the influences on uncertainty for each of the climate elements but did not address the resultant streamflow uncertainty in this paper all elements will be discussed uncertainty of δamp from rcps was much smaller than that from gcms in both unadjusted and bias corrected gcms which was consistent with previous work ouyang et al 2015 they found the uncertainty of rcps is smaller than that of gcms in the long term although different gcms and bias correction methods were used in our study the similar result reinforces the substantial uncertainty caused by gcm selection in addition uncertainty of δamp from gcms was slightly higher than that from bias corrected data source for all rcps fig 8 in most gcms uncertainty from bias corrected data source clearly was larger than that from rcps except for the gcm2 cnrm cm5 fig 8 the most notable difference was from gcm3 ec earth with a range of δamp of 2 to 11 from rcps and compared to 11 to 34 from data sources from above comparisons differences among gcms provided the primary source of uncertainty and differences among data sources also provided a substantial source of uncertainty but differences among rcps had little contribution to uncertainty in estimating future δamp both gcm model selection and rcp selection had similar effects on uncertainty for δamx estimated using both unadjusted gcm and each bias corrected gcm fig 8 differences among data sources had little influence on uncertainty of δamx estimation for δami uncertainty from gcms was most influential followed by rcps and then data source fig 8 sources of uncertainty for streamflow appeared to be more consistent with precipitation than temperature although with different magnitudes fig 8 for example gcms downscaled with ncdc introduced uncertainty in δamp ranging from 18 to 33 whereas the introduced uncertainty in δamq ranged from 65 to 160 this increase in magnitude of change between future and unadjusted historical gcm values was evident across all elements for δamq relative to δamp comparing the variation in uncertainty introduced by gcms for δamq relative to δamp for example ncdc uncertainty expanded prism uncertainty was shifted toward more negative change and nexrad uncertainty both expanded and shifted toward more negative change different changes in uncertainty associated with ncdc prism and nexrad data were mainly caused by raw distributions of observed datasets see fig 1s in supplementary material overall these patterns indicate that for streamflow like precipitation selection of the gcm contributes the greatest uncertainty whereas selection of the data source used for bias correction is able to substantially affect uncertainty these results indicate that future precipitation projections were highly sensitive to gcms as well as sensitive to data sources but less sensitive to rcps future temperature projections however were most sensitive to gcms and rcps and least sensitive to data sources this suggests that it is essential for the modeler to carefully select both gcms and bias correction data sources that capture local precipitation processes and carefully consider both gcms and rcps in determining the most appropriate temperature dataset for future climate simulations the uncertainty in hydrologic response to projected climate changes reflected general similarity to uncertainty in precipitation but also reflected the influence of uncertainty in temperature uncertainty in both precipitation and temperature datasets affected magnitude direction and variability of uncertainty in streamflow both on average fig 8 and inter annually fig 7 overall streamflow demonstrated high sensitivity to selection of gcm moderately high sensitivity to selection of bias correction data source and low sensitivity to selection of rcp our study demonstrated results in the central great plains of the u s and one might anticipate different results in other regions additionally there might exist interactive effects between gcm rcp and data sources on hydrologic process worthy of future research as also suggested by bosshard et al 2013 6 conclusions this was one of very few studies to systematically assess the influence of bias correction data source on uncertainty of not only projected climate precipitation maximum and minimum temperature but also hydrologic response streamflow relative uncertainty induced by selection of climate model emissions scenario and data source was assessed by comparing the relative variability in change of projected precipitation temperature and streamflow from six gcms three rcps and three data sources hydrologic response was assessed using the swat model calibrated for conditions of an agricultural watershed in west central kansas for near future and distant future periods the following five conclusions were summarized 1 for precipitation data nearly all shifts in δmmp bias corrected vs unadjusted decreased after bias corrections by ncdc prism and nexrad but by different amounts variability was increased after bias correction in some months and decreased in other months for rcps 2 6 and 4 5 but variability was amplified in all months for rcp 8 5 this indicates that monthly response to bias correction was different among the six gcms and among the three rcps overall these results revealed the potential risk of overestimating projected precipitation without bias correction and that the magnitude of bias correction varies temporally by bias correction data source gcm and rcp 2 for temperature data bias correction by both ncdc and prism data sources decreased the gcm simulated future increases in minimum temperature but had little effect on the gcm simulated future increases in maximum temperature for all months and rcps 3 for streamflow outputs bias correction by each of the three data sources changed δmmq differently overall relative to ncdc future streamflow simulated using prism bias correction had the greatest decrease and the least variation in δmmq throughout the year whereas nexrad was intermediate in both magnitude of decrease and variation in δmmq 4 the changes in magnitude of future streamflow δamq were different from the changes in either precipitation or temperatures in the same periods likely due to the hydrologic interaction of precipitation and temperature via et on streamflow variability of change in streamflow δamq indicated high sensitivity to change in precipitation δamp but magnitude direction and variability of change in streamflow also demonstrated an effect of temperature 5 overall the sensitivity of streamflow to selection of bias correction data source was found to be less than the sensitivity to selection of gcm and greater than sensitivity to selection of rcp acknowledgments this work was

6832,uncertainty in simulating hydrologic response to future climate is generally assumed to result from the combined uncertainties of the general circulation model gcm representative concentration pathway rcp downscaling method and hydrologic model used however another source of uncertainty the observed climate data source used to statistically downscale and bias correct gcm projections has largely been overlooked this study assessed the shifts variability and uncertainty in streamflow simulation from three downscaling data sources ncdc land based weather stations nexrad spatial grid and prism spatial grid relative to those introduced by six gcms and three rcps in west central kansas u s streamflow simulated by the soil and water assessment tool swat hydrologic model was found to be more sensitive to future precipitation than to maximum and minimum temperatures the greatest uncertainty in simulated streamflow was associated with selection of the gcm uncertainty in simulated streamflow associated with the observed bias correction data source ncdc prism nexrad was greater than with rcps and was primarily related to uncertainty in precipitation this study highlighted the importance of recognizing uncertainty from bias correction data sources in representing future climate scenarios in hydrologic simulations keywords uncertainty bias correction cmip5 climate change

hydrologic simulations especially precipitation and temperature risbey and entekhabi 1996 suggested that significant variations in streamflow responses may arise with even small fluctuations in precipitation data temporal or spatial but almost insensitive to mean seasonal temperature impacts of future climate on hydrologic alterations in large river basins have been widely studied chen et al

derived mainly from general circulation models gcms and regional climate models rcms which contain specific biases due to parameterization and large grid size up to 300 km 300 km these biases or

correction methods hydrologic models and hydrologic model parameters wilby and harris 2006 they found that the most important sources of uncertainty were from gcms and downscaling methods especially for simulating changes in low flows another study in four large british watersheds found that gcms were the dominant source of uncertainty followed by downscaling methods and that both were greater than the contribution of uncertainty from hydrologic modeling prudhomme and davies 2009 regarding analysis of flood frequency in two urban catchments jung et al 2011 found gcms were the major source of uncertainty among five uncertainty sources gcms rcps land use change scenarios natural variability and hydrologic model parameters vetter et al 2015 analyzed and compared climate impacts on future river discharge in three basins and found the upper niger basin africa to have greatest uncertainty from climate models the yellow basin asia to have substantial uncertainty from both climate and hydrologic models and the rhine basin europe to have low uncertainty from both climate and hydrologic models chawla and mujumdar 2018 quantified contributions of gcms rcps land use hydrologic model parameters and internal variability of the system to uncertainty in the streamflow and found gcms and model parameters were the primary sources of uncertainty with the variability of results in these prior studies into the relative contributions of various sources of uncertainty and with little attention to the uncertainty associated with selection of the observation dataset used in bias correction further systematic study is warranted the contribution of gcms rcps and choice of bias correction methods and observation datasets to uncertainty in projected climate precipitation temperature was previously assessed by chen et al 2013 and gao et al 2018 however few studies have assessed how these climatic uncertainties propagate through hydrologic models and none in the u s great plains region the combination of climatic variability and the non linearity of hydrologic response to climate makes it unclear how the various uncertainties will propagate through hydrologic models in simulation of hydrologic responses to climate the primary goal of this study was to assess the relative contribution to uncertainty of watershed hydrology and streamflow responses from observed bias correction data sources relative to climate models and emissions radiative forcing scenarios the specific objectives were 1 to demonstrate monthly changes in climate data with bias corrections using different observed data sources 2 to assess the impacts of different data sources used to correct future climate data on streamflow predictions at monthly and yearly scales 3 to identify the relationships between streamflow and raw and corrected climate changes by implementing observation data with without bias correction in swat and 4 to analyze the relative uncertainty from bias correction data sources climate models and emissions scenarios on hydrologic response 2 materials 2 1 study area the smoky hill river watershed shrw in west central kansas usa is a 6310 km2 1 559

nexrad data were converted to daily data by accumulating the 24 hour period prior to 7 00 a m on the recorded day for each grid cell to correspond with the observation time of ncdc rain gauge data the details of the nexrad processing procedure can be found at gao et al 2017a only precipitation data were available for nexrad thus prism temperature data were used for swat simulations with the nexrad

zhang et al 2009 eleven model parameters were selected for adjustment during the calibration procedure the details on the swat model built for shrw can be found in gao et al 2017a b 3 2 downscaling method the daily translation dt method was used as a bias correction algorithm to establish the relationship between observed and gcm simulated daily data at the historical period mpelasoka and chiew 2009 gao et al 2018 first a distribution mapping technique establishes a relationship between the observed daily precipitation pobs q or temperature tobs q at each percentile and the gcm simulated precipitation pgcm ref q or temperature tgcm ref q at the historical period 1985 2004 the ratio for precipitation or difference for temperature in percentiles between observed and gcm simulated data at the historical period is then multiplied or added to the future daily precipitation pgcm fut q and temperature tgcm fut q for each percentile specifically the adjusted daily precipitation padj fut q and temperature tadj fut q for the future period 2041 2060 for near future and 2081 2100 for distant future are derived using the following equations p adj f u t d p gcm f u t d p obs q p gcm r e f q t adj f u t d t gcm f u t d t obs q t gcm r e f q where the subscript q is a quantile for a specific day and the subscript d represents a specific day empirical quantile mapping was found to be more accurate with more quantile divisions lafon et al 2013 in this study 100 integral quantiles from 1st to 100th percentile were calculated for each day in each stage the primary disadvantage of the daily translation approach is that the scaled daily precipitation sequence wet and dry days is the same as that of the unadjusted raw gcm data which may project too many wet days compared to observed data chen et al 2013 mpelasoka and chiew 2009 full details of the utilized downscaling and bias correction procedure can be found at gao et al 2018 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrologic model

hydrologic predictions for the historical period in shrw detailed comparisons of three input climate datasets raw and bias corrected gcms in historical period can be found in gao et al 2018 the worse performance and higher pbias seen in the validation period was caused by several years with extreme high flow events historical floods in 1986 and 1992 that negatively affected calibration results for example several peaks of extreme stream flow of 30 m3 s occurred in the months 3 4 74 75 79 101 152 and 174 during the 18 year validation period significantly exceeded any stream flow during 3 year calibration period fig 2 4 2 data source effects on downscaled precipitation and temperature impact of bias correction data source on precipitation was summarized using the percentage change in future monthly mean precipitation δmmp compared to the unadjusted raw historical gcm data for the six gcms fig 3 where each gcm value was averaged across 54 subbasins and 20 years the δmmp between the historical period 1985 2004 and both near future 2041 2060 fig 3a and distant future 2081 2100 fig 3b increased in all months and for all three rcps except january for rcp 8 5 indicating that unadjusted gcms simulated greater precipitation in the future periods than in the historical period results from a prior study indicated that most gcms overestimated historical period precipitation in the shrw and that bias correction from all three data sources successfully reduced these biases gao et al 2018 thus application of bias corrections to the future gcm projections also attenuated projected precipitation amounts after bias corrections by ncdc prism and nexrad nearly all corrected δmmps decreased but by different amounts in the near future with rcp 2 6 fig 3a top for example the annual median change in precipitation decreased from 5 53 unadjusted to 3 01 ncdc 15 92 prism and 6 66 nexrad it can be speculated that larger negative shifting by prism was contributed by prism s more accurate representation of precipitation spatial distribution than ncdc gao et al 2017a in case of nexrad evidence of the presence of both positive and negative fluctuations yield medians similar to that displayed in ncdc as shown in fig s1 in supplementary material also shown in fig 3a δmmp variability in terms of inter quartile range q1 3 was increased after bias correction in some months and decreased in other months for rcps 2 6 and 4 5 but that δmmp variability was amplified in all months for rcp 8 5 this indicates that monthly response to bias correction was different among the six gcms and among the three rcps overall these results revealed the potential risk of overestimating projected precipitation without bias correction and that the magnitude of bias correction varies temporally by all impacting uncertainty elements bias correction data source gcm and rcp impact of bias correction data source on temperature was summarized using the change in degrees celsius in future monthly mean minimum δmmi and maximum δmmx temperature compared to the unadjusted historical gcm data for the six gcms fig 4 where each gcm value was averaged across 54 subbasins and 20 years both δmmi and δmmx of raw gcms in near future and distant future increased similarly in each month and progressively increased from scenario rcp 2 6 to rcp 8 5 fig 4 after bias correction δmmi corrected by both data sources decreased in all months for all three rcps fig 4a b bias correction had little influence on δmmx in any month fig 4c d as a result in the near future δmmi became negative for all rcps in all months after bias correction by prism and all rcps and months except rcp 8 5 from july to december after bias correction by ncdc fig 4a no such shift on δmmx was observed in any rcp or month fig 4c this was expected since most gcms overestimated historical period minimum temperature but had little bias in estimating maximum temperature in the shrw gao et al 2018 in both near future fig 4a and distant future fig 4b δmmi showed larger q1 3 variability among gcms in the first half of the year and this variability was amplified after bias correction by both data sources overall bias correction by both data sources decreased the increase of gcm simulated future minimum temperature but had little effect on the increase of gcm simulated future maximum temperature for all months and rcps as a result future minimum temperature in the shrw would be expected to decrease rather than increase in most months under most rcps and in near future and distant future with likely impacts on watershed hydrologic response 4 3 data source effects on future streamflow 4 3 1 change in monthly streamflow impact of bias correction data source on monthly streamflow at the usgs stream gauge station location was summarized using the change in future monthly mean streamflow δmmq compared to the one simulated for unadjusted raw historical gcm data for the six gcms fig 5 where each mmq simulated by each gcm value was averaged across 54 subbasins and 20 years the δmmq for the unadjusted gcm showed little change in the future even though both precipitation fig 3 and temperature fig 4 showed substantial increases this result reflects the counterbalancing effects on streamflow of increased precipitation in the basin which contributes to increased streamflow and increased temperature which contributes to decreased streamflow via increased evapotranspiration et in the basin gao et al 2006 this result highlights the utility of hydrologic models and swat in particular in this study to quantify these counterbalancing hydrologic contributors to streamflow this result also highlights the rationale for accurate downscaling and bias correction of gcm results to ensure that future climatic forcing data are representative of both global trends and local influences on climate bias correction by each of the three data sources changed δmmq differently the δmmq from the unadjusted future gcm showed a gradual slight increase from january through june followed by a gradual slight decrease through december for all rcps and both near future and distant future periods fig 5 application of ncdc bias correction data induced the least change from the unadjusted future gcm δmmq but the relative shift varied throughout the year for most rcps and future periods δmmq followed a similar monthly pattern as the unadjusted gcm but with an exaggerated decrease in january that gradually transitioned to an exaggerated increase in june which was then maintained with a gradual slight decline for the remainder of the year monthly trends in δmmq using both nexrad and prism data sources were similar to ncdc but were shifted toward more negative δmmq with lower monthly variation this point further displays that sparsely distributed ncdc stations were used to represent climate condition in sub basins in swat to some extent leading to underestimation in δmmq bias correction data sources also changed the variability as indicated by q1 3 in δmmq variability in δmmq using ncdc bias correction was greater than for the unadjusted future gcm with the greatest increase in variability in may june and the least increase in january february fig 5 in contrast variability in δmmq using prism bias correction was less than for the unadjusted future gcm for almost all months and rcps in the near future except april june for rcp 2 6 and almost all months and rcps in the distant future except april december for rcp 4 5 overall relative to ncdc future streamflow simulated using prism bias correction had the greatest decrease and the least variation in δmmq throughout the year whereas the results with nexrad bias correction were intermediate in both magnitude of decrease and variation in δmmq these changes are mainly contributed by smaller variation in precipitation presented in prism data against the larger variation seen in nexrad data see fig s1 in supplementary material it is impossible to deduce which bias correction dataset provides the correct climatic forcings or results in the correct streamflow magnitude and timing clearly substantially different hydrologic conditions resulted from gcms that were bias corrected with different data sources gao et al 2018 concluded that a selection of the downscaling data source can influence both magnitude and variability of future precipitation and temperature projections notably downscaling gcms using ncdc introduced the greatest variability but the least change in future precipitation whereas prism introduced the least variability with the greatest change the greater variability introduced to the gcm projections by ncdc and nexrad data were consistent with the greater temporal ncdc and spatial nexrad resolutions inherent in these data sources gao et al 2018 if one assumed that it would be preferable to retain precipitation data variability more consistent with the local historical climatological patterns then ncdc or nexrad based streamflow simulations would also be preferable 4 3 2 change in annual streamflow impact of bias correction data source on annual streamflow at the usgs gauge station was summarized individually for each of the six gcms using change in future annual mean streamflow δamq compared to the one simulated with unadjusted historical gcm data fig 6 where each amq simulated by each gcm value was averaged across 54 subbasins changes in δamq across three rcps and two future periods fig 6 followed similar patterns as described previously for δmmq fig 5 however differences among the six gcms were readily apparent in near future for almost all rcps the median change in δamq of unadjusted future gcm values decreased for cnrm cm5 ec earth miroc5 and ccsm4 and increased for cmcc cm and mri cgcm3 the changes in future streamflow δamq were different from the changes in either precipitation or temperatures in the same periods described in gao et al 2018 again due to the hydrologic interaction of precipitation and temperature via et on streamflow in addition the variability q1 3 of δamq was much greater than for future annual mean precipitation δamp in many combinations of gcms rcps and future periods and this was consistent with the results of ouyang et al 2015 after bias correction both increases and decreases in δamq were observed relative to unadjusted raw future gcm values fig 6 in addition the influence of bias correction data source on magnitude direction and variability of δamq was different among gcms for the unadjusted future gcm mri cgcm3 consistently showed the largest increase in median δamq in both near future and distant future while cnrm cm5 and miroc5 provided the largest decreases in median δamq after bias correction with ncdc ec earth gave the largest increases in median δamq in both near future and distant future while mri cgcm3 exhibited the largest decreases in median δamq however after bias correction with prism and nexrad nearly all simulated δamq declined in both near future and distant future under all three rcps fig 6 in both near future and distant future ec earth produced the smallest decreases in median δamq while mri cgcm3 and miroc5 showed the largest decreases in median δamq for almost all rcps the substantial differences in changes to δamq from the various bias correction datasets gcms and emission scenarios indicate a contribution of each element to the overall simulation uncertainty this point is consistent with the conclusion in bosshard et al 2013 that the associated interactions among the gcm downscaling methods and a hydrologic model account for a substantial part of the total uncertainty in predicting streamflow careful study into the possible influences of changes in future precipitation and temperature data sources on these differences found discernable reasonable relationships in some cases but not in others for example δami decreased and δamx increased after bias correction with ncdc which corresponded to a decrease in δamq for miroc5 and mri cgcm3 but also corresponded to an increase in δamq for ec earth this suggests that the differences evident among scenarios relate not only to the annual level differences in future precipitation and temperature but also to the intensity sequencing spatial distribution and seasonal timing of storms as related to antecedent hydrologic conditions such as soil moisture 4 4 relationship between climate change and streamflow in yearly series the impact of bias correction data source precipitation and minimum and maximum temperatures on streamflow in the shrw can be demonstrated by annual time series fig 7 synthesizes the data presented in figs 3 6 reinforces the patterns noted and discussed in previous sections and provides a framework for integrated comparisons the grey band shows 1 standard error of unadjusted future values from the six gcms in the historical period 1985 2004 all bias corrected δamp values were lower than the δamp values for unadjusted historical gcms fig 7b shifts ranged from about 10 for ncdc to about 25 for prism with the prism data generally falling outside the standard error band these shifts generally persisted in the future periods bias corrected δamx showed little difference from the uncorrected historical for future period data fig 7c whereas both bias correction data sources decreased δami outside the standard error band of unadjusted historical or future period data fig 7d the effect of these climatic shifts on streamflow was combined to produce an annual pattern of changing δamq that did not follow either precipitation or temperature trends over time fig 7a although the magnitude of shift in δamq ncdc nexrad prism tended to align with that seen for δamp the annual series followed a more complex pattern for example the alternating generally increasing pattern of low and high δamp from 2041 to the peak in 2053 fig 7b corresponds to an exaggerated steeply increasing alternating pattern of δamq over the same period this pattern cannot be explained on the basis of the annual climatic time series shown in fig 7 but rather indicates that the model is capturing a more complex relationship between climate forcing data and streamflow this reinforces the importance of accurate downscaling and bias correction of gcm results to derive the most accurate future climate forcing data possible 5 uncertainty analysis uncertainties of future climate and streamflow projections associated with each potential uncertainty element gcm rcp data source were assessed by comparing the ranges of projections produced by different options of that element 6 gcm options 3 rcp options 3 data source options a mean annual basin wide average value δamp δamx δami and δamq was generated for each option averaged across all other elements for the near future future period fig 8 each bar in fig 8 therefore represents the range of variation from using the different options of that element for climate or streamflow projections the gcm bars represent the range of values generated by the six different gcms the rcp bars represent the range of values generated by the three different rcps and the data source bars represent the range of values generated by the three different data sources larger bars indicate larger ranges among options within that element and greater sensitivity to selection among those options in generating future climate or streamflow projections these graphs allow direct comparison of the relative uncertainty among the various options of each element in projecting future climate gao et al 2018 provided a preliminary presentation and discussion comparing the influences on uncertainty for each of the climate elements but did not address the resultant streamflow uncertainty in this paper all elements will be discussed uncertainty of δamp from rcps was much smaller than that from gcms in both unadjusted and bias corrected gcms which was consistent with previous work ouyang et al 2015 they found the uncertainty of rcps is smaller than that of gcms in the long term although different gcms and bias correction methods were used in our study the similar result reinforces the substantial uncertainty caused by gcm selection in addition uncertainty of δamp from gcms was slightly higher than that from bias corrected data source for all rcps fig 8 in most gcms uncertainty from bias corrected data source clearly was larger than that from rcps except for the gcm2 cnrm cm5 fig 8 the most notable difference was from gcm3 ec earth with a range of δamp of 2 to 11 from rcps and compared to 11 to 34 from data sources from above comparisons differences among gcms provided the primary source of uncertainty and differences among data sources also provided a substantial source of uncertainty but differences among rcps had little contribution to uncertainty in estimating future δamp both gcm model selection and rcp selection had similar effects on uncertainty for δamx estimated using both unadjusted gcm and each bias corrected gcm fig 8 differences among data sources had little influence on uncertainty of δamx estimation for δami uncertainty from gcms was most influential followed by rcps and then data source fig 8 sources of uncertainty for streamflow appeared to be more consistent with precipitation than temperature although with different magnitudes fig 8 for example gcms downscaled with ncdc introduced uncertainty in δamp ranging from 18 to 33 whereas the introduced uncertainty in δamq ranged from 65 to 160 this increase in magnitude of change between future and unadjusted historical gcm values was evident across all elements for δamq relative to δamp comparing the variation in uncertainty introduced by gcms for δamq relative to δamp for example ncdc uncertainty expanded prism uncertainty was shifted toward more negative change and nexrad uncertainty both expanded and shifted toward more negative change different changes in uncertainty associated with ncdc prism and nexrad data were mainly caused by raw distributions of observed datasets see fig 1s in supplementary material overall these patterns indicate that for streamflow like precipitation selection of the gcm contributes the greatest uncertainty whereas selection of the data source used for bias correction is able to substantially affect uncertainty these results indicate that future precipitation projections were highly sensitive to gcms as well as sensitive to data sources but less sensitive to rcps future temperature projections however were most sensitive to gcms and rcps and least sensitive to data sources this suggests that it is essential for the modeler to carefully select both gcms and bias correction data sources that capture local precipitation processes and carefully consider both gcms and rcps in determining the most appropriate temperature dataset for future climate simulations the uncertainty in hydrologic response to projected climate changes reflected general similarity to uncertainty in precipitation but also reflected the influence of uncertainty in temperature uncertainty in both precipitation and temperature datasets affected magnitude direction and variability of uncertainty in streamflow both on average fig 8 and inter annually fig 7 overall streamflow demonstrated high sensitivity to selection of gcm moderately high sensitivity to selection of bias correction data source and low sensitivity to selection of rcp our study demonstrated results in the central great plains of the u s and one might anticipate different results in other regions additionally there might exist interactive effects between gcm rcp and data sources on hydrologic process worthy of future research as also suggested by bosshard et al 2013 6 conclusions this was one of very few studies to systematically assess the influence of bias correction data source on uncertainty of not only projected climate precipitation maximum and minimum temperature but also hydrologic response streamflow relative uncertainty induced by selection of climate model emissions scenario and data source was assessed by comparing the relative variability in change of projected precipitation temperature and streamflow from six gcms three rcps and three data sources hydrologic response was assessed using the swat model calibrated for conditions of an agricultural watershed in west central kansas for near future and distant future periods the following five conclusions were summarized 1 for precipitation data nearly all shifts in δmmp bias corrected vs unadjusted decreased after bias corrections by ncdc prism and nexrad but by different amounts variability was increased after bias correction in some months and decreased in other months for rcps 2 6 and 4 5 but variability was amplified in all months for rcp 8 5 this indicates that monthly response to bias correction was different among the six gcms and among the three rcps overall these results revealed the potential risk of overestimating projected precipitation without bias correction and that the magnitude of bias correction varies temporally by bias correction data source gcm and rcp 2 for temperature data bias correction by both ncdc and prism data sources decreased the gcm simulated future increases in minimum temperature but had little effect on the gcm simulated future increases in maximum temperature for all months and rcps 3 for streamflow outputs bias correction by each of the three data sources changed δmmq differently overall relative to ncdc future streamflow simulated using prism bias correction had the greatest decrease and the least variation in δmmq throughout the year whereas nexrad was intermediate in both magnitude of decrease and variation in δmmq 4 the changes in magnitude of future streamflow δamq were different from the changes in either precipitation or temperatures in the same periods likely due to the hydrologic interaction of precipitation and temperature via et on streamflow variability of change in streamflow δamq indicated high sensitivity to change in precipitation δamp but magnitude direction and variability of change in streamflow also demonstrated an effect of temperature 5 overall the sensitivity of streamflow to selection of bias correction data source was found to be less than the sensitivity to selection of gcm and greater than sensitivity to selection of rcp acknowledgments this work was

6833,a storm composed of two delayed cells hit the monte antelao slopes dolomites north eastern italy in the early morning of july 18th 2009 the resulting runoff triggered two consecutive debris flows along the rovina di cancia channel the detailed topographic data collected before and just after this event allowed an accurate reconstruction of the morphological changes experienced by the channel bed these data are here used as benchmark to test the ability of numerical models to reproduce the dynamics of a real event taking into account the morphology changes of the channel bed the aim is to provide an efficient model for engineering applications on large scales such as those required by debris flow hazard assessment a rainfall runoff transformation is applied to reconstruct the solid liquid hydrograph needed for computing the debris flow propagation two routing models are used a gis based movable bed model and a widely used fixed bed model flo 2d although similar results are obtained in terms of areas subjected to deposition significant differences emerge in terms of mobilized volumes only the simulation of both the deposition and entrainment processes allows to reliably reproduce the sediment volumes estimated from the pre and post event topographic data this information is fundamental in any hazard assessment because the volume of sediment mobilized by debris flow events exerts a fundamental control on the extension of areas subjected to inundation and on the thickness of sediment deposits the capability to reproduce correctly the mobilized volumes also entails a more reliable simulation of the evolution of the peak and volume of the solid liquid hydrograph as the debris flow propagates downstream allowing the identification of the channel reach where banks could be overflowed conversely adopting a fixed bed model leads mainly to an underestimation of the both the transported sediments volumes and the area subjected to deposition as a consequence the maximum debris flow depth in the portion of the channel subjected to erosion is underestimated and that in the portion of the channel subjected to deposition is overestimated all these types of information are of great importance for an effective hazard assessment keywords debris flows propagation modeling comparative hazard assessment channel bed morphodynamics 1 introduction in channel debris flows are usually generated in narrow valleys by high intensity rainfalls able to produce the runoff needed for mobilizing large enough quantities of sediment they are frequently observed in many locations of the italian alps and in other similar geological contexts all around the world imaizumi et al 2006 cannon et al 2008 coe et al 2008 mccoy et al 2012 theule et al 2012 hurlimann et al 2014 ma et al 2018 due to the destructive power these phenomena could result in high socio economic impacts fuchs et al 2007 santi et al 2011 thiene et al 2017 stancanelli and musumeci 2018 the overall process of debris flow initiation could be summarized as follows the rainfall generates a runoff over the debris channel bed entraining the sediments available on it and dispersing them through the flow depth a mixture of sediment and muddy fluid eventually forms giving rise to a debris flow surge composed by a front with a usually higher sediment concentration a body and a more diluted tail navratil et al 2013 kean et al 2013 stancanelli et al 2015 the content of fines influences the viscosity of the muddy fluid and consequently the rheology of the debris flow mixture in mountain basins in which the channel bed is mainly composed by gravel the viscosity of the muddy fluid is close to that of water and the debris flow dynamics is essentially controlled by grain collisions stony debris flows conversely in the presence of high content of fines the debris flow rheology strongly relies on the viscosity of the muddy fluid viscous debris flow the complexity of the mechanisms controlling the various phases triggering propagation and deposition of a debris flow calls for an integrated modelling framework including hydrological rheological and geological information and reliable field data for both calibration and validation many models used in engineering applications to compute debris flow propagation consider a single phase fluid matrix with a specific rheological law based on empirical coefficients depending on the relative importance of the various stress generating mechanisms collisions friction viscosity the debris flow mixture is described using different rheological laws for example as a visco plastic bingham fluid de blasio et al 2004 a collision dominated mixture armanini et al 2009 a voellmy fluid quan luna et al 2012 hussin et al 2012 frank et al 2015 more sophisticated models have been also developed to account for the changes in flow properties with time among others here we recall the approach put forward by iverson and george 2014 which combines a pore pressure dependent coulomb friction law with a term accounting for viscous resistance in the interstitial fluid and the framework developed by armanini et al 2014 which uses a frictional model to satisfy the coulombian condition at the boundary with the loose static bed and adopts the kinetic theory to describe the collision dominated flow near to the free surface nevertheless the computational costs have so far restricted the use of refined models to the reproduction of flume experiments suitably simplified models have thus to be considered for the development of hazard assessments on relatively large regional scales in the absence of significant erosion rates single phase models adopting a viscous or coulomb stress rheology have been demonstrated to give good results when applied to landslide masses that transform into debris flows or to describe the collapse of landslide dams liu and wang 2006 rickenmann et al 2006 pirulli 2010 pudasaini 2012 di cristo et al 2014 iverson and george 2014 tiranti and deangeli 2015 clearly they are not able to describe debris flows generated by the entrainment of bed sediment by surface runoff as in the case of in channel debris flows in order to improve the accuracy of predictions sediment entrainment needs to be modeled armanini et al 2009 quan luna et al 2012 hussin et al 2012 frank et al 2015 even though various models have been recently proposed to simulate debris flow propagation in the presence of erosion and deposition e g brufau et al 2000 chen et al 2006 medina et al 2008 armanini et al 2009 hussin et al 2012 quan luna et al 2012 frank et al 2015 cuomo et al 2016 the lack of reliable field estimates of eroded deposited volumes has so far prevented a thorough evaluation of their performances in the present contribution we try to fill this gap thanks to the availability of a detailed set of field data including rain gauge information and topographic bed surveys collected at rovina di cancia debris channel located in the italian dolomites specifically the data refer to the event occurred on july 18th 2009 that caused two consecutive debris flow surges with relevant impact in terms of damages and fatalities we use these data to evaluate the importance of accounting for erosion processes in engineering applications such as hazard assessment of in channel debris flows the runoff needed to determine the sediment liquid hydrograph is here computed by using a rainfall runoff transformation specifically designed and tested for headwater rocky basins gregoretti et al 2016a the hydrographs resulting from the formative process of the solid liquid surge are routed downstream by using two different models an updated version of the gis based kinematic model by gregoretti et al 2016b and a widely adopted fixed bed model flo 2d o brien et al 1993 simulation results are finally compared with the erosion and deposition patterns obtained from the difference between pre and post event topographic surveys the considered kinematic model is found to ensure robust and computationally efficient computations and highlights the spatio temporal distribution of erosion patterns this knowledge is crucial for reliable hazard assessment and improves the information given by empirical approaches iverson et al 1998 rickenmann 1999 godt and coe 2007 santi et al 2008 youberg et al 2014 reid et al 2016 the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the material and methods divided in four sub sections concerning the morphological and sedimentological features of the rovina di cancia site the features of the debris flow events occurred thereby on july 18th 2009 the collected data and the hydrological estimates and the routing modeling the results of simulations are presented in section 3 while section 4 discusses the issues related to the modeling of erosion and deposition finally section 5 presents some conclusions 2 material and methods 2 1 the study site the rovina di cancia debris channel originates at the scree just below the salvella fork 2500 m a s l on the monte antelao dolomites north eastern italy and ends just upstream the village of borca di cadore fig 1 at an elevation of 1320 m a s l the channel joins with the bus de diau creek fig 1a which provides mainly a liquid discharge after the debris flow events of july 2nd 1994 and august 7th 1996 that flooded the borca di cadore village a gabion weir 1013 m a s l and a circular retaining basin 1001 m a s l delimited downstream by a gabion wall were built at the end of the debris flow channel fig 1b a flat depositional area was also built just upstream 1344 m a s l of the confluence with the bus de diau creek to reduce the solid content of the upcoming debris flows fig 1a the debris channel reach located upstream of 1666 m a s l is incised on the scree slope and is characterized by relatively narrow cross sections mean width 8 m gregoretti and dalla fontana 2008 the bed includes giant and big boulders of size up to the channel width that prevent the formation of consistent sediment liquid surges fig 1c conversely a large amount of debris material can be stored within the bed of the channel segment placed between 1666 and 1344 m a s l fig 1d debris flows or hyperconcentrated flows can generate there depending on the erosion capacity of the overflowing water runoff gregoretti and dalla fontana 2008 specifically the channel bed material is mainly supplied by shallow failures of the channel banks and has time to consolidate just downstream the flat area located at 1344 m a s l the bus de diau creek provides a predominantly liquid contribute further downstream also as a consequence of the protection structures built since 1960s the bed is composed by less packed i e lower dry sediment concentration sediments deposited by former debris flow events the area of the basin where the formative runoff discharges form consists of two sub basins salvella and bus de diau as depicted in fig 1 the first area 0 65 km2 includes the upper portion of the rovina di cancia channel where the debris flows usually form the closure section is at an elevation of 1666 m the terrain is characterized by an abundant presence of vegetated scree deposits 27 of the area and bare loose debris 22 the second sub basin area 0 99 km2 is that dissected by the bus de diau creek and has the closure section at the confluence with the rovina di cancia channel 1320 m a s l it is dominated by dolomite scree outcrops subcrops 62 of the area with vegetated patches on top while bare scree accounts for only 5 of the sub basin surface the debris flows are usually triggered along the rovina di cancia channel close to the outlet of the salvella sub basin the bus de diau sub basin contributes to the sediment liquid surge with an essentially liquid discharge owing to its morphological and geological configuration in particular because of the larger sub basin area the runoff hydrographs produced by the bus de diau creek have larger peak and volume table 1 shows the main morphological characteristics of the two sub basins grain size analysis carried out through the frequency by weight method indicate that on average the material sampled in the debris flow initiation area i e between 1666 and 1344 m a s l is composed by 1 clay d 0 002 mm 4 silt 0 002 d 0 063 mm 22 sand 0 063 d 2 mm 71 gravel 2 d 63 mm and 2 cobbles 63 d 200 mm with a mean density ρ s 2 56 kg m3 and a volumetric concentration of the dry bed c 0 75 a value of c 0 62 is instead assumed for the less packed sediment deposits delivered by debris flows downstream of the initiation area the surveyed material is very similar to that collected in the initiation area of chiapuzza debris flows located about 3 km far from rovina di cancia for which the static friction angle φ s estimated through triaxial tests is about 39 the quasi static friction angle φ qs is taken equal to 34 i e about 5 smaller than static friction angle on the basis of the information provided by the flume experiments of lanzoni et al 2017 the quite low percentage of clay and silt 5 implies that the interstitial fluid has a viscosity similar to that of water as a results grain collisions rather than interstitial fluid viscosity control the rheology of the mixture leading to debris flows of the stony type takahashi 2007 2 2 the debris flow event of july 18th 2009 the debris flow occurred in the early morning of july 18th 2009 was triggered by a storm characterized by two distinct cells fig 2 with a time lag of approximately 20 min that was recorded by a rain gauge just below the initiation area fig 1 before the event the channel bed was likely in a dry condition a total rainfall depth of 1 6 mm was in fact observed in the previous five days dry moisture conditions the first cell caused a rainfall depth of 11 6 mm in 5 min intensity 140 mm h and produced a runoff able to entrain the material laying within the debris channel bed the resulting sediment liquid wave reached the flat depositional area at 1344 m a s l where the solid part of the mixture mostly stopped as suggested by post event analysis see section 2 4 and in accordance with the description provided by deganutti and tecca 2013 the hydrological computations reported in section 2 4 confirm the small volume of the superficial runoff and consequently the low magnitude of the debris flow associated to the first storm cell a similar behavior was exhibited by other two debris flows occurred in july and august 2013 degetto et al 2015 characterized by larger values of the simulated runoff peak 1 7 3 7 m3 s and volume 2800 3700 m3 the rainfall depth produced by the second storm cell was of 17 mm in 25 min mean intensity 40 mm h this precipitation produced a runoff able to entrain a considerable quantity of bed debris see section 2 4 the resulting sediment liquid surge routed downstream without a significative reduction of the solid content when passing through the flat depositional area at 1344 m a s l that was already partially occupied by the sediment delivered there by the first debris flow the overall volume of the mobilized sediment progressively increased as the debris flow propagated along the channel eventually the debris flow reached the retaining wall located at 1013 m a s l and opened a breach on its left side fig 1b the sediment liquid flow filled progressively the downstream retaining basin 1001 m a s l and after a while around 4 01 a m according to a eye witness a breach formed on the crest of the downstream gabion wall fig 1b an overtopping muddy surge hit the houses just downstream of the basin causing two deaths and considerable damages 2 3 collected data topographical surveys of the rovina di cancia channel were carried out before and just after the event of july 18th 2009 a total station in a georeferenced local system was used to collect data from the flat depositional area at 1344 m a s l to the retaining basin at 1001 m a s l this information was complemented with two lidar flights held in may 2009 and october 2011 covering the entire basin note that during the first lidar flight the portion of the basin until 1344 m a s l was covered by snow which prevented the acquisition of reliable elevation data in the following we reasonably assume that the part of the basin upstream of 1666 m a s l i e upstream of the triggering area has remained substantially unchanged during the time interval between the two surveys therefore we use the lidar data acquired in 2011 for building the dems used in the hydrological calculations while the lidar data collected in 2009 are used for the debris flow routing simulation from a location just upstream the confluence at 1333 m a s l to the borca di cadore village the elevation data acquired with the total station were used to build the pre and post event dem s and their difference provided the deposition erosion maps the accuracy of these two dems mean error 0 08 m standard deviation 0 23 m was evaluated through the methodology proposed by höhle and putuckova 2011 the dem data were checked in correspondence of selected homogeneously distributed control points sampled during another independent gps survey in the areas that remained unchanged and not used for building the two dems for the routing simulation we did not use the dem from total station elevation data because the surveyed points have a lower density than those of lidar 2009 and because their extent does not cover the area downstream the retaining basin fig 3 shows the variation of the longitudinal channel profile a and the resulting deposition and erosion depths b grouped in classes of 2 m size i e about eight times the standard deviation two areas zone i appear to be mainly subject to erosion the upper portion of the debris flow channel yielding about 60 of the eroded volume and the 100 m long reach upstream of the gabion weir located at 1013 m a s l yielding about 20 of the eroded volume deposition mainly occurs upstream of the retaining structures zone ii even though a certain amount of deposition about 30 of the total also localizes in the central portion of the debris flow channel in total the volumes deposited and eroded in zone i are 11024 m3 and 18570 m3 respectively while they amount to 24350 m3 and 550 m3 in zone ii the overall deposited and eroded volumes are then 35374 m3 and 19120 m3 their difference 16254 m3 gives an estimate of the sediment volume eroded upstream of the deposition area at 1344 m a s l and transited over it see section 3 assuming for this deposited mass a packing concentration of 0 62 yields a solid volume of 10100 m3 this material likely originated from the channel reach between 1666 m a s l and 1344 m a s l where it accumulated before the considered debris flow event as a result of bank failures subsequently subject to consolidation assuming a packing debris concentration of 0 75 and fully saturated conditions the corresponding liquid volume is estimated in about 3400 m3 finally for the sake of completeness the sum of the volume of debris material deposited on the zones i and ii 35374 m3 with that on the flat area and just upstream it covered by total station survey but also by snow during the lidar flight and for this reason not considered in the simulations is about 53000 m3 2 4 modelling approach this section describes the hydrological estimate of the runoff discharge in the upper part of the cancia basin where debris flows initiate the methodology used to reconstruct the input sediment liquid hydrograph and the models adopted to route downstream this hydrograph 2 4 1 rainfall runoff transformation the hydrological methodology used in the present study has been specifically developed for headwater rocky catchments gregoretti et al 2016a it has been tested by direct measurements of the runoff discharge at the outlet of a rocky channel incised on the cliffs of a dolomitic peak the dimai peak and indirectly by considering the debris flow runoff transit in the initiation area of another dolomitic catchment the acquabona basin the initiation areas of these two headwater catchments located 15 km and 5 km far away from the rovina di cancia basin have morphological features very similar to those investigated here the excess rainfall p e contributing to the runoff discharge is computed by means of the scs cn method suitably modified for mountain watershed by coupling it with a simplified version of the horton equation assuming a constant infiltration rate f c at each time step t j j δ t p e j is determined as 1 p ej 0 t t i a p j i a 2 p j i a s t j t i a i f c p e j 1 p j

retention s 1000 cn 10 i is the mean rainfall intensity during the time step δ t and p escs is the excess rainfall of the total precipitation computed through the scn cn method the empirical parameter cn is determined on the basis of the soil type the land use and the antecedent moisture condition amc classified as amc i dry condition amc ii standard condition amc iii wet condition excess rainfall is routed to the channel network along the steepest direction assuming a constant value of runoff velocity u depending on the terrain typology finally the water hydrograph at the closure section of the basin is determined modeling the channel routing with the matched diffusivity kinematic wave model of orlandini et al 1996 2 4 2 runoff contributing to debris flow triggering the amount of runoff contributing to form the debris flow is that exceeding a critical discharge value ensuring the entrainment of the bed sediment gregoretti et al 2016b han et al 2017 using the sedimentological and morphological data of the initiation area gregoretti and dalla fontana 2008 suggested a threshold discharge of about 1 m 3 s the sediment liquid surge triggered by this formative runoff at a given section is assumed to have a triangular shape with a quasi vertical rising limb followed by a relatively rapid falling stage in accordance with field observations berti et al 2000 zanuttigh et al 2007 kean et al 2012 this triangle shaped hydrograph can be determined defining the time to peak e g 1 min the peak value of the mixture discharge and imposing a linear decrease after the peak being the area under the hydrograph the sum of the formative runoff volume the entrained sediment volume and the volume of the fluid stored inside the voids of the eroded sediment bed the sediment liquid peak discharge q p can be estimated by the following relationship based on some series of systematic flume experiments takahashi 2007 lanzoni et al 2017 2 q p q 0 0 75 c c c s where q 0 is the formative runoff peak discharge while c and c s are the volumetric solid concentrations of the dry bed and of the debris flow the latter is computed through the relationship lanzoni et al 2017 3 c s ρ f tan θ ρ s ρ f tan φ qs tan θ where ρ f and ρ s are the densities of the liquid and solid phases θ is the channel slope and φ qs is the quasi static friction angle since q p q 0 1 the duration of the solid liquid hydrograph resulting from this procedure is smaller than that of the runoff see section 3 1 2 4 3 the modified gis based routing model the kinematic gis based cell model of gregoretti et al 2016b is here modified to account separately for the flow of the liquid and solid phases this modification ensures a better simulation of the entrainment process specifically the relevant equations express the mass and momentum conservation of the overall sediment water mixture and of the solid phase and the rate of change of bed elevation exner equation resulting from the deposition and entrainment processes here we summarize the main equations referring the interested reader to gregoretti et al 2016b for implementation details basically the flow is controlled by the relative elevations of the bed z i z k and of the water surface z i h i z k h k between a generic i cell and the eight k cells surrounding it the continuity equations read 4 a i d h i z i dt k 1 8 q ik 0 5 a i d c s h i c z i dt k 1 8 q ik 0 where a i is the planar area of the cell t is time z i is the elevation of the cell bottom h i is the flow depth c s is the volumetric solid concentration of the mixture and q ik is the discharge exchanged with the surrounding k th cell the momentum equations are simplified by assuming equal velocities for the solid and liquid phases rosatti and begnudelli 2013 and following a kinematic wave approach that has been already demonstrated to satisfactorily simulate debris flow routing in sloping channels arattano and savage 1994 di cristo et al 2014 a uniform flow equation is applied when the i th cell elevation is lower than that of the surrounding k th cell otherwise a broad crested weir equation is considered the corresponding discharges are 6 q ik δ x w i c ond h i g h z i z k l ik z i z k 7 q ik δ x s i c q 2 g h i z k 1 5 z i z k where δ x is the cell size a 0 5 c ond is the conductance coefficient c q is a discharge coefficient set equal to that of water 0 385 in the absence of specific experimental observations z i and z k are the elevations of the centers of two neighboring cells l ik is the distance between the two centers w k and s k are two weighting coefficients partitioning the flow along the eight possible flow directions depending on the bed elevations z i z k and the flow depths h i and h k the conductance coefficient c ond is defined as the ratio u u of the depth averaged velocity u to the friction velocity u it depends on the velocity and concentration profiles that establish along the sediment water column in the case of a stony debris flow takahashi 2007 where collisional stresses dominate the mixture rheology the conductance is controlled by the densities of the liquid and solid phases the depth averaged sediment concentration the particle diameter the flow depth and two empirical parameters describing the particle repulsive pressure and the ratio of shear stress to pressure stress takahashi 2007 lanzoni et al 2017 in particular c ond tends to increase as c s decreases and for larger values of the ratio h d lanzoni et al 2017 both flume experiments and field observations fig 4 suggest that c ond ranges in the interval 1 3 for channelized stony debris flows of small volume under unsteady flow conditions owing to the great variability of both c s and h along the debris surge c ond is expected to attain higher values especially in the presence of intense runoff conditions leading to the mobilization of large volumes of sediment indeed all the other relevant parameters remaining unvaried larger values of c ond imply larger velocities and hence larger sediment entrainment and smaller deposition in the present contribution we then set c ond 5 to account for the quite large solid volume mobilized by the investigated debris flow the exner equation 8 dz dt d e expresses the rate of change of bed elevation of the cell as a function of the difference between erosion e and deposition d rates these processes are controlled by the bed incline along the flow direction sin θ ik z i z k l ik or in the case of adverse slopes by the energy incline sin θ ik h i z i h k z k l ik as well as by the flow velocity following egashira et al 2001 see also brufau et al 2000 we write 9 e d i k sin α ki sin θ lim v max where k is an empirical constant ranging between 0 and 1 and v max is the value of the velocity along the steepest ik direction eq 9 can lead to unphysical conditions if not properly constrained in terms of sediment concentration and flow transport capacity erosion in fact occurs for high enough velocities v max v lim e and slope angles θ ik θ lim e and is limited by the maximum transport concentration c s 0 9 c that can be attained by the debris flow takahashi 2007 in addition field observations berger et al 2011 indicate that erosion generally occurs during the passage of the debris flow front dh dt 0 and starts before the maximum value of the flow depth is reached likewise deposition can take place only for low enough values of the flow velocity v max v lim d and of the relevant slope angle θ ik θ lim d and for sufficiently high sediment concentration c s c sd calibration of the model has been carried out in order to reproduce the observed routing time and deposition erosion patterns it provides the following values of the limiting parameters θ lim e 16 θ lim d 14 u lim e 1 8 m s and u lim d 1 8 m s k e 0 5 k d 0 1 c sd 0 005 the sensitivity analysis see table a 3 and figs a 10 a 11 in the appendix a suggests that physically plausible variations of the various parameters do not lead to significantly different results except for c ond that has greater influence clearly the values of the relevant parameters are expected to change markedly when simulating debris flows different from the stony type treated here the model equations are solved numerically by an explicit scheme after computing the time step according to the cfl stability condition the flow depth at the new time step is determined by eq 4 after calculating all the quantities at the previous time step by using eqs 6 9 after that c s is computed by using eq 5 more details on the model and its numerical discretization are reported in gregoretti et al 2016b 2 4 4 the flo 2d routing model flo 2d is a tool adopted worldwide for the simulation of debris flow phenomena and hydraulic flooding of urban areas bertolo and wieczorek 2005 boniello et al 2010 stancanelli et al 2017 stancanelli and foti 2015 the relevant equations include the conservation of mass and momentum for the bulk mixture along the considered direction of motion x 10 h t hv x 0 11 s f tan θ h x v g v x 1 g v t where s f is the friction slope tan θ is the bed slope h is the flow depth v is the depth averaged velocity g is the gravitational acceleration the flow domain is discretized into uniform square grid elements the differential forms of eqs 10 and 11 are solved through finite differences for each computational cell the discretized form of eqs 10 and 11 are solved independently along the eight potential flow directions ensuing from the considered cell the quantities h and v are related to one of the eight flow directions by choosing the steepest direction x the sediment liquid mixture is approximated as a single phase liquid assuming an empirical quadratic rheological law o brien and julien 1988 the total friction slope s f is expressed as 12 s f τ b ρ m g h k l μ b v 8 ρ m g h 2 n 2 v 2 h 4 3 where τ b is the bingham yield stress ρ m is the mixture density k l is the laminar flow resistance coefficient g is gravitational acceleration μ b is the bingham viscosity and n is the pseudo manning s resistance coefficient which accounts for both turbulent boundary friction and internal collisional stresses in particular the yield stress τ b the dynamic viscosity μ b and the resistance coefficient n are influenced by the sediment concentration and therefore can be described by the following equations o brien and julien 1988 o brien 2007 13 τ b α 1 e β 1 c s μ b α 2 e β 2 c s n n t 0 538 e 6 0896 c s where c s is the solid volumetric concentration of the mixture α 1 β 1 α 2 and β 2 are empirical coefficients defined by laboratory experiments and n t is the turbulent n value the values of these parameters α 1 0 00632 poises β 1 19 9 α 2 0 000707 dyn cm 2 β 2 29 8 have been selected in order to reproduce the observed routing time they correspond to those reported by o brien and julien 1988 for a debris flow composed of gravel with a muddy fluid phase containing a low percentage of clay 4 more detailed information about the constitutive fluid equations adopted in the model and the numerical scheme used to solve the continuity and momentum equations can be found in o brien 2007 3 simulations debris flow occurred at rovina di cancia on the 18th of july 2009 is the result of three consecutive physical processes the transformation of rainfall in runoff the entrainment of debris material present on the channel bed by this runoff and the downstream propagation of the sediment liquid mixture thus formed the first two processes are responsible for the formation of a debris flow surge that can be described through a sediment liquid hydrograph which in turn represents the input for investigating the propagation phase the sediment liquid hydrograph is evaluated using the methodolgy proposed at section 2 4 2 where runoff is estimated by means of the model of gregoretti et al 2016a the downstream routing of this hydrograph is simulated by applying a bi phase modified version of a gis based model gregoretti et al 2016b and the flo 2d model o brien et al 1993 these two propagation models differ for the constitutive relations used to model the stress generating mechanisms collisional versus empirical quadratic laws and for the capability or not to describe the bed erosion processes 3 1 runoff formation and debris flow triggering the rainfalls associated with the two storm cells determined the formation of two distinct consecutive runoff hydrographs see fig 2 in the following we focus our attention on the second hydrograph responsible for the debris flow that after reaching the retaining basin at 1001 m a s l breached the downstream gabion walls and hit the borca di cadore village the former generated a less intense debris flow that likely stopped at the flat depositional area located at 1344 m a s l just upstream of the confluence of the rovina di cancia channel with the bus de diau creek the parameters adopted for the hydrological estimates are reported in table 2 note that the antecedent moisture condition differs for the two storms for the first a dry conditions amc i has been assumed because of the small amount of rainfall 1 6 mm observed in the previous five days for the second a standard condition amc ii is considered owing to the significant rainfall depth 24 5 mm associated with the first rainstorm the results of the hydrological estimates are shown in fig 5 in the salvella sub basin the runoff produced by the first rainstorm total volume 1000 m3 is more than 80 smaller than that corresponding to the second rainstorm total volume 4700 m3 as a result the corresponding runoff volume contributing to the debris flow triggered by the first rainfall event not shown in fig 5 for simplicity is definitely much smaller than that resulting from the second rainfall cell 580 m3 as compared to 3700 m3 this supports the idea that the first debris flow occurred on july 18th 2009 had a relatively low magnitude that led it to stop at the depositional area at 1344 m a s l importantly the peak of the second runoff hydrograph generated by the bus de diau sub basin 6 3 m3 s results five minutes delayed with respect to that generated in the cancia channel sub basin this delay is related to the stretched shape of the bus de diau sub basin implying much longer flow paths the absence of any pre and post event topographical surveys from the initiation area at 1666 m a s l to the flat depositional area at 1344 m a s l excluded prevented any simulation of debris flow triggering we thus used the information reported in section 2 4 2 to reconstruct the solid liquid hydrograph to be routed downstream together that predominantly liquid 4700 m3 delivered by the bus de diau sub basin fig 5 recalling that section 2 3 the solid and water volumes supplied by the channel reach between 1666 and 1344 m a s l have been estimated in 10100 m3 and 3400 m3 respectively and that the runoff coming from the salvella sub basin is about 3700 m3 yields a solid liquid hydrograph of 17200 m3 this hydrograph is assumed to have a triangular shape and a raising limb of about 1 min section 2 4 2 its peak computed through eq 2 is q p 32 3 m 3 s the duration ensuring a solid liquid volume of 17200 m3 is 17 min note that the value of c s 0 67 used in eq 2 is that resulting from the relation eq 3 while the values of c 0 75 θ 19 5 and φ qs 34 needed in the computations are those discussed in section 2 1 3 2 modeling the debris flow event the sediment liquid hydrograph and the liquid hydrograph from bus de diau creek computed in the previous section were routed downstream of the junction of the rovina di cancia channel with the bus de diau creek by using the models described in sections 2 4 3 and 2 4 4 a grid system with square cells is adopted with a size of 1 1 m in the case of the gis based model and of 3 3 m in the case of the flo 2d model the erosion and deposition depths simulated with the gis based kinematic model are shown in fig 6 where the areas of the channel bed affected by erosion and deposition are easily recognizable the comparison with the observed erosion deposition patterns of fig 3 suggests that deposition is well reproduced both in terms of extension and magnitude i e deposition depth on the other hand erosion tends to be underestimated especially in the channel reach located just upstream of the final retaining basin where the volume of eroded sediment is approximately equal to 20 of the total eroded volume estimated from topographic surveys note that erosion generally takes place during the passage of the debris flow front and can determine a local decrease in channel slope which in turn promotes sediment deposition the spatial distribution of the in channel deposition depth computed by means of the flo 2d model is reported in fig 7 clearly the inability of flo 2d to describe erosion implies that also the deposition pattern is not well reproduced and tends to be underestimated both along the channel and upstream of the retaining structures indeed in case of fixed bed conditions the mechanical energy associated with the debris flow surge is higher since no energy is used to erode the sediment bed as a result deposition is delayed and reduced 4 discussion although the two models used to simulate the propagation are based on different rheological laws the results obtained in terms of debris flow paths and more in general of inundation areas are similar suggesting that the patterns are mainly influenced by the gravity and the topography i e slope rather than the rheology fig 8 shows a quantitative comparison in terms of observed a o and computed a c areas subjected to deposition erosion as anticipated by the visual inspection of figure 6 the overlapping between observed and computed areas a oc is more satisfactory for deposition than for erosion the ratio between a oc and the observed a o deposition area a oc a o d is 0 72 for the gis based and 0 53 for the flo 2d models in the case of erosion this ratio a oc a o e becomes 0 33 and 0 0 fixed bed model respectively when considering the correct reproduction of deposition and erosion depths these percentages decrease to 42 deposition and 14 erosion in the case of the gis based model and to 22 deposition and 0 erosion in the case of the flo 2d model the two models obviously give quite different results in terms of deposited eroded sediment volumes owing to the fixed bed assumption intrinsic to the flo 2d model the ratio between simulated and observed sediment volumes are v c v o d 0 94 for deposition and v c v o e 0 9 for erosion when using the gis based model while when using the flo 2d model these ratios becomes v c v o d 0 24 and v c v o e 0 these results can be explained by the difficulty of simulating properly the erosion produced by a debris flow running over a loose sediment bed bouchut et al 2008 the quantitative assessments of the exchange of mass between the flowing sediment fluid mixture and the underlying sediment bed is still an open issue even though some formulations have been already proposed in the literature mangeney et al 2010 iverson 2012 iverson and ouyang 2015 kang and chan 2017 the present contribution provides a further attempt to deal with this complex problem for example erosion is strongly affected by sediment heterogeneity not modeled here indeed sediment entrainment takes place mainly during the passage of the front as observed in field by berger et al 2011 and mccoy et al 2012 heterogeneity of material laying on the bed matters as well with clast of large size that are much more difficult to entrain fig 9 describes clearly the differences that arise in terms of flow depth when erosion is accounted for or not in the case of a fixed bed condition flo 2d model the maximum flow depth keeps almost constant along the debris flow channel fig 9a no overall differences are also recognizable by comparing the temporal evolution of the cross sectionally averaged flow depth in a number of sections fig 9b conversely in the presence of a mobile bed the maximum debris flow depth turns out to vary significantly along the channel higher depths are observed in the upper part of the basin characterized by a higher slope and a large availability of sediment to be entrained fig 9c also the form of the temporal distribution of the mean flow depth observed at fixed sections shows a great variability fig 9d in particular when compared to the fixed bed case the peak of the flow depth hydrograph reduces progressively as the debris flow propagates downstream moving from higher slopes where erosion mainly occurs to smaller slopes where deposition prevails the comparison of the results provided by the two models thus highlights the importance of considering the mobile bed condition when simulating in channel debris flows while the extension of the areas affected by the debris transit and deposit does not change dramatically fig 9 adopting a fixed bed model leads to an underestimation by 25 of the maximum debris flow depth in the upper channel portion and to an even much larger overestimation by 51 in the lower channel reaches an underestimation is also remarked for the simulation of observed deposition area 53 and of observed sediment volume 24 it is also important to observe that the less demanding computational effort required by the gis based kinematic model allows to increase the spatial resolution 1 1 m with respect to that used for flo 2d 3 3 m using a 3 m grid size also for the gis based model produces very similar deposition and erosion patterns not shown here for the sake of brevity areas and to a less extent volumes while the routing time tends to reduce this is due to the topographic smoothing caused by a three times larger grid size which in turn implicates larger slopes and shorter flow paths and consequently an increased propagation speed 5 conclusions the measurements carried out with reference to the debris flows occurred at cancia on july 18th 2009 provide a unique set of data that can help in understanding the complexity embedded in this kind of phenomena and can be profitably used to test and develop physics based models the main conclusions of the present work can be summarized as follows in small dolomitic watersheds as cancia debris flows are usually triggered by intense rainfalls produced by concentrated and fast moving storm cells the debris flow inception however requires a sufficiently intense surface runoff and the availability of loose sediment in the case study considered here rainfall data indicate the presence of two well separated and subsequent rainfall events with comparable depth of which only the second caused a debris flow that was able to reach the end of the channel overflowing the retaining basin located there the reconstruction of the sediment liquid hydrograph to be used as input to debris flow routing models needs a reliable estimate of the sediment volume entrained by the surface runoff obtained here from the detailed topographic data collected before and after the investigated debris flow events and a rainfall runoff relationship specifically developed for headwater mountain catchments a reliable simulation of debris flow routing requires that both erosion and deposition processes are accounted for the availability of detailed data about the morphological changes produced by a debris flow is thus fundamental to evaluate the performance of a given routing model in terms of both eroded deposited areas and eroded deposited volumes in channel debris flow propagation simulated by assuming either fixed bed no erosion or mobile bed erosion allowed conditions produces similar results in terms of areas subjected to deposition but significant differences in terms of mobilized volumes assuming a fixed bed condition does not allow to reproduce the progressive modifications experienced by the debris flow hydrograph as it moves downstream and consequently can produce significant errors when evaluating the mobilized sediment volumes as well as the dynamic features of the flow e g impact forces which are fundamental for reliable hazard assessments the movable bed gis based kinematic model used here to simulate the in channel debris flow propagation appears to describe the observed phenomenon with reasonable accuracy given also the complexity of the triggering conditions and the uncertainties in the rheological regime its simplicity and robustness makes it a tool for analyzing hazard scenarios at the basin and or regional scales as well as for predicting imminent scenarios after an alert given by now casting the model can also be interfaced with gis platforms because of its raster based nature clearly much more sophisticated models e g two dimensional finite volume models as those developed by armanini et al 2009 and frank et al 2015 can be used to propagate downstream the sediment liquid debris flow hydrograph in any case a correct reproduction not only of the debris flow depth but also of the spatial distribution of erosion deposition depths

sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis reported here follows closely the framework developed by hussin et al 2012 and gregoretti et al 2016b essentially any relevant parameter of the a given model is varied in a physically plausible range keeping all the other parameters unchanged see the dataset in the supplementary material the set of parameters used as reference is that resulting from calibration i e that ensuring the overall best matching between a number of computed and observed quantities in the present case we focus our attention on the areas subjected to deposition and or erosion and the corresponding volumes the overall agreement between computer and simulated quantities is measured by introducing the dimensionless performance described below here generalized to account for erosion and deposition the first parameter is the fit index f proposed by bates and de roo 2000 a 1 f a co d a co e a co a o a c d a co a o a c e ranging between 0 no fit and 1 perfect fit here a o and a c denote the observed and computed areas a co is the measure of their overlapping part and the sub fixes e and d indicate erosion and deposition respectively the second parameter is the evaluation factor ω ψ introduced by scheidl and rickenman 2010 here generalized to account for the presence of both deposition and erosion it is defined as a 2 ω ψ ψ co d ψ co e ψ c d ψ c e ψ o d ψ o e ψ co ψ o d ψ co ψ o d with ψ equal to either a or v the first term between square brackets on the right side of eq a 2 represents a positive accuracy while the second and third terms between square brackets denote negative and missing accuracies respectively scheidl and rickenman 2010 in the case of a perfect fit these latter two terms are identically equal and ω ψ 1 in the case of no fit ψ co d ψ co e 0 and hence ω become negative the sum ω ω a ω v accounts for the ability of the model to reproduce correctly both the observed areas and volumes in the following we assume that f 0 5 and ω 0 indicate an intermediate condition between no fit and perfect fit while larger values represent acceptably good results the parameters considered in the analysis are c ond θ lim d e u lim d e k d k e table a 3 summarizes their best fitting values and the ranges of variation considered in the sensitivity analysis fig a 10 shows the results of the sensitivity analysis carried out by varying the parameter c ond and keeping fixed all others it clearly emerges the importance of selecting correctly the conductance for maximizing both the indexes f and ω on the other hand fig a 11 shows the sensitivity analysis in terms of the parameters controlling erosion and deposition when c ond is maintained fixed the variability of the results with respect to the best fit values is quite limited the values resulting from the calibration of the gis based kinematic model and taken as reference are reported in the first line of table a 3 while the second line of this table shows the range of parameter variation used for the sensitivity analysis the values adopted for the critical angles of deposition and erosion 14 and 16 respectively were selected on the basis of the laboratory experiments carried out by lanzoni et al 2017 for coarse grained debris flows and field observations gregoretti et al 2016b for this reasons we varied them in small intervals 12 15 deposition and 15 17 erosion in presence of erosion we should also consider the effect of the simulation of erosion on that of deposition therefore we introduce the new following index id equal to the ratio between the sum of the input sediment volume voc vo d voc vo e with the simulated eroded volume voc vc e and the observed deposited volume voc vo d a 3 i d 1 v o v c e v oc v o d it evaluates the error on the sediment eroded volume difference between the eroded volumes observed but not simulated volume and simulated but not observed respect to the sediment deposited volume values exhibited by results of simulations range mostly around 1 0 1 1 if the simulated eroded volume coincides with that observed this ensures a no substantial influence of the error of simulated erosion on deposition notation the

6833,a storm composed of two delayed cells hit the monte antelao slopes dolomites north eastern italy in the early morning of july 18th 2009 the resulting runoff triggered two consecutive debris flows along the rovina di cancia channel the detailed topographic data collected before and just after this event allowed an accurate reconstruction of the morphological changes experienced by the channel bed these data are here used as benchmark to test the ability of numerical models to reproduce the dynamics of a real event taking into account the morphology changes of the channel bed the aim is to provide an efficient model for engineering applications on large scales such as those required by debris flow hazard assessment a rainfall runoff transformation is applied to reconstruct the solid liquid hydrograph needed for computing the debris flow propagation two routing models are used a gis based movable bed model and a widely used fixed bed model flo 2d although similar results are obtained in terms of areas subjected to deposition significant differences emerge in terms of mobilized volumes only the simulation of both the deposition and entrainment processes allows to reliably reproduce the sediment volumes estimated from the pre and post event topographic data this information is fundamental in any hazard assessment because the volume of sediment mobilized by debris flow events exerts a fundamental control on the extension of areas subjected to inundation and on the thickness of sediment deposits the capability to reproduce correctly the mobilized volumes also entails a more reliable simulation of the evolution of the peak and volume of the solid liquid hydrograph as the debris flow propagates downstream allowing the identification of the channel reach where banks could be overflowed conversely adopting a fixed bed model leads mainly to an underestimation of the both the transported sediments volumes and the area subjected to deposition as a consequence the maximum debris flow depth in the portion of the channel subjected to erosion is underestimated and that in the portion of the channel subjected to deposition is overestimated all these types of information are of great importance for an effective hazard assessment keywords debris flows propagation modeling comparative hazard assessment channel bed morphodynamics 1 introduction in channel debris flows are usually generated in narrow valleys by high intensity rainfalls able to produce the runoff needed for mobilizing large enough quantities of sediment they are frequently observed in many locations of the italian alps and in other similar geological contexts all around the world imaizumi et al 2006 cannon et al 2008 coe et al 2008 mccoy et al 2012 theule et al 2012 hurlimann et al 2014 ma et al 2018 due to the destructive power these phenomena could result in high socio economic impacts fuchs et al 2007 santi et al 2011 thiene et al 2017 stancanelli and musumeci 2018 the overall process of debris flow initiation could be summarized as follows the rainfall generates a runoff over the debris channel bed entraining the sediments available on it and dispersing them through the flow depth a mixture of sediment and muddy fluid eventually forms giving rise to a debris flow surge composed by a front with a usually higher sediment concentration a body and a more diluted tail navratil et al 2013 kean et al 2013 stancanelli et al 2015 the content of fines influences the viscosity of the muddy fluid and consequently the rheology of the debris flow mixture in mountain basins in which the channel bed is mainly composed by gravel the viscosity of the muddy fluid is close to that of water and the debris flow dynamics is essentially controlled by grain collisions stony debris flows conversely in the presence of high content of fines the debris flow rheology strongly relies on the viscosity of the muddy fluid viscous debris flow the complexity of the mechanisms controlling the various phases triggering propagation and deposition of a debris flow calls for an integrated modelling framework including hydrological rheological and geological information and reliable field data for both calibration and validation many models used in engineering applications to compute debris flow propagation consider a single phase fluid matrix with a specific rheological law based on empirical coefficients depending on the relative importance of the various stress generating mechanisms collisions friction viscosity the debris flow mixture is described using different rheological laws for example as a visco plastic bingham fluid de blasio et al 2004 a collision dominated mixture armanini et al 2009 a voellmy fluid quan luna et al 2012 hussin et al 2012 frank et al 2015 more sophisticated models have been also developed to account for the changes in flow properties with time among others here we recall the approach put forward by iverson and george 2014 which combines a pore pressure dependent coulomb friction law with a term accounting for viscous resistance in the interstitial fluid and the framework developed by armanini et al 2014 which uses a frictional model to satisfy the coulombian condition at the boundary with the loose static bed and adopts the kinetic theory to describe the collision dominated flow near to the free surface nevertheless the computational costs have so far restricted the use of refined models to the reproduction of flume experiments suitably simplified models have thus to be considered for the development of hazard assessments on relatively large regional scales in the absence of significant erosion rates single phase models adopting a viscous or coulomb stress rheology have been demonstrated to give good results when applied to landslide masses that transform into debris flows or to describe the collapse of landslide dams liu and wang 2006 rickenmann et al 2006 pirulli 2010 pudasaini 2012 di cristo et al 2014 iverson and george 2014 tiranti and deangeli 2015 clearly they are not able to describe debris flows generated by the entrainment of bed sediment by surface runoff as in the case of in channel debris flows in order to improve the accuracy of predictions sediment entrainment needs to be modeled armanini et al 2009 quan luna et al 2012 hussin et al 2012 frank et al 2015 even though various models have been recently proposed to simulate debris flow propagation in the presence of erosion and deposition e g brufau et al 2000 chen et al 2006 medina et al 2008 armanini et al 2009 hussin et al 2012 quan luna et al 2012 frank et al 2015 cuomo et al 2016 the lack of reliable field estimates of eroded deposited volumes has so far prevented a thorough evaluation of their performances in the present contribution we try to fill this gap thanks to the availability of a detailed set of field data including rain gauge information and topographic bed surveys collected at rovina di cancia debris channel located in the italian dolomites specifically the data refer to the event occurred on july 18th 2009 that caused two consecutive debris flow surges with relevant impact in terms of damages and fatalities we use these data to evaluate the importance of accounting for erosion processes in engineering applications such as hazard assessment of in channel debris flows the runoff needed to determine the sediment liquid hydrograph is here computed by using a rainfall runoff transformation specifically designed and tested for headwater rocky basins gregoretti et al 2016a the hydrographs resulting from the formative process of the solid liquid surge are routed downstream by using two different models an updated version of the gis based kinematic model by gregoretti et al 2016b and a widely adopted fixed bed model flo 2d o brien et al 1993 simulation results are finally compared with the erosion and deposition patterns obtained from the difference between pre and post event topographic surveys the considered kinematic model is found to ensure robust and computationally efficient computations and highlights the spatio temporal distribution of erosion patterns this knowledge is crucial for reliable hazard assessment and improves the information given by empirical approaches iverson et al 1998 rickenmann 1999 godt and coe 2007 santi et al 2008 youberg et al 2014 reid et al 2016 the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the material and methods divided in four sub sections concerning the morphological and sedimentological features of the rovina di cancia site the features of the debris flow events occurred thereby on july 18th 2009 the collected data and the hydrological estimates and the routing modeling the results of simulations are presented in section 3 while section 4 discusses the issues related to the modeling of erosion and deposition finally section 5 presents some conclusions 2 material and methods 2 1 the study site the rovina di cancia debris channel originates at the scree just below the salvella fork 2500 m a s l on the monte antelao dolomites north eastern italy and ends just upstream the village of borca di cadore fig 1 at an elevation of 1320 m a s l the channel joins with the bus de diau creek fig 1a which provides mainly a liquid discharge after the debris flow events of july 2nd 1994 and august 7th 1996 that flooded the borca di cadore village a gabion weir 1013 m a s l and a circular retaining basin 1001 m a s l delimited downstream by a gabion wall were built at the end of the debris flow channel fig 1b a flat depositional area was also built just upstream 1344 m a s l of the confluence with the bus de diau creek to reduce the solid content of the upcoming debris flows fig 1a the debris channel reach located upstream of 1666 m a s l is incised on the scree slope and is characterized by relatively narrow cross sections mean width 8 m gregoretti and dalla fontana 2008 the bed includes giant and big boulders of size up to the channel width that prevent the formation of consistent sediment liquid surges fig 1c conversely a large amount of debris material can be stored within the bed of the channel segment placed between 1666 and 1344 m a s l fig 1d debris flows or hyperconcentrated flows can generate there depending on the erosion capacity of the overflowing water runoff gregoretti and dalla fontana 2008 specifically the channel bed material is mainly supplied by shallow failures of the channel banks and has time to consolidate just downstream the flat area located at 1344 m a s l the bus de diau creek provides a predominantly liquid contribute further downstream also as a consequence of the protection structures built since 1960s the bed is composed by less packed i e lower dry sediment concentration sediments deposited by former debris flow events the area of the basin where the formative runoff discharges form consists of two sub basins salvella and bus de diau as depicted in fig 1 the first area 0 65 km2 includes the upper portion of the rovina di cancia channel where the debris flows usually form the closure section is at an elevation of 1666 m the terrain is characterized by an abundant presence of vegetated scree deposits 27 of the area and bare loose debris 22 the second sub basin area 0 99 km2 is that dissected by the bus de diau creek and has the closure section at the confluence with the rovina di cancia channel 1320 m a s l it is dominated by dolomite scree outcrops subcrops 62 of the area with vegetated patches on top while bare scree accounts for only 5 of the sub basin surface the debris flows are usually triggered along the rovina di cancia channel close to the outlet of the salvella sub basin the bus de diau sub basin contributes to the sediment liquid surge with an essentially liquid discharge owing to its morphological and geological configuration in particular because of the larger sub basin area the runoff hydrographs produced by the bus de diau creek have larger peak and volume table 1 shows the main morphological characteristics of the two sub basins grain size analysis carried out through the frequency by weight method indicate that on average the material sampled in the debris flow initiation area i e between 1666 and 1344 m a s l is composed by 1 clay d 0 002 mm 4 silt 0 002 d 0 063 mm 22 sand 0 063 d 2 mm 71 gravel 2 d 63 mm and 2 cobbles 63 d 200 mm with a mean density ρ s 2 56 kg m3 and a volumetric concentration of the dry bed c 0 75 a value of c 0 62 is instead assumed for the less packed sediment deposits delivered by debris flows downstream of the initiation area the surveyed material is very similar to that collected in the initiation area of chiapuzza debris flows located about 3 km far from rovina di cancia for which the static friction angle φ s estimated through triaxial tests is about 39 the quasi static friction angle φ qs is taken equal to 34 i e about 5 smaller than static friction angle on the basis of the information provided by the flume experiments of lanzoni et al 2017 the quite low percentage of clay and silt 5 implies that the interstitial fluid has a viscosity similar to that of water as a results grain collisions rather than interstitial fluid viscosity control the rheology of the mixture leading to debris flows of the stony type takahashi 2007 2 2 the debris flow event of july 18th 2009 the debris flow occurred in the early morning of july 18th 2009 was triggered by a storm characterized by two distinct cells fig 2 with a time lag of approximately 20 min that was recorded by a rain gauge just below the initiation area fig 1 before the event the channel bed was likely in a dry condition a total rainfall depth of 1 6 mm was in fact observed in the previous five days dry moisture conditions the first cell caused a rainfall depth of 11 6 mm in 5 min intensity 140 mm h and produced a runoff able to entrain the material laying within the debris channel bed the resulting sediment liquid wave reached the flat depositional area at 1344 m a s l where the solid part of the mixture mostly stopped as suggested by post event analysis see section 2 4 and in accordance with the description provided by deganutti and tecca 2013 the hydrological computations reported in section 2 4 confirm the small volume of the superficial runoff and consequently the low magnitude of the debris flow associated to the first storm cell a similar behavior was exhibited by other two debris flows occurred in july and august 2013 degetto et al 2015 characterized by larger values of the simulated runoff peak 1 7 3 7 m3 s and volume 2800 3700 m3 the rainfall depth produced by the second storm cell was of 17 mm in 25 min mean intensity 40 mm h this precipitation produced a runoff able to entrain a considerable quantity of bed debris see section 2 4 the resulting sediment liquid surge routed downstream without a significative reduction of the solid content when passing through the flat depositional area at 1344 m a s l that was already partially occupied by the sediment delivered there by the first debris flow the overall volume of the mobilized sediment progressively increased as the debris flow propagated along the channel eventually the debris flow reached the retaining wall located at 1013 m a s l and opened a breach on its left side fig 1b the sediment liquid flow filled progressively the downstream retaining basin 1001 m a s l and after a while around 4 01 a m according to a eye witness a breach formed on the crest of the downstream gabion wall fig 1b an overtopping muddy surge hit the houses just downstream of the basin causing two deaths and considerable damages 2 3 collected data topographical surveys of the rovina di cancia channel were carried out before and just after the event of july 18th 2009 a total station in a georeferenced local system was used to collect data from the flat depositional area at 1344 m a s l to the retaining basin at 1001 m a s l this information was complemented with two lidar flights held in may 2009 and october 2011 covering the entire basin note that during the first lidar flight the portion of the basin until 1344 m a s l was covered by snow which prevented the acquisition of reliable elevation data in the following we reasonably assume that the part of the basin upstream of 1666 m a s l i e upstream of the triggering area has remained substantially unchanged during the time interval between the two surveys therefore we use the lidar data acquired in 2011 for building the dems used in the hydrological calculations while the lidar data collected in 2009 are used for the debris flow routing simulation from a location just upstream the confluence at 1333 m a s l to the borca di cadore village the elevation data acquired with the total station were used to build the pre and post event dem s and their difference provided the deposition erosion maps the accuracy of these two dems mean error 0 08 m standard deviation 0 23 m was evaluated through the methodology proposed by höhle and putuckova 2011 the dem data were checked in correspondence of selected homogeneously distributed control points sampled during another independent gps survey in the areas that remained unchanged and not used for building the two dems for the routing simulation we did not use the dem from total station elevation data because the surveyed points have a lower density than those of lidar 2009 and because their extent does not cover the area downstream the retaining basin fig 3 shows the variation of the longitudinal channel profile a and the resulting deposition and erosion depths b grouped in classes of 2 m size i e about eight times the standard deviation two areas zone i appear to be mainly subject to erosion the upper portion of the debris flow channel yielding about 60 of the eroded volume and the 100 m long reach upstream of the gabion weir located at 1013 m a s l yielding about 20 of the eroded volume deposition mainly occurs upstream of the retaining structures zone ii even though a certain amount of deposition about 30 of the total also localizes in the central portion of the debris flow channel in total the volumes deposited and eroded in zone i are 11024 m3 and 18570 m3 respectively while they amount to 24350 m3 and 550 m3 in zone ii the overall deposited and eroded volumes are then 35374 m3 and 19120 m3 their difference 16254 m3 gives an estimate of the sediment volume eroded upstream of the deposition area at 1344 m a s l and transited over it see section 3 assuming for this deposited mass a packing concentration of 0 62 yields a solid volume of 10100 m3 this material likely originated from the channel reach between 1666 m a s l and 1344 m a s l where it accumulated before the considered debris flow event as a result of bank failures subsequently subject to consolidation assuming a packing debris concentration of 0 75 and fully saturated conditions the corresponding liquid volume is estimated in about 3400 m3 finally for the sake of completeness the sum of the volume of debris material deposited on the zones i and ii 35374 m3 with that on the flat area and just upstream it covered by total station survey but also by snow during the lidar flight and for this reason not considered in the simulations is about 53000 m3 2 4 modelling approach this section describes the hydrological estimate of the runoff discharge in the upper part of the cancia basin where debris flows initiate the methodology used to reconstruct the input sediment liquid hydrograph and the models adopted to route downstream this hydrograph 2 4 1 rainfall runoff transformation the hydrological methodology used in the present study has been specifically developed for headwater rocky catchments gregoretti et al 2016a it has been tested by direct measurements of the runoff discharge at the outlet of a rocky channel incised on the cliffs of a dolomitic peak the dimai peak and indirectly by considering the debris flow runoff transit in the initiation area of another dolomitic catchment the acquabona basin the initiation areas of these two headwater catchments located 15 km and 5 km far away from the rovina di cancia basin have morphological features very similar to those investigated here the excess rainfall p e contributing to the runoff discharge is computed by means of the scs cn method suitably modified for mountain watershed by coupling it with a simplified version of the horton equation assuming a constant infiltration rate f c at each time step t j j δ t p e j is determined as 1 p ej 0 t t i a p j i a 2 p j i a s t j t i a i f c p e j 1 p j p j 1 f c δ t t j t i a i f c p e p escs where i a is the initial abstraction t i a is the time at which i a occurs estimated as i a 0 1 s gregoretti and dalla fontana 2008 s is the potential maximum retention s 1000 cn 10 i is the mean rainfall intensity during the time step δ t and p escs is the excess rainfall of the total precipitation computed through the scn cn method the empirical parameter cn is determined on the basis of the soil type the land use and the antecedent moisture condition amc classified as amc i dry condition amc ii standard condition amc iii wet condition excess rainfall is routed to the channel network along the steepest direction assuming a constant value of runoff velocity u depending on the terrain typology finally the water hydrograph at the closure section of the basin is determined modeling the channel routing with the matched diffusivity kinematic wave model of orlandini et al 1996 2 4 2 runoff contributing to debris flow triggering the amount of runoff contributing to form the debris flow is that exceeding a critical discharge value ensuring the entrainment of the bed sediment gregoretti et al 2016b han et al 2017 using the sedimentological and morphological data of the initiation area gregoretti and dalla fontana 2008 suggested a threshold discharge of about 1 m 3 s the sediment liquid surge triggered by this formative runoff at a given section is assumed to have a triangular shape with a quasi vertical rising limb followed by a relatively rapid falling stage in accordance with field observations berti et al 2000 zanuttigh et al 2007 kean et al 2012 this triangle shaped hydrograph can be determined defining the time to peak e g 1 min the peak value of the mixture discharge and imposing a linear decrease after the peak being the area under the hydrograph the sum of the formative runoff volume the entrained sediment volume and the volume of the fluid stored inside the voids of the eroded sediment bed the sediment liquid peak discharge q p can be estimated by the following relationship based on some series of systematic flume experiments takahashi 2007 lanzoni et al 2017 2 q p q 0 0 75 c c c s where q 0 is the formative runoff peak discharge while c and c s are the volumetric solid concentrations of the dry bed and of the debris flow the latter is computed through the relationship lanzoni et al 2017 3 c s ρ f tan θ ρ s ρ f tan φ qs tan θ where ρ f and ρ s are the densities of the liquid and solid phases θ is the channel slope and φ qs is the quasi static friction angle since q p q 0 1 the duration of the solid liquid hydrograph resulting from this procedure is smaller than that of the runoff see section 3 1 2 4 3 the modified gis based routing model the kinematic gis based cell model of gregoretti et al 2016b is here modified to account separately for the flow of the liquid and solid phases this modification ensures a better simulation of the entrainment process specifically the relevant equations express the mass and momentum conservation of the overall sediment water mixture and of the solid phase and the rate of change of bed elevation exner equation resulting from the deposition and entrainment processes here we summarize the main equations referring the interested reader to gregoretti et al 2016b for implementation details basically the flow is controlled by the relative elevations of the bed z i z k and of the water surface z i h i z k h k between a generic i cell and the eight k cells surrounding it the continuity equations read 4 a i d h i z i dt k 1 8 q ik 0 5 a i d c s h i c z i dt k 1 8 q ik 0 where a i is the planar area of the cell t is time z i is the elevation of the cell bottom h i is the flow depth c s is the volumetric solid concentration of the mixture and q ik is the discharge exchanged with the surrounding k th cell the momentum equations are simplified by assuming equal velocities for the solid and liquid phases rosatti and begnudelli 2013 and following a kinematic wave approach that has been already demonstrated to satisfactorily simulate debris flow routing in sloping channels arattano and savage 1994 di cristo et al 2014 a uniform flow equation is applied when the i th cell elevation is lower than that of the surrounding k th cell otherwise a broad crested weir equation is considered the corresponding discharges are 6 q ik δ x w i c ond h i g h z i z k l ik z i z k 7 q ik δ x s i c q 2 g h i z k 1 5 z i z k where δ x is the cell size a 0 5 c ond is the conductance coefficient c q is a discharge coefficient set equal to that of water 0 385 in the absence of specific experimental observations z i and z k are the elevations of the centers of two neighboring cells l ik is the distance between the two centers w k and s k are two weighting coefficients partitioning the flow along the eight possible flow directions depending on the bed elevations z i z k and the flow depths h i and h k the conductance coefficient c ond is defined as the ratio u u of the depth averaged velocity u to the friction velocity u it depends on the velocity and concentration profiles that establish along the sediment water column in the case of a stony debris flow takahashi 2007 where collisional stresses dominate the mixture rheology the conductance is controlled by the densities of the liquid and solid phases the depth averaged sediment concentration the particle diameter the flow depth and two empirical parameters describing the particle repulsive pressure and the ratio of shear stress to pressure stress takahashi 2007 lanzoni et al 2017 in particular c ond tends to increase as c s decreases and for larger values of the ratio h d lanzoni et al 2017 both flume experiments and field observations fig 4 suggest that c ond ranges in the interval 1 3 for channelized stony debris flows of small volume under unsteady flow conditions owing to the great variability of both c s and h along the debris surge c ond is expected to attain higher values especially in the presence of intense runoff conditions leading to the mobilization of large volumes of sediment indeed all the other relevant parameters remaining unvaried larger values of c ond imply larger velocities and hence larger sediment entrainment and smaller deposition in the present contribution we then set c ond 5 to account for the quite large solid volume mobilized by the investigated debris flow the exner equation 8 dz dt d e expresses the rate of change of bed elevation of the cell as a function of the difference between erosion e and deposition d rates these processes are controlled by the bed incline along the flow direction sin θ ik z i z k l ik or in the case of adverse slopes by the energy incline sin θ ik h i z i h k z k l ik as well as by the flow velocity following egashira et al 2001 see also brufau et al 2000 we write 9 e d i k sin α ki sin θ lim v max where k is an empirical constant ranging between 0 and 1 and v max is the value of the velocity along the steepest ik direction eq 9 can lead to unphysical conditions if not properly constrained in terms of sediment concentration and flow transport capacity erosion in fact occurs for high enough velocities v max v lim e and slope angles θ ik θ lim e and is limited by the maximum transport concentration c s 0 9 c that can be attained by the debris flow takahashi 2007 in addition field observations berger et al 2011 indicate that erosion generally occurs during the passage of the debris flow front dh dt 0 and starts before the maximum value of the flow depth is reached likewise deposition can take place only for low enough values of the flow velocity v max v lim d and of the relevant slope angle θ ik θ lim d and for sufficiently high sediment concentration c s c sd calibration of the model has been carried out in order to reproduce the observed routing time and deposition erosion patterns it provides the following values of the limiting parameters θ lim e 16 θ lim d 14 u lim e 1 8 m s and u lim d 1 8 m s k e 0 5 k d 0 1 c sd 0 005 the sensitivity analysis see table a 3 and figs a 10 a 11 in the appendix a suggests that physically plausible variations of the various parameters do not lead to significantly different results except for c ond that has greater influence clearly the values of the relevant parameters are expected to change markedly when simulating debris flows different from the stony type treated here the model equations are solved numerically by an explicit scheme after computing the time step according to the cfl stability condition the flow depth at the new time step is determined by eq 4 after calculating all the quantities at the previous time step by using eqs 6 9 after that c s is computed by using eq 5 more details on the model and its numerical discretization are reported in gregoretti et al 2016b 2 4 4 the flo 2d routing model flo 2d is a tool adopted worldwide for the simulation of debris flow phenomena and hydraulic flooding of urban areas bertolo and wieczorek 2005 boniello et al 2010 stancanelli et al 2017 stancanelli and foti 2015 the relevant equations include the conservation of mass and momentum for the bulk mixture along the considered direction of motion x 10 h t hv x 0 11 s f tan θ h x v g v x 1 g v t where s f is the friction slope tan θ is the bed slope h is the flow depth v is the depth averaged velocity g is the gravitational acceleration the flow domain is discretized into uniform square grid elements the differential forms of eqs 10 and 11 are solved through finite differences for each computational cell the discretized form of eqs 10 and 11 are solved independently along the eight potential flow directions ensuing from the considered cell the quantities h and v are related to one of the eight flow directions by choosing the steepest direction x the sediment liquid mixture is approximated as a single phase liquid assuming an empirical quadratic rheological law o brien and julien 1988 the total friction slope s f is expressed as 12 s f τ b ρ m g h k l μ b v 8 ρ m g h 2 n 2 v 2 h 4 3 where τ b is the bingham yield stress ρ m is the mixture density k l is the laminar flow resistance coefficient g is gravitational acceleration μ b is the bingham viscosity and n is the pseudo manning s resistance coefficient which accounts for both turbulent boundary friction and internal collisional stresses in particular the yield stress τ b the dynamic viscosity μ b and the resistance coefficient n are influenced by the sediment concentration and therefore can be described by the following equations o brien and julien 1988 o brien 2007 13 τ b α 1 e β 1 c s μ b α 2 e β 2 c s n n t 0 538 e 6 0896 c s where c s is the solid volumetric concentration of the mixture α 1 β 1 α 2 and β 2 are empirical coefficients defined by laboratory experiments and n t is the turbulent n value the values of these parameters α 1 0 00632 poises β 1 19 9 α 2 0 000707 dyn cm 2 β 2 29 8 have been selected in order to reproduce the observed routing time they correspond to those reported by o brien and julien 1988 for a debris flow composed of gravel with a muddy fluid phase containing a low percentage of clay 4 more detailed information about the constitutive fluid equations adopted in the model and the numerical scheme used to solve the continuity and momentum equations can be found in o brien 2007 3 simulations debris flow occurred at rovina di cancia on the 18th of july 2009 is the result of three consecutive physical processes the transformation of rainfall in runoff the entrainment of debris material present on the channel bed by this runoff and the downstream propagation of the sediment liquid mixture thus formed the first two processes are responsible for the formation of a debris flow surge that can be described through a sediment liquid hydrograph which in turn represents the input for investigating the propagation phase the sediment liquid hydrograph is evaluated using the methodolgy proposed at section 2 4 2 where runoff is estimated by means of the model of gregoretti et al 2016a the downstream routing of this hydrograph is simulated by applying a bi phase modified version of a gis based model gregoretti et al 2016b and the flo 2d model o brien et al 1993 these two propagation models differ for the constitutive relations used to model the stress generating mechanisms collisional versus empirical quadratic laws and for the capability or not to describe the bed erosion processes 3 1 runoff formation and debris flow triggering the rainfalls associated with the two storm cells determined the formation of two distinct consecutive runoff hydrographs see fig 2 in the following we focus our attention on the second hydrograph responsible for the debris flow that after reaching the retaining basin at 1001 m a s l breached the downstream gabion walls and hit the borca di cadore village the former generated a less intense debris flow that likely stopped at the flat depositional area located at 1344 m a s l just upstream of the confluence of the rovina di cancia channel with the bus de diau creek the parameters adopted for the hydrological estimates are reported in table 2 note that the antecedent moisture condition differs for the two storms for the first a dry conditions amc i has been assumed because of the small amount of rainfall 1 6 mm observed in the previous five days for the second a standard condition amc ii is considered owing to the significant rainfall depth 24 5 mm associated with the first rainstorm the results of the hydrological estimates are shown in fig 5 in the salvella sub basin the runoff produced by the first rainstorm total volume 1000 m3 is more than 80 smaller than that corresponding to the second rainstorm total volume 4700 m3 as a result the corresponding runoff volume contributing to the debris flow triggered by the first rainfall event not shown in fig 5 for simplicity is definitely much smaller than that resulting from the second rainfall cell 580 m3 as compared to 3700 m3 this supports the idea that the first debris flow occurred on july 18th 2009 had a relatively low magnitude that led it to stop at the depositional area at 1344 m a s l importantly the peak of the second runoff hydrograph generated by the bus de diau sub basin 6 3 m3 s results five minutes delayed with respect to that generated in the cancia channel sub basin this delay is related to the stretched shape of the bus de diau sub basin implying much longer flow paths the absence of any pre and post event topographical surveys from the initiation area at 1666 m a s l to the flat depositional area at 1344 m a s l excluded prevented any simulation of debris flow triggering we thus used the information reported in section 2 4 2 to reconstruct the solid liquid hydrograph to be routed downstream together that predominantly liquid 4700 m3 delivered by the bus de diau sub basin fig 5 recalling that section 2 3 the solid and water volumes supplied by the channel reach between 1666 and 1344 m a s l have been estimated in 10100 m3 and 3400 m3 respectively and that the runoff coming from the salvella sub basin is about 3700 m3 yields a solid liquid hydrograph of 17200 m3 this hydrograph is assumed to have a triangular shape and a raising limb of about 1 min section 2 4 2 its peak computed through eq 2 is q p 32 3 m 3 s the duration ensuring a solid liquid volume of 17200 m3 is 17 min note that the value of c s 0 67 used in eq 2 is that resulting from the relation eq 3 while the values of c 0 75 θ 19 5 and φ qs 34 needed in the computations are those discussed in section 2 1 3 2 modeling the debris flow event the sediment liquid hydrograph and the liquid hydrograph from bus de diau creek computed in the previous section were routed downstream of the junction of the rovina di cancia channel with the bus de diau creek by using the models described in sections 2 4 3 and 2 4 4 a grid system with square cells is adopted with a size of 1 1 m in the case of the gis based model and of 3 3 m in the case of the flo 2d model the erosion and deposition depths simulated with the gis based kinematic model are shown in fig 6 where the areas of the channel bed affected by erosion and deposition are easily recognizable the comparison with the observed erosion deposition patterns of fig 3 suggests that deposition is well reproduced both in terms of extension and magnitude i e deposition depth on the other hand erosion tends to be underestimated especially in the channel reach located just upstream of the final retaining basin where the volume of eroded sediment is approximately equal to 20 of the total eroded volume estimated from topographic surveys note that erosion generally takes place during the passage of the debris flow front and can determine a local decrease in channel slope which in turn promotes sediment deposition the spatial distribution of the in channel deposition depth computed by means of the flo 2d model is reported in fig 7 clearly the inability of flo 2d to describe erosion implies that also the deposition pattern is not well reproduced and tends to be underestimated both along the channel and upstream of the retaining structures indeed in case of fixed bed conditions the mechanical energy associated with the debris flow surge is higher since no energy is used to erode the sediment bed as a result deposition is delayed and reduced 4 discussion although the two models used to simulate the propagation are based on different rheological laws the results obtained in terms of debris flow paths and more in general of inundation areas are similar suggesting that the patterns are mainly influenced by the gravity and the topography i e slope rather than the rheology fig 8 shows a quantitative comparison in terms of observed a o and computed a c areas subjected to deposition erosion as anticipated by the visual inspection of figure 6 the overlapping between observed and computed areas a oc is more satisfactory for deposition than for erosion the ratio between a oc and the observed a o deposition area a oc a o d is 0 72 for the gis based and 0 53 for the flo 2d models in the case of erosion this ratio a oc a o e becomes 0 33 and 0 0 fixed bed model respectively when considering the correct reproduction of deposition and erosion depths these percentages decrease to 42 deposition and 14 erosion in the case of the gis based model and to 22 deposition and 0 erosion in the case of the flo 2d model the two models obviously give quite different results in terms of deposited eroded sediment volumes owing to the fixed bed assumption intrinsic to the flo 2d model the ratio between simulated and observed sediment volumes are v c v o d 0 94 for deposition and v c v o e 0 9 for erosion when using the gis based model while when using the flo 2d model these ratios becomes v c v o d 0 24 and v c v o e 0 these results can be explained by the difficulty of simulating properly the erosion produced by a debris flow running over a loose sediment bed bouchut et al 2008 the quantitative assessments of the exchange of mass between the flowing sediment fluid mixture and the underlying sediment bed is still an open issue even though some formulations have been already proposed in the literature mangeney et al 2010 iverson 2012 iverson and ouyang 2015 kang and chan 2017 the present contribution provides a further attempt to deal with this complex problem for example erosion is strongly affected by sediment heterogeneity not modeled here indeed sediment entrainment takes place mainly during the passage of the front as observed in field by berger et al 2011 and mccoy et al 2012 heterogeneity of material laying on the bed matters as well with clast of large size that are much more difficult to entrain fig 9 describes clearly the differences that arise in terms of flow depth when erosion is accounted for or not in the case of a fixed bed condition flo 2d model the maximum flow depth keeps almost constant along the debris flow channel fig 9a no overall differences are also recognizable by comparing the temporal evolution of the cross sectionally averaged flow depth in a number of sections fig 9b conversely in the presence of a mobile bed the maximum debris flow depth turns out to vary significantly along the channel higher depths are observed in the upper part of the basin characterized by a higher slope and a large availability of sediment to be entrained fig 9c also the form of the temporal distribution of the mean flow depth observed at fixed sections shows a great variability fig 9d in particular when compared to the fixed bed case the peak of the flow depth hydrograph reduces progressively as the debris flow propagates downstream moving from higher slopes where erosion mainly occurs to smaller slopes where deposition prevails the comparison of the results provided by the two models thus highlights the importance of considering the mobile bed condition when simulating in channel debris flows while the extension of the areas affected by the debris transit and deposit does not change dramatically fig 9 adopting a fixed bed model leads to an underestimation by 25 of the maximum debris flow depth in the upper channel portion and to an even much larger overestimation by 51 in the lower channel reaches an underestimation is also remarked for the simulation of observed deposition area 53 and of observed sediment volume 24 it is also important to observe that the less demanding computational effort required by the gis based kinematic model allows to increase the spatial resolution 1 1 m with respect to that used for flo 2d 3 3 m using a 3 m grid size also for the gis based model produces very similar deposition and erosion patterns not shown here for the sake of brevity areas and to a less extent volumes while the routing time tends to reduce this is due to the topographic smoothing caused by a three times larger grid size which in turn implicates larger slopes and shorter flow paths and consequently an increased propagation speed 5 conclusions the measurements carried out with reference to the debris flows occurred at cancia on july 18th 2009 provide a unique set of data that can help in understanding the complexity embedded in this kind of phenomena and can be profitably used to test and develop physics based models the main conclusions of the present work can be summarized as follows in small dolomitic watersheds as cancia debris flows are usually triggered by intense rainfalls produced by concentrated and fast moving storm cells the debris flow inception however requires a sufficiently intense surface runoff and the availability of loose sediment in the case study considered here rainfall data indicate the presence of two well separated and subsequent rainfall events with comparable depth of which only the second caused a debris flow that was able to reach the end of the channel overflowing the retaining basin located there the reconstruction of the sediment liquid hydrograph to be used as input to debris flow routing models needs a reliable estimate of the sediment volume entrained by the surface runoff obtained here from the detailed topographic data collected before and after the investigated debris flow events and a rainfall runoff relationship specifically developed for headwater mountain catchments a reliable simulation of debris flow routing requires that both erosion and deposition processes are accounted for the availability of detailed data about the morphological changes produced by a debris flow is thus fundamental to evaluate the performance of a given routing model in terms of both eroded deposited areas and eroded deposited volumes in channel debris flow propagation simulated by assuming either fixed bed no erosion or mobile bed erosion allowed conditions produces similar results in terms of areas subjected to deposition but significant differences in terms of mobilized volumes assuming a fixed bed condition does not allow to reproduce the progressive modifications experienced by the debris flow hydrograph as it moves downstream and consequently can produce significant errors when evaluating the mobilized sediment volumes as well as the dynamic features of the flow e g impact forces which are fundamental for reliable hazard assessments the movable bed gis based kinematic model used here to simulate the in channel debris flow propagation appears to describe the observed phenomenon with reasonable accuracy given also the complexity of the triggering conditions and the uncertainties in the rheological regime its simplicity and robustness makes it a tool for analyzing hazard scenarios at the basin and or regional scales as well as for predicting imminent scenarios after an alert given by now casting the model can also be interfaced with gis platforms because of its raster based nature clearly much more sophisticated models e g two dimensional finite volume models as those developed by armanini et al 2009 and frank et al 2015 can be used to propagate downstream the sediment liquid debris flow hydrograph in any case a correct reproduction not only of the debris flow depth but also of the spatial distribution of erosion deposition depths

sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis reported here follows closely the framework developed by hussin et al 2012 and gregoretti et al 2016b essentially any relevant parameter of the a given model is varied in a physically plausible range keeping all the other parameters unchanged see the dataset in the supplementary material the set of parameters used as reference is that resulting from calibration i e that ensuring the overall best matching between a number of computed and observed quantities in the present case we focus our attention on the areas subjected to deposition and or erosion and the corresponding volumes the overall agreement between computer and simulated quantities is measured by introducing the dimensionless performance described below here generalized to account for erosion and deposition the first parameter is the fit index f proposed by bates and de roo 2000 a 1 f a co d a co e a co a o a c d a co a o a c e ranging between 0 no fit and 1 perfect fit here a o and a c denote the observed and computed areas a co is the measure of their overlapping part and the sub fixes e and d indicate erosion and deposition respectively the second parameter is the evaluation factor ω ψ introduced by scheidl and rickenman 2010 here generalized to account for the presence of both deposition and erosion it is defined as a 2 ω ψ ψ co d ψ co e ψ c d ψ c e ψ o d ψ o e ψ co ψ o d ψ co ψ o d with ψ equal to either a or v the first term between square brackets on the right side of eq a 2 represents a positive accuracy while the second and third terms between square brackets denote negative and missing accuracies respectively scheidl and rickenman 2010 in the case of a perfect fit these latter two terms are identically equal and ω ψ 1 in the case of no fit ψ co d ψ co e 0 and hence ω become negative the sum ω ω a ω v accounts for the ability of the model to reproduce correctly both the observed areas and volumes in the following we assume that f 0 5 and ω 0 indicate an intermediate condition between no fit and perfect fit while larger values represent acceptably good results the parameters considered in the analysis are c ond θ lim d e u lim d e k d k e table a 3 summarizes their best fitting values and the ranges of variation considered in the sensitivity analysis fig a 10 shows the results of the sensitivity analysis carried out by varying the parameter c ond and keeping fixed all others it clearly emerges the importance of selecting correctly the conductance for maximizing both the indexes f and ω on the other hand fig a 11 shows the sensitivity analysis in terms of the parameters controlling erosion and deposition when c ond is maintained fixed the variability of the results with respect to the best fit values is quite limited the values resulting from the calibration of the gis based kinematic model and taken as reference are reported in the first line of table a 3 while the second line of this table shows the range of parameter variation used for the sensitivity analysis the values adopted for the critical angles of deposition and erosion 14 and 16 respectively were selected on the basis of the laboratory experiments carried out by lanzoni et al 2017 for coarse grained debris flows and field observations gregoretti et al 2016b for this reasons we varied them in small intervals 12 15 deposition and 15 17 erosion in presence of erosion we should also consider the effect of the simulation of erosion on that of deposition therefore we introduce the new following index id equal to the ratio between the

sediment eroded volume difference between the eroded volumes observed but not simulated volume and simulated but not observed respect to the sediment deposited volume values exhibited by results of

6834,hydrological drought is increasing under the impact of global change which could have serious influences on the stability of ecological systems and water dependent human activities in the affected regions in this study the total water storage tws derived from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites from 2003 to 2012 was downscaled to a finer resolution by incorporating the output from a land surface model the downscaled data was used to identify hydrological drought for eight tributaries of the yangtze river in china the trend in the water storage deficit based on the downscaled grace data ranged from 0 86 to 0 29 mm month 1 for the eight tributaries from 2003 to 2012 among which the absolute largest value occurred in the poyang lake basin the eight tributaries experienced between four and seven hydrological droughts during the study period and droughts in 2003 2006 and 2011 occurred in all of the tributaries the drought recovery rate for the eight tributaries was between 4 5 and 7 2 mm month 1 and the average drought recovery time was between 3 6 and 5 7 months tributaries with a high climate moisture index had low frequencies of drought occurrence but had long drought durations and large drought severities resulting in long drought recovery times additionally the impacts of human activity on hydrologic processes intensified significantly from 2003 to 2012 such as water storage in reservoirs and water consumption leading to spatial differences in regional drought characterizations the results are useful for the understanding of the mechanism of hydrological drought formation and the extension of grace applications in medium and small scale catchments keywords grace data downscaling water storage deficit drought recovery time 1 introduction hydrological extremes are increasing under the impact of global change roudier et al 2016 sugiyama et al 2010 yoon et al 2015 as noted by the international hydrological program and the fifth assessment of the intergovernmental panel on climate change investigating hydrological extremes is an important issue in hydrological and meteorological studies flato et al 2013 zalewski et al 2016 it is reported that hydrological drought events occurred frequently during the past decade and had serious influences on the water demand of mankind agricultural irrigation and the stability of ecological systems bai et al 2018b jassey et al 2018 van loon and laaha 2015 so far investigations on hydrological drought include 1 the identification of drought events 2 the characterization of drought 3 the attribution of one or several drought events to its affecting factors and 4 the impact of drought on water resources agriculture and ecosystems chen et al 2009 long et al 2013 nath et al 2017 wanders and wada 2015 zhang et al 2017 these studies focused on the shortage of surface water storage based on the records from hydrometeorological stations and remote sensing data from satellites barker et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 however hydrological drought is a recurring water shortage phenomenon integrating both surface and subsurface water storage under the impacts of climate change and human activity schwalm et al 2017 the national aeronautics and space administration s gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites were launched in march 2002 and measured earth s gravity field with enough precision to infer terrestrial water mass variations over large regions sahoo et al 2016 swenson and wahr 2002 tapley et al 2004 compared with the conventional in situ observations and other remote sensing methods satellite gravity data from the grace satellites provides integrated information about the variation in total water storage tws through all components of the surface and subsurface water balance andersen et al 2005 frappart and ramillien 2018 rodell et al 2004a the grace data has been used in numerous hydrometeorological studies including evaporation estimation billah et al 2015 drought characterization schumacher et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 water storage component decomposition andrew et al 2017 castellazzi et al 2016 and improvement of hydrological modeling bai et al 2018a khaki et al 2017 long et al 2017 for example pan et al 2017 investigated the human induced change in evapotranspiration over the haihe river in china based on the grace data and found that human activities contributed to a 12 increase in evapotranspiration sinha et al 2017 studied hydrological drought in india using the grace observations and found that the grace based dataset was robust for drought characterization over large spatial scales bai et al 2018a incorporated the grace derived tws into hydrological modeling based on a multi objective calibration scheme and indicated that there was significant improvement in evapotranspiration simulation in dry catchments the spatial resolution of the grace tws data is coarse and the minimum area that can be used effectively by the grace data remains controversial vishwakarma et al 2018 several studies have investigated the spatial resolutions of the grace data in hydrological studies longuevergne et al 2010 rowlands et al 2005 tourian et al 2015 vishwakarma et al 2018 for example longuevergne et al 2010 indicated that the footprint of grace was approximately 200 000 km2 4 4 and dedicated methods were needed to study catchments smaller than 200 000 km2 vishwakarma et al 2018 compared four popular correction schemes of grace data over 255 catchments and found that a catchment of a size of approximately 63 000 km2 can be resolved by grace data generally the minimum area of grace application varies in different studies which increases the difficulty in the application of grace products for a better use of grace products in medium and small scale catchments wan et al 2015 proposed a land surface model based approach to downscale the coarse grace data to a finer resolution and applied the downscaled data to produce a monthly evapotranspiration dataset across the conterminous united states as the longest river in china the yangtze river comprises approximately 36 of china s water resources liu et al 2017 the yangtze river basin is one of the most developing regions in china accounting for approximately 41 of china s total gross domestic product according to the report of the national statistical bureau of china it is documented that the yangtze river experienced serious hydrological droughts in the last decade especially after the operation of the three gorges dam tgd began in 2003 dai et al 2008 huang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014a some studies have attempted to investigate hydrological drought in the yangtze river using the grace data ferreira et al 2013 huang et al 2015 sun et al 2017 for example tang et al 2014 extracted tws variations from the regional gravity signal based on the grace satellites and found that the recent heavy droughts in southwestern china can be captured by the observable nonseasonal gravity changes it should be noted that there are spatial differences in hydrological drought characterizations in the tributaries of the yangtze river because this river spans several climate zones however due to the coarse resolution of the grace data the spatial differences of hydrological drought and its recovery time among the tributaries of the yangtze river have not been investigated this study downscales the grace data to a finer resolution based on a land surface model and then uses the downscaled data to investigate the spatial differences in hydrological drought characterization in eight tributaries over the yangtze river the results are expected to give a generalized evaluation on hydrological drought monitoring based on the downscaled grace data it is essential for understanding of the formation mechanism of hydrological drought for medium and small scale watersheds as well as for the extension of grace applications the objectives of this study are 1 to analyze the spatial differences of the downscaled grace data in eight tributaries of the yangtze river 2 to identify hydrological drought based on the downscaled grace data and 3 to assess the recovery time of hydrological drought in different tributaries 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yangtze river 24 35 n 90 122 e originating from the tibet plateau in china traverses from the southwest to the east finally flowing into the east china sea fig 1 there are a number of hydrological stations in the yangtze river the yichang station and hukou station are conventionally considered the demarcation stations of the upper tributaries and the lower tributaries of the yangtze river respectively the yangtze river mainly includes eight tributaries where the upper tributaries of the yangtze river consist of the jinsha river basin mintuo river basin jialing river basin and wu river basin the middle tributaries of the yangtze river consist of the han river basin dongting lake basin and poyang lake basin and the lower tributaries of the yangtze river consist of the tai lake basin the drainage areas of the eight tributaries range from 36 790 to 473 237 km2 table 1 the average air temperature ranges from 9 to 18 c and the annual precipitation ranges from 692 to 1611 mm the upper tributaries belong to a high cold climate zone whereas the middle and lower tributaries belong to subtropical and temperate climate zones human activity intensifies gradually from the upper tributaries to the lower tributaries in the yangtze river sun et al 2016 yin and li 2001 the tgd is the largest hydroelectric power station in the world came into operation in june 2003 and is located approximately 44 km upstream of yichang station 2 2 data in this study the release 05 grace products provided by the center for space research csr geoforschungszentrum potsdam gfz and the jet propulsion laboratory jpl from january 2003 to december 2012 were employed with a resolution of 1 1 the ensemble mean values of the three tws data were used to reduce the uncertainties associated with data processing moreover since the grace tws data at small spatial scales tend to be attenuated the average values obtained by six sets of scaling factors provided by long et al 2015a were used to restore the true signal amplitude this procedure can minimize the uncertainties in the tws dataset resulting from scaling approaches long et al 2015a zhang et al 2016 the tws data simulated by the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrologic model was used to downscale the grace tws time series zhang et al 2014b tws was calculated as the sum of soil moisture and snow water equivalent simulated by the vic model the vic model performed well in china with a high resolution of 0 25 0 25 because it employed a high density of meteorological observations from the china meteorological administration cma as model inputs and multigauge streamflow observations from the hydrology bureau of china hbc for model calibration it should be noted that the ground water storage is not included in this model details of the model s calibration and validation can be found in zhang et al 2014b the monthly air temperature sunshine duration relative humidity and wind speed in the yangtze river during the period of 2003 to 2012 were collected from the cma the penman formula was used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration pet penman 1948 shuttleworth 1993 the climate moisture index cmi was employed to characterize the climate condition of each tributary which was estimated as the ratio of precipitation to pet willmott and feddema 1992 the runoff data 2003 2012 for the tributaries were collected from the hbc because the tai lake basin locates in the yangtze river delta and there are many rivers flowing into the tai lake the total runoff of the tai lake basin is difficult to estimate therefore the analysis of runoff in this tributary is not involved in this study information of hydrological stations for the tributaries is given in table s1 the water consumption dataset and water storage in large and medium size reservoirs during the period of 2003 2012 for the eight tributaries were collected from the water resources bulletin of the yangtze river 3 method 3 1 downscaling of the grace data a statistical downscaling approach based on a land surface model is employed to downscale the grace tws data in this study wan et al 2015 first the original grace data is aggregated to 4 to match the footprint of grace because of the high resolution and good accuracy of the vic outputs the tws simulated by the vic model processed by zhang et al 2014b is used for downscaling processes noting that the vic derived tws data should be first normalized by the same normalization procedure used in the grace data where each monthly grace value represents the surface mass deviation for that month relative to the baseline average over january 2004 to december 2009 wan et al 2015 then the weight of tws for each 0 25 grid at a 4 4 square is calculated last the original grace tws is downscaled to 0 25 by the following formula 1 tw s d i t w s vic i b a t w s vic 0 i t w s vic 0 i a i where twsd i is the downscaled grace tws tws vic i is the normalized vic based tws b is the bias between the vic based tws and grace based tws at the 4 grid cell a is the total area of the 4 grid cell containing the 0 25 grid cell ai is area of the 0 25 grid cell and tws vic0 i is the prenormalized vic based tws the advantage of this downscaling method ensures that the sum of the downscaled tws values in each 4 grid cell is equal to the corresponding 4 grace tws value 3 2 statistical method the empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf is the cumulative distribution function associated with the empirical measure of the sample smirnov 1948 turnbull 1976 which is widely used in hydrological and meteorological studies cannon 2018 favre et al 2004 jung et al 2017 the ecdf is a step function that jumps up by 1 n at each of the n data points for a given observations series x 1 x 2 xi xn the empirical cumulative distribution function fn t for x is defined as 2 f n t 1 n i 1 n i x i t where i x i t is the indicator function which is equal to 1 if xi t and equal to 0 otherwise the kolmogorov smirnov test quantifies whether the ecdf is fitting to the theoretical cdf which is a nonparametric test of the equality of continuous and one dimensional probability distributions kanji 2006 rajan et al 2014 it has the advantage of making no assumption of data distribution the kolmogorov smirnov statistic d for a given cumulative distribution function f t can be calculated as 3 d max f n t f t if d is smaller than the threshold d a there are no significant differences between the ecdf and theoretical cdf which indicates the distribution of the given data is normal in addition the pearson correlation coefficient r is used to analyze the relationships between the key variables related to hydrological drought trends in hydrological variables during 2003 2012 are determined using linear regression a t test is conducted to determine whether correlations and trends are significant at the level of 95 3 3 evaluation of hydrological drought and its recovery time a hydrological drought is identified by the method proposed by zhang et al 2016 as at least three months of the grace tws lower than its average condition for a certain month the relatively short inter drought period is neglected between two drought events less than three months in this study which might be a short alleviation for the former drought the severity s mm of each hydrological drought is calculated as 4 s i k k d r tws j tw s i where tws i is the downscaled tws for month i and tws j is the corresponding average value of tws for a given month whereby j i 12 i 12 1 leading to 1 j 12 in particular the difference between tws j and tws i is defined as the water storage deficit wsd k is the beginning time of a former drought event and dr is the prolonged drought duration the severity during each inter drought period is assumed to be zero because there is noise in the grace data the downscaled grace tws are reprocessed by a 3 month moving average filter prior to drought analysis thomas et al 2014 the hydrological recovery time is calculated based on a statistical method proposed by thomas et al 2014 the rate of change of wsd during a certain period can be assessed by 5 δ wsd δ t ws d i ws d i 1 where δ wsd δ t represents the rate of change of the water storage deficit and δt represents the time interval one month in this study if δ wsd δ t follows a standard normal distribution according to a one sample kolmogorov smirnov test the 68th percentile value c 1 standard deviation is used as the recovery rate of wsd for any deficit month then the drought recovery time rt for each month can be obtained by thomas et al 2014 6 rt w s d c where c is the drought recovery rate during the study period and rt month is the drought recovery time of the water storage deficit according to this method a probabilistic recovery time can be assessed for each hydrological drought 4 results 4 1 spatial distribution of the downscaled grace data fig 2 shows the trends in tws over the yangtze river based on the downscaled 0 25 0 25 and the original 1 1 grace data from 2003 to 2012 the spatial patterns of the two dataset were consistent with each other where there were negative trends in tws over the upper tributaries and positive trends over the middle and lower tributaries of the yangtze river the downscaled grace data can reflect the spatial differences of tws in the yangtze river fig 3 shows the variations of tws based on the downscaled grace data and vic model as well as runoff in the eight tributaries of the yangtze river the three datasets had good consistencies during the period of 2003 2012 the correlation coefficient between tws derived from the downscaled grace data and runoff ranged from 0 53 to 0 91 which further indicates that the downscaled grace tws is reliable in this study variations in wsd based on the downscaled grace data for the eight tributaries are provided in fig 4 wsd increased at the jinsha river basin and the mintuo river basin with the rates of 0 29 p 0 05 and 0 14 p 0 05 mm month 1 respectively however wsd decreased at the other six tributaries and four of them decreased significantly p 0 05 the largest absolute trend in wsd occurred in the poyang lake basin with a value of 0 86 mm month 1 p 0 05 the lowest absolute trend in wsd occurred in the han river basin with a value of 0 01 mm month 1 p 0 05 wsd in the middle tributaries changed more dramatically than that in the upper and lower tributaries of the yangtze river except in the han river basin 4 2 identification of hydrological drought events hydrological drought based on the downscaled grace data occurred between four and seven times in the eight tributaries of the yangtze river during 2003 2012 fig 5 the drought events in 2003 2006 and 2011 appeared in all of the tributaries the average drought duration for the eight tributaries ranged from 7 1 to 13 5 months and the average drought severity ranged from 131 to 461 mm fig 6 the droughts in the dongting lake basin and the poyang lake basin were relatively severe compared with the other six tributaries with the average severities of 367 and 461 mm respectively note that droughts in the dongting lake basin and the poyang lake basin could be interdependent because dongting lake and poyang lake are both connected with the yangtze river and the water levels in the two lakes are influenced by the yangtze river water levels simultaneously huang et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 the characterizations of the longest and most severe hydrological droughts were summarized in table 2 the longest drought was also the most severe drought in each tributary during the period of 2003 2012 in terms of drought duration the longest drought occurred in the dongting lake basin lasting 34 months starting from june 2003 the severity of this drought was 1476 mm the peak wsd of this drought was 116 mm occurring in january 2004 in terms of drought severity the most severe drought occurred in the poyang lake basin starting from june 2003 and lasting 33 months with the drought severity of 1599 mm the peak wsd of this drought was 128 mm occurring in january 2004 the characterizations of the two droughts including starting time duration peak wsd and severity were similar indicating the two droughts could be interdependent due to the influences of yangtze water levels in addition hydrological drought statistics based on the downscaled grace data were compared with those based on the vic data figs 5 and 6 there were between three and ten occurrences of vic based hydrological drought in the eight tributaries the average drought duration was between 5 5 and 20 2 months and the average drought severity was between 2398 and 15 520 mm the distributions of hydrological droughts based on the downscaled grace data were consistent with that based on the vic data in the four upper tributaries i e the jinsha river basin the mintuo river basin the jialing river basin and the wu river basin fig 5 however there were differences in hydrological drought occurrences identified by the two datasets in the middle and lower tributaries this is because human activities are relatively obvious in the middle and lower tributaries of the yangtze river such as reservoir construction agriculture irrigation and water transfers hou et al 2017 yang et al 2015 the vic model simulates water balance components without considering the impacts of human activities which leads to the differences between the vic based droughts and the grace based droughts nevertheless the major drought events can be both captured by the downscaled grace data and vic output 4 3 assessment of hydrological drought recovery times table 3 shows that the statistic d for the eight tributaries is lower than da using the one sample kolmogorov smirnov test which indicates δ wsd δ t is in accordance with the standard normal distribution therefore it is appropriate to estimate the recovery time of hydrological drought in the yangtze river based on the employed approach in this study the drought recovery rate varied in the eight tributaries the dongting lake basin had the largest drought recovery rate with the value of 7 2 mm month 1 whereas the jinsha river basin had the lowest drought recovery rate with the value of 4 5 mm month 1 a relatively high value of the drought recovery rate indicates a tendency for depleted storage levels to increase rapidly which is expected to occur in regions where surface and subsurface storage capacities are relatively large for the eight tributaries the average drought recovery time rt was between 3 6 and 5 7 months fig 7 the high values of average rt mainly occurred in the dongting lake basin and the poyang lake basin with values of 5 0 and 5 7 months respectively fig 8 although the drought recovery rates in the two tributaries were rapid the severities of hydrological droughts were high leading to relatively long drought recovery times for the longest and the most severe drought events over the eight tributaries the average rt for these drought events ranged from 3 5 to 7 2 months and rt for the peak wsd ranged from 8 2 to 19 1 months 4 4 factors affecting hydrological drought characterizations hydrological drought events are influenced by regional climate and human activity van loon 2015 wanders and wada 2015 the climate moisture index cmi the ratio of annual precipitation to pet is usually used to represent the climate condition of a certain basin hogg et al 2013 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 a basin with a relatively high cmi has relatively high excess rainfall to investigate the spatial differences in the characteristics of hydrological drought in the tributaries of the yangtze river hydrological drought statistics were compared to the cmi in this study fig 9 a shows a positive relationship between the average rt and cmi with the r of 0 73 p 0 05 indicating that basins with relatively high excess rainfall have relatively long drought recovery times this is because these basins typically have relatively high surface subsurface storage bai and liu 2018 once hydrological droughts occurred more water is needed for wsd to recovery to normal condition in the yangtze river the occurrences of hydrological drought decreased with increasing cmi r 0 43 p 0 05 fig 9b while the average drought duration fig 9c and drought severity fig 9d increased with increasing cmi with r values of 0 53 p 0 05 and 0 89 p 0 05 respectively that is the frequency of hydrological drought is low but the drought duration is long and the severity is severe in basins with relatively high excess rainfall leading to long drought recovery times in addition to the impact of climatic conditions on hydrological drought events human activity also has influences on hydrological drought characterizations over the yangtze river fig 10 shows that the water storage in large and medium size reservoirs varied obviously in the eight tributaries during the period of 2003 2012 especially in the middle tributaries the largest changing trend occurred in the dongting lake basin and the poyang lake basin with the rates of 13 5 10 m8 yr 1 p 0 05 and 5 9 10 m8 yr 1 p 0 05 respectively figs 5 and 6 indicate that there were relatively large drought severity in the dongting lake basin and the poyang lake basin during the study period which partly reflected the large changes in surface water impoundment in the two tributaries caused by human activities compared with the middle tributaries the water storage in the large and medium size reservoirs for the upper tributaries i e the mintuo river basin the jialing river basin and the wu river basin also increased significantly p 0 05 nevertheless due to the locations and high altitudes of the three tributaries water consumption in the upper tributaries is relatively less as for the lower tributary the tai lake basin the water storage in reservoirs and water consumption both increased during the period of 2003 2012 while the frequency of drought occurrence was relatively high before 2008 hydrological drought is the result of the superimposed impacts of human activities and climate change exceeding a certain threshold the way in which to quantify the influences of affecting factors on droughts should be further studied 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainties this study used the vic model outputs zhang et al 2014b to downscale the grace data the vic model of zhang et al 2014b employs a high density of meteorological observations from the cma as model inputs and multigauge streamflow observations from the hbc for model calibration compared with the outputs of the global land data assimilation system the vic model outputs of zhang et al 2014b have a relatively better accuracy li et al 2018 rodell et al 2004b therefore the employment of the model outputs is an appropriate choice in addition the downscaled grace data is processed by a 3 month moving average filter to remove the abnormal values which might influence the drought identification however drought event identifications mainly depend on the average hydrologic conditions of a certain period therefore the procedure of 3 month moving average filter would not change the final results substantially 5 2 comparison with previous studies previous studies usually investigated hydrological drought over the yangtze river using different drought indicators based on observation values such as the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index standardized runoff index sri and standardized water level index shukla and wood 2008 zhang et al 2017 2016 for example zhang et al 2018 employed the sri to investigate hydrological drought in the middle tributaries of the yangtze river and found that the influences of human activity on drought were intensified however these results only reflected the shortage of surface water storage in the yangtze river the application of grace provides a useful method to assess the integrated drought condition considering the shortage of both surface and subsurface water storage some studies have investigated hydrological drought in the yangtze river based on the grace data long et al 2015b sun et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 2015 for example sun et al 2017 found that three major droughts occurred in 2004 2006 and 2011 in the yangtze river based on grace data from 2003 to 2015 zhang et al 2015 identified two severe drought events that occurred in the fall of 2006 and spring of 2011 using grace data from 2002 to 2013 this study also identifies two major droughts that occurred in 2006 and 2011 which is consistent with the results of previous studies however previous studies focused on droughts in the entire yangtze river due to the coarse resolution of the grace data it should be noted that because the tributaries of the yangtze river belong to different climate conditions there are significant regional differences from the upper tributaries to the lower tributaries for example this study finds there were little drought events before 2006 in the jinsha river basin whereas there was the longest and severest drought events before 2006 in the poyang lake basin fig 5 moreover the drought recovery time is difficult to evaluate due to the complex formation mechanism of drought events generally there are two major approaches to estimate the drought recovery time i e ecological approach and probabilistic method schwalm et al 2017 thomas et al 2014 for example schwalm et al 2017 investigated the drought recovery time of gross primary productivity globally using an ecological approach and found that the drought recovery time is relatively long in the tropics this study found that tributaries of the yangtze river with high values of cmi had long drought recovery times the result agrees well with the findings of schwalm et al 2017 however an ecological approach needs a lot of data from observations and remote sensing as inputs and it is difficult to predict the recovery time of drought events in the future compared with the ecological approach the probabilistic method used in this study is easy to execute and can be used to predict drought recovery time especially in data scarce regions 6 conclusions in this study the grace tws data from 2003 to 2012 was downscaled to a finer resolution based on a statistical downscaling approach and then the downscaled data was used to characterize hydrological drought for the eight tributaries of the yangtze river in china the downscaled grace data was capable of depicting the spatial differences of wsd changes in the yangtze river trends in wsd ranged from 0 86 to 0 29 mm month 1 for the eight tributaries during the period of 2003 2012 the eight tributaries experienced four to seven hydrological droughts the hydrological droughts in 2003 2006 and 2011 were identified in all of the tributaries the hydrological drought recovery time for the eight tributaries in the yangtze river was evaluated using a probabilistic approach the drought recovery rate was between 4 5 and 7 2 mm month 1 and the average drought recovery time was between 3 6 and 5 7 months although the drought recovery rates in the middle tributaries were rapid the severities of hydrological drought were large leading to long drought recovery times in addition the influences of human activity on hydrological droughts intensified and resulted in distinct differences in regional hydrological drought characterizations this study evaluated hydrological drought characteristics across the eight tributaries in the yangtze river based on the downscaled grace data it is beneficial for the extension of grace applications under different climatic conditions nevertheless it is still a challenge to explore the formation mechanism of hydrological drought and predict drought occurrence which needs further investigation acknowledgments this research was

6834,hydrological drought is increasing under the impact of global change which could have serious influences on the stability of ecological systems and water dependent human activities in the affected regions in this study the total water storage tws derived from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites from 2003 to 2012 was downscaled to a finer resolution by incorporating the output from a land surface model the downscaled data was used to identify hydrological drought for eight tributaries of the yangtze river in china the trend in the water storage deficit based on the downscaled grace data ranged from 0 86 to 0 29 mm month 1 for the eight tributaries from 2003 to 2012 among which the absolute largest value occurred in the poyang lake basin the eight tributaries experienced between four and seven hydrological droughts during the study period and droughts in 2003 2006 and 2011 occurred in all of the tributaries the drought recovery rate for the eight tributaries was between 4 5 and 7 2 mm month 1 and the average drought recovery time was between 3 6 and 5 7 months tributaries with a high climate moisture index had low frequencies of drought occurrence but had long drought durations and large drought severities resulting in long drought recovery times additionally the impacts of human activity on hydrologic processes intensified significantly from 2003 to 2012 such as water storage in reservoirs and water consumption leading to spatial differences in regional drought characterizations the results are useful for the understanding of the mechanism of hydrological drought formation and the extension of grace applications in medium and small scale catchments keywords grace data downscaling water storage deficit drought recovery time 1 introduction hydrological extremes are increasing under the impact of global change roudier et al 2016 sugiyama et al 2010 yoon et al 2015 as noted by the international hydrological program and the fifth assessment of the intergovernmental panel on climate change investigating hydrological extremes is an important issue in hydrological and meteorological studies flato et al 2013 zalewski et al 2016 it is reported that hydrological drought events occurred frequently during the past decade and had serious influences on the water demand of mankind agricultural irrigation and the stability of ecological systems bai et al 2018b jassey et al 2018 van loon and laaha 2015 so far investigations on hydrological drought include 1 the identification of drought events 2 the characterization of drought 3 the attribution of one or several drought events to its affecting factors and 4 the impact of drought on water resources agriculture and ecosystems chen et al 2009 long et al 2013 nath et al 2017 wanders and wada 2015 zhang et al 2017 these studies focused on the shortage of surface water storage based on the records from hydrometeorological stations and remote sensing data from satellites barker et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 however hydrological drought is a recurring water shortage phenomenon integrating both surface and subsurface water storage under the impacts of climate change and human activity schwalm et al 2017 the national aeronautics and space administration s gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites were launched in march 2002 and measured earth s gravity field with enough precision to infer terrestrial water mass variations over large regions sahoo et al 2016 swenson and wahr 2002 tapley et al 2004 compared with the conventional in situ observations and other remote sensing methods satellite gravity data from the grace satellites provides integrated information about the variation in total water storage tws through all components of the surface and subsurface water balance andersen et al 2005 frappart and ramillien 2018 rodell et al 2004a the grace data has been used in numerous hydrometeorological studies including evaporation estimation billah et al 2015 drought characterization schumacher et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 water storage component decomposition andrew et al 2017 castellazzi et al 2016 and improvement of hydrological modeling bai et al 2018a khaki et al 2017 long et al 2017 for example pan et al 2017 investigated the human induced change in evapotranspiration over the haihe river in china based on the grace data and found that human activities contributed to a 12 increase in evapotranspiration sinha et al 2017 studied hydrological drought in india using the grace observations and found that the grace based dataset was robust for drought characterization over large spatial scales bai et al 2018a incorporated the grace derived tws into hydrological modeling based on a multi objective calibration scheme and indicated that there was significant improvement in evapotranspiration simulation in dry catchments the spatial resolution of the grace tws data is coarse and the minimum area that can be used effectively by the grace data remains controversial vishwakarma et al 2018 several studies have investigated the spatial resolutions of the grace data in hydrological studies longuevergne et al 2010 rowlands et al 2005 tourian et al 2015 vishwakarma et al 2018 for example longuevergne et al 2010 indicated that the footprint of grace was approximately 200 000 km2 4 4 and dedicated methods were needed to study catchments smaller than 200 000 km2 vishwakarma et al 2018 compared four popular correction schemes of grace data over 255 catchments and found that a catchment of a size of approximately 63 000 km2 can be resolved by grace data generally the minimum area of grace application varies in different studies which increases the difficulty in the application of grace products for a better use of grace products in medium and small scale catchments wan et al 2015 proposed a land surface model based approach to downscale the coarse grace data to a finer resolution and applied the downscaled data to produce a monthly evapotranspiration dataset across the conterminous united states as the longest river in china the yangtze river comprises approximately 36 of china s water resources liu et al 2017 the yangtze river basin is one of the most developing regions in china accounting for approximately 41 of china s total gross domestic product according to the report of the national statistical bureau of china it is documented that the yangtze river experienced serious hydrological droughts in the last decade especially after the operation of the three gorges dam tgd began in 2003 dai et al 2008 huang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014a some studies have attempted to investigate hydrological drought in the yangtze river using the grace data ferreira et al 2013 huang et al 2015 sun et al 2017 for example tang et al 2014 extracted tws variations from the regional gravity signal based on the grace satellites and found that the recent heavy droughts in southwestern china can be captured by the observable nonseasonal gravity changes it should be noted that there are spatial differences in hydrological drought characterizations in the tributaries of the yangtze river because this river spans several climate zones however due to the coarse resolution of the grace data the spatial differences of hydrological drought and its recovery time among the tributaries of the yangtze river have not been investigated this study downscales the grace data to a finer resolution based on a land surface model and then uses the downscaled data to investigate the spatial differences in hydrological drought characterization in eight tributaries over the yangtze river the results are expected to give a generalized evaluation on hydrological drought monitoring based on the downscaled grace data it is essential for understanding of the formation mechanism of hydrological drought for medium and small scale watersheds as well as for the extension of grace applications the objectives of this study are 1 to analyze the spatial differences of the downscaled grace data in eight tributaries of the yangtze river 2 to identify hydrological drought based on the downscaled grace data and 3 to assess the recovery time of hydrological drought in different tributaries 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yangtze river 24 35 n 90 122 e originating from the tibet plateau in china traverses from the southwest to the east finally flowing into the east china sea fig 1 there are a number of hydrological stations in the yangtze river the yichang station and hukou station are conventionally considered the demarcation stations of the upper tributaries and the lower tributaries of the yangtze river respectively the yangtze river mainly includes eight tributaries where the upper tributaries of the yangtze river consist of the jinsha river basin mintuo river basin jialing river basin and wu river basin the middle tributaries of the yangtze river consist of the han river basin dongting lake basin and poyang lake basin and the lower tributaries of the yangtze river consist of the tai lake basin the drainage areas of the eight tributaries range from 36 790 to 473 237 km2 table 1 the average air temperature ranges from 9 to 18 c and the annual precipitation ranges from 692 to 1611 mm the upper tributaries belong to a high cold climate zone whereas the middle and lower tributaries belong to subtropical and temperate climate zones human activity intensifies gradually from the upper tributaries to the lower tributaries in the yangtze river sun et al 2016 yin and li 2001 the tgd is the largest hydroelectric power station in the world came into operation in june 2003 and is located approximately 44 km upstream of yichang station 2 2 data in this study the release 05 grace products provided by the center for space research csr geoforschungszentrum potsdam gfz and the jet propulsion laboratory jpl from january 2003 to december 2012 were employed with a resolution of 1 1 the ensemble mean values of the three tws data were used to reduce the uncertainties associated with data processing moreover since the grace tws data at small spatial scales tend to be attenuated the average values obtained by six sets of scaling factors provided by long et al 2015a were used to restore the true signal amplitude this procedure can minimize the uncertainties in the tws dataset resulting from scaling approaches long et al 2015a zhang et al 2016 the tws data simulated by the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrologic model was used to downscale the grace tws time series zhang et al 2014b tws was calculated as the sum of soil moisture and snow water equivalent simulated by the vic model the vic model performed well in china with a high resolution of 0 25 0 25 because it employed a high density of meteorological observations from the china meteorological administration cma as model inputs and multigauge streamflow observations from the hydrology bureau of china hbc for model calibration it should be noted that the ground water storage is not included in this model details of the model s calibration and validation can be found in zhang et al 2014b the monthly air temperature sunshine duration relative humidity and wind speed in the yangtze river during the period of 2003 to 2012 were collected from the cma the penman formula was used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration pet penman 1948 shuttleworth 1993 the climate moisture index cmi was employed to characterize the climate condition of each tributary which was estimated as the ratio of precipitation to pet willmott and feddema 1992 the runoff data 2003 2012 for the tributaries were collected from the hbc because the tai lake basin locates in the yangtze river delta and there are many rivers flowing into the tai lake the total runoff of the tai lake basin is difficult to estimate therefore the analysis of runoff in this tributary is not involved in this study information of hydrological stations for the tributaries is given in table s1 the water consumption dataset and water storage in large and medium size reservoirs during the period of 2003 2012 for the eight tributaries were collected from the water resources bulletin of the yangtze river 3 method 3 1 downscaling of the grace data a statistical downscaling approach based on a land surface model is employed to downscale the grace tws data in this study wan et al 2015 first the original grace data is aggregated to 4 to match the footprint of grace because of the high resolution and good accuracy of the vic outputs the tws simulated by the vic model processed by zhang et al 2014b is used for downscaling processes noting that the vic derived tws data should be first normalized by the same normalization procedure used in the grace data where each monthly grace value represents the surface mass deviation for that month relative to the baseline average over january 2004 to december 2009 wan et al 2015 then the weight of tws for each 0 25 grid at a 4 4 square is calculated last the original grace tws is downscaled to 0 25 by the following formula 1 tw s d i t w s vic i b a t w s vic 0 i t w s vic 0 i a i where twsd i is the downscaled grace tws tws vic i is the normalized vic based tws b is the bias between the vic based tws and grace based tws at the 4 grid cell a is the total area of the 4 grid cell containing the 0 25 grid cell ai is area of the 0 25 grid cell and tws vic0 i is the prenormalized vic based tws the advantage of this downscaling method ensures that the sum of the downscaled tws values in each 4 grid cell is equal to the corresponding 4 grace tws value 3 2 statistical method the empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf is the cumulative distribution function associated with the empirical measure of the sample smirnov 1948 turnbull 1976 which is widely used in hydrological and meteorological studies cannon 2018 favre et al 2004 jung et al 2017 the ecdf is a step function that jumps up by 1 n at each of the n data points for a given observations series x 1 x 2 xi xn the empirical cumulative distribution function fn t for x is defined as 2 f n t 1 n i 1 n i x i t where i x i t is the indicator function which is equal to 1 if xi t and equal to 0 otherwise the kolmogorov smirnov test quantifies whether the ecdf is fitting to the theoretical cdf which is a nonparametric test of the equality of continuous and one dimensional probability distributions kanji 2006 rajan et al 2014 it has the advantage of making no assumption of data distribution the kolmogorov smirnov statistic d for a given cumulative distribution function f t can be calculated as 3 d max f n t f t if d is smaller than the threshold d a there are no significant differences between the ecdf and theoretical cdf which indicates the distribution of the given data is normal in addition the pearson correlation coefficient r is used to analyze the relationships between the key variables related to hydrological drought trends in hydrological variables during 2003 2012 are determined using linear regression a t test is conducted to determine whether correlations and trends are significant at the level of 95 3 3 evaluation of hydrological drought and its recovery time a hydrological drought is identified by the method proposed by zhang et al 2016 as at least three months of the grace tws lower than its average condition for a certain month the relatively short inter drought period is neglected between two drought events less than three months in this study which might be a short alleviation for the former drought the severity s mm of each hydrological drought is calculated as 4 s i k k d r tws j tw s i where tws i is the downscaled tws for month i and tws j is the corresponding average value of tws for a given month whereby j i 12 i 12 1 leading to 1 j 12 in particular the difference between tws j and tws i is defined as the water storage deficit wsd k is the beginning time of a former drought event and dr is the prolonged drought duration the severity during each inter drought period is assumed to be zero because there is noise in the grace data the downscaled grace tws are reprocessed by a 3 month moving average filter prior to drought analysis thomas et al 2014 the hydrological recovery time is calculated based on a statistical method proposed by thomas et al 2014 the rate of change of wsd during a certain period can be assessed by 5 δ wsd δ t ws d i ws d i 1 where δ wsd δ t represents the rate of change of the water storage deficit and δt represents the time interval one month in this study if δ wsd δ t follows a standard normal distribution according to a one sample kolmogorov smirnov test the 68th percentile value c 1 standard deviation is used as the recovery rate of wsd for any deficit month then the drought recovery time rt for each month can be obtained by thomas et al 2014 6 rt w s d c where c is the drought recovery rate during the study period and rt month is the drought recovery time of the water storage deficit according to this method a probabilistic recovery time can be assessed for each hydrological drought 4 results 4 1 spatial distribution of the downscaled grace data fig 2 shows the trends in tws over the yangtze river based on the downscaled 0 25 0 25 and the original 1 1 grace data from 2003 to 2012 the spatial patterns of the two dataset were consistent with each other where there were negative trends in tws over the upper tributaries and positive trends over the middle and lower tributaries of the yangtze river the downscaled grace data can reflect the spatial differences of tws in the yangtze river fig 3 shows the variations of tws based on the downscaled grace data and vic model as well as runoff in the eight tributaries of the yangtze river the three datasets had good consistencies during the period of 2003 2012 the correlation coefficient between tws derived from the downscaled grace data and runoff ranged from 0 53 to 0 91 which further indicates that the downscaled grace tws is reliable in this study variations in wsd based on the downscaled grace data for the eight tributaries are provided in fig 4 wsd increased at the jinsha river basin and the mintuo river basin with the rates of 0 29 p 0 05 and 0 14 p 0 05 mm month 1 respectively however wsd decreased at the other six tributaries and four of them decreased significantly p 0 05 the largest absolute trend in wsd occurred in the poyang lake basin with a value of 0 86 mm month 1 p 0 05 the lowest absolute trend in wsd occurred in the han river basin with a value of 0 01 mm month 1 p 0 05 wsd in the middle tributaries changed more dramatically than that in the upper and lower tributaries of the yangtze river except in the han river basin 4 2 identification of hydrological drought events hydrological drought based on the downscaled grace data occurred between four and seven times in the eight tributaries of the yangtze river during 2003 2012 fig 5 the drought events in 2003 2006 and 2011 appeared in all of the tributaries the average drought duration for the eight tributaries ranged from 7 1 to 13 5 months and the average drought severity ranged from 131 to 461 mm fig 6 the droughts in the dongting lake basin and the poyang lake basin were relatively severe compared with the other six tributaries with the average severities of 367 and 461 mm respectively note that droughts in the dongting lake basin and the poyang lake basin could be interdependent because dongting lake and poyang lake are both connected with the yangtze river and the water levels in the two lakes are influenced by the yangtze river water levels simultaneously huang et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 the characterizations of the longest and most severe hydrological droughts were summarized in table 2 the longest drought was also the most severe drought in each tributary during the period of 2003 2012 in terms of drought duration the longest drought occurred in the dongting lake basin lasting 34 months starting from june 2003 the severity of this drought was 1476 mm the peak wsd of this drought was 116 mm occurring in january 2004 in terms of drought severity the most severe drought occurred in the poyang lake basin starting from june 2003 and lasting 33 months with the drought severity of 1599 mm the peak wsd of this drought was 128 mm occurring in january 2004 the characterizations of the two droughts including starting time duration peak wsd and severity were similar indicating the two droughts could be interdependent due to the influences of yangtze water levels in addition hydrological drought statistics based on the downscaled grace data were compared with those based on the vic data figs 5 and 6 there were between three and ten occurrences of vic based hydrological drought in the eight tributaries the average drought duration was between 5 5 and 20 2 months and the average drought severity was between 2398 and 15 520 mm the distributions of hydrological droughts based on the downscaled grace data were consistent with that based on the vic data in the four upper tributaries i e the jinsha river basin the mintuo river basin the jialing river basin and the wu river basin fig 5 however there were differences in hydrological drought occurrences identified by the two datasets in the middle and lower tributaries this is because human activities are relatively obvious in the middle and lower tributaries of the yangtze river such as reservoir construction agriculture irrigation and water transfers hou et al 2017 yang et al 2015 the vic model simulates water balance components without considering the impacts of human activities which leads to the differences between the vic based droughts and the grace based droughts nevertheless the major drought events can be both captured by the downscaled grace data and vic output 4 3 assessment of hydrological drought recovery times table 3 shows that the statistic d for the eight tributaries is lower than da using the one sample kolmogorov smirnov test which indicates δ wsd δ t is in accordance with the standard normal distribution therefore it is appropriate to estimate the recovery time of hydrological drought in the yangtze river based on the employed approach in this study the drought recovery rate varied in the eight tributaries the dongting lake basin had the largest drought recovery rate with the value of 7 2 mm month 1 whereas the jinsha river basin had the lowest drought recovery rate with the value of 4 5 mm month 1 a relatively high value of the drought recovery rate indicates a tendency for depleted storage levels to increase rapidly which is expected to occur in regions where surface and subsurface storage capacities are relatively large for the eight tributaries the average drought recovery time rt was between 3 6 and 5 7 months fig 7 the high values of average rt mainly occurred in the dongting lake basin and the poyang lake basin with values of 5 0 and 5 7 months respectively fig 8 although the drought recovery rates in the two tributaries were rapid the severities of hydrological droughts were high leading to relatively long drought recovery times for the longest and the most severe drought events over the eight tributaries the average rt for these drought events ranged from 3 5 to 7 2 months and rt for the peak wsd ranged from 8 2 to 19 1 months 4 4 factors affecting hydrological drought characterizations hydrological drought events are influenced by regional climate and human activity van loon 2015 wanders and wada 2015 the climate moisture index cmi the ratio of annual precipitation to pet is usually used to represent the climate condition of a certain basin hogg et al 2013 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 a basin with a relatively high cmi has relatively high excess rainfall to investigate the spatial differences in the characteristics of hydrological drought in the tributaries of the yangtze river hydrological drought statistics were compared to the cmi in this study fig 9 a shows a positive relationship between the average rt and cmi with the r of 0 73 p 0 05 indicating that basins with relatively high excess rainfall have relatively long drought recovery times this is because these basins typically have relatively high surface subsurface storage bai and liu 2018 once hydrological droughts occurred more water is needed for wsd to recovery to normal condition in the yangtze river the occurrences of hydrological drought decreased with increasing cmi r 0 43 p 0 05 fig 9b while the average drought duration fig 9c and drought severity fig 9d increased with increasing cmi with r values of 0 53 p 0 05 and 0 89 p 0 05 respectively that is the frequency of hydrological drought is low but the drought duration is long and the severity is severe in basins with relatively high excess rainfall leading to long drought recovery times in addition to the impact of climatic conditions on hydrological drought events human activity also has influences on hydrological drought characterizations over the yangtze river fig 10 shows that the water storage in large and medium size reservoirs varied obviously in the eight tributaries during the period of 2003 2012 especially in the middle tributaries the largest changing trend occurred in the dongting lake basin and the poyang lake basin with the rates of 13 5 10 m8 yr 1 p 0 05 and 5 9 10 m8 yr 1 p 0 05 respectively figs 5 and 6 indicate that there were relatively large drought severity in the dongting lake basin and the poyang lake basin during the study period which partly reflected the large changes in surface water impoundment in the two tributaries caused by human activities compared with the middle tributaries the water storage in the large and medium size reservoirs for the upper tributaries i e the mintuo river basin the jialing river basin and the wu river basin also increased significantly p 0 05 nevertheless due to the locations and high altitudes of the three tributaries water consumption in the upper tributaries is relatively less as for the lower tributary the tai lake basin the water storage in reservoirs and water consumption both increased during the period of 2003 2012 while the frequency of drought occurrence was relatively high before 2008 hydrological drought is the result of the superimposed impacts of human activities and climate change exceeding a certain threshold the way in which to quantify the influences of affecting factors on droughts should be further studied 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainties this study used the vic model outputs zhang et al 2014b to downscale the grace data the vic model of zhang et al 2014b employs a high density of meteorological observations from the cma as model inputs and multigauge streamflow observations from the hbc for model calibration compared with the outputs of the global land data assimilation system the vic model outputs of zhang et al 2014b have a relatively better accuracy li et al 2018 rodell et al 2004b therefore the employment of the model outputs is an appropriate choice in addition the downscaled grace data is processed by a 3 month moving average filter to remove the abnormal values which might influence the drought identification however drought event identifications mainly depend on the average hydrologic conditions of a certain period therefore the procedure of 3 month moving average filter would not change the final results substantially 5 2 comparison with previous studies previous studies usually investigated hydrological drought over the yangtze river using different drought indicators based on observation values such as the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index standardized runoff index sri and standardized water level index shukla and wood 2008 zhang et al 2017 2016 for example zhang et al 2018 employed the sri to investigate hydrological drought in the middle tributaries of the yangtze river and found that the influences of human activity on drought were intensified however these results only reflected the shortage of surface water storage in the yangtze river the application of grace provides a useful method to assess the integrated drought condition considering the shortage of both surface and subsurface water storage some studies have investigated hydrological drought in the yangtze river based on the grace data long et al 2015b sun et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 2015 for example sun et al 2017 found that three major droughts occurred in 2004 2006 and 2011 in the yangtze river based on grace data from 2003 to 2015 zhang et al 2015 identified two severe drought events that occurred in the fall of 2006 and spring of 2011 using grace data from 2002 to 2013 this study also identifies two major droughts that occurred in 2006 and 2011 which is consistent with the results of previous studies however previous studies focused on droughts in the entire yangtze river due to the coarse resolution of the grace data it should be noted that because the tributaries of the yangtze river belong to different climate conditions there are significant regional differences from the upper tributaries to the lower tributaries for example this study finds there were little drought events before 2006 in the jinsha river basin whereas there was the longest and severest drought events before 2006 in the poyang lake basin fig 5 moreover the drought recovery time is difficult to evaluate due to the complex formation mechanism of drought events generally there are two major approaches to estimate the drought recovery time i e ecological approach and probabilistic method schwalm et al 2017 thomas et al 2014 for example schwalm et al 2017 investigated the drought recovery time of gross primary productivity globally using an ecological approach and found that the drought recovery time is relatively long in the tropics this study found that tributaries of the yangtze river with high values of cmi had long drought recovery times the result agrees well with the findings of schwalm et al 2017 however an ecological approach needs a lot of data from observations and remote sensing as inputs and it is difficult to predict the recovery time of drought events in the future compared with the ecological approach the probabilistic method used in this study is easy to execute and can be used to predict drought recovery time especially in data scarce regions 6 conclusions in this study the grace tws data from 2003 to 2012 was downscaled to a finer resolution based on a statistical downscaling approach and then the downscaled data was used to characterize hydrological drought for the eight tributaries of the yangtze river in china the downscaled grace data was capable of depicting the spatial differences of wsd changes in the yangtze river trends in wsd ranged from 0 86 to 0 29 mm month 1 for the eight tributaries during the period of 2003 2012 the eight tributaries experienced four to seven hydrological droughts the hydrological droughts in 2003 2006 and 2011 were identified in all of the tributaries the hydrological drought recovery time for the eight tributaries in the yangtze river was evaluated using a probabilistic approach the drought recovery rate was between 4 5 and 7 2 mm month 1 and the average drought recovery time was between 3 6 and 5 7 months although the drought recovery rates in the middle tributaries were rapid the severities of hydrological drought were large leading to long drought recovery times in addition the influences of human activity on hydrological droughts intensified and resulted in distinct differences in regional hydrological drought characterizations this study evaluated hydrological drought characteristics across the eight tributaries in the yangtze river based on the downscaled grace data it is beneficial for the extension of grace applications under different climatic conditions nevertheless it is still a challenge to explore the formation mechanism of hydrological drought and predict drought occurrence which needs further investigation acknowledgments this research was
