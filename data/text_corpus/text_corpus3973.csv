19865,the use of somatic coliphages as indicators of fecal and viral pollution in water and food has great potential due to the reliability reproducibility speed and cost effectiveness of methods for their detection indeed several countries already use this approach in their water management policies although standardized protocols for somatic coliphage detection are available user friendly commercial kits would facilitate their routine implementation in laboratories the new method presented here allows detection of up to 1 somatic coliphage in under 3 5 h well within one working day the method is based on a modified escherichia coli strain with knocked out uidb and uidc genes which encode the transport of glucuronic acid inside cells and overexpressing uida which encodes the enzyme β glucuronidase the enzyme accumulated in the bacterial cells only has contact with its substrate after cell lysis such as that caused by phages since the strain cannot internalize the substrate when the enzyme is released into the medium which contains a chromogen analogous to glucuronic acid it produces a change of color from yellow to dark blue this microbiological method for the determination of fecal pollution via the detection of culturable microorganisms can be applied to diverse sample types and volumes for qualitative presence absence and quantitative analysis and is the fastest reported to date graphical abstract image keywords indicator fecal pollution coliphages virus new tools 1 introduction fecal water pollution is an important cause of pathogen transmission and is associated with several thousand human mortalities per day around the world lechevallier and kwok keung 2004 the indicators most commonly used to determine fecal pollution levels in different water sources are bacterial but fecal contaminated water also contains viral and protozoan pathogens this has raised doubts within the water microbiology community concerning the capacity of bacterial indicators to measure water quality and predict waterborne viral disease hazards borchardt et al 2004 gerba et al 1979 grabow 2001 keswick et al 1984 payment et al 1997 therefore additional indicators are advisable to predict the presence and behavior of viruses in water several groups of bacteriophages have been proposed as indicator microorganisms to assess fecal and viral contamination of water the potential value of different groups of phages that infect enteric bacteria as quality indicators in water biosolids and food has been studied in depth and reviewed armon and kott 1996 bosch et al 2001 goyal 2006 grabow 2001 hsu et al 2002 iawprc study group on health related water microbiology 1991 jofre 2007 one of these bacteriophage groups are somatic coliphages which replicate in escherichia coli after infection through the cell wall iawprc study group on health related water microbiology 1991 somatic coliphages are abundant in fecally contaminated samples and there are standardized methods for their detection and quantification anonymous 2000 u s epa 2001a 2001b the standardized iso and u s epa methods are faster than the tests to identify bacterial indicators easy to perform cost effective and reasonably robust mooijman et al 2005 u s epa 2003a 2003b however current methods are still multi step processes that require several media and operations and more than 8 h that is more than one ordinary working day to yield results although the use of somatic coliphages as fecal indicators was proposed years ago iawprc study group on health related water microbiology 1991 they have only recently been included in water and sludge quality guidelines for example those affecting water reclamation north carolina administration 2011 queensland government 2005 groundwater nhmrc and nrmmc 2011 u s epa 2006 biosolids applied in agriculture republica de colombia 2014 western australian government 2012 and aquaculture practices food and drug administration and interestate shellfish sanitation comission 2015 additionally the u s regulatory authorities u s epa 2016 u s epa 2015 are currently studying the application of coliphages in the quality control of bathing and recreational surface water as the use of somatic coliphages expands simpler and faster detection methods will be required the availability of straightforward ready to use tests would facilitate routine implementation of the methods in laboratories and encourage their adoption in guidelines for water biosolids and food quality management unfortunately the use of molecular techniques such as pcr which would provide a rapid detection is not possible because somatic coliphages are a heterogeneous group belonging to different phage families muniesa et al 1999 that do not share common dna sequences among various approaches to devise such a method some are based on the measurement of the phage mediated release of intracellular molecules such as the intracellular enzyme β galactosidase ijzerman et al 1994 1993 salter and durbin 2012 or adenylate kinase guzmán luna et al 2009 however this approach has certain drawbacks that still need to be resolved including long incubation times when the phage density is low or frequent false positive results the present study reports further progress in this field with a method based on an engineered host bacterium herein we describe a somatic coliphage detection method based on a modified e coli host strain the modification is located in a genetic operon specific for e coli the β glucuronidase system an assay based on β glucuronidase has already been applied to detect e coli in agar plates e g chromocult merck laboratories darmstadt germany or liquid media colilert idexx laboratories inc maine us and has been approved by some food management agencies for drinking water and processed food samples anonymous 2001 the media contain the substrate x glucuronide which is cleaved by ß d glucuronidase a characteristic enzyme of e coli e coli grown in this media develop a dark blue coloration or fluorescence frampton et al 1988 kilian and bülow 1976 the β glucuronidase system in e coli is composed of several genes liang et al 2005 for our purpose we focused on the uida uidb and uidc genes that encode the uida b and c proteins uida is the active subunit an intracellular acid glucuronoside glucuronosohydrolase with broad substrate specificity novel and novel 1976 uidb which is located in the inner membrane is a proton dependent transporter specifically for importing α and β glucuronides into the cell making it essential for glucuronide transport uidc which is associated with the outer membrane does not confer transport activity but it improves the efficiency of transport by uidb through an unknown mechanism liang et al 2005 β glucuronide molecules are imported by the activity of uidc and uidb and once inside the cell are cleaved by uida novel and novel 1976 the objective of this work was to develop a method that allows the rapid detection of somatic coliphages at low densities while minimizing false negative results the method named bluephage incorporates a tailored e coli strain with two features that improve its sensitivity for phage detection on the one hand it overexpresses the uida gene causing an accumulation of the β glucuronidase enzyme in the cytoplasm on the other it lacks the genes uidb and uidc involved in introducing the substrate into the cell the culture medium used in this test incorporates the substrate 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl β d glucuronic acid which turns blue after its cleavage by β glucuronidase consequently only after the host strain cells are lysed as occurs after phage infection will the enzyme degrade the substrate which in turn causes the medium to change color thereby providing fast phage detection in a given sample 2 materials and methods 2 1 medium and growth conditions the media and conditions used here are those included in the iso protocol for the culture of e coli wg5 strain anonymous 2000 the method employs a modified version of modified scholten s broth msb anonymous 2000 the modified msb medium is supplemented with 0 05 w v arabinose 0 5 v v glycerol 15 μl cacl2 1 m and 0 1 mg ml 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl β d glucuronic acid when necessary for the selection of colonies transformed with the pbad vector ampicillin ap 100 μg ml was added to the liquid medium the modified bacterial strain and bacteriophages were inoculated into msb media and incubated at 37 c for variable periods from 1 to 18 h unless specified otherwise 2 2 plasmids plasmid pkd46 genbank ay048746 expressing the red recombinase system was used to insert dna fragments into the e coli chromosome datsenko and wanner 2000

purified using qiagen plasmid midi purification kits qiagen inc valencia usa 2 3 bacteriophages the bacteriophages in this study were used from laboratory stocks of known concentration 109 pfu ml containing a pure culture of one bacteriophage or naturally occurring somatic coliphages coliphages were purified from 1 ml of raw urban sewage from the influent of a wastewater treatment plant that serves approximately 500 000 inhabitants containing ca 104 5 pfu ml or 50 ml of llobregat river water ca 103 pfu ml both sampling points are located in the barcelona area spain phage фx174 atcc 13706 b1 was used as a reference phage for somatic coliphages in accordance with the iso protocol anonymous 2000 to prepare a phage mixture two phages som3 and som23 muniesa et al 2003 which belong to myoviridae and siphoviridae morphological types respectively were used together with phage фx174 anonymous 2000 the environmental samples used were filtered through 0 22 μm pore size low protein binding pes membranes millipore usa to remove bacteria and other particulate material 2 4 pcr techniques pcrs were performed with a geneamp 2400 pcr system perkin elmer pe applied biosystems barcelona spain the oligonucleotides used in this study are shown in table 1 and were designed from the sequence available for e coli k 12 genbank accession number nc 000913 2 5 electroporation electrocompetent cells were prepared from 50 ml of culture in super optimal broth sob medium hanahan 1983 with 0 05 l arabinose as previously described sambrook and russell 2001 mixed with the corresponding amount of dna plasmid or pcr amplified 0 5 μg and transferred to a 0 2 cm electroporation cuvette bio rad inc the cells were electroporated at 2 5 kv 25 f and 200 ω cells containing the construct were recovered on msb agar with the corresponding antibiotic 2 6 generation of a tailored cb10 strain the e coli strain wg5 the wild type strain wt recommended in the iso standard method for the detection of somatic coliphages anonymous 2000 was genetically modified in several steps 2 6 1 uida overexpression a fragment containing the gene encoding the β glucuronidase enzyme uida 1847 bp was amplified by pcr with primers uida for2 uida rev2 table 1 from wt e coli and cloned using a pbad topo ta expression kit the latter contains a pbad topo vector that allows gene insertion under the control of an arabad promoter invitrogene corporation barcelona spain the uida gene was inserted into the plasmid following the manufacturer s instructions the construct was separately transformed in electrocompetent cells prepared with wt e coli in the resulting construct pbad uida the gene was positioned in the correct orientation immediately downstream of the p ara inducible promoter as confirmed by pcr using primers pbadf pbadr table 1 and sequencing the expression of uida in the pbad vector was optimized by adding arabinose to the medium at different final concentrations ranging from 0 to 0 02 as described by the manufacturer invitrogen corporation barcelona spain finally arabinose was added to a final concentration of 0 05 in the media both vectors contain an ampicillin marker therefore the strains containing the plasmid construct were grown in the presence of ampicillin in an initial stage 2 6 2 construction of the uidb tet uidc fragment the amplimer containing the tet gene was constructed replacing the whole fragment comprising uidb and uidc genes the primer pair tc5 tc3 table 1 was used for the amplification of the tet gene 1343 bp the primer pair uidb up uidb tc5 amplified a 5 region of the uidb initial codon including a 20 bp tail homologous with the 5 region of tet 279 bp primers uidc tc3 uidc lp amplified the 3 region of the uidc subunit 261 bp fig 1 including a 20 bp fragment homologue of the 3 region of tet the conditions used for all primer combinations were an annealing temperature of 50 c and an elongation time of 60 s fragments uidb and tet were annealed at their overlapping region underlined letters in table 1 they were then amplified by pcr as a single fragment with the external primers uidb up and tc3 generating a fragment of 1602 bp with an annealing temperature of 55 c and an elongation time of 2 min fragments uidc and tet were annealed at their overlapping region with the external primers uidc lp tc5 underlined letters in table

primers uidb up uidc lp generating the final fragment 1843 bp in which the sequence between genes uidb and uidc was replaced by the tet gene the uidb tet uidc fragment was excised from the gel and purified using the qiaquick gel extraction kit qiagen inc valencia usa the final product was used for the electrotransformation in the wt strain 2 6 3 transformation of pkd46 plasmid pkd46 genbank ay048746 was transformed by electroporation in electrocompetent wt e coli cells prepared as described above transformed colonies were selected by resistance to ampicillin and the presence of pkd46 was confirmed by pcr using the primer pair rr46 up rr46 lp and sequencing 2 6 4 recombination of uidb tet uidc the transformation of 30 μl of the fragment 6 uidb tet uidc pcr amplimer corresponding to 0 1 0 5 μg of amplified dna was performed in electrocompetent wt cells containing vector pkd46 these cells were prepared from 50 ml cultures approximately 5 1010 cfu ml grown at 30 c in sob medium with ampicillin and 0 05 l arabinose to an od600 of 0 6 the transformed cells were recovered in the presence of tc 10 μg ml colonies in which uidb and uidc were replaced by fragment 6 were confirmed by pcr using the uidb uidc primers and by sequencing the strain was forced to lose the plasmid pkd46 by several growing steps at 37 c pkd46 cannot replicate over 30 c without ampicillin the loss of the pkd46 plasmid was confirmed by pcr 2 6 5 construction of cb10 the mutant lacking the uidb and uidc genes was transformed with plasmid pbad uida generating strain cb10 δuidbuidc tet pbad uida the presence of plasmid pbad was confirmed the performance of strain cb10 in detecting somatic coliphages was compared with that of the wt strain using a suspension of phages som3 som23 and фx174 propagated in the laboratory and with phages occurring in environmental samples 2 7 assays of the bluephage method strain cb10 was inoculated in standard msb with ampicillin and incubated overnight at 37 c one ml of the overnight culture was 1 100 diluted in fresh msb with ampicillin and grown to the exponential growth phase monitored by an optical density od at 600 nm of 0 3 at this stage 0 5 ml of this culture was added to 2 5 ml of the msb medium containing 0 05 arabinose 0 5 glycerol 15 μl cacl 1 m and 0 1 mg ml of x glucuronide 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl β d glucuronic acid cyclohexylammonium salt c20h26brcln2o7 as the substrate as indicated in each experiment aliquots of dilutions of the corresponding phage suspension were added to each tube and one tube without phages was kept as a control the tubes were statically incubated at 37 c and periodically evaluated for color change from light yellow to blue the experiment lasted until the phage free control tube turned blue a minimum of 7 h the method was also adapted for quantification using the most probable number mpn method 2 8 spot test confirmation of phages detected by bluephage from each tube inoculated using the bluephage method after the reported incubation period 15 μl aliquots were taken and spiked onto an agar monolayer containing strain cb10 according with the iso method anonymous 2000 the plates were side up incubated at 37 c plaques appearing in the spot area were considered positive for the presence of phages in a given sample positive results for this spot test were compared with positive results in the bluephage tube to evaluate the sensitivity of the new method for a quantitative comparison the mpn method was applied to the positive spot tests and the positive tubes obtained with the bluephage method and compared with the number of phages detected by the conventional iso method anonymous 2000 2 9 sensitivity of the bluephage method to evaluate the sensitivity of the method and the minimum incubation time needed for the analysis somatic coliphages were enumerated in natural water samples using the iso method anonymous 2000 the samples were filtered through 0 22 μm low binding membranes pes millipore and diluted to reach estimated lower densities of phages each dilution was evaluated in triplicate using the bluephage method the minimum time to obtain results was reported the performance of the test was assayed at 20 c 25 c 30 c 37 c and 44 c wastewater and river water samples filter sterilized through high protein binding membranes of 0 22 μm millex mf millipore to remove phages were used as additional controls 2 10 assay protocol in solid samples sludge and mussels to evaluate the performance of the method in matrices other than water sludge samples from the digestor of a wastewater treatment plant in the barcelona metropolitan area which serves approximately 500 000 people and mussels obtained from local supermarkets were processed the method for phage extraction from sludge corresponds to the methods used in established policies as described previously by lasobras et al 1999 with minor modifications briefly the samples were mixed in a 1 10 w v ratio with pbs ph 7 4 and homogenized by magnetic stirring for 30 min at room temperature the suspension was then centrifuged at 10 000 g for 30 min at 4 c the supernatant was subsequently filtered through low protein binding 0 22 μm pore size membrane filters millex gp millipore bedford ma the suspension was diluted and used to enumerate phages using the standard iso method and analyzed in triplicate using bluephage for the study of phages in mussels samples were spiked with somatic coliphages from raw sewage to reach a final estimated concentration of 102 103 pfu g of mussel phages were incubated with the samples for 2 h at 23 c there is no established guideline for phage extraction from mussels so previously reported methods were used lucena et al 1994 briefly mussel meat from a minimum of 10 mussels per sample was homogenized in a blender for 5 min elution of phage particles was performed on 100 ml of the homogenate by magnetic stirring for 15 min in 400 ml of borate buffer 0 01 m containing 3 beef extract ph 9 5 after neutralization to ph 7 2 the treated homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 2500 g for 15 min at 4 c phages present in the supernatant were enumerated by the iso standard procedure and detected by the bluephage method 2 11 scaling up and down of the bluephage method to evaluate the performance of the method in different sample volumes 100 ml bottles were used with 50 ml of river water samples diluted to contain phage densities of 10 pfu ml similarly small volumes of 1 5 ml containing densities from 104 to 0 1 phages were used both assays were performed keeping the same proportion of nutrients substrate and strain cb10 as in the tubes 2 12 statistical analysis computation of data and statistical tests were performed using the statistical package for social science software spss the anova test was used to evaluate the differences between mpn spot test and bluephage results evaluations were based on 5 of significance levels 3 results 3 1 method rationale and strain performance the genetically modified e coli strain referred to henceforth as strain cb10 described in this study was grown in the presence of the substrate without its consumption since the substrate cannot be incorporated inside the cell in the absence of transporter genes only when phage infection caused cell lysis was β glucuronidase which is overexpressed in the presence of arabinose and accumulated in the cell cytoplasm released into the medium where it encountered the substrate even as few as 1 to 5 somatic coliphages were able to lyse a number of cells exceeding 108 in less than 3 h thus liberating a large amount of enzyme into the medium the enzyme in the medium cleaves the d glucuronide in the 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl β d glucuronic acid molecules releasing the blue substrate that turns the broth originally light yellow dark blue the time necessary for this color change varied depending on the number of bacteria lysed and hence on the concentration of phages added to the cell culture and the time elapsed after infection the performance of cb10 in the presence of the substrate was evaluated before using it for phage detection to do this the e coli wg5 wt strain containing pbad uida and cb10 with and without phages were compared when inoculated into the broth for the bluephage method we observed a slight but visible color change with the wt e coli fig 2 meanwhile strain cb10 had no effect on the color in the absence of phages because of its incapacity to incorporate the substrate caused by replacement of the uidbuidc complex the highest expression of the enzyme was observed in the wt strain containing pbad uida in the presence of 0 02 arabinose which produced a darker blue than the wt strain finally on adding phages from wastewater we used a high quantity of 103 pfu to test the method under optimal conditions cb10 caused a change of color after only 1 5 h of incubation fig 2 3 2 the cb10 strain and the standard method detected the same number of phages to confirm that the modification of the wt strain did not cause a decrease in the number of phages detected its performance was compared with the wt strain according to the iso method anonymous 2000 the phage counts obtained with both strains showed no significant differences p 0 05 table 2 3 3 performance of the bluephage method with environmental samples filtered wastewater and river water samples were 10 fold diluted and added to the bluephage tubes containing strain cb10 at descending phage densities in fig 3 the tubes correspond to estimated 500 50 5 and 1 pfu tube calculation based on the dilution of the sample and one control tube that contained only cb10 and no phages the cultures were incubated at 37 c and the color change was monitored over time fig 3 the first positive results were observed at 1 30 h for concentrations of 50 and 500 phages cultures containing 5 phages turned blue after 2 15 h nevertheless the tubes were incubated until the control culture turned blue which required a minimal incubation time of 7 h samples were considered negative for the presence of phages if blue coloration did not occur before the time needed for the control sample to change color fig 3 potentially polluted wastewater and river samples were 10 fold diluted and the number of somatic coliphages was evaluated using the iso method table 3 the color change was monitored after 2 30 h 3 30 h and 4 30 h times that were selected to generate results within one working day the resulting number of positive tubes out of the total number of tubes assayed at the different times for each phage density are presented in table 3 notably at higher phage densities detection occurred after 2 30 h some samples with high phage densities turned blue even earlier at 1 30 h data not shown in general tubes with high phage densities changed color earlier than those with low densities table 3 although a clear correspondence between the number of phages and the time required for the color change was not always observed as discussed below the minimal time to observe color change in tubes with 5 pfu was 2 30 h as for example in tubes with densities of 0 7 pfu tube in wastewater or 3 4 pfu tube in river water table 3 nevertheless at 4 30 h all the tubes containing 10 pfu tube were positive and 46 of the tubes containing 1 10 pfu tube had also turned blue this time is well within the time frame in which the phage free negative control remained without changing color in parallel no changes were observed in the filter sterilized diluted wastewater and river water control samples from which the phages had been removed 3 4 results using the bluephage method at different temperatures the above mentioned results were obtained when incubating at 37 c with the same results obtained at 44 c in contrast at 20 c and 25 c longer incubation times 5 h were required before the color change was detected in the tubes containing 500 pfu accordingly the phage free control tube also remained unaltered for longer and no change of color was observed before 12 h of incubation 3 5 sensitivity and specificity of the bluephage method to confirm that the color change in inoculated tubes was due to the presence of phages the supernatant of each tube including the negative tubes underwent a spot test on strain cb10 positive results of both bluephage and the spot test were used to enumerate the phages using the mpn method the results recorded after 3 5 h of incubation by the bluephage method and by the spot test were used to determine the phage densities using mpn calculations fig 4 in all cases the values obtained with bluephage were the same as or slightly lower than the spot test values however the results showed no statistically significant p 0 05 differences between them as indicated above only results obtained within an acceptable time frame for the method during which the control did not change color were considered and used for the calculations 3 6 the bluephage method is applicable to phages extracted from solid samples to evaluate any limitation of the method when using somatic coliphages extracted from matrices other than water two types of solid samples related with water pollution sludge and mussels were evaluated the presence of phages in wastewater sludge and mussels was detected by the bluephage method after 2 30 h of incubation when no change was observed in the control table 4 or before 7 h of incubation as in the water samples most samples with densities of up to 10 pfu tube and some with even lower densities table 4 were already positive at 1 30 h data not shown all the samples with fewer than 3 phages tube were negative since no change of color was observed before the control turned blue 3 7 the bluephage method is applicable at different scales when using larger volumes phages were detected by the bluephage method whenever the proportions of nutrients substrate and the host strain cb10 were maintained volumes of 50 ml of samples containing low phage densities 10 pfu l of sample which corresponds to 500 pfu in each bottle produced positive results visible after 1 30 h of incubation fig 5 a similarly the method was successfully down scaled which is useful for quantification based on the mpn technique as in the tubes the bluephage method allowed detection of somatic coliphages in sample dilutions containing 100 pfu well or over at 1 30 h and 10 pfu well or over at 3 30 h fig 5b even a well containing just 1 pfu started to turn blue after 3 30 h fig 5b 3 30 h 2nd row 4 discussion the standardized iso and u s epa protocols for the detection and enumeration of somatic coliphages consist of a multiple step procedure involving coliphage replication in exponential growth phase host cells iso 10705 2 anonymous 2000 includes both a double agar layer dal plaque assay for the quantification of pfu and the presence absence test that can also be adapted to the mpn format u s epa method 1601 u s epa 2001a is a presence absence method and u s epa method 1602 u s epa 2003b a single agar layer sal plaque assay plaque assays provide results more rapidly and in both methods plaques can be obtained after 6 h however up to two additional hours are needed for pre growth of the host strain and the overall recommended assay length is 18 h alternative protocols based on the detection of a molecule released by host cell lysis have also been reported guzmán luna et al 2009 ijzerman et al 1993 these methods provide insight into the number of infectious bacteriophages in a given sample they are also relatively fast because of the short time needed for the initial and subsequent replication cycles which allows a high number of lysed cells to be obtained in 2 3 h thus ijzerman et al 1993 report a method based on rapid extracellular release and detection of a β galactosidase enzyme during the coliphage induced lysis the drawbacks are false positives and long incubation times required when the phage number is low later guzmán luna et al guzmán luna et al 2009 described a method based on the detection of somatic coliphages via a bioluminescence assay measuring the phage mediated release of adenylate kinase and subsequent adenosine 5 triphosphate detection these methods have been improved and adapted to multiple tube serial dilutions based on the u s epa and iso presence absence standards salter and durbin 2012 salter et al 2010 with results available within one working day additionally the test is facilitated by the incorporation of lyophilized e coli tablets the bluephage method presented here takes advantage of the overexpressed β glucuronidase enzyme which is not secreted into the medium until the cells are lysed therefore in the absence of bacteriolysis contact between the intracellular enzyme and its specific substrate is precluded as the substrate remains uncleaved false positive results are avoided during the time needed to complete the screening in the presence of bacteriophages the bacterial cells are lysed releasing the enzyme into the medium where it finds and cleaves the substrate inducing a change of color when enough cells are lysed the general trend observed was that higher phage densities caused a faster change of color than lower densities although with some exceptions the variability observed at low phage densities has two explanations first the possibility of inoculating a single phage can vary from tube to tube when the densities are low second the somatic coliphages are heterogeneous as they belong to different families with a variety of burst sizes and times required for replication muniesa et al 1999 considering that 1 5 2 h are required to prepare strain cb10 at an od600 of 0 3 for inoculation into the tubes and that the method allows detection of one phage per tube in 3 5 h the maximum test duration is of 5 5 h well within one habitual working day it should also be considered that the host strain can be grown to an od600 of 0 3 before the sample arrives at the laboratory anonymous 2000 compared to the aforementioned methods based on the detection of a molecule or molecules released by host cell lysis the method reported herein is faster and gives a much lower percentage of false positive results furthermore it needs minimal laboratory equipment the change of color observed in the phage free controls after 7 h was attributed to spontaneous cell lysis after a certain incubation period but this is sufficient time to ensure phage detection in the sample it cannot be excluded that the presence of bacteriolytic agents other than phages can lead to false positive results which could also be caused by the presence of high concentrations of the glucuronidase enzyme or glucuronidase positive bacterial strains in the samples this can occur with highly polluted undiluted wastewater and the high density of phages occurring found in such samples produces a color change before glucuronidase can have the same effect in any case the bluephage method requires the previous filtration of the sample to reduce the possibility of other bacteriolytic agents and particularly for the removal of other bacterial strains possessing glucuronidase activity filtration of natural samples through 0 22 μm low protein binding membranes is already used in the standard methods for somatic coliphage detection anonymous 2000 although it is not mandatory importantly the bluephage method shows the same sensitivity as the standard iso method the cb10 strain does not lose its capacity to detect somatic coliphages after its modification and it was confirmed that all positive enzymatic activity results were due to the presence of phages in the sample moreover bluephage is useful for the analysis of water and solid matrices such as biosolids and shellfish the method can also be scaled up for large volumes and adapted to small volumes for mpn quantification mimicking kits available for the detection of bacterial indicators in the current work our main intention was to establish the suitability of the method for use in different conditions and matrices but a more exhaustive analysis should be done in the future to evaluate the significance of low pfu in these formats the rapid performance of the method providing results within the same day of sampling would be an advantage when a fast immediate or continuous response to the quality of a water body is required for instance to provide safe drinking water trace the origin of a water borne outbreak evaluate the quality of recreational surface waters in the morning before the users arrive monitor a treatment plant or a disinfection device or evaluate the water used in food production the method could be improved still further without involving substantial changes by using fluorogenic instead of colorimetric detection and lyophilized strains that are easier to store although in this case the time frame necessary to generate visible results should be validated an adaptation of bluephage to detect β glucuronidase activity using already available online platforms hesari et al 2015 togo et al 2007 seems feasible and would provide an automated method 5 conclusions the widespread incorporation of somatic coliphage detection in water management policies requires user friendly methods bluephage can facilitate routine implementation of somatic coliphage determination in laboratories with minimal requirements bluephage allows the detection of up to 1 somatic coliphage in under 3 5 h well within a working day this improves the sensitivity reported for other available methods the method has been successfully applied to diverse sample types and volumes using presence absence and quantitative analysis which confirms its suitability for use with a variety of food and water samples this microbiological method for the determination of fecal pollution via detection of culturable microorganisms is the fastest reported to date and can provide results where rapid information of fecal pollution is essential acknowledgements authors are members of the consolidated group of the generalitat de

glucuronidase the enzyme accumulated in the bacterial cells only has contact with its substrate after cell lysis such as that caused by phages since the strain cannot internalize the substrate when the enzyme is released into the medium which contains a chromogen analogous to glucuronic acid it produces a change of color from yellow to dark blue this microbiological method for the determination of fecal pollution via the detection of culturable microorganisms can be applied to diverse sample types and volumes for qualitative presence absence and quantitative analysis and is the fastest reported to date graphical abstract image keywords indicator fecal pollution coliphages virus new tools 1 introduction fecal water pollution is an important cause of pathogen transmission and is associated with several thousand human mortalities per day around the world lechevallier and kwok keung 2004 the indicators most commonly used to determine fecal pollution levels in different water sources are bacterial but fecal contaminated water also contains viral and protozoan pathogens this has raised doubts within the water microbiology community concerning the capacity of bacterial indicators to measure water quality and predict waterborne viral disease hazards borchardt et al 2004 gerba et al 1979 grabow 2001 keswick et al 1984 payment et al 1997 therefore additional indicators are advisable to predict the presence and behavior of viruses in water several groups of bacteriophages have been proposed as indicator microorganisms to assess fecal and viral contamination of water the potential value of different groups of phages that infect enteric bacteria as quality indicators in water biosolids and food has been studied in depth and reviewed armon and kott 1996 bosch et al 2001 goyal 2006 grabow 2001 hsu et al 2002 iawprc study group on health related water microbiology 1991 jofre 2007 one of these bacteriophage groups are somatic coliphages which replicate in escherichia coli after infection through the cell wall iawprc study group on health related water microbiology 1991 somatic coliphages are abundant in fecally contaminated samples and there are standardized methods for their detection and quantification anonymous 2000 u s epa 2001a 2001b the standardized iso and u s epa methods are faster than the tests to identify bacterial indicators easy to perform cost effective and reasonably robust mooijman et al 2005 u s epa 2003a 2003b however current methods are still multi step processes that require several media and operations and more than 8 h that is more than one ordinary working day to yield results although the use of somatic coliphages as fecal indicators was proposed years ago iawprc study group on health related water microbiology 1991 they have only recently been included in water and sludge quality guidelines for example those affecting water reclamation north carolina administration 2011 queensland government 2005 groundwater nhmrc and nrmmc 2011 u s epa 2006 biosolids applied in agriculture republica de colombia 2014 western australian government 2012 and aquaculture practices food and drug administration and interestate shellfish sanitation comission 2015 additionally the u s regulatory authorities u s epa 2016 u s epa 2015 are currently studying the application of coliphages in the quality control of bathing and recreational surface water as the use of somatic coliphages expands simpler and faster detection methods will be required the availability of straightforward ready to use tests would facilitate routine implementation of the methods in laboratories and encourage their adoption in guidelines for water biosolids and food quality management unfortunately the use of molecular techniques such as pcr which would provide a rapid detection is not possible because somatic coliphages are a heterogeneous group belonging to different phage families muniesa et al 1999 that do not share common dna sequences among various approaches to devise such a method some are based on the measurement of the phage mediated release of intracellular molecules such as the intracellular enzyme β galactosidase ijzerman et al 1994 1993 salter and durbin 2012 or adenylate kinase guzmán luna et al 2009 however this approach has certain drawbacks that still need to be resolved including long incubation times when the phage density is low or frequent false positive results the present study reports further progress in this field with a method based on an engineered host bacterium herein we describe a somatic coliphage detection method based on a modified e coli host strain the modification is located in a genetic operon specific for e coli the β glucuronidase system an assay based on β glucuronidase has already been applied to detect e coli in agar plates e g chromocult merck laboratories darmstadt germany or liquid media colilert idexx laboratories inc maine us and has been approved by some food management agencies for drinking water and processed food samples anonymous 2001 the media contain the substrate x glucuronide which is cleaved by ß d glucuronidase a characteristic enzyme of e coli e coli grown in this media develop a dark blue coloration or fluorescence frampton et al 1988 kilian and bülow 1976 the β glucuronidase system in e coli is composed of several genes liang et al 2005 for our purpose we focused on the uida uidb and uidc genes that encode the uida b and c proteins uida is the active subunit an intracellular acid glucuronoside glucuronosohydrolase with broad substrate specificity novel and novel 1976 uidb which is located in the inner membrane is a proton dependent transporter specifically for importing α and β glucuronides into the cell making it essential for glucuronide transport uidc which is associated with the outer membrane does not confer transport activity but it improves the efficiency of transport by uidb through an unknown mechanism liang et al 2005 β glucuronide molecules are imported by the activity of uidc and uidb and once inside the cell are cleaved by uida novel and novel 1976 the objective of this work was to develop a method that allows the rapid detection of somatic coliphages at low densities while minimizing false negative results the method named bluephage incorporates a tailored e coli strain with two features that improve its sensitivity for phage detection on the one hand it overexpresses the uida gene causing an accumulation of the β glucuronidase enzyme in the cytoplasm on the other it lacks the genes uidb and uidc involved in introducing the substrate into the cell the culture medium used in this test incorporates the substrate 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl β d glucuronic acid which turns blue after its cleavage by β glucuronidase consequently only after the host strain cells are lysed as occurs after phage infection will the enzyme degrade the substrate which in turn causes the medium to change color thereby providing fast phage detection in a given sample 2 materials and methods 2 1 medium and growth conditions the media and conditions used here are those included in the iso protocol for the culture of e coli wg5 strain anonymous 2000 the method employs a modified version of modified scholten s broth msb anonymous 2000 the modified msb medium is supplemented with 0 05 w v arabinose 0 5 v v glycerol 15 μl cacl2 1 m and 0 1 mg ml 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl β d glucuronic acid when necessary for the selection of colonies transformed with the pbad vector ampicillin ap 100 μg ml was added to the liquid medium the modified bacterial strain and bacteriophages were inoculated into msb media and incubated at 37 c for variable periods from 1 to 18 h unless specified otherwise 2 2 plasmids plasmid pkd46 genbank ay048746 expressing the red recombinase system was used to insert dna fragments into the e coli chromosome datsenko and wanner 2000

purified using qiagen plasmid midi purification kits qiagen inc valencia usa 2 3 bacteriophages the bacteriophages in this study were used from laboratory stocks of known concentration 109 pfu ml containing a pure culture of one bacteriophage or naturally occurring somatic coliphages coliphages were purified from 1 ml of raw urban sewage from the influent of a wastewater treatment plant that serves approximately 500 000 inhabitants containing ca 104 5 pfu ml or 50 ml of llobregat river water ca 103 pfu ml both sampling points are located in the barcelona area spain phage фx174 atcc 13706 b1 was used as a reference phage for somatic coliphages in accordance with the iso protocol anonymous 2000 to prepare a phage mixture two phages som3 and som23 muniesa et al 2003 which belong to myoviridae and siphoviridae morphological types respectively were used together with phage фx174 anonymous 2000 the environmental samples used were filtered through 0 22 μm pore size low protein binding pes membranes millipore usa to remove bacteria and other particulate material 2 4 pcr techniques pcrs were performed with a geneamp 2400 pcr system perkin elmer pe applied biosystems barcelona spain the oligonucleotides used in this study are shown in table 1 and were designed from the sequence available for e coli k 12 genbank accession number nc 000913 2 5 electroporation electrocompetent cells were prepared from 50 ml of culture in super optimal broth sob medium hanahan 1983 with 0 05 l arabinose as previously described sambrook and russell 2001 mixed with the corresponding amount of

on msb agar with the corresponding antibiotic 2 6 generation of a tailored cb10 strain the e coli strain wg5 the wild type strain wt recommended in the iso standard method for the detection of somatic coliphages anonymous 2000 was genetically modified in several steps 2 6 1 uida overexpression a fragment containing the gene encoding the β glucuronidase enzyme uida 1847 bp was amplified by pcr with primers uida for2 uida rev2 table 1 from wt e coli and cloned using a pbad topo ta expression kit the latter contains a pbad topo vector that allows gene insertion under the control of an arabad promoter invitrogene corporation barcelona spain the uida gene was inserted into the plasmid following the manufacturer s instructions the construct was separately transformed in electrocompetent cells prepared with wt e coli in the resulting construct pbad uida the gene was positioned in the correct orientation immediately downstream of the p ara inducible promoter as confirmed by pcr using primers pbadf pbadr table 1 and sequencing the expression of uida in the pbad vector was optimized by adding arabinose to the medium at different final concentrations ranging from 0 to 0 02 as described by the manufacturer invitrogen corporation barcelona spain finally arabinose was added to a final concentration of 0 05 in the media both vectors contain an ampicillin marker therefore the strains containing the plasmid construct were grown in the presence of ampicillin in an initial stage 2 6 2 construction of the uidb tet uidc fragment the amplimer containing the tet gene was constructed replacing the whole fragment comprising uidb and uidc genes the primer pair tc5 tc3 table 1 was used for the amplification of the tet gene 1343 bp the primer pair uidb up uidb tc5 amplified a 5 region of the uidb initial codon including a 20 bp tail homologous with the 5 region of tet 279 bp primers uidc tc3 uidc lp amplified the 3 region of the uidc subunit 261 bp fig 1 including a 20 bp fragment homologue of the 3 region of tet the conditions used for all primer combinations were an annealing temperature of 50 c and an elongation time of 60 s fragments uidb and tet were annealed at their overlapping region underlined letters in table 1 they were then amplified by pcr as a single fragment with the external primers uidb up and tc3 generating a fragment of 1602 bp with an annealing temperature of 55 c and an elongation time of 2 min fragments uidc and tet were annealed at their overlapping region with the external primers uidc lp tc5 underlined letters in table 1 generating a fragment of 1584 bp finally the two fragments of 1602 and 1584 bp were annealed at their overlapping region the tet gene and were amplified by pcr as a single fragment with the external primers uidb up uidc lp generating the final fragment 1843 bp in which the sequence between genes uidb and uidc was replaced by the tet gene the uidb tet uidc fragment was excised from the gel and purified using the qiaquick gel extraction kit qiagen inc valencia usa the final product was used for the electrotransformation in the wt strain 2 6 3 transformation of pkd46 plasmid pkd46 genbank ay048746 was transformed by electroporation in electrocompetent wt e coli cells prepared as described above transformed colonies were selected by resistance to ampicillin and the presence of pkd46 was confirmed by pcr using the primer pair rr46 up rr46 lp and sequencing 2 6 4 recombination of uidb tet uidc the transformation of 30 μl of the fragment 6 uidb tet uidc pcr amplimer corresponding to 0 1 0 5 μg of amplified dna was performed in electrocompetent wt cells containing vector pkd46 these cells were prepared from 50 ml cultures approximately 5 1010 cfu ml grown at 30 c in sob medium with ampicillin and 0 05 l arabinose to an od600 of 0 6 the transformed cells were recovered in the presence of tc 10 μg ml colonies in which uidb and uidc were replaced by fragment 6 were confirmed by pcr using the uidb uidc primers and by sequencing the strain was forced to lose the plasmid pkd46 by several growing steps at 37 c pkd46 cannot replicate over 30 c without ampicillin the loss of the pkd46 plasmid was confirmed by pcr 2 6 5 construction of cb10 the mutant lacking the uidb and uidc genes was transformed with plasmid pbad uida generating strain cb10 δuidbuidc tet pbad uida the presence of plasmid pbad was confirmed the performance of strain cb10 in detecting somatic coliphages was compared with that of the wt strain using a suspension of phages som3 som23 and фx174 propagated in the laboratory and with phages occurring in environmental samples 2 7 assays of the bluephage method strain cb10 was inoculated in standard msb with ampicillin and incubated overnight at 37 c one ml of the overnight culture was 1 100 diluted in fresh msb with ampicillin and grown to the exponential growth phase monitored by an optical density od at 600 nm of 0 3 at this stage 0 5 ml of this culture was added to 2 5 ml of the msb medium containing 0 05 arabinose 0 5 glycerol 15 μl cacl 1 m and 0 1 mg ml of x glucuronide 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl β d glucuronic acid cyclohexylammonium salt c20h26brcln2o7 as the substrate as indicated in each experiment aliquots of dilutions of the corresponding phage suspension were added to each tube and one tube without phages was kept as a control the tubes were statically incubated at 37 c and periodically evaluated for color change from light yellow to blue the experiment lasted until the phage free control tube turned blue a minimum of 7 h the method was also adapted for quantification using the most probable number mpn method 2 8 spot test confirmation of phages detected by bluephage from each tube inoculated using the bluephage method after the reported incubation period 15 μl aliquots were taken and spiked onto an agar monolayer containing strain cb10 according with the iso method anonymous 2000 the plates were side up incubated at 37 c plaques appearing in the spot area were considered positive for the presence of phages in a given sample positive results for this spot test were compared with positive results in the bluephage tube to evaluate the sensitivity of the new method for a quantitative comparison the mpn method was applied to the positive spot tests and the positive tubes obtained with the bluephage method and compared with the number of phages detected by the conventional iso method anonymous 2000 2 9 sensitivity of the bluephage method to evaluate the sensitivity of the method and the minimum incubation time needed for the analysis somatic coliphages were enumerated in natural water samples using the iso method anonymous 2000 the samples were filtered through 0 22 μm low binding membranes pes millipore and diluted to reach estimated lower densities of phages each dilution was evaluated in triplicate using the bluephage method the minimum time to obtain results was reported the performance of the test was assayed at 20 c 25 c 30 c 37 c and 44 c wastewater and river water samples filter sterilized through high protein binding membranes of 0 22 μm millex mf millipore to remove phages were used as additional controls 2 10 assay protocol in solid samples sludge and mussels to evaluate the performance of the method in matrices other than water sludge samples from the digestor of a wastewater treatment plant in the barcelona metropolitan area which serves approximately 500 000 people and mussels obtained from local supermarkets were processed the method for phage extraction from sludge corresponds to the methods used in established policies as described previously by lasobras et al 1999 with minor modifications briefly the samples were mixed in a 1 10 w v ratio with pbs ph 7 4 and homogenized by magnetic stirring for 30 min at room temperature the suspension was then centrifuged at 10 000 g for 30 min at 4 c the supernatant was subsequently filtered through low protein binding 0 22 μm pore size membrane filters millex gp millipore bedford ma the suspension was diluted and used to enumerate phages using the standard iso method and analyzed in triplicate using bluephage for the study of phages in mussels samples were spiked with somatic coliphages from raw sewage to reach a final estimated concentration of 102 103 pfu g of mussel phages were incubated with the samples for 2 h at 23 c there is no established guideline for phage extraction from mussels so previously reported methods were used lucena et al 1994 briefly mussel meat from a minimum of 10 mussels per sample was homogenized in a blender for 5 min elution of phage particles was performed on 100 ml of the homogenate by magnetic stirring for 15 min in 400 ml of borate buffer 0 01 m containing 3 beef extract ph 9 5 after neutralization to ph 7 2 the treated homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 2500 g for 15 min at 4 c phages present in the supernatant were enumerated by the iso standard procedure and detected by the bluephage method 2 11 scaling up and down of the bluephage method to evaluate the performance of the method in different sample volumes 100 ml bottles were used with 50 ml of river water samples diluted to contain phage densities of 10 pfu ml similarly small volumes of 1 5 ml containing densities from 104 to 0 1 phages were used both assays were performed keeping the same proportion of nutrients substrate and strain cb10 as in the tubes 2 12 statistical analysis computation of data and statistical tests were performed using the statistical package for social science software spss the anova test was used to evaluate the differences between mpn spot test and bluephage results evaluations were based on 5 of significance levels 3 results 3 1 method rationale and strain performance the genetically modified e coli strain referred to henceforth as strain cb10 described in this study was grown in the presence of the substrate without its consumption since the substrate cannot be incorporated inside the cell in the absence of transporter genes only when phage infection caused cell lysis was β glucuronidase which is overexpressed in the presence of arabinose and accumulated in the cell cytoplasm released into the medium where it encountered the substrate even as few as 1 to 5 somatic coliphages were able to lyse a number of cells exceeding 108 in less than 3 h thus liberating a large amount of enzyme into the medium the enzyme in the medium cleaves the d glucuronide in the 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl β d glucuronic acid molecules releasing the blue substrate that turns the broth originally light yellow dark blue the time necessary for this color change varied depending on the number of bacteria lysed and hence on the concentration of phages added to the cell culture and the time elapsed after infection the performance of cb10 in the presence of the substrate was evaluated before using it for phage detection to do this the e coli wg5 wt strain containing pbad uida and cb10 with and without phages were compared when inoculated into the broth for the bluephage method we observed a slight but visible color change with the wt e coli fig 2 meanwhile strain cb10 had no effect on the color in the absence of phages because of its incapacity to incorporate the substrate caused by replacement of the uidbuidc complex the highest expression of the enzyme was observed in the wt strain containing pbad uida in the presence of 0 02 arabinose which produced a darker blue than the wt strain finally on adding phages from wastewater we used a high quantity of 103 pfu to test the method under optimal conditions cb10 caused a change of color after only 1 5 h of incubation fig 2 3 2 the cb10 strain and the standard method detected the same number of phages to confirm that the modification of the wt strain did not cause a decrease in the number of phages detected its performance was compared with the wt strain according to the iso method anonymous 2000 the phage counts obtained with both strains showed no significant differences p 0 05 table 2 3 3 performance of the bluephage method with environmental samples filtered wastewater and river water samples were 10 fold diluted and added to the bluephage tubes containing strain cb10 at descending phage densities in fig 3 the tubes correspond to estimated 500 50 5 and 1 pfu tube calculation based on the dilution of the sample and one control tube that contained only cb10 and no phages the cultures were incubated at 37 c and the color change was monitored over time fig 3 the first positive results were observed at 1 30 h for concentrations of 50 and 500 phages cultures containing 5 phages turned blue after 2 15 h nevertheless the tubes were incubated until the control culture turned blue which required a minimal incubation time of 7 h samples were considered negative for the presence of phages if blue coloration did not occur before the time needed for the control sample to change color fig 3 potentially polluted wastewater and river samples were 10 fold diluted and the number of somatic coliphages was evaluated using the iso method table 3 the color change was monitored after 2 30 h 3 30 h and 4 30 h times that were selected to generate results within one working day the resulting number of positive tubes out of the total number of tubes assayed at the different times for each phage density are presented in table 3 notably at higher phage densities detection occurred after 2 30 h some samples with high phage densities turned blue even earlier at 1 30 h data not shown in general tubes with high phage densities changed color earlier than those with low densities table 3 although a clear correspondence between the number of phages and the time required for the color change was not always observed as discussed below the minimal time to observe color change in tubes with 5 pfu was 2 30 h as for example in tubes with densities of 0 7 pfu tube in wastewater or 3 4 pfu tube in river water table 3 nevertheless at 4 30 h all the tubes containing 10 pfu tube were positive and 46 of the tubes containing 1 10 pfu tube had also turned blue this time is well within the time frame in which the phage free negative control remained without changing color in parallel no changes were observed in the filter sterilized diluted wastewater and river water control samples from which the phages had been removed 3 4 results using the bluephage method at different temperatures the above mentioned results were obtained when incubating at 37 c with the same results obtained at 44 c in contrast at 20 c and 25 c longer incubation times 5 h were required before the color change was detected in the tubes containing 500 pfu accordingly the phage free control tube also remained unaltered for longer and no change of color was observed before 12 h of incubation 3 5 sensitivity and specificity of the bluephage method to confirm that the color change in inoculated tubes was due to the presence of phages the supernatant of each tube including the negative tubes underwent a spot test on strain cb10 positive results of both bluephage and the spot test were used to enumerate the phages using the mpn method the results recorded after 3 5 h of incubation by the bluephage method and by the spot test were used to determine the phage densities using mpn calculations fig 4 in all cases the values obtained with bluephage were the same as or slightly lower than the spot test values however the results showed no statistically significant p 0 05 differences between them as indicated above only results obtained within an acceptable time frame for the method during which the control did not change color were considered and used for the calculations 3 6 the bluephage method is applicable to phages extracted from solid samples to evaluate any limitation of the method when using somatic coliphages extracted from matrices other than water two types of solid samples related with water pollution sludge and mussels were evaluated the presence of phages in wastewater sludge and mussels was detected by the bluephage method after 2 30 h of incubation when no change was observed in the control table 4 or before 7 h of incubation as in the water samples most samples with densities of up to 10 pfu tube and some with even lower densities table 4 were already positive at 1 30 h data not shown all the samples with fewer than 3 phages tube were negative since no change of color was observed before the control turned blue 3 7 the bluephage method is applicable at different scales when using larger volumes phages were detected by the bluephage method whenever the proportions of nutrients substrate and the host strain cb10 were maintained volumes of 50 ml of samples containing low phage densities 10 pfu l of sample which corresponds to 500 pfu in each bottle produced positive results visible after 1 30 h of incubation fig 5 a similarly the method was successfully down scaled which is useful for quantification based on the mpn technique as in the tubes the bluephage method allowed detection of somatic coliphages in sample dilutions containing 100 pfu well or over at 1 30 h and 10 pfu well or over at 3 30 h fig 5b even a well containing just 1 pfu started to turn blue after 3 30 h fig 5b 3 30 h 2nd row 4 discussion the standardized iso and u s epa protocols for the detection and enumeration of somatic coliphages consist of a multiple step procedure involving coliphage replication in exponential growth phase host cells iso 10705 2 anonymous 2000 includes both a double agar layer dal plaque assay for the quantification of pfu and the presence absence test that can also be adapted to the mpn format u s epa method 1601 u s epa 2001a is a presence absence method and u s epa method 1602 u s epa 2003b a single agar layer sal plaque assay plaque assays provide results more rapidly and in both methods plaques can be obtained after 6 h however up to two additional hours are needed for pre growth of the host strain and the overall recommended assay length is 18 h alternative protocols based on the detection of a molecule released by host cell lysis have also been reported guzmán luna et al 2009 ijzerman et al 1993 these methods provide insight into the number of infectious bacteriophages in a given sample they are also relatively fast because of the short time needed for the initial and subsequent replication cycles which allows a high number of lysed cells to be obtained in 2 3 h thus ijzerman et al 1993 report a method based on rapid extracellular release and detection of a β galactosidase enzyme during the coliphage induced lysis the drawbacks are false positives and long incubation times required when the phage number is low later guzmán luna et al guzmán luna et al 2009 described a method based on the detection of somatic coliphages via a bioluminescence assay measuring the phage mediated release of adenylate kinase and subsequent adenosine 5 triphosphate detection these methods have been improved and adapted to multiple tube serial dilutions based on the u s epa and iso presence absence standards salter and durbin 2012 salter et al 2010 with results available within one working day additionally the test is facilitated by the incorporation of lyophilized e coli tablets the bluephage method presented here takes advantage of the overexpressed β glucuronidase enzyme which is not secreted into the medium until the cells are lysed therefore in the absence of bacteriolysis contact between the intracellular enzyme and its specific substrate is precluded as the substrate remains uncleaved false positive results are avoided during the time needed to complete the screening in the presence of bacteriophages the bacterial cells are lysed releasing the enzyme into the medium where it finds and cleaves the substrate inducing a change of color when enough cells are lysed the general trend observed was that higher phage densities caused a faster change of color than lower densities although with some exceptions the variability observed at low phage densities has two explanations first the possibility of inoculating a single phage can vary from tube to tube when the densities are low second the somatic coliphages are heterogeneous as they belong to different families with a variety of burst sizes and times required for replication muniesa et al 1999 considering that 1 5 2 h are required to prepare strain cb10 at an od600 of 0 3 for inoculation into the tubes and that the method allows detection of one phage per tube in 3 5 h the maximum test duration is of 5 5 h well within one habitual working day it should also be considered that the host strain can be grown to an od600 of 0 3 before the sample arrives at the laboratory anonymous 2000 compared to the aforementioned methods based on the detection of a molecule or molecules released by host cell lysis the method reported herein is faster and gives a much lower percentage of false positive results furthermore it needs minimal laboratory equipment the change of color observed in the phage free controls after 7 h was attributed to spontaneous cell lysis after a certain incubation period but this is sufficient time to ensure phage detection in the sample it cannot be excluded that the presence of bacteriolytic agents other than phages can lead to false positive results which could also be caused by the presence of high concentrations of the glucuronidase enzyme or glucuronidase positive bacterial strains in the samples this can occur with highly polluted undiluted wastewater and the high density of phages occurring found in such samples produces a color change before glucuronidase can have the same effect in any case the bluephage method requires the previous filtration of the sample to reduce the possibility of other bacteriolytic agents and particularly for the removal of other bacterial strains possessing glucuronidase activity filtration of natural samples through 0 22 μm low protein binding membranes is already used in the standard methods for somatic coliphage detection anonymous 2000 although it is not mandatory importantly the bluephage method shows the same sensitivity as the standard iso method the cb10 strain does not lose its capacity to detect somatic coliphages after its modification and it was confirmed that all positive enzymatic activity results were due to the presence of phages in the sample moreover bluephage is useful for the analysis of water and solid matrices such as biosolids and shellfish the method can also be scaled up for large volumes and adapted to small volumes for mpn quantification mimicking kits available for the detection of bacterial indicators in the current work our main intention was to establish the suitability of the method for use in different conditions and matrices but a more exhaustive analysis should be done in the future to evaluate the significance of low pfu in these formats the rapid performance of the method providing results within the same day of sampling would be an advantage when a fast immediate or continuous response to the quality of a water body is required for instance to provide safe drinking water trace the origin of a water borne outbreak evaluate the quality of recreational surface waters in the morning before the users arrive monitor a treatment plant or a disinfection device or evaluate the water used in food production the method could be improved still further without involving substantial changes by using fluorogenic instead of colorimetric detection and lyophilized strains that are easier to store although in this case the time frame necessary to generate visible results should be validated an adaptation of bluephage to detect β glucuronidase activity using already available online platforms hesari et al 2015 togo et al 2007 seems feasible and would provide an automated method 5 conclusions the widespread incorporation of somatic coliphage detection in water management policies requires user friendly methods bluephage can facilitate routine implementation of somatic coliphage determination in laboratories with minimal requirements bluephage allows the detection of up to 1 somatic coliphage in under 3 5 h well within a working day this improves the sensitivity reported for other available methods the method has been successfully applied to diverse sample types and volumes using presence absence and quantitative analysis which confirms its suitability for use with a variety of food and water samples this microbiological method for the determination of fecal pollution via detection of culturable microorganisms is the fastest reported to date and can provide results where rapid information of fecal pollution is essential acknowledgements authors are members of the consolidated group of the generalitat de

19866,oyster norovirus outbreaks pose increasing risks to human health and seafood industry worldwide but exact causes of the outbreaks are rarely identified making it highly unlikely to reduce the risks this paper presents a genetic programming gp based approach to identifying the primary cause of oyster norovirus outbreaks and predicting oyster norovirus outbreaks in order to reduce the risks in terms of the primary cause it was found that oyster norovirus outbreaks were controlled by cumulative effects of antecedent environmental conditions characterized by low solar radiation low water temperature low gage height the height of water above a gage datum low salinity heavy rainfall and strong offshore wind the six environmental variables were determined by using random forest rf and binary logistic regression blr methods within the framework of the gp approach in terms of predicting norovirus outbreaks a risk based gp model was developed using the six environmental variables and various combinations of the variables with different time lags the results of local and global sensitivity analyses showed that gage height temperature and solar radiation were by far the three most important environmental predictors for oyster norovirus outbreaks though other variables were also important specifically very low temperature and gage height significantly increased the risk of norovirus outbreaks while high solar radiation markedly reduced the risk suggesting that low temperature and gage height were associated with the norovirus source while solar radiation was the primary sink of norovirus the gp model was utilized to hindcast daily risks of oyster norovirus outbreaks along the northern gulf of mexico coast the daily hindcasting results indicated that the gp model was capable of hindcasting all historical oyster norovirus outbreaks from january 2002 to june 2014 in the gulf of mexico with only two false positive outbreaks for the 12 5 year period the performance of the gp model was characterized with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0 86 the true positive rate sensitivity of 78 53 and the true negative rate specificity of 88 82 respectively demonstrating the efficacy of the gp model the findings and results offered new insights into the oyster norovirus outbreaks in terms of source sink cause and predictors the gp model provided an efficient and effective tool for predicting potential oyster norovirus outbreaks and implementing management interventions to prevent or at least reduce norovirus risks to both the human health and the seafood industry graphical abstract image keywords genetic programming oyster norovirus outbreaks predictive model sensitivity analysis 1 introduction norovirus is the leading cause of illness and outbreaks from contaminated foods https www cdc gov norovirus php illness outbreaks html such as oysters harvested from sewage contaminated coastal waters butt et al 2004 campos and lees 2014 campos et al 2015 specifically the virus is associated with 18 of all diarrheal diseases worldwide ahmed et al 2014 lopman et al 2015 and causes 58 of foodborne illnesses or 5 5 million cases in a typical year in the united states in addition norovirus imposes 2 3 billion in economic burden in a typical year due to deaths non hospitalized cases and hospitalizations in the united states u s alone hoffmann et al 2015 the first 2017 norovirus outbreak linked to british columbia oysters spread nation wide from january to march 2017 and caused over 320 cases of gastrointestinal illnesses in canada http www phac aspc gc ca phn asp 2017 outbreak norovirus eclosion eng php in addition to burdens on health sectors the norovirus outbreaks may also lead to severe economic losses to the shellfish industry because of product recalls http www issc org notices harvest area closures and loss of consumer confidence torok 2013 although significant efforts have been made in improving sewerage infrastructure contamination to seafood due to the sewage contaminated runoff caused by heavy rainfall events remains difficult to avoid the contamination of shellfish growing waters in the nearshore coastal environment may cause the bioaccumulation of enteric bacteria and viruses particularly norovirus particles in filter feeding shellfish such as oysters flannery et al 2013 under certain environmental conditions particularly norovirus nov has been found to accumulate in digestive tissues of oysters growing in contaminated waters wang and deng 2012 consequently it is crucial to identify the environmental conditions favoring the norovirus bioaccumulation in oysters and thereby to predict potential oyster norovirus outbreaks in order to protect public health and promote the sustainable development of the shellfish industry while there is a growing body of literature on norovirus seasonality and epidemiology there is only very limited success in identifying and modeling environmental conditions responsible for oyster norovirus outbreaks greer et al 2009 evaluated the association of norovirus outbreak risk with environment variables by taking into account the nonlinear relationship between norovirus outbreaks and environmental factors and employing poisson and zero inflated poisson regression models their study revealed that low temperature and heavy precipitation facilitated oyster norovirus outbreaks a similar study conducted by lopman et al 2009 investigated the lagged effect of temperature relative humidity and rainfall on norovirus outbreaks using poisson regression kim et al 2016 developed a geographic information system gis based binary response model to predict norovirus outbreak patterns using environmental variables including topographical characteristics climate conditions demographic characteristics water and sanitation utilities and land use results showed that cold temperature in combination with several factors increased norovirus outbreaks the artificial neural network ann based models presented by wang and deng 2016 and chenar and deng 2017 were the first operational models for predicting and forecasting the risk of potential oyster norovirus outbreaks in the gulf of mexico using environmental predictors while demonstrating an excellent performance a major limitation of the ann models was that they were black box models with implicit and unknown relationships between the norovirus epidemics and environmental predictors an explicit relationship between the norovirus outbreak risk and environmental predictors would be useful to understanding the processes and mechanisms triggering norovirus outbreaks the overall goal of this study was to present a new explicit model for prediction of oyster norovirus outbreaks and for reducing the risk of norovirus outbreaks to human health to that end the specific objectives of this paper were 1 to identify environmental predictors for oyster norovirus outbreaks using random forest rf and binary logistic regression blr 2 to present an evolution based genetic programming gp model for predicting oyster norovirus outbreaks in the gulf of mexico using the environmental predictors and 3 to determine the sensitivity of the gp model for identifying the most influential environmental predictors controlling norovirus outbreaks the gp model could potentially alert the public with timely outbreak risk predictions and thereby reduce the risk of norovirus to human health moreover early detection of potential norovirus outbreaks allows the shellfish industry to take intervention actions such as closure of implicated oyster growing areas and thereby to reduce economic losses 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the gulf of mexico coast produces about two thirds of the u s oysters with louisiana being the top oyster producer in the u s this study focuses on the oyster harvest areas along the u s gulf coast of texas louisiana and mississippi including 30 areas in louisiana the copano bay and the san antonio bay in texas and area iic in mississippi as shown in fig 1 environmental data were collected for the oyster harvest areas 2 2 data collection and processing data on historical norovirus outbreaks associated with the consumption of raw oysters harvested in louisiana were collected from annual louisiana morbidity reports released by the louisiana department of health and hospitals data on oyster norovirus outbreaks in texas and mississippi were obtained from the u s food and drug administration and the centers for disease control and prevention table 1 data for environmental predictors including water temperature gage height salinity rainfall solar radiation and wind speed and direction were collected from various online sources for the period of 2002 2014 specifically data for water temperature gage height and salinity were obtained from the u s geological survey usgs stations located along the gulf of mexico coast https maps waterdata usgs gov mapper index html while rainfall and wind data were collected from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa weather service website http water weather gov precip the gage height is the water surface elevation measured above a gage datum such as the north american vertical datum of 1988 navd88 or the national geodetic vertical datum of 1929 ngvd29 sauer and turnipseed 2010 solar radiation data were downloaded from the louisiana agriclimatic information system website http weather lsuagcenter com charts aspx r 2 hourly time series data were used to derive the data for the daily maximum daily change and daily average of individual environmental predictors for identification of potential model input variables all data were then normalized using feature scaling unity based normalization so that each environmental predictor varies only in the range of 0 1 to eliminate effects of datum offshore wind was found to increase the concentration of norovirus in oyster growing waters wang and deng 2016 generally offshore wind produces an offshore surface current and onshore bottom flow near the seabed where oyster beds are located therefore the offshore wind produced onshore bottom flow conveys norovirus to oyster beds increasing the concentration of norovirus in oysters and thereby the risk of oyster norovirus outbreaks whether a wind direction is offshore or onshore depends on not only the wind direction but also local shoreline directions the same wind may cause offshore currents in one oyster area and onshore currents in another area in order to quantify the effect of the site specific onshore offshore wind on norovirus outbreaks a wind direction index ω was defined in eq 1 and fig 2 since the angle θ in eq 1 is site specific the parameter ω was defined individually for each oyster growing area such that ω 0 for all onshore wind directions θ 90 and ω values were calculated using eq 1 for offshore wind directions it is clear from eq 1 that ω 1 0 when the offshore wind direction is perpendicular to the shoreline θ 0 and ω 0 0 when the wind direction is parallel to the shoreline θ 90 in general the wind direction index ω varies in the range of 0 0 1 0 for any offshore wind direction while it equals 0 for all onshore winds with the wind direction θ 90 1 ω 0 for onshore winds 90 θ 90 for offshore winds where the parameter θ 0 θ 90 is the angle between an offshore wind direction and the offshore vector perpendicular to the shoreline as shown in fig 2 in order to reduce the number of input variables involved in the predictive model the wind speed v and the direction index ω were combined and their product v ω was defined as a new wind function w v ω the wind function w was simply called as wind and used as an independent environmental variable in the selection of model input variables 2 3 selection of model input variables the selection of explanatory variables is the first major step in the development of data driven models according to previous studies of author s research group wang and deng 2016 chenar and deng 2017 oyster norovirus outbreaks are principally controlled by the combination of antecedent environmental conditions particularly cumulative effects of antecedent environmental conditions play a more important role in triggering a norovirus outbreak than instantaneous environmental conditions for this purpose the six independent environmental predictors including water temperature gage height salinity rainfall solar radiation and wind were selected and reorganized into time series ensembles of individual predictors to describe antecedent environmental conditions the potential time series ensemble of each environmental predictor consisted of a finite number of time lagged variables covering the antecedent period of 1 30 days and involving the maximum minimum daily average daily change and cumulative terms of the predictor the cumulative terms or effects of an environmental predictor were described using the sums of observations of the predictor over a certain antecedent time period such as cumulative salinity in last 30 days 29 days and 2 days since a large number of potential time series variables may produce a large amount of redundancy in model input variables the random forest rf method and the binary logistic regression blr method were employed to rank the importance of individual variables to norovirus outbreaks reduce the number of datasets and then select a final set of model input variables the random forest rf method proposed by breiman 2001 is one of the most widely used supervised machine learning methods for regression analysis and classification svetnik et al 2003 by combining the idea of bagging peters et al 2007 and random feature selection rf starts by growing multiple trees each tree is grown to the largest extent possible and there is no pruning then new data are predicted by aggregating the predictions of the ntree trees using majority votes for classification and the average for regression analysis svetnik et al 2003 the numbers of trees and predictors used to determine the split at each node are key principals of the rf method aside from improved accuracy rf provides measures of relevant variables for each candidate predictor peters et al 2007 the popular variable importance measure based on rf is the gini variable importance strobl et al 2007 which was used in this study the gini criterion was utilized to select the split with the lowest impurity at each node which was chosen as the spitting variable leading to the most influential input variable archer and kimes 2008 in this study the top 20 of predictive variables from the predictor set with the high gini variable importance were selected as significant inputs for each predictor the random forest package within the statistical software r 3 2 2 was used for the rf analysis since there is no guarantee that the input variables selected using rf are the best predictors for a predictive model the binary logistic regression blr analysis also was used in this study to select and confirm the model input variables blr is a classification method that estimates the probability of occurrence of one of the two classes of a dichotomous criterion variable a linear combination of predictors was employed to fit a logit transformation of the probability of success for each subject and the regression coefficients were estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation cox 1958 since the dependent variable norovirus outbreak risk in this study was binomial logistic regression was adopted to select a final set of model inputs based on the nagelkerke r square values for individual variables the logistic regression analysis in the statistical software package ibm spss was used to implement this technique the top 20 of predictive variables with the high nagelkerke r square were selected as significant inputs for each environmental predictor since the input variables selected using the rf and blr methods were not necessarily the same variables it was important to verify the results from the two methods and determine the explanatory variables finally to use in the predictive model as the model input variables to that end the genetic programming gp technique was utilized to test the potential independent variables initially selected with the rf and blr methods it was argued that an equation evolved with gp would contain the most significant input variables muttil and lee 2005 muttil and chau 2007 therefore the performance of the rf and blr methods was evaluated using the number of gp model input variables selected from the rf variable pool and the blr variable pool respectively the following five step procedure was employed for the final selection of the potential independent variables based on the rf and blr methods and model input functions step 1 independent variables and various combinations of individual independent variables were sorted in descending order of rf score of importance the variables of the high importance top 20 were selected and the other combinations were removed from the potential input variable pool step 2 independent variables and various combinations of individual independent variables were sorted in descending order of nagelkerke r square based on blr analysis the variables of high r square top 20 were selected and the other combinations were eliminated step 3 all the remaining variables from steps 1 and 2 were then selected as the potential set of input variables for the gp model step 4 gp automatically selected the final set of model input variables from the potential input variables identified in step 3 the number of finally selected model input variables was less than that of the potential input variables determined in step 3 some of the finally selected variables were from the rf variable pool table 3 column 4 while the others were from the blr variable pool table 3 column 3 in addition to those variables some common variables were selected by both rf and blr methods table 3 column 5 step 5 the input variables finally identified in step 4 were used in gp to further establish functional relationships between the norovirus outbreak and individual independent environmental predictors along with various combinations of the predictors identified in step 4 as a result six input functions were established for the six independent environmental predictors and then employed as the gp model inputs 2 4 genetic programming approach genetic programming gp is an evolutionary algorithm based on the darwinian theory of evolution by the natural selection the primary search strategy behind it is a genetic algorithm ga goldberg and holland 1988 gp proceeds by initially generating random programs equations derived from the random combination of input variables random numbers and functions gp then evaluates their fitness a measure of how well they solve the problem of evolved programs and subsequently selects individual programs that best fit the data for reproduction and recombination from the initial population sivapragasam et al 2010 the models with the best fit are evolved through genetic operators of selection reproduction crossover and mutation which mimic the biological evolution mehr et al 2014 a key advantage of genetic programming as compared to traditional data driven models is that the model structure doesn t need to be defined initially in fact gp is frequently applied to model structure identification problems and a number of applications of gp have been reported including rainfall runoff modeling havlíček et al 2013 algal bloom predictions muttil and lee 2005 sivapragasam et al 2010 sediment transport modelling garg 2014 groundwater level forecast and aquifer management cobaner et al 2016 kasiviswanathan et al 2016 and stream flow predictions guven 2009 mehr et al 2014 furthermore gp is capable of selecting automatically input variables that contribute beneficially to a model muttil and lee 2005 in addition gp doesn t require variable independence for model generation castillo et al 2005 and automatically selects sensitive predictors castillo et al 2005 garg and tai 2012 the development of a gp model requires the modeler to specify 1 a set of terminals independent variables for each branch of the program to evolve 2 a set of primitive functions for each branch of the program to evolve 3 a fitness measure for determining the fitness of individuals in the population 4 control parameters for the run and 5 the termination criterion and method for designating the result of the run sreekanth and datta 2011 based on the understanding of the physical process the combination of arithmetic operators and mathematical functions sin cos tan exp log sigmoid forms a set of equations in each generation iteration the operators including addition subtraction multiplication and division were considered in the initial functional set function set i other functions sin cos ln and sqrt were then added to the functional set function set ii due to the nonlinear nature of the relationship between norovirus outbreaks and environmental factors the sum of the absolute differences between the expected output value and the input also was set as a measure of fitness function for the evolution of the gp models the control parameters used in all gp runs were determined empirically through trial runs and listed in table 2 the parameter maximum tree size defines the maximum size of an evolved equation and it was set to be 29 to avoid overgrowing programs and to constrain the number of selected input variables hence the equation is easy to interpret muttil and chau 2006 the crossover and mutation rates were chosen to be 75 and 25 respectively as the values were generally used in the literature it should be noted that if the probability of mutation is set too high the mutation can cause rapid degradation of relatively fit solution sets garg 2014 the above mentioned tree based genetic programming tgp approach to modeling norovirus outbreaks was implemented in this study using the gplab toolbox for matlab developed by silva and almeida 2003 the input output datasets were split into two subsets including testing and training subsets as shown in table 1 the training subset including two thirds of reported outbreaks was used to train the gp models while the other subset which was not used in the model training phase and collected from 2010 to 2014 for the oyster growing areas 3 23 30 and copano bay was employed to validate the developed gp models the six functional relationships finally established for the six independent variables including temperature gage height solar radiation salinity rainfall and wind were used as model input functions the efficacy of evolved models was evaluated using the root mean square error rmse and the number of correct predictions of reported norovirus outbreaks the importance of individual independent variables was assessed based on sensitivity analyses 2 5 sensitivity analysis to investigate the sensitivity of gp model outputs model predicted norovirus outbreak risks to individual independent variables local and global sensitivity analyses sa were carried out the local sa is concerned with the local response of the output s when input parameters vary one at a time while global sa examines the global response of model output over the entire input parameter space saltelli et al 2000 cannavó 2012 to conduct local sa the mean values of individual predictors including water temperature gage height water salinity rainfall solar radiation and wind were varied one at a time by 10 20 30 40 and 50 respectively and the corresponding percent change in the final model output was calculated the variance based sobol sensitivity analysis was applied to quantify the global response of norovirus outbreak risks predicted by the gp model over the entire environmental parameter space saltelli and sobol 1995 homma and saltelli 1996 the advantage of applying the sobol global sensitivity analysis is that the method is not only a comprehensive approach to determining highly influential or non influential predictors but also estimating the most significant interaction between naturally correlated environmental parameters the amount of variance which a single parameter or the interactions of two or more parameters contribute to the unconditional variance of the model output is referred as sobol sensitivity index calculated based on the anova decomposition nossent et al 2011 the total variance d of a function f x where x xi is a vector of the input variables defined in the unit hypercube hn 0 xi 1 i 1 n can be expressed as follows 2 d 0 1 f 2 x d x f 0 2 s 1 n i 1 i s d i 1 i s where 1 i1 is n and s 1 n sensitivity estimates are then defined as 3 s i 1 i s d i 1 i s d using this general definition the first order indices si represent the variance contribution of the individual parameter x i to the total model variance whereas the second order sensitivity indices sij measure the interaction effects and so on finally total order sensitivity indices are the sum of all the sensitivity indices which introduce the overall effects of one factor on the model output eq 4 used as quantitative measures to determine the sensitivity of the analyzed gp model to individual input variables moreover quasi monte carlo integrals qmc were applied in this research to compute the multi dimensional integrals and estimate the sensitivity indices the idea behind quasi monte carlo methods is to use low discrepancy sequences lds for sampling points instead of pseudo random numbers bianchetti et al 2015 a toolbox named gsat global sensitivity analysis toolbox developed by cannavó 2012 was used to calculate the above described sensitivity indices 4 s t i s i i j s i j 3 results 3 1 selection of model input functions based on the methodology presented above potential gp models were evolved for norovirus outbreak predictions using the six functional relationships individually the evolved gp equations for the six functional relationships are presented in appendix a the optimal relationship for each function was selected based on the number of true outbreak predictions with the training dataset by comparing gp model predictions with historical data for norovirus outbreaks it was found that all reported oyster norovirus outbreaks were consistently associated with the model predicted risk range of 0 8 1 0 therefore the risk level of 0 8 was employed as the threshold of model predicted oyster norovirus outbreaks specifically norovirus outbreaks occurred when the model predicted risk was 0 8 no outbreaks were reported when the model predicted risk was 0 8 among the six individual functional relationships the solar radiation relationship predicted more norovirus outbreaks 5 out of 8 than any other relationships and the rainfall relationship predicted the lowest number of outbreaks 2 out of 8 table 3 shows the total number of variables used in individual relationships and the number of variables selected by the rf and blr methods it is clear from the table that there is no significant difference in the performance of rf and blr methods gp selected approximately the same numbers of variables from the rf and blr variable pools most significant variables were the average water temperature thirty days before the onset of an outbreak the difference between the minimum gage heights eleven and twelve days before the outbreak the difference between the maximum solar radiation values ten and fourteen days before the average salinity sixteen days before cumulative rainfall in ten days and the difference between the wind function values fourteen and fifteen days before the onset of the outbreak it is clear that most variables involved in the gp model are time lagged combinations of independent environmental predictors indicating the importance of time lagged effects and cumulative effects of individual environmental predictors on norovirus outbreaks it should be pointed out that each environmental predictor along with its time series ensemble represents a unique mechanism responsible for oyster norovirus outbreaks for instance rainfall variables were used to represent the effect of norovirus sources on oyster norovirus outbreaks specifically antecedent rainfalls of 2 10 days before the onset of a norovirus outbreak were used to show that it would take 2 10 days for sewage contaminated runoff to reach oyster growing areas from distributed norovirus sources such as failing septic systems and malfunctioning wastewater treatment plants following a rainfall event basically each rainfall variable in the rainfall function represents a single sewage or norovirus source since norovirus may persist in water environment for up to 30 days pommepuy et al 2004 time lags of up to 30 days were used to describe effects of other environmental predictors on the persistence of norovirus in oyster growing waters and the concentration of norovirus in oysters by means of time series ensembles leading to a large number of variables due to the time lags 3 2 genetic programming model performance with training datasets the six gp evolved relationships listed in appendix a were employed as the final set of model input functions for the prediction of norovirus outbreaks in fact two function sets were initially used and 20 gp equations were evolved with each function set table 4 lists the rmse of 15 best models out of 20 models for the two gp function sets including i and ii and data sets including training and testing sets all of the models produced almost the same rmse with each of the function sets according to table 4 the total rmse for gp evolved models developed with the basic function set i varies from 0 48 to 0 54 and the total rmse for models with the more complicated function set ii ranges from 0 4 to 0 51 though an improvement in the model performance was observed when more functions were added the improvement in terms of rmse was very limited the rmse with the testing dataset varies in the range from 0 52 to 0 66 for the function set i and 0 41 to 0 50 for the function set ii respectively it is clear that the models developed with the function set ii performed better than did the models from the function set i consequently the best gp model was selected from the models developed with the function set ii consisting of both basic and mathematical functions sin cos ln sqrt as shown in table 4 models ii5 and ii11 have the minimum rmse of 0 41 with the testing dataset while the two models have the same rmse of 0 41 the model ii11 included rainfall as one of the six independent environmental predictors therefore model ii11 is finally selected as the best gp model and it is written in the form of the six input functions as 5 n o v sin sin f s f g h f s r f t f w f r f g h s i n f w 2 f s r c o s l n f s r where nov represents the norovirus outbreak risk f t f gh f w f sr f s and f r denote the gp evolved functions for temperature gage height wind solar radiation water salinity and rainfall respectively which are listed in appendix a fig 3 shows daily oyster norovirus outbreak risks predicted with the best gp model against reported norovirus outbreaks for 2002 training dataset although a false outbreak was predicted for october 10 2002 with risk of 0 91 the gp model correctly reproduced norovirus outbreaks that occurred in march 2002 in louisiana area 6 as shown in fig 3a the model predicted risks exceeded the threshold risk of 0 8 for 6 days during the outbreak period starting from march 12 risk 0 84 to 27 risk 0 93 fig 3b shows both predicted and reported oyster norovirus outbreak risks in 2007 in louisiana oyster area 3 oysters harvested from december 10 21 were recalled due to a reported norovirus outbreak while the gp model predicted a norovirus outbreak with the risk of 0 9 for december 9 2007 fig 3b the u s food and drug administration fda advised consumers to avoid eating raw oysters harvested in the period of february 1 24 2007 from the san antonio bay due to a reported norovirus outbreak as shown in fig 3c oyster growing areas in the san antonio bay were closed by the texas department of health services on february 24 2007 all oysters harvested from the san antonio bay between november 16 and 25 2009 were recalled again by the texas department of state health services due to another reported norovirus outbreak in this area as shown in fig 3c approximately 12 people became ill with norovirus after eating oysters harvested from this area the daily norovirus outbreak risks predicted with the gp model for the san antonio bay are also shown in fig 3c the gp model predicted the high risks of 0 83 0 99 0 8 for thirteen days in the period of february 2 24 2007 and the risks of 0 85 0 86 0 98 and 0 92 0 8 for november 22 23 24 and 25 2009 respectively the model predictions were consistent with the reported norovirus outbreaks in the san antonio bay two outbreaks associated with the consumption of norovirus contaminated raw oysters harvested from area iic located in the mississippi sound fig 1 occurred on january 5 and february 24 2009 as shown in fig 3d it can be seen from the figure that the reported norovirus outbreaks were correctly predicted by the gp model with the risks of 0 87 and 0 93 for january 5 and 12 and 0 94 for february 27 with 3 days of time lag 2009 fig 3e and f shows both predicted and reported oyster norovirus outbreak risks in 2010 january 1 december 31 in areas 7 and 13 respectively along louisiana coast fig 1 it was reported that area 7 was closed on march 24 2010 after 14 people became ill due to the consumption of norovirus contaminated raw oysters harvested inferably between march 6 and 24 2010 area 13 was closed on march 30 2010 after 19 people were infected by norovirus due to eating raw oysters harvested from this area between march 27 and 30 2010 http new dhh louisiana gov assets oph center phch center ch infectious epi lmr 2000 2010 2010 mayjun10 pdf fig 3e demonstrates that the gp model predicted multiple norovirus outbreaks for march 9 12 13 16 18 23 and 24 2010 with the risks higher than the threshold of 0 8 which were consistent with the inferred norovirus outbreak period of march 6 and 24 2010 likewise fig 3f shows the gp model predicted high norovirus outbreak risk of 1 0 for march 27 confirming the reported outbreak between march 27 and 30 2010 while the model predicted a false positive outbreak for january 13 2010 with risk of 0 97 the overall performance of the gp model is reasonably good because the model correctly predicted all other reported norovirus outbreaks in the year 2010 and no false outbreaks were predicted the area under the receiver operating characteristic roc curve auc true positive and negative rates which are reliable measures for the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system gardner and greiner 2006 were used to evaluate the performance of the gp model roc curve can be constructed by plotting the true positive rate sensitivity against the false positive rate 100 specificity at various threshold settings fawcett 2006 fig 5a illustrates the roc curve for the training dataset an area of 1 0 means that the model performance is perfect while an area of 0 5 indicates that the model is useless the area under the roc curve auc in fig 5a is 0 86 the true positive rate sensitivity and the true negative rate specificity are 79 51 and 89 92 respectively 3 3 independent cross validation in order to further test the performance of the best gp model the model was utilized for the prediction of norovirus outbreaks with independent data collected from 2010 to 2014 which were not used in the model development and involved five reported norovirus outbreaks as shown in fig 4 a the model correctly predicted the reported norovirus outbreak in area 3 with high risks of 0 96 and 0 9 for march 20 and 21 2010 respectively the model also predicted a high risk of 0 88 for february 25 2010 it was possible that the reported outbreak might last over 3 weeks from february 25 march 21 2010 fig 4b shows norovirus outbreaks risks in 2012 in area 23 the louisiana department of health and hospitals dhh closed area 23 on tuesday may 8 2012 after 14 people consumed the oysters harvested from area 23 and became sick with norovirus all oysters harvested from april 26 may 8 2012 in area 23 were recalled it can be seen from fig 4b that the model correctly predicted the outbreak with the high risks of 0 95 0 90 0 90 and 0 93 for april 26 29 and 30 and may 2 respectively the dhh also ordered a recall of oysters harvested from december 28 2012 january 4 2013 in area 30 after nine people ate oysters harvested from area 30 and became sick with norovirus http dhh louisiana gov index cfm newsroom detail 2732 as shown in fig 4c the gp model predicted the high risks of 0 95 and 0 96 for december 28 2012 and january 2 2013 respectively in the reported outbreak period and for january 12 risk 0 93 after the reported period overall the model predictions were consistent with the reported outbreaks from 2012 2013 fig 4d shows norovirus outbreak risks from 2013 2014 in the copano bay texas the fda warned consumers not to eat raw or partially cooked shellfish harvested from the copano bay between december 26 2013 and january 9 2014 due to norovirus illnesses in louisiana http www fda gov newsevents newsroom pressannouncements ucm382247 htm fig 4d clearly indicates that the norovirus outbreak risks predicted with the gp model increased from about 0 1 to 1 0 on december 17 2013 and high risks 0 8 persisted until january 9 2014 in order to determine whether the model was overfitted the area under the roc curve auc true positive and negative rates for the independent datasets were also calculated and shown in fig 5b the auc the true positive rate and the true negative rate were 0 86 78 18 and 89 26 respectively moreover the overall performance of gp model for both training and independent validation datasets in terms of auc the true positive rate and the true negative rate were 0 86 78 53 and 88 82 respectively demonstrating the consistent performance of the gp model for both the training and the validation datasets 3 4 sensitivity analysis the result of the local sensitivity analysis is shown in fig 6 the vertical axis of fig 6 represents percent changes in individual environmental predictors from their average values and the horizontal axis indicates how the gp model responds to the change in an independent environmental predictor in terms of percent change in the model predicted oyster norovirus outbreak risk in terms of reduction negative change in the risk of oyster norovirus outbreaks shown in the left panel of fig 6 solar radiation is by far the most important environmental predictor as a 50 increase in solar radiation reduces the model predicted risk of oyster norovirus outbreak over four times 221 the risk reduction is achieved due to the solar inactivation of norovirus this finding may explain why oyster norovirus outbreaks rarely occur in the summer season due to the strong solar inactivation of norovirus therefore solar radiation is the primary sink of norovirus the negative percent changes outbreak risk reduction caused by other environmental predictors are negligible as compared with that caused by solar radiation in terms of elevated risk of oyster norovirus outbreaks shown in the right panel of fig 6 the low temperature is by far the most important environmental predictor as a 50 reduction in temperature increases the model predicted risk of oyster norovirus outbreaks over three times the low gage height is the second most important environmental predictor to oyster norovirus outbreaks followed by salinity and solar radiation the importance of wind and rainfall to oyster norovirus outbreaks is much smaller than other environmental predictors overall the local sensitivity analysis result indicates that norovirus outbreaks are controlled by the environmental conditions of low temperature low gage height and low solar radiation in combination with low salinity strong offshore wind and heavy rainfall the advantage of the local sensitivity analysis is that the effects of both positive and negative changes in individual environmental predictors on oyster norovirus outbreaks can be identified while the global sensitivity analysis is capable of taking account of the interaction among model input variables fig 7 shows the result of sobol global sensitivity analysis in terms of total sensitivity indices the figure indicates that the risk of model predicted oyster norovirus outbreaks is most sensitive to gage height and temperature this finding is consistent with that from the previous study of our research group wang and deng 2016 solar radiation is ranked as the third important environmental predictor to oyster norovirus outbreaks followed by wind salinity and rainfall overall the results from the local and global sensitivity analyses are consistent in terms of the most and least important environmental predictors specifically gage height temperature and solar radiation are the most important three predictors and wind salinity and rainfall are the least important three predictors to oyster norovirus outbreaks 4 discussion while the most likely source of oyster norovirus outbreaks is often pinpointed to human sewage exact causes of the outbreaks are rarely identified and reported it is essential to identify the causes behind the outbreaks and then develop predictive tools for mitigating the negative impact of the outbreaks the premier hypothesis of this study was that oyster norovirus outbreaks are primarily caused by certain environmental conditions the hypothesis was tested and confirmed in this study by identifying the environmental conditions and developing a gp based predictive model using environmental predictors describing the conditions gp was first utilized to develop functional relationships between norovirus outbreak risks and individual environmental predictors along with their various combinations while no single predictor was able to explain all historical norovirus outbreaks the functional relationship established using various combinations of solar radiation was found to be the most important explanatory relationship to predicting norovirus outbreaks and thus to the gp model the solar radiation was employed in this study as a predictor for the first time in the modeling of oyster norovirus outbreaks the importance of solar radiation is understandable since virus survival increases in cold temperature due to the reduction in the exposure to solar radiation westrell et al 2010 many studies also reported that high reduction in norovirus can be achieved when the uv intensity is high campos et al 2013 campos and lees 2014 in addition to the solar radiation water temperature and gage height were identified as the second third most influential predictors in both methods specifically low water temperature and low gage height were found to enhance the concentration of norovirus in oyster tissues and thus increase the risk of oyster norovirus outbreaks wang and deng 2016 when gage height is very low the water depth over oyster beds would be very shallow and the water temperature at the oyster bed level would be as low as the air temperature while the water temperature at oyster beds is commonly higher than the air temperature during cold seasons low temperature may cause the pores in oyster gills to contract reducing the pore size of oyster tissues and increasing the concentration of norovirus particles in oysters which are larger than the contracted pore size salinity wind and rainfall were less critical predictors to the oyster norovirus outbreaks based on both the local and the global sensitivity analysis methods however strong offshore wind and low salinity can enhance the resuspension of norovirus attached to fine sediment particles enhancing the concentration of norovirus in oyster tissues in addition low salinity was found to affect the persistence of norovirus in oyster harvest waters by enhancing virus binding to fine sediment particles maalouf et al 2010 rainfall runoff is a major source of norovirus contamination to oyster growing waters shamkhali chenar and deng 2017 although logistic regression and random forest methods achieved superior performance in some of previously published studies oliveira et al 2012 vorpahl et al 2012 results of the current study reveal that none of the methods exhibits distinct superiority over another one in spite of some similarities the two methods provided different sets of significant input variables for the same datasets therefore no single method can be considered as the best method for the selection of input variables rather a combination of rf and blr should be used for the selection of significant input variables the significant variables determined by gp suggest that the number of lag days that influence model based norovirus outbreaks may vary between 1 and 30 days depending on individual environmental predictors as shown in appendix a the result indicates that antecedent environmental conditions and the cumulative effects of the conditions before the onset of an outbreak control norovirus outbreaks the significance of this finding is that seafood safety monitoring programs could be improved by monitoring not only current environmental conditions but also the cumulative effects of antecedent environmental conditions this study also investigated whether the model performance could be improved if the mathematical functions such as sin cos natural logarithm and square root were used in addition to basic arithmetic operators while it was argued that using simple function sets would improve the model accuracy banzhaf et al 1998 jayawardena et al 2005 muttil and lee 2005 muttil and chau 2006 due to efficiency and creativity of gp in evolving equations by combining them the results of this study indicated that the incorporation of more mathematical functions could improve the performance of the gp evolved equations in terms of rmse overall the performance of the final gp evolved equation for both training and testing periods was satisfactory in terms of correct predictions of historical oyster norovirus outbreaks however there were some differences in the timing of the predicted versus reported outbreak dates in addition two model predicted outbreaks were significantly different from reported outbreaks in the timing and thus might be false positive outbreaks an advantage of the gp model over the artificial neural network ann models developed by the authors research group wang and deng 2016 chenar and deng 2017 is the explicit mathematical equations shown in appendix a which provide a direct relationship between norovirus epidemics and environmental predictors while data driven models with multiple explanatory variables may experience overfitting overfitting of the gp model was avoided by training and testing the model with two separate datasets including the training datasets and independent validation datasets from four different oysters growing waters area 3 23 30 in louisiana and copano bay in texas overfitted models are generally able to achieve a good fit to training data while they show a poor performance with independent testing data gonçalves et al 2012 other overfitting control measures such as using a large training sample size and random sampling were also adopted in this research to avoid model overfitting tuite et al 2011 gonçalves et al 2012 in order to determine whether the gp model is overtrained the three model performance metrics including auc true positive rate and true negative rate were calculated for the model training datasets and the model validation datasets separately the auc true positive rate and true negative rate were 0 86 79 51 and 89 92 respectively for the model training datasets and 0 86 78 18 and 89 26 respectively for the model validation datasets it is clear that the gp model performed consistently well with both datasets confirming that the gp model was not overtrained or overfitted 5 conclusions it is highly likely that oyster norovirus outbreaks will keep occurring it is therefore important to have predictive tools for reducing the risk of the outbreaks to human health and to the seafood industry a risk based gp model was developed for predicting norovirus outbreaks in oyster harvest areas along the northern gulf of mexico coast which is highly prone to norovirus epidemics based on the results of model predictions and sensitivity analyses the following conclusions can be drawn the primary cause of oyster norovirus outbreaks is favorable environmental conditions the environmental conditions in favor of norovirus outbreaks are characterized by low solar radiation low temperature low gage height low salinity heavy rainfall and strong offshore wind cumulative effects of antecedent environmental conditions play a more important role in triggering a norovirus outbreak than do the current environmental conditions the significance of this finding is that seafood safety monitoring programs could be improved by monitoring not only current environmental conditions but also the cumulative effects of antecedent environmental conditions the environmental conditions can be described with six independent environmental predictors and their time series ensembles the most significant environmental predictors to model predicted norovirus outbreaks are solar radiation gage height and water temperature wind salinity and rainfall are also important predictors to oyster norovirus outbreaks the solar radiation was found for the first time to be one of the most important environmental predictors based on local sensitivity analysis in fact solar radiation is the primary sink of norovirus specifically the solar uv radiation inactivates viruses by chemically modifying their dna and rna the six environmental predictors were selected by combining rf and blr methods although rf and blr had a similar performance each method produced different sets of significant input variables the combination of rf and blr approaches could beneficially contribute to the optimal model the cumulative effects of antecedent environmental conditions can be described with various time lagged combinations time series ensembles of the six independent environmental predictors the time lags could span anywhere from 1 day up to 30 days before the onset of an outbreak depending on individual environmental predictors the theoretical significance of this finding is that it provides a new insight into the process leading to a norovirus outbreak specifically a norovirus outbreak is triggered by a process in which favorable environmental conditions are naturally maintained for an extended period of time the gp model developed in this paper is an effective and efficient tool for predicting oyster norovirus outbreaks the area under the roc curve auc was 0 86 the true positive and negative rates were 78 53 and 88 82 respectively demonstrating the efficacy of the gp model in predicting the environmental conditions under which norovirus contamination of oysters is likely to occur as a result the risk of norovirus to human health and the economic losses of norovirus outbreaks to the shellfish industry could be significantly reduced a major advantage of the gp based norovirus prediction model over other models is that gp provides an explicit mathematical relationship between the norovirus epidemics and the environmental variables the explicit gp based norovirus model in conjunction with the sensitivity analyses provided new insights into the mechanisms underlying norovirus outbreaks in terms of source sink cause and predictors the gp model presented here was developed and tested with the data from the northern gulf of mexico the application of the gp model to oyster growing waters in other regions and countries may require additional validation and calibration of the model with local data and particularly some of the time lagged ensembles of the environmental predictors particularly rainfall

19866,oyster norovirus outbreaks pose increasing risks to human health and seafood industry worldwide but exact causes of the outbreaks are rarely identified making it highly unlikely to reduce the risks this paper presents a genetic programming gp based approach to identifying the primary cause of oyster norovirus outbreaks and predicting oyster norovirus outbreaks in order to reduce the risks in terms of the primary cause it was found that oyster norovirus outbreaks were controlled by cumulative effects of antecedent environmental conditions characterized by low solar radiation low water temperature low gage height the height of water above a gage datum low salinity heavy rainfall and strong offshore wind the six environmental variables were determined by using random forest rf and binary logistic regression blr methods within the framework of the gp approach in terms of predicting norovirus outbreaks a risk based gp model was developed using the six environmental variables and various combinations of the variables with different time lags the results of local and global sensitivity analyses showed that gage height temperature and solar radiation were by far the three most important environmental predictors for oyster norovirus outbreaks though other variables were also important specifically very low temperature and gage height significantly increased the risk of norovirus outbreaks while high solar radiation markedly reduced the risk suggesting that low temperature and gage height were associated with the norovirus source while solar radiation was the primary sink of norovirus the gp model was utilized to hindcast daily risks of oyster norovirus outbreaks along the northern gulf of mexico coast the daily hindcasting results indicated that the gp model was capable of hindcasting all historical oyster norovirus outbreaks from january 2002 to june 2014 in the gulf of mexico with only two false positive outbreaks for the 12 5 year period the performance of the gp model was characterized with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0 86 the true positive rate sensitivity of 78 53 and the true negative rate specificity of 88 82 respectively demonstrating the efficacy of the gp model the findings and results offered new insights into the oyster norovirus outbreaks in terms of source sink cause and predictors the gp model provided an efficient and effective tool for predicting potential oyster norovirus outbreaks and implementing management interventions to prevent or at least reduce norovirus risks to both the human health and the seafood industry graphical abstract image keywords genetic programming oyster norovirus outbreaks predictive model sensitivity analysis 1 introduction norovirus is the leading cause of illness and outbreaks from contaminated foods https www cdc gov norovirus php illness outbreaks html such as oysters harvested from sewage contaminated coastal waters butt et al 2004 campos and lees 2014 campos et al 2015 specifically the virus is associated with 18 of all diarrheal diseases worldwide ahmed et al 2014 lopman et al 2015 and causes 58 of foodborne illnesses or 5 5 million cases in a typical year in the united states in addition norovirus imposes 2 3 billion in economic burden in a typical year due to deaths non hospitalized cases and hospitalizations in the united states u s alone hoffmann et al 2015 the first 2017 norovirus outbreak linked to british columbia oysters spread nation wide from january to march 2017 and caused over 320 cases of gastrointestinal illnesses in canada http www phac aspc gc ca phn asp 2017 outbreak norovirus eclosion eng php in addition to burdens on health sectors the norovirus outbreaks may also lead to severe economic losses to the shellfish industry because of product recalls http www issc org notices harvest area closures and loss of consumer confidence torok 2013 although significant efforts have been made in improving sewerage infrastructure contamination to seafood due to the sewage contaminated runoff caused by heavy rainfall events remains difficult to avoid the contamination of shellfish growing waters in the nearshore coastal environment may cause the bioaccumulation of enteric bacteria and viruses particularly norovirus particles in filter feeding shellfish such as oysters flannery et al 2013 under certain environmental conditions particularly norovirus nov has been found to accumulate in digestive tissues of oysters growing in contaminated waters wang and deng 2012 consequently it is crucial to identify the environmental conditions favoring the norovirus bioaccumulation in oysters and thereby to predict potential oyster norovirus outbreaks in order to protect public health and promote the sustainable development of the shellfish industry while there is a growing body of literature on norovirus seasonality and epidemiology there is only very limited success in identifying and modeling environmental conditions responsible for oyster norovirus outbreaks greer et al 2009 evaluated the association of norovirus outbreak risk with environment variables by taking into account the nonlinear relationship between norovirus outbreaks and environmental factors and employing poisson and zero inflated poisson regression models their study revealed that low temperature and heavy precipitation facilitated oyster norovirus outbreaks a similar study conducted by lopman et al 2009 investigated the lagged effect of temperature relative humidity and rainfall on norovirus outbreaks using poisson regression kim et al 2016 developed a geographic information system gis based binary response model to predict norovirus outbreak patterns using environmental variables including topographical characteristics climate conditions demographic characteristics water and sanitation utilities and land use results showed that cold temperature in combination with several factors increased norovirus outbreaks the artificial neural network ann based models presented by wang and deng 2016 and chenar and deng 2017 were the first operational models for predicting and forecasting the risk of potential oyster norovirus outbreaks in the gulf of mexico using environmental predictors while demonstrating an excellent performance a major limitation of the ann models was that they were black box models with implicit and unknown relationships between the norovirus epidemics and environmental predictors an explicit relationship between the norovirus outbreak risk and environmental predictors would be useful to understanding the processes and mechanisms triggering norovirus outbreaks the overall goal of this study was to present a new explicit model for prediction of oyster norovirus outbreaks and for reducing the risk of norovirus outbreaks to human health to that end the specific objectives of this paper were 1 to identify environmental predictors for oyster norovirus outbreaks using random forest rf and binary logistic regression blr 2 to present an evolution based genetic programming gp model for predicting oyster norovirus outbreaks in the gulf of mexico using the environmental predictors and 3 to determine the sensitivity of the gp model for identifying the most influential environmental predictors controlling norovirus outbreaks the gp model could potentially alert the public with timely outbreak risk predictions and thereby reduce the risk of norovirus to human health moreover early detection of potential norovirus outbreaks allows the shellfish industry to take intervention actions such as closure of implicated oyster growing areas and thereby to reduce economic losses 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the gulf of mexico coast produces about two thirds of the u s oysters with louisiana being the top oyster producer in the u s this study focuses on the oyster harvest areas along the u s gulf coast of texas louisiana and mississippi including 30 areas in louisiana the copano bay and the san antonio bay in texas and area iic in mississippi as shown in fig 1 environmental data were collected for the oyster harvest areas 2 2 data collection and processing data on historical norovirus outbreaks associated with the consumption of raw oysters harvested in louisiana were collected from annual louisiana morbidity reports released by the louisiana department of health and hospitals data on oyster norovirus outbreaks in texas and mississippi were obtained from the u s food and drug administration and the centers for disease control and prevention table 1 data for environmental predictors including water temperature gage height salinity rainfall solar radiation and wind speed and direction were collected from various online sources for the period of 2002 2014 specifically data for water temperature gage height and salinity were obtained from the u s geological survey usgs stations located along the gulf of mexico coast https maps waterdata usgs gov mapper index html while rainfall and wind data were collected from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa weather service website http water weather gov precip the gage height is the water surface elevation measured above a gage datum such as the north american vertical datum of 1988 navd88 or the national geodetic vertical datum of 1929 ngvd29 sauer and turnipseed 2010 solar radiation data were downloaded from the louisiana agriclimatic information system website http weather lsuagcenter com charts aspx r 2 hourly time series data were used to derive the data for the daily maximum daily change and daily average of individual environmental predictors for identification of potential model input variables all data were then normalized using feature scaling unity based normalization so that each environmental predictor varies only in the range of 0 1 to eliminate effects of datum offshore wind was found to increase the concentration of norovirus in oyster growing waters wang and deng 2016 generally offshore wind produces an offshore surface current and onshore bottom flow near the seabed where oyster beds are located therefore the offshore wind produced onshore bottom flow conveys norovirus to oyster beds increasing the concentration of norovirus in oysters and thereby the risk of oyster norovirus outbreaks whether a wind direction is offshore or onshore depends on not only the wind direction but also local shoreline directions the same wind may cause offshore currents in one oyster area and onshore currents in another area in order to quantify the effect of the site specific onshore offshore wind on norovirus outbreaks a wind direction index ω was defined in eq 1 and fig 2 since the angle θ in eq 1 is site specific the parameter ω was defined individually for each oyster growing area such that ω 0 for all onshore wind directions θ 90 and ω values were calculated using eq 1 for offshore wind directions it is clear from eq 1 that ω 1 0 when the offshore wind direction is perpendicular to the shoreline θ 0 and ω 0 0 when the wind direction is parallel to the shoreline θ 90 in general the wind direction index ω varies in the range of 0 0 1 0 for any offshore wind direction while it equals 0 for all onshore winds with the wind direction θ 90 1 ω 0 for onshore winds 90 θ 90 for offshore winds where the parameter θ 0 θ 90 is the angle between an offshore wind direction and the offshore vector perpendicular to the shoreline as shown in fig 2 in order to reduce the number of input variables involved in the predictive model the wind speed v and the direction index ω were combined and their product v ω was defined as a new wind function w v ω the wind function w was simply called as wind and used as an independent environmental variable in the selection of model input variables 2 3 selection of model input variables the selection of explanatory variables is the first major step in the development of data driven models according to previous studies of author s research group wang and deng 2016 chenar and deng 2017 oyster norovirus outbreaks are principally controlled by the combination of antecedent environmental conditions particularly cumulative effects of antecedent environmental conditions play a more important role in triggering a norovirus outbreak than instantaneous environmental conditions for this purpose the six independent environmental predictors including water temperature gage height salinity rainfall solar radiation and wind were selected and reorganized into time series ensembles of individual predictors to describe antecedent environmental conditions the potential time series ensemble of each environmental predictor consisted of a finite number of time lagged variables covering the antecedent period of 1 30 days and involving the maximum minimum daily average daily change and cumulative terms of the predictor the cumulative terms or effects of an environmental predictor were described using the sums of observations of the predictor over a certain antecedent time period such as cumulative salinity in last 30 days 29 days and 2 days since a large number of potential time series variables may produce a large amount of redundancy in model input variables the random forest rf method and the binary logistic regression blr method were employed to rank the importance of individual variables to norovirus outbreaks reduce the number of datasets and then select a final set of model input variables the random forest rf method proposed by breiman 2001 is one of the most widely used supervised machine learning methods for regression analysis and classification svetnik et al 2003 by combining the idea of bagging peters et al 2007 and random feature selection rf starts by growing multiple trees each tree is grown to the largest extent possible and there is no pruning then new data are predicted by aggregating the predictions of the ntree trees using majority votes for classification and the average for regression analysis svetnik et al 2003 the numbers of trees and predictors used to determine the split at each node are key principals of the rf method aside from improved accuracy rf provides measures of relevant variables for each candidate predictor peters et al 2007 the popular variable importance measure based on rf is the gini variable importance strobl et al 2007 which was used in this study the gini criterion was utilized to select the split with the lowest impurity at each node which was chosen as the spitting variable leading to the most influential input variable archer and kimes 2008 in this study the top 20 of predictive variables from the predictor set with the high gini variable importance were selected as significant inputs for each predictor the random forest package within the statistical software r 3 2 2 was used for the rf analysis since there is no guarantee that the input variables selected using rf are the best predictors for a predictive model the binary logistic regression blr analysis also was used in this study to select and confirm the model input variables blr is a classification method that estimates the probability of occurrence of one of the two classes of a dichotomous criterion variable a linear combination of predictors was employed to fit a logit transformation of the probability of success for each subject and the regression coefficients were estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation cox 1958 since the dependent variable norovirus outbreak risk in this study was binomial logistic regression was adopted to select a final set of model inputs based on the nagelkerke r square values for individual variables the logistic regression analysis in the statistical software package ibm spss was used to implement this technique the top 20 of predictive variables with the high nagelkerke r square were selected as significant inputs for each environmental predictor since the input variables selected using the rf and blr methods were not necessarily the same variables it was important to verify the results from the two methods and determine the explanatory variables finally to use in the predictive model as the model input variables to that end the genetic programming gp technique was utilized to test the potential independent variables initially selected with the rf and blr methods it was argued that an equation evolved with gp would contain the most significant input variables muttil and lee 2005 muttil and chau 2007 therefore the performance of the rf and blr methods was evaluated using the number of gp model input variables selected from the rf variable pool and the blr variable pool respectively the following five step procedure was employed for the final selection of the potential independent variables based on the rf and blr methods and model input functions step 1 independent variables and various combinations of individual independent variables were sorted in descending order of rf score of importance the variables of the high importance top 20 were selected and the other combinations were removed from the potential input variable pool step 2 independent variables and various combinations of individual independent variables were sorted in descending order of nagelkerke r square based on blr analysis the variables of high r square top 20 were selected and the other combinations were eliminated step 3 all the remaining variables from steps 1 and 2 were then selected as the potential set of input variables for the gp model step 4 gp automatically selected the final set of model input variables from the potential input variables identified in step 3 the number of finally selected model input variables was less than that of the potential input variables determined in step 3 some of the finally selected variables were from the rf variable pool table 3 column 4 while the others were from the blr variable pool table 3 column 3 in addition to those variables some common variables were selected by both rf and blr methods table 3 column 5 step 5 the input variables finally identified in step 4 were used in gp to further establish functional relationships between the norovirus outbreak and individual independent environmental predictors along with various combinations of the predictors identified in step 4 as a result six input functions were established for the six independent environmental predictors and then employed as the gp model inputs 2 4 genetic programming approach genetic programming gp is an evolutionary algorithm based on the darwinian theory of evolution by the natural selection the primary search strategy behind it is a genetic algorithm ga goldberg and holland 1988 gp proceeds by initially generating random programs equations derived from the random combination of input variables random numbers and functions gp then evaluates their fitness a measure of how well they solve the problem of evolved programs and subsequently selects individual programs that best fit the data for reproduction and recombination from the initial population sivapragasam et al 2010 the models with the best fit are evolved through genetic operators of selection reproduction crossover and mutation which mimic the biological evolution mehr et al 2014 a key advantage of genetic programming as compared to traditional data driven models is that the model structure doesn t need to be defined initially in fact gp is frequently applied to model structure identification problems and a number of applications of gp have been reported including rainfall runoff modeling havlíček et al 2013 algal bloom predictions muttil and lee 2005 sivapragasam et al 2010 sediment transport modelling garg 2014 groundwater level forecast and aquifer management cobaner et al 2016 kasiviswanathan et al 2016 and stream flow predictions guven 2009 mehr et al 2014 furthermore gp is capable of selecting automatically input variables that contribute beneficially to a model muttil and lee 2005 in addition gp doesn t require variable independence for model generation castillo et al 2005 and automatically selects sensitive predictors castillo et al 2005 garg and tai 2012 the development of a gp model requires the modeler to specify 1 a set of terminals independent variables for each branch of the program to evolve 2 a set of primitive functions for each branch of the program to evolve 3 a fitness measure for determining the fitness of individuals in the population 4 control parameters for the run and 5 the termination criterion and method for designating the result of the run sreekanth and datta 2011 based on the understanding of the physical process the combination of arithmetic operators and mathematical functions sin cos tan exp log sigmoid forms a set of equations in each generation iteration the operators including addition subtraction multiplication and division were considered in the initial functional set function set i other functions sin cos ln and sqrt were then added to the functional set function set ii due to the nonlinear nature of the relationship between norovirus outbreaks and environmental factors the sum of the absolute differences between the expected output value and the input also was set as a measure of fitness function for the evolution of the gp models the control parameters used in all gp runs were determined empirically through trial runs and listed in table 2 the parameter maximum tree size defines the maximum size of an evolved equation and it was set to be 29 to avoid overgrowing programs and to constrain the number of selected input variables hence the equation is easy to interpret muttil and chau 2006 the crossover and mutation rates were chosen to be 75 and 25 respectively as the values were generally used in the literature it should be noted that if the probability of mutation is set too high the mutation can cause rapid degradation of relatively fit solution sets garg 2014 the above mentioned tree based genetic programming tgp approach to modeling norovirus outbreaks was implemented in this study using the gplab toolbox for matlab developed by silva and almeida 2003 the input output datasets were split into two subsets including testing and training subsets as shown in table 1 the training subset including two thirds of reported outbreaks was used to train the gp models while the other subset which was not used in the model training phase and collected from 2010 to 2014 for the oyster growing areas 3 23 30 and copano bay was employed to validate the developed gp models the six functional relationships finally established for the six independent variables including temperature gage height solar radiation salinity rainfall and wind were used as model input functions the efficacy of evolved models was evaluated using the root mean square error rmse and the number of correct predictions of reported norovirus outbreaks the importance of individual independent variables was assessed based on sensitivity analyses 2 5 sensitivity analysis to investigate the sensitivity of gp model outputs model predicted norovirus outbreak risks to individual independent variables local and global sensitivity analyses sa were carried out the local sa is concerned with the local response of the output s when input parameters vary one at a time while global sa examines the global response of model output over the entire input parameter space saltelli et al 2000 cannavó 2012 to conduct local sa the mean values of individual predictors including water temperature gage height water salinity rainfall solar radiation and wind were varied one at a time by 10 20 30 40 and 50 respectively and the corresponding percent change in the final model output was calculated the variance based sobol sensitivity analysis was applied to quantify the global response of norovirus outbreak risks predicted by the gp model over the entire environmental parameter space saltelli and sobol 1995 homma and saltelli 1996 the advantage of applying the sobol global sensitivity analysis is that the method is not only a comprehensive approach to determining highly influential or non influential predictors but also estimating the most significant interaction between naturally correlated environmental parameters the amount of variance which a single parameter or the interactions of two or more parameters contribute to the unconditional variance of the model output is referred as sobol sensitivity index calculated based on the anova decomposition nossent et al 2011 the total variance d of a function f x where x xi is a vector of the input variables defined in the unit hypercube hn 0 xi 1 i 1 n can be expressed as follows 2 d 0 1 f 2 x d x f 0 2 s 1 n i 1 i s d i 1 i s where 1 i1 is n and s 1 n sensitivity estimates are then defined as 3 s i 1 i s d i 1 i s d using this general definition the first order indices si represent the variance contribution of the individual parameter x i to the total model variance whereas the second order sensitivity indices sij measure the interaction effects and so on finally total order sensitivity indices are the sum of all the sensitivity indices which introduce the overall effects of one factor on the model output eq 4 used as quantitative measures to determine the sensitivity of the analyzed gp model to individual input variables moreover quasi monte carlo integrals qmc were applied in this research to compute the multi dimensional integrals and estimate the sensitivity indices the idea behind quasi monte carlo methods is to use low discrepancy sequences lds for sampling points instead of pseudo random numbers bianchetti et al 2015 a toolbox named gsat global sensitivity analysis toolbox developed by cannavó 2012 was used to calculate the above described sensitivity indices 4 s t i s i i j s i j 3 results 3 1 selection of model input functions based on the methodology presented above potential gp models were evolved for norovirus outbreak predictions using the six functional relationships individually the evolved gp equations for the six functional relationships are presented in appendix a the optimal relationship for each function was selected based on the number of true outbreak predictions with the training dataset by comparing gp model predictions with historical data for norovirus outbreaks it was found that all reported oyster norovirus outbreaks were consistently associated with the model predicted risk range of 0 8 1 0 therefore the risk level of 0 8 was employed as the threshold of model predicted oyster norovirus outbreaks specifically norovirus outbreaks occurred when the model predicted risk was 0 8 no outbreaks were reported when the model predicted risk was 0 8 among the six individual functional relationships the solar radiation relationship predicted more norovirus outbreaks 5 out of 8 than any other relationships and the rainfall relationship predicted the lowest number of outbreaks 2 out of 8 table 3 shows the total number of variables used in individual relationships and the number of variables selected by the rf and blr methods it is clear from the table that there is no significant difference in the performance of rf and blr methods gp selected approximately the same numbers of variables from the rf and blr variable pools most significant variables were the average water temperature thirty days before the onset of an outbreak the difference between the minimum gage heights eleven and twelve days before the outbreak the difference between the maximum solar radiation values ten and fourteen days before the average salinity sixteen days before cumulative rainfall in ten days and the difference between the wind function values fourteen and fifteen days before the onset of the outbreak it is clear that most variables involved in the gp model are time lagged combinations of independent environmental predictors indicating the importance of time lagged effects and cumulative effects of individual environmental predictors on norovirus outbreaks it should be pointed out that each environmental predictor along with its time series ensemble represents a unique mechanism responsible for oyster norovirus outbreaks for instance rainfall variables were used to represent the effect of norovirus sources on oyster norovirus outbreaks specifically antecedent rainfalls of 2 10 days before the onset of a norovirus outbreak were used to show that it would take 2 10 days for sewage contaminated runoff to reach oyster growing areas from distributed norovirus sources such as failing septic systems and malfunctioning wastewater treatment plants following a rainfall event basically each rainfall variable in the rainfall function represents a single sewage or norovirus source since norovirus may persist in water environment for up to 30 days pommepuy et al 2004 time lags of up to 30 days were used to describe effects of other environmental predictors on the persistence of norovirus in oyster growing waters and the concentration of norovirus in oysters by means of time series ensembles leading to a large number of variables due to the time lags 3 2 genetic programming model performance with training datasets the six gp evolved relationships listed in appendix a were employed as the final set of model input functions for the prediction of norovirus outbreaks in fact two function sets were initially used and 20 gp equations were evolved with each function set table 4 lists the rmse of 15 best models out of 20 models for the two gp function sets including i and ii and data sets including training and testing sets all of the models produced almost the same rmse with each of the function sets according to table 4 the total rmse for gp evolved models developed with the basic function set i varies from 0 48 to 0 54 and the total rmse for models with the more complicated function set ii ranges from 0 4 to 0 51 though an improvement in the model performance was observed when more functions were added the improvement in terms of rmse was very limited the rmse with the testing dataset varies in the range from 0 52 to 0 66 for the function set i and 0 41 to 0 50 for the function set ii respectively it is clear that the models developed with the function set ii performed better than did the models from the function set i consequently the best gp model was selected from the models developed with the function set ii consisting of both basic and mathematical functions sin cos ln sqrt as shown in table 4 models ii5 and ii11 have the minimum rmse of 0 41 with the testing dataset while the two models have the same rmse of 0 41 the model ii11 included rainfall as one of the six independent environmental predictors therefore model ii11 is finally selected as the best gp model and it is written in the form of the six input functions as 5 n o v sin sin f s f g h f s r f t f w f r f g h s i n f w 2 f s r c o s l n f s r where nov represents the norovirus outbreak risk f t f gh f w f sr f s and f r denote the gp evolved functions for temperature gage height wind solar radiation water salinity and rainfall respectively which are listed in appendix a fig 3 shows daily oyster norovirus outbreak risks predicted with the best gp model against reported norovirus outbreaks for 2002 training dataset although a false outbreak was predicted for october 10 2002 with risk of 0 91 the gp model correctly reproduced norovirus outbreaks that occurred in march 2002 in louisiana area 6 as shown in fig 3a the model predicted risks exceeded the threshold risk of 0 8 for 6 days during the outbreak period starting from march 12 risk 0 84 to 27 risk 0 93 fig 3b shows both predicted and reported oyster norovirus outbreak risks in 2007 in louisiana oyster area 3 oysters harvested from december 10 21 were recalled due to a reported norovirus outbreak while the gp model predicted a norovirus outbreak with the risk of 0 9 for december 9 2007 fig 3b the u s food and drug administration fda advised consumers to avoid eating raw oysters harvested in the period of february 1 24 2007 from the san antonio bay due to a reported norovirus outbreak as shown in fig 3c oyster growing areas in the san antonio bay were closed by the texas department of health services on february 24 2007 all oysters harvested from the san antonio bay between november 16 and 25 2009 were recalled again by the texas department of state health services due to another reported norovirus outbreak in this area as shown in fig 3c approximately 12 people became ill with norovirus after eating oysters harvested from this area the daily norovirus outbreak risks predicted with the gp model for the san antonio bay are also shown in fig 3c the gp model predicted the high risks of 0 83 0 99 0 8 for thirteen days in the period of february 2 24 2007 and the risks of 0 85 0 86 0 98 and 0 92 0 8 for november 22 23 24 and 25 2009 respectively the model predictions were consistent with the reported norovirus outbreaks in the san antonio bay two outbreaks associated with the consumption of norovirus contaminated raw oysters harvested from area iic located in the mississippi sound fig 1 occurred on january 5 and february 24 2009 as shown in fig 3d it can be seen from the figure that the reported norovirus outbreaks were correctly predicted by the gp model with the risks of 0 87 and 0 93 for january 5 and 12 and 0 94 for february 27 with 3 days of time lag 2009 fig 3e and f shows both predicted and reported oyster norovirus outbreak risks in 2010 january 1 december 31 in areas 7 and 13 respectively along louisiana coast fig 1 it was reported that area 7 was closed on march 24 2010 after 14 people became ill due to the consumption of norovirus contaminated raw oysters harvested inferably between march 6 and 24 2010 area 13 was closed on march 30 2010 after 19 people were infected by norovirus due to eating raw oysters harvested from this area between march 27 and 30 2010 http new dhh louisiana gov assets oph center phch center ch infectious epi lmr 2000 2010 2010 mayjun10 pdf fig 3e demonstrates that the gp model predicted multiple norovirus outbreaks for march 9 12 13 16 18 23 and 24 2010 with the risks higher than the threshold of 0 8 which were consistent with the inferred norovirus outbreak period of march 6 and 24 2010 likewise fig 3f shows the gp model predicted high norovirus outbreak risk of 1 0 for march 27 confirming the reported outbreak between march 27 and 30 2010 while the model predicted a false positive outbreak for january 13 2010 with risk of 0 97 the overall performance of the gp model is reasonably good because the model correctly predicted all other reported norovirus outbreaks in the year 2010 and no false outbreaks were predicted the area under the receiver operating characteristic roc curve auc true positive and negative rates which are reliable measures for the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system gardner and greiner 2006 were used to evaluate the performance of the gp model roc curve can be constructed by plotting the true positive rate sensitivity against the false positive rate 100 specificity at various threshold settings fawcett 2006 fig 5a illustrates the roc curve for the training dataset an area of 1 0 means that the model performance is perfect while an area of 0 5 indicates that the model is useless the area under the roc curve auc in fig 5a is 0 86 the true positive rate sensitivity and the true negative rate specificity are 79 51 and 89 92 respectively 3 3 independent cross validation in order to further test the performance of the best gp model the model was utilized for the prediction of norovirus outbreaks with independent data collected from 2010 to 2014 which were not used in the model development and involved five reported norovirus outbreaks as shown in fig 4 a the model correctly predicted the reported norovirus outbreak in area 3 with high risks of 0 96 and 0 9 for march 20 and 21 2010 respectively the model also predicted a high risk of 0 88 for february 25 2010 it was possible that the reported outbreak might last over 3 weeks from february 25 march 21 2010 fig 4b shows norovirus outbreaks risks in 2012 in area 23 the louisiana department of health and hospitals dhh closed area 23 on tuesday may 8 2012 after 14 people consumed the oysters harvested from area 23 and became sick with norovirus all oysters harvested from april 26 may 8 2012 in area 23 were recalled it can be seen from fig 4b that the model correctly predicted the outbreak with the high risks of 0 95 0 90 0 90 and 0 93 for april 26 29 and 30 and may 2 respectively the dhh also ordered a recall of oysters harvested from december 28 2012 january 4 2013 in area 30 after nine people ate oysters harvested from area 30 and became sick with norovirus http dhh louisiana gov index cfm newsroom detail 2732 as shown in fig 4c the gp model predicted the high risks of 0 95 and 0 96 for december 28 2012 and january 2 2013 respectively in the reported outbreak period and for january 12 risk 0 93 after the reported period overall the model predictions were consistent with the reported outbreaks from 2012 2013 fig 4d shows norovirus outbreak risks from 2013 2014 in the copano bay texas the fda warned consumers not to eat raw or partially cooked shellfish harvested from the copano bay between december 26 2013 and january 9 2014 due to norovirus illnesses in louisiana http www fda gov newsevents newsroom pressannouncements ucm382247 htm fig 4d clearly indicates that the norovirus outbreak risks predicted with the gp model increased from about 0 1 to 1 0 on december 17 2013 and high risks 0 8 persisted until january 9 2014 in order to determine whether the model was overfitted the area under the roc curve auc true positive and negative rates for the independent datasets were also calculated and shown in fig 5b the auc the true positive rate and the true negative rate were 0 86 78 18 and 89 26 respectively moreover the overall performance of gp model for both training and independent validation datasets in terms of auc the true positive rate and the true negative rate were 0 86 78 53 and 88 82 respectively demonstrating the consistent performance of the gp model for both the training and the validation datasets 3 4 sensitivity analysis the result of the local sensitivity analysis is shown in fig 6 the vertical axis of fig 6 represents percent changes in individual environmental predictors from their average values and the horizontal axis indicates how the gp model responds to the change in an independent environmental predictor in terms of percent change in the model predicted oyster norovirus outbreak risk in terms of reduction negative change in the risk of oyster norovirus outbreaks shown in the left panel of fig 6 solar radiation is by far the most important environmental predictor as a 50 increase in solar radiation reduces the model predicted risk of oyster norovirus outbreak over four times 221 the risk reduction is achieved due to the solar inactivation of norovirus this finding may explain why oyster norovirus outbreaks rarely occur in the summer season due to the strong solar inactivation of norovirus therefore solar radiation is the primary sink of norovirus the negative percent changes outbreak risk reduction caused by other environmental predictors are negligible as compared with that caused by solar radiation in terms of elevated risk of oyster norovirus outbreaks shown in the right panel of fig 6 the low temperature is by far the most important environmental predictor as a 50 reduction in temperature increases the model predicted risk of oyster norovirus outbreaks over three times the low gage height is the second most important environmental predictor to oyster norovirus outbreaks followed by salinity and solar radiation the importance of wind and rainfall to oyster norovirus outbreaks is much smaller than other environmental predictors overall the local sensitivity analysis result indicates that norovirus outbreaks are controlled by the environmental conditions of low temperature low gage height and low solar radiation in combination with low salinity strong offshore wind and heavy rainfall the advantage of the local sensitivity analysis is that the effects of both positive and negative changes in individual environmental predictors on oyster norovirus outbreaks can be identified while the global sensitivity analysis is capable of taking account of the interaction among model input variables fig 7 shows the result of sobol global sensitivity analysis in terms of total sensitivity indices the figure indicates that the risk of model predicted oyster norovirus outbreaks is most sensitive to gage height and temperature this finding is consistent with that from the previous study of our research group wang and deng 2016 solar radiation is ranked as the third important environmental predictor to oyster norovirus outbreaks followed by wind salinity and rainfall overall the results from the local and global sensitivity analyses are consistent in terms of the most and least important environmental predictors specifically gage height temperature and solar radiation are the most important three predictors and wind salinity and rainfall are the least important three predictors to oyster norovirus outbreaks 4 discussion while the most likely source of oyster norovirus outbreaks is often pinpointed to human sewage exact causes of the outbreaks are rarely identified and reported it is essential to identify the causes behind the outbreaks and then develop predictive tools for mitigating the negative impact of the outbreaks the premier hypothesis of this study was that oyster norovirus outbreaks are primarily caused by certain environmental conditions the hypothesis was tested and confirmed in this study by identifying the environmental conditions and developing a gp based predictive model using environmental predictors describing the conditions gp was first utilized to develop functional relationships between norovirus outbreak risks and individual environmental predictors along with their various combinations while no single predictor was able to explain all historical norovirus outbreaks the functional relationship established using various combinations of solar radiation was found to be the most important explanatory relationship to predicting norovirus outbreaks and thus to the gp model the solar radiation was employed in this study as a predictor for the first time in the modeling of oyster norovirus outbreaks the importance of solar radiation is understandable since virus survival increases in cold temperature due to the reduction in the exposure to solar radiation westrell et al 2010 many studies also reported that high reduction in norovirus can be achieved when the uv intensity is high campos et al 2013 campos and lees 2014 in addition to the solar radiation water temperature and gage height were identified as the second third most influential predictors in both methods specifically low water temperature and low gage height were found to enhance the concentration of norovirus in oyster tissues and thus increase the risk of oyster norovirus outbreaks wang and deng 2016 when gage height is very low the water depth over oyster beds would be very shallow and the water temperature at the oyster bed level would be as low as the air temperature while the water temperature at oyster beds is commonly higher than the air temperature during cold seasons low temperature may cause the pores in oyster gills to contract reducing the pore size of oyster tissues and increasing the concentration of norovirus particles in oysters which are larger than the contracted pore size salinity wind and rainfall were less critical predictors to the oyster norovirus outbreaks based on both the local and the global sensitivity analysis methods however strong offshore wind and low salinity can enhance the resuspension of norovirus attached to fine sediment particles enhancing the concentration of norovirus in oyster tissues in addition low salinity was found to affect the persistence of norovirus in oyster harvest waters by enhancing virus binding to fine sediment particles maalouf et al 2010 rainfall runoff is a major source of norovirus contamination to oyster growing waters shamkhali chenar and deng 2017 although logistic regression and random forest methods achieved superior performance in some of previously published studies oliveira et al 2012 vorpahl et al 2012 results of the current study reveal that none of the methods exhibits distinct superiority over another one in spite of some similarities the two methods provided different sets of significant input variables for the same datasets therefore no single method can be considered as the best method for the selection of input variables rather a combination of rf and blr should be used for the selection of significant input variables the significant variables determined by gp suggest that the number of lag days that influence model based norovirus outbreaks may vary between 1 and 30 days depending on individual environmental predictors as shown in appendix a the result indicates that antecedent environmental conditions and the cumulative effects of the conditions before the onset of an outbreak control norovirus outbreaks the significance of this finding is that seafood safety monitoring programs could be improved by monitoring not only current environmental conditions but also the cumulative effects of antecedent environmental conditions this study also investigated whether the model performance could be improved if the mathematical functions such as sin cos natural logarithm and square root were used in addition to basic arithmetic operators while it was argued that using simple function sets would improve the model accuracy banzhaf et al 1998 jayawardena et al 2005 muttil and lee 2005 muttil and chau 2006 due to efficiency and creativity of gp in evolving equations by combining them the results of this study indicated that the incorporation of more mathematical functions could improve the performance of the gp evolved equations in terms of rmse overall the performance of the final gp evolved equation for both training and testing periods was satisfactory in terms of correct predictions of historical oyster norovirus outbreaks however there were some differences in the timing of the predicted versus reported outbreak dates in addition two model predicted outbreaks were significantly different from reported outbreaks in the timing and thus might be false positive outbreaks an advantage of the gp model over the artificial neural network ann models developed by the authors research group wang and deng 2016 chenar and deng 2017 is the explicit mathematical equations shown in appendix a which provide a direct relationship between norovirus epidemics and environmental predictors while data driven models with multiple explanatory variables may experience overfitting overfitting of the gp model was avoided by training and testing the model with two separate datasets including the training datasets and independent validation datasets from four different oysters growing waters area 3 23 30 in louisiana and copano bay in texas overfitted models are generally able to achieve a good fit to training data while they show a poor performance with independent testing data gonçalves et al 2012 other overfitting control measures such as using a large training sample size and random sampling were also adopted in this research to avoid model overfitting tuite et al 2011 gonçalves et al 2012 in order to determine whether the gp model is overtrained the three model performance metrics including auc true positive rate and true negative rate were calculated for the model training datasets and the model validation datasets separately the auc true positive rate and true negative rate were 0 86 79 51 and 89 92 respectively for the model training datasets and 0 86 78 18 and 89 26 respectively for the model validation datasets it is clear that the gp model performed consistently well with both datasets confirming that the gp model was not overtrained or overfitted 5 conclusions it is highly likely that oyster norovirus outbreaks will keep occurring it is therefore important to have predictive tools for reducing the risk of the outbreaks to human health and to the seafood industry a risk based gp model was developed for predicting norovirus outbreaks in oyster harvest areas along the northern gulf of mexico coast which is highly prone to norovirus epidemics based on the results of model predictions and sensitivity analyses the following conclusions can be drawn the primary cause of oyster norovirus outbreaks is favorable environmental conditions the environmental conditions in favor of norovirus outbreaks are characterized by low solar radiation low temperature low gage height low salinity heavy rainfall and strong offshore wind cumulative effects of antecedent environmental conditions play a more important role in triggering a norovirus outbreak than do the current environmental conditions the significance of this finding is that seafood safety monitoring programs could be improved by monitoring not only current environmental conditions but also the cumulative effects of antecedent environmental conditions the environmental conditions can be described with six independent environmental predictors and their time series ensembles the most significant environmental predictors to model predicted norovirus outbreaks are solar radiation gage height and water temperature wind salinity and rainfall are also important predictors to oyster norovirus outbreaks the solar radiation was found for the first time to be one of the most important environmental predictors based on local sensitivity analysis in fact solar radiation is the primary sink of norovirus specifically the solar uv radiation inactivates viruses by chemically modifying their dna and rna the six environmental predictors were selected by combining rf and blr methods although rf and blr had a similar performance each method produced different sets of significant input variables the combination of rf and blr approaches could beneficially contribute to the optimal model the cumulative effects of antecedent environmental conditions can be described with various time lagged combinations time series ensembles of the six independent environmental predictors the time lags could span anywhere from 1 day up to 30 days before the onset of an outbreak depending on individual environmental predictors the theoretical significance of this finding is that it provides a new insight into the process leading to a norovirus outbreak specifically a norovirus outbreak is triggered by a process in which favorable environmental conditions are naturally maintained for an extended period of time the gp model developed in this paper is an effective and efficient tool for predicting oyster norovirus outbreaks the area under the roc curve auc was 0 86 the true positive and negative rates were 78 53 and 88 82 respectively demonstrating the efficacy of the gp model in predicting the environmental conditions under which norovirus contamination of oysters is likely to occur as a result the risk of norovirus to human health and the economic losses of norovirus outbreaks to the shellfish industry could be significantly reduced a major advantage of the gp based norovirus prediction model over other models is that gp provides an explicit mathematical relationship between the norovirus epidemics and the environmental variables the explicit gp based norovirus model in conjunction with the sensitivity analyses provided new insights into the mechanisms underlying norovirus outbreaks in terms of source sink cause and predictors the gp model presented here was developed and tested with the data from the northern gulf of mexico the application of the gp model to oyster growing waters in other regions and countries may require additional validation and calibration of the model with local data and particularly some of the time lagged ensembles of the environmental predictors particularly rainfall

19867,previous studies have shown that the photodegradation of some pollutants induced by the excited triplet states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter 3cdom can be inhibited by back reduction processes carried out by phenolic antioxidants occurring in dissolved organic matter dom here for the first time to our knowledge we included such an inhibition effect into a photochemical model and applied the model predictions to sulfadiazine sdz a sulfonamide antibiotic that occurs in surface waters in two forms neutral hsdz and anionic sdz pka 6 5 the input parameters of the photochemical model were obtained by means of dedicated experiments which showed that the inhibition effect was more marked for sdz than for hsdz compared to the behavior of 2 4 6 trimethylphenol which does not undergo antioxidant inhibition when irradiated in natural water samples the back reduction effect on the degradation of sdz was proportional to the electron donating capacity of the dom according to the model results direct photolysis and oh reaction would account for the majority of both hsdz and sdz photodegradation in waters having low dissolved organic carbon doc 1 mgc l 1 with higher doc values 3 4 mgc l 1 and despite the back reduction processes the 3cdom reactions are expected to account for the majority of hsdz phototransformation in the case of sdz at high doc most of the photodegradation would be accounted for by direct photolysis the relative importance of the triplet sensitized phototransformation of both sdz and most importantly hsdz is expected to increase with increasing doc even in the presence of back reduction an increase in water ph favoring the occurrence of sdz with respect to hsdz would enhance direct photolysis at the expense of triplet sensitization sdz should be fairly photolabile under summertime sunlight with predicted half lives ranging from a few days to a couple of months depending on water conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords antioxidants sulfadiazine electron donating capacity dissolved organic matter environmental photochemistry 1 introduction sulfadiazine sdz is a sulfonamide antibiotic inhibiting the bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthase involved in the synthesis of folate that is an important growth factor for the bacterial cells madigan et al 2012 sdz is included in the world health organization who list of essential medicines who 2017 namely the most important medications needed in a basic health system it is used in the treatment of urinary tract infections toxoplasmosis malaria and against bacterial infections that may arise in the hiv disease nih 2017 sdz is metabolized in the human body with urinary excretion of the parent compound together with its hydroxylated sulfated and glucuronised derivatives vree et al 1995 sdz is partially removed but not completely eliminated from wastewater in wastewater treatment plants wwtps li and zhang 2011 huang et al 2016 the occurrence of sdz in wastewater treatment basins and wastewater effluents at μg l 1 levels gao et al 2012 vosough et al 2015 has the potential to induce sdz resistance in bacteria yuan et al 2014 in addition to wwtp effluents also the use of sdz in aquaculture and livestock breeding is an important sdz source to surface waters li et al 2016a sun et al 2016 due to the aforementioned sources sdz has been detected in surface waters at ng l 1 to sub μg l 1 levels chen et al 2013 giang et al 2015 li et al 2016b sakai et al 2016 although not among the most persistent sulfonamide antibiotics sdz has a biodegradation half life in river water of about 20 30 days adamek et al 2016 this compound can also undergo photodegradation by direct and indirect photochemistry diaz et al 2004 boreen et al 2005 bahnmüller et al 2014 and photodegradation has been shown to affect significantly its overall fate giang et al 2015 moreover it has been shown that sdz biodegradation can be accelerated by sdz photolysis intermediates pan et al 2014 the direct photodegradation of sdz has been found to be faster at higher ph bian and zhang 2016 and to be affected by the formation of complexes with dissolved fe iii although the importance of the latter pathway at the fe iii levels that naturally occur in surface waters is still uncertain zhang and ma 2013 batista et al 2014 the ph effect on photolysis is likely accounted for by the fact that sdz is a weak acid with pka 6 5 lin et al 1997 sanli et al 2010 therefore the occurrence of both the undissociated form and the anionic one hereafter hsdz and sdz respectively should be taken into account when modeling the environmental fate of sdz vide infra direct photolysis and indirect photoreactions with oh and the triplet states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter 3cdom account for the majority of sdz phototransformation in most surface water conditions boreen et al 2005 bahnmüller et al 2014 among these photoreaction pathways the direct photolysis occurs when a pollutant absorbs sunlight boreen et al 2003 in the case of indirect photochemistry the irradiation of chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom mainly yields 3cdom 1o2 and oh the radical oh is also produced by irradiation of nitrate and nitrite the radical oh occurs at a higher extent in shallow and low doc waters while the 3cdom and 1o2 reactions tend to prevail in high doc and deep environments vione et al 2014 cory et al 2009 wenk et al 2013 bianco et al 2015 minella et al 2016 the photochemical modeling of sdz phototransformation which is one of the goals of the present work is enabled by the literature availability of the direct photolysis quantum yields and of the reaction rate constants with oh and 1o2 boreen et al 2005 moreover the second order rate constants for the quenching of the triplet state of 4 carboxybenzophenone 3cbbp by hsdz and sdz have been measured recently by li et al 2015 cbbp is a suitable proxy for cdom as there is evidence that the 3cbbp reactivity is quite close to that of 3cdom avetta et al 2016 the triplet quenching rate constants are here assumed to be close to the rate constants of hsdz sdz transformation induced by 3cbbp and therefore to the rate constants of transformation by 3cdom the reaction between sdz and 3cdom is not a straightforward process however because of the occurrence of back reduction phenomena wenk and canonica 2012 wenk et al 2015 indeed the dissolved organic matter dom that occurs in natural waters comprises both photoactive moieties cdom and antioxidant groups e g phenolic moieties the 3cdom species are oxidants usually involved in one electron or h atom abstraction from dissolved substrates including the xenobiotics producing oxidized transformation intermediates the oxidized intermediates can undergo further reactions finally resulting in xenobiotic transformation in alternative they could also interact with easily oxidizable dom moieties to undergo back reduction and produce again the original xenobiotic sdz is among the xenobiotics that undergo the back reduction phenomenon which causes an inhibition of triplet sensitized degradation canonica and laubscher 2008 wenk and canonica 2012 back reduction processes have been described in the laboratory and they have the potential to inhibit the phototransformation of compounds such as sdz in deep and dom rich waters deep water columns are out of reach for laboratory experiments but they are accessible to photochemical modeling bodrato and vione 2014 to this purpose this paper has the goal of assessing the impact of back reduction under conditions that are representative of surface waters for instance high doc conditions would increase both the steady state 3cdom and the back reduction effect mcneill and canonica 2016 with an overall outcome on the importance of triplet sensitized phototransformation that is still to be assessed to do so however one needs additional experimental data the effect of antioxidants on the triplet sensitized degradation of sdz is presently available for a single ph value and with a model sensitizer that is different from 4 carboxybenzophenone in this paper we i study the back reduction process for both hsdz and sdz in synthetic solutions ii irradiate sdz in natural water samples to get insight into the antioxidant effect in shallow water iii verify that the observed trends can be reproduced by photochemical modeling and iv extrapolate the model predictions to deeper water columns we compare the sdz results with those obtained with 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp under similar conditions tmp is a compound for which photodegradation in natural water is mainly triggered by 3cdom the tmp direct photolysis and reactions with oh and 1o2 are only minor processes al housari et al 2010 de laurentiis et al 2012 moreover differently from sdz tmp does not undergo back reduction in the presence of dom antioxidants canonica and laubsher 2008 wenk et al 2015 2

were collected in the piedmont region nw italy grab sampling was carried out with 1 l pyrex glass bottles from the shore of four lakes avigliana maggiore candia and viverone and two paddy fields santhià and san germano vercellese the water samples were transported under refrigeration to the laboratory vacuum filtered using cellulose acetate filter membranes sartorius 47 mm diameter 0 45 μm pore size and stored under refrigeration till use or analysis 2 2 irradiation experiments the solutions to be irradiated 20 ml total volume were introduced in quartz tubes that were then closed with glass stoppers when required the ph of the irradiated solutions was adjusted by addition of a phosphate buffer solution final concentration of phosphate 5 mm the tubes were placed in a dema hans mangels gmbh bornhein roisdorf germany model 125 merry go round photoreactor equipped with a heraeus noblelight tq718 medium pressure mercury lamp operated at 500 w and a borosilicate glass cooling jacket the used apparatus can irradiate up to nine tubes at the same time a 0 15 m nano3 solution passed through a lauda rk 20 cooling thermostat was used as a water bath to keep the irradiated tubes at a temperature of 25 0 0 5 c and to remove lamp radiation of wavelength 320 nm the latter condition was employed to minimize the direct photolysis of sdz the photolysis of nitrate yields nitrite that absorbs radiation at longer wavelengths mack and bolton 1999 and might modify the filter transmittance therefore the stability over time of the filter solution was monitored by measuring its transmittance at 360 nm and by checking that it was above 85 for the effective optical path length of 3 cm the irradiation intensity in the quartz tubes was checked by chemical actinometry using an aqueous solution of 4 nitroanisole 5 μm and pyridine 10 mm dulin and mill 1982 and it was estimated to vary by 7 over the whole series of irradiation experiments at scheduled irradiation times 0 5 ml sample aliquots were withdrawn from each tube placed in hplc vials and kept refrigerated until analysis 2 3 analytical determinations the time trends of sdz and tmp were monitored by high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection hplc dad the used instrument was an agilent 1100 chromatograph pc controlled with a chromeleon 7 chromatography data system software the column used was a reverse phase cosmosil 5 c18 ms ii 100 mm 3 mm 5 μm kept at 25 c in the column oven sdz was eluted at 0 7 ml min 1 flow rate with a 90 a 10 b mixture of a aqueous h3po4 at ph 2 1 and b acetonitrile with retention time t r of 2 7 min and detection at 267 nm tmp was eluted with 50 a 50 b with t r 3 0 min and detection at 210 nm in most experiments the time trend of tmp and of sdz was fitted with an exponential function of the form c t c o e k t where c t is the substrate concentration at the time t c o the initial concentration and k the pseudo first order degradation rate constant the initial transformation rate was obtained as r k c o in some experiments i e in the case of sdz irradiated in natural water the time trend was observed to deviate from a pure pseudo first order kinetics in these cases data fitting was performed using an exponential trend with a residual c t a e k t b where a and b are free floating fit parameters and the initial transformation rate is given by r k c o a a b 1 such a deviation from pseudo first order is expected to arise from aging of the irradiated solutions possibly due to cdom photobleaching reversible formation of photolysis products as well as changes in the antioxidant capacity of the solutions the natural water samples were characterized for the absorption spectra and the content of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon doc and dic respectively the doc and dic values were measured by catalytic wet oxidation and by acidification plus gas stripping respectively followed by non dispersive ir detection the used instrument was a shimadzu toc vcsh analyzer equipped with an asi v autosampler further details concerning the analytical procedures are reported elsewhere carena et al 2017 the results of these determinations are reported in table sm1 in the supplementary material hereafter sm the doc of our lake water samples taken near the shore and potentially affected by terrestrial organic matter was often higher than typical values obtained in the center of the lake especially in the case of lago maggiore bertoni et al 2010 absorption spectra were taken with an agilent technologies cary 100 double beam uv visible spectrophotometer using 1 cm quartz cuvettes and 5 cm ones in the case of lake and paddy water the absorption spectra of hsdz and sdz are reported in fig sm1 sm those of the

632 ph meter the electron donating capacity edc of the lake and paddy waters expressed in molar concentration units was determined employing the recently developed size exclusion chromatographic sec method which uses a post column reaction with the stable radical anion of 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts chon et al 2015 briefly samples of the waters 2 5 ml were injected in a dionex ultimate 3000 hplc system thermoscientific sunnyvale ca usa equipped with a quaternary pump low pressure mixing an autosampler a thermostated column compartment a photodiode array uv vis absorbance detector pad and a variable wavelength uv vis absorbance detector vwd chromatography was performed on a toyopearl hw 50s column 8 300 mm 30 μm grace davison product from bgb boeckten switzerland using a 50 mm borate buffer as the eluent at a flow rate of 0 2 ml min 1 after the pad which recorded the absorbance signal at 254 nm after the exit of the column the outflow was mixed with the reagent an abts solution that was delivered at a flow rate of 0 04 ml min 1 using a dionex pc 10 system the mixture then passed a 750 μl knitted reaction coil dionex and the vwd set to record absorbance at 405 nm quantification of the edc was performed by integrating the negative peak of decreased abts absorbance as detailed elsewhere chon et al 2015 2 4 photochemical modeling the model assessment of sdz photodegradation was carried out with the apex software aqueous photochemistry of environmentally occurring xenobiotics available for free as electronic supplementary information of bodrato and vione 2014 apex predicts photochemical reaction kinetics from photoreactivity parameters absorption spectra direct photolysis quantum yields and second order reaction rate constants with transient species and from data of water chemistry and depth bodrato and vione 2014 vione 2014 apex predictions have been validated by comparison with field data of pollutant phototransformation kinetics in surface freshwaters see for instance maddigapu et al 2011 marchetti et al 2013 bodrato and vione 2014 apex uses a fair weather summertime solar spectrum at mid latitude see figure sm1 in the sm frank and klöpffer 1988 sunlight irradiance is not constant in the natural environment due to fluctuations in meteorological conditions not included in apex and of diurnal and seasonal cycles to allow easier comparison between model results and environmental conditions apex uses as time unit a 24 h summer sunny day ssd equivalent to fair weather 15 july at 45 n latitude which takes the day night cycle into account the absorption of radiation by the photosensitizers cdom nitrate and nitrite and the target substrate is calculated based on competition for sunlight irradiance in a lambert beer approach bodrato and vione 2014 braslavsky 2007 apex applies to well mixed waters and gives average values over the water column which includes the contributions of the well illuminated surface layer and of darker water in the lower depths where irradiance is very low loiselle et al 2008 in the case of sdz literature data were used for the direct photolysis quantum yields and for the second order reaction rate constants with oh and 1o2 see table 1 boreen et al 2005 while separate photolysis quantum yields are reported for the two forms hsdz and sdz no separate oh and 1o2 rate constant values are available in the case of 1o2 this is a minor problem because the reaction plays a negligible role in sdz phototransformation vide infra similar reaction rate constants between sdz and oh have been measured at presumably acidic ph fenton reaction and at ph around 8 h2o2 photolysis where there is prevalence of hsdz and sdz respectively boreen et al 2005 baeza and knappe 2011 moreover successful modeling of sdz phototransformation by oh in the h2o2 uv process has been carried out with a single reaction rate constant in the ph range from 6 5 comparable values of hsdz and sdz to 8 4 strong prevalence of sdz wols et al 2014 as far as the triplet sensitized transformation is concerned the reported second order quenching constants of hsdz and sdz with the triplet state of 4 carboxybenzophenone 3cbbp li et al 2015 were taken as representative of the corresponding 3cdom rate constants this procedure has been recently shown to be appropriate in the cases of diclofenac naproxen and clofibric acid avetta et al 2016 triplet sensitized degradation is triggered by reaction between sdz and 3cdom boreen et al 2005 and it is inhibited by dom antioxidant moieties canonica and laubscher 2008 wenk and canonica 2012 bahnmüller et al 2014 wenk et al 2015 this effect is not due to a decrease of the rate of the primary reaction but rather to the back reduction of partially oxidized sdz to the parent compound such an observation can be summarized by the following equation 1 k sdz ao ψ k sdz where k sdz ao is the pseudo first order rate constant of sdz transformation either hsdz or sdz triggered by 3cdom or a surrogate of it e g 3cbbp in the presence of phenolic antioxidants ao k sdz is the pseudo first order rate constant without antioxidants and ψ 1 is the ratio of the two rate constants because the triplet sensitization process is a bimolecular reaction between sdz and 3cdom and because 3cdom is in steady state conditions canonica et al 2005 boreen et al 2005 one has k sdz k sdz 3 cdom 3cdom where k sdz 3 cdom is the second order reaction rate constant between sdz and 3cdom in the presence of antioxidant molecules the back reduction processes decrease the apparent degradation rate of sdz to enable this antioxidant effect to be taken into account within apex the second order reaction rate constant for sdz transformation was modified into an apparent rate constant k sdz 3 cdom ao that is lower than the actual one measured in the absence of antioxidants one has 2 k sdz ao ψ k sdz ψ k sdz 3 cdom 3 cdom k sdz 3 cdom ao 3 cdom from which one gets that k sdz 3 cdom ao ψ k sdz 3 cdom in this way the antioxidant effect on the degradation kinetics is seen as an apparent decrease of the second order reaction rate constant at equal 3cdom this is reasonable because under conditions that are significant for surface water bodies dissolved organic compounds including dom antioxidants are usually unable to quench a significant fraction of the photogenerated triplet states therefore dom does not affect the steady state 3cdom significantly wenk et al 2013 finally the apex modeling returns also the steady state 3cdom for given water conditions and water depth referred to a standard sunlight spectrum that corresponds to 22 w m 2 uv irradiance bodrato and vione 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 triplet sensitized sdz photodegradation effect of phenol as model antioxidant our first goal was the quantification of the antioxidant effect on the triplet sensitized degradation of sdz the two sdz forms acidic hsdz and basic sdz are known to react with 3cbbp to produce oxidation intermediates that may further react to yield transformation products to assess the possible effect of back reduction on this reaction we chose phenol as model antioxidant based on the fact that phenol is degraded by direct reaction with 3cbbp at a lesser extent than other model antioxidants including 4 methylphenol canonica and laubscher 2008 because both 3cbbp quenching and the back reduction of partially oxidized sdz are able to inhibit sdz photodegradation the use of phenol minimizes the quenching process and should allow the back reduction to be highlighted the possible consumption of 3cbbp by phenol was assessed by considering the 3cbbp decay kinetics k 3 cbbp 6 105 s 1 in aerated solution de laurentiis et al 2013 and an upper limit for the rate constant of 3cbbp quenching by phenol k 5 109 m 1 s 1 which is a typical upper limit for most triplet sensitized reactions mcneill and canonica 2016 considering that hsdz has pka 6 5 lin et al 1997 sanli et al 2010 and the carboxylic group of cbbp has pka 4 5 nist 2004 the hsdz experiments were carried out at ph 5 5 to have most sdz in the protonated form and most cbbp in the deprotonated one in contrast the sdz experiments were carried out at ph 8 5 where cbbp is deprotonated as well ph was adjusted with a phosphate buffer in both cases fig 2 a reports the time trend of 5 μm sdz in the presence of 40 μm cbbp at ph 5 5 with different concentration values of phenol 10 μm to minimize 3cbbp quenching the time trend of hsdz direct photolysis is also reported on the graph showing that the direct photolysis d p process was practically negligible no reliable direct photolysis quantum yield could be inferred from these data the insert in the figure shows the measured first order rate constants of hsdz degradation k hsdz as a function of phenol concentration together with the expected effect of phenol if it only acted as 3cbbp quencher which appears to be a minor process the observed experimental trend of k hsdz could be fitted well with equation 3 this equation is analogous to the equations derived in previous studies of the inhibitory effect of dom and model antioxidants on the excited triplet induced transformation of organic contaminants canonica and laubscher 2008 wenk et al 2011 wenk and canonica 2012 3 k hsdz k hsdz o 1 1 phenol phenol 1 2 where k hsdz o is the pseudo first order rate constant of hsdz degradation in the absence of phenol and phenol 1 2 19 5 2 5 μm is the phenol concentration that halves the observed degradation rate constant hereafter error bounds represent standard errors note that ψ 1 1 phenol phenol 1 2 see the definition of ψ in equation 1 the underlying concept of equation 3 is explained in the introduction fig 2b reports the time trend of 5 μm sdz in the presence of 40 μm cbbp at ph 8 5 with different phenol concentrations the direct photolysis of sdz also reported in the diagram was slow but its rate constants could be quantified by applying previously described actinometric methods canonica et al 2008 and using the spectral data of the filtered tq718 lamp leresche et al 2016 a direct photolysis quantum yield of 1 0 0 1 10 3 was determined which is close to that known from literature see boreen et al 2005 and table 1 the figure insert reports k sdz vs phenol as well as the expected effect of 3cbbp quenching by phenol itself a comparison between fig 2b and fig 2a suggests that the inhibitory effect of phenol was more marked in the case of sdz compared to hsdz the numerical fit of the k sdz vs phenol data with the equivalent of equation 3 obtained by replacing the hsdz labels with sdz yielded phenol 1 2 0 86 0 10 μm the different effects of phenol at the two investigated ph values might be accounted for by two phenomena i phenol has pka 10 nist 2004 and the fraction of phenolate at ph 8 5 is 103 times higher than at ph 5 5 phenolate is a stronger reducing agent compared to phenol wardman 1989 thus it can be reasonable that its antioxidant action is more effective interestingly humic substances have been shown to have an increasing antioxidant action expressed as edc with increasing ph aeschbacher et al 2012 which might be accounted for by the occurrence of phenolate anions at the higher ph values ii the radical species derived from the triplet sensitized oxidation of hsdz and sdz are probably different but they can undergo an acid base equilibrium in a similar way as the parent compounds tentscher et al 2013 4 hsdz sdz h 5 3cbbp hsdz cbbp hsdz 6 3cbbp sdz cbbp sdz 7 hsdz sdz h however it is not known whether these acid base reactions occur on a similar time scale as other transformation recombination processes relevant for the degradation of sdz the very different effects of phenol at ph 5 5 and 8 5 would suggest that the radical species of sdz do not interconvert quickly 3 2 photodegradation of sdz in natural water samples sdz was spiked to the six studied natural water samples to reach an initial concentration of 5 μm and these systems were then irradiated for up to 4 5 h two blank runs direct photolysis were also carried out at ph 5 5 hsdz and 8 5 sdz the ph values of natural water were included in the 7 8 range thereby ensuring a prevalence of sdz fully comparable irradiation experiments were carried out with 5 μm tmp which undergoes triplet sensitized oxidation with similar rate constant as sdz but does not undergo back reduction upon reaction with antioxidants canonica and laubscher 2008 wenk et al 2015 in the case of tmp 3 h irradiation was enough to attain complete photodegradation in all the natural waters except for lago maggiore m fig 3 a reports the initial degradation rates of tmp and sdz r tmp and r sdz respectively observed in the different cases the lake water samples are shown in order of increasing doc note that s santhià and sg s germano vercellese represent paddy water samples the doc values of which were intermediate between those of candia c and viverone v the direct photolysis of tmp and sdz was practically negligible except for sdz at ph 8 5 sdz the faster direct photolysis of sdz compared to hsdz is consistent with previous reports bian and zhang 2016 but the rate of sdz direct photolysis was much lower than the photodegradation rate we observed in natural water samples therefore the photodegradation of sdz in our natural water samples under our irradiation conditions should mainly take place by indirect photochemistry the photodegradation of tmp was particularly effective in paddy water in the case of lake water the tmp transformation rate increased with increasing doc as can be expected for a process that involves 3cdom but is not affected by back reduction canonica and laubscher 2008 bodhipaksha et al 2015 compared to tmp the phototransformation kinetics of sdz showed a much less marked dependence on the doc of either lake or paddy water similar results have already been reported in the case of sdz irradiated in river water bahnmüller et al 2014 paddy water had no peculiarly high doc when compared to the investigated lake water but it had higher absorbance see fig 1 interestingly the plot of r tmp vs the 300 nm absorbance of natural water a 1 300 nm see fig 3b yielded a reasonably straight line it is suggested that the kinetics of tmp photodegradation with respect to the amount of absorbed radiation were very similar in all the studied natural water samples in contrast r sdz reached a plateau already at relatively low values of a 1 300 nm the rationale for taking the water absorbance into account is that cdom is both the 3cdom source and the main light absorbing species in natural waters between 300 and 500 nm loiselle et al 2008 the present finding concerning r tmp vs a 1 300 nm is consistent with a previous report that the quantum yield of 3cdom photogeneration was comparable in paddy and lake water carena et al 2017 tmp at the used initial concentration 5 μm would carry out a minor quenching of 3cdom canonica and freiburghaus 2001 this issue allows for the use of the relationship r tmp k tmp 3 cdom tmp 3cdom to derive a 3cdom value that would be valid in the absence of tmp as well thus by assuming k tmp 3 cdom 3 109 m 1 s 1 al housari et al 2010 the 3cdom values that are reported in the right y axis of fig 3b were obtained as 3cdom r tmp tmp 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 differently from tmp sdz could undergo different transformation processes including the direct photolysis as well as the reactions with oh and 3cdom however the 0 15 m nitrate solution used to filter lamp radiation would largely reduce the photon flux absorbed by both sdz and nitrate in the samples thereby minimizing both direct photolysis and oh reactions as a consequence the primary reaction between sdz and 3cdom is potentially important in sdz degradation but the overall process would be inhibited by the back reactions between oxidized sdz and dom antioxidants canonica and laubscher 2008 wenk et al 2015 it is possible to assess the importance of the sdz back reactions in the irradiated samples by comparing the ratio of the degradation rates of tmp and sdz r tmp r sdz 1 with the electron donating capacity of the samples edc units of μmol e l 1 see table sm1 the edc parameter measures the molar concentration of dom antioxidants considering that sdz undergoes back reactions with dom antioxidants while tmp does not wenk et al 2015 the higher is the edc the higher is expected to be the r tmp r sdz 1 ratio if tmp and sdz mostly react with 3cdom fig 3c reports the correlation plot between r tmp r sdz 1 and the measured edc which suggests a very good linear trend interestingly the paddy fields showed higher values of edc per unit doc compared to lake water the reason is possibly linked to the fact that the biological processing of dom in paddy water is so high that the organic matter is renewed very quickly and has little time to undergo photochemical oxidation carena et al 2017 3 3 modeling of sdz phototransformation 3 3 1 model validation as already mentioned to model the effect of dom antioxidant moieties on the triplet sensitized degradation of sdz either hsdz or sdz it was assumed a decrease of the relevant second order reaction rate constants we used k sdz 3 cdom ao ψ k sdz 3 cdom with ψ 1 phenol phenol 1 2 1 1 as per equation 3 the main difficulty with this approach is that the natural dom contains phenolic compounds among other functionalities but it is not only made up of phenols the phenolic content of specific dom samples is known ritchie and perdue 2003 but one should make the additional hypothesis that natural dom phenols have the same or similar antioxidant effect as the phenol molecule fortunately the antioxidant effect of phenol has been compared with that of suwannee river fulvic acids srfa and of pony lake fulvic acids plfa in the case of the triplet sensitized transformation of n n dimethyl 4 cyanoaniline leresche et al 2016 the substrate degradation rate was halved in the presence of phenol 1 2 3 7 μmol l 1 of dom 1 2 3 2 mgc l 1 plfa or of dom 1 2 1 5 mgc l 1 srfa these concentration values allow for the determination of the phenol antioxidant equivalents of plfa and srfa thus the value of phenol 1 2 19 μmol l 1 we obtained for hsdz would correspond to dom 1 2 17 mgc l 1 plfa or to 8 mgc l 1 srfa similarly the value of phenol 1 2 0 9 μmol l 1 we obtained for sdz would correspond to dom 1 2 0 7 mgc l 1 plfa or to 0 3 mgc l 1 srfa we used these dom 1 2 values for the modeling of hsdz and sdz phototransformation assuming ψ 1 d o c d o m 1 2 1 1 it should be noted here that humic substances such as plfa and srfa are not the only dom components with phenolic moieties or antioxidant behavior other examples include for instance the tyrosine groups of peptides coble 1996 thus the degree by which plfa or srfa are representative of the antioxidant dom moieties has to be assessed anyway in addition to being the only substances with available dom 1 2 data these humic compounds make a reasonable choice because srfa is routinely used in the quality control of edc measurements chon et al 2015 moreover the fluorescence spectra of the paddy water samples used in our irradiation experiments have shown a strong prevalence of humic substances compared to proteins carena et al 2017 the apex software uses a standard sunlight spectrum for modeling under which conditions it is well known that sdz undergoes significant direct photolysis bahnmüller et al 2014 in contrast our irradiation set up was chosen to highlight only the triplet sensitized phototransformation of sdz therefore the validation of model predictions with the experimental data was carried out by considering the predicted sdz phototransformation kinetics accounted for by 3cdom alone to avoid problems linked with the different irradiation sources we used the steady state 3cdom to achieve a normalization between experimental data and model predictions the experimental 3cdom values are those obtained from the tmp phototransformation kinetics and they are reported in fig 3b the corresponding predicted values of 3cdom were obtained by adjusting the model parameters and by varying the input doc so that the modeled 3cdom values matched the experimental ones note that for short optical path lengths in the model it was used a water depth d 1 cm that is close to the optical path length of the experiments there is a direct proportionality between 3cdom and doc the match was carried out so that the model predicted 3cdom 5 10 13 m for doc 10 mgc l 1 this is not far from the doc values of the paddy water samples that yielded the highest experimental 3cdom finally because apex returns first order rate constants and not initial transformation rates the predicted rate constants were transformed into s 1 units and multiplied by sdz o 5 μm to get the predicted initial rates r sdz the experimental r sdz data reported in fig 4 a b are the same as those of fig 3b including the same meaning for open and solid symbols in repeated experiments but they are plotted as a function of the experimental 3cdom because two tmp degradation replicas were carried out for each condition the used 3cdom is the average of the values obtained in both sets of experiments in fig 4a the experimental data are compared with the model predictions in the plfa like scenario for hsdz dom 1 2 17 mgc l 1 for sdz dom 1 2 0 7 mgc l 1 and for a mixture containing 30 hsdz 70 sdz such a mixture would be observed at ph 7 in the case of the mixture one finds a reasonable agreement between model predictions and experimental data in fig 4b the same comparison is made in the srfa like scenario dom 1 2 8 mgc l 1 for hsdz and 0 3 mgc l 1 for sdz where the impact of back reduction is considerably higher than for plfa the mixture of 30 hsdz 70 sdz did not match the experimental data as well as in the previous case a better match with the experiments would be obtained with 50 hsdz 50 sdz but that would imply ph 6 5 that is not really compatible with the ph values of the studied water samples see sm in summary the plfa like scenario gave a somewhat better match with the experimental data than the srfa like scenario 3 3 2 modeling of sdz photodegradation under conditions representative of natural waters thus far only the reaction between sdz and 3cdom was modeled to allow for a comparison with the irradiation experiments by taking into account all the main phototransformation processes see table 1 for the relevant kinetic parameters one obtains the results reported in fig 5 these results should give insight into the actual behavior of sdz in natural waters fig 5a reports the modeled fractions of sdz transformation accounted for by the different photoreactions as a function of ph for a water depth d 5 m and doc 3 mgc l 1 when ph increases one has an increasing percentage of sdz with respect to hsdz pk a 6 5 moreover hsdz and sdz have similar phototransformation rate constants for doc 3 mgc l 1 vide infra the plot shows that the 3cdom process would prevail in the case of hsdz and that it would be gradually replaced by the direct photolysis as the sdz fraction gets higher in either case the oh reaction would only play a secondary role note that these conclusions are obtained for the plfa like scenario but very similar results apply to the srfa like case as well fig 5b reports the predicted half lives of hsdz and sdz in the plfa like and srfa like scenarios as a function of the doc for d 5 m the predicted half lives increase with increasing doc and also depending on the sdz form and the modeled scenario they vary from some days to several weeks similar transformation kinetics are predicted for hsdz and sdz at doc 2 3 mgc l 1 with very few differences between the srfa like and the plfa like scenarios at lower doc one expects the phototransformation of sdz to be slightly faster than that of hsdz while the reverse happens at higher doc in particular for doc 10 mgc l 1 the phototransformation of hsdz would be considerably faster than that of sdz in these doc conditions the predicted half lives are expected to significantly increase and the relevant rate constants to correspondingly decrease with increasing ph the steady state 3cdom increases with increasing doc while other processes such as direct photolysis and oh reactions are inhibited in high doc waters vione et al 2014 increasing doc would on the one side enhance the primary reaction of sdz with 3cdom but on the other hand it would also enhance back reduction it is interesting to see the expected impact of these two contrasting effects on the importance of 3cdom in the photodegradation of hsdz and sdz as the doc increases the plots shown in fig 5c f report as a function of the doc and for water depth d 5 m the modeled fractions of hsdz or sdz that undergo transformation via the different photoreaction pathways in the srfa like and plfa like scenarios the oh process undergoes the highest inhibition with increasing doc due to the scavenging of oh by dom vione et al 2014 the direct photolysis is also inhibited with increasing doc due to competition between hsdz sdz and cdom for sunlight irradiance however the direct photolysis undergoes lesser inhibition compared to the oh reaction which accounts for the trend with a maximum of the direct photolysis fraction as a function of the doc very interestingly the relative importance of the 3cdom process is predicted to increase with the doc in all the investigated scenarios including the srfa like case with sdz this is the scenario where the impact of back reduction is expected to be the highest to explain the above finding one should consider that the kinetics of all the processes are slowed down when the doc is high the oh reaction is inhibited by dom scavenging while cdom inhibits the direct photolysis by competition for irradiance the combination of cdom absorption saturation and back reduction slows down the degradation induced by 3cdom but to a lesser extent compared to the other two pathways as a result even in the presence of the antioxidant induced reduction process the relative importance of triplet sensitized degradation is predicted to increase with increasing doc 4 conclusions phenolic antioxidants are able to inhibit the triplet sensitized degradation of sdz the inhibition effect can be assessed in the laboratory by using model phenolic compounds phenol in the present case provided that they do not significantly quench the photogenerated triplet states the use of the equivalent anti oxidant behavior of srfa or plfa was here shown to be appropriate to extrapolate the laboratory results to the behavior of dom in natural water samples the plfa like case allowed for a better agreement with the experimental data the inhibition effect of phenol was more marked with the anionic form sdz than with the neutral one hsdz the extent of the inhibition was directly proportional to the electron donating capacity of the water sample therefore at least for short optical path lengths that are typical of laboratory irradiation set ups the kinetics of sdz phototransformation was poorly dependent on the amount of c dom in the studied water samples in sunlit surface waters direct photolysis and oh reaction are expected to account for the majority of the photodegradation of both hsdz and sdz if the doc is low 1 mgc l 1 with higher doc 3 4 mgc l 1 and despite the back reduction processes the 3cdom reactions would account for the majority of hsdz phototransformation in the case of sdz at high doc the direct photolysis would be the main phototransformation process interestingly although the 3cdom reactions are secondary processes for sdz in natural water settings their relative importance is expected to increase with increasing doc despite the considerable back reduction phenomenon back reduction is observed with several compounds and particularly with those having amine or sulfonamide groups canonica and laubscher 2008 davis et al 2017 our findings suggest that for many xenobiotics undergoing back reduction the process inhibition by dom would not prevent triplet sensitization from gaining importance with increasing doc in several cases the 3cdom reaction could still become the main photoprocess in dom rich i e high doc waters an increase in water ph shifts the prevailing sdz form from hsdz to sdz and it would enhance the direct photolysis at the expense of triplet sensitization when taking into account the possible variations of surface water conditions sdz is expected to be fairly photolabile under summertime sunlight the photochemical half lives would range from a few days to a couple of months which in many cases would successfully compete with the biodegradation kinetics to extend this study to other compounds it is necessary to know or measure their reaction rate constants with a reactive triplet state e g 3cbbp and to assess the values of phenol 1 2 or dom 1 2 under conditions of triplet

19867,previous studies have shown that the photodegradation of some pollutants induced by the excited triplet states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter 3cdom can be inhibited by back reduction processes carried out by phenolic antioxidants occurring in dissolved organic matter dom here for the first time to our knowledge we included such an inhibition effect into a photochemical model and applied the model predictions to sulfadiazine sdz a sulfonamide antibiotic that occurs in surface waters in two forms neutral hsdz and anionic sdz pka 6 5 the input parameters of the photochemical model were obtained by means of dedicated experiments which showed that the inhibition effect was more marked for sdz than for hsdz compared to the behavior of 2 4 6 trimethylphenol which does not undergo antioxidant inhibition when irradiated in natural water samples the back reduction effect on the degradation of sdz was proportional to the electron donating capacity of the dom according to the model results direct photolysis and oh reaction would account for the majority of both hsdz and sdz photodegradation in waters having low dissolved organic carbon doc 1 mgc l 1 with higher doc values 3 4 mgc l 1 and despite the back reduction processes the 3cdom reactions are expected to account for the majority of hsdz phototransformation in the case of sdz at high doc most of the photodegradation would be accounted for by direct photolysis the relative importance of the triplet sensitized phototransformation of both sdz and most importantly hsdz is expected to increase with increasing doc even in the presence of back reduction an increase in water ph favoring the occurrence of sdz with respect to hsdz would enhance direct photolysis at the expense of triplet sensitization sdz should be fairly photolabile under summertime sunlight with predicted half lives ranging from a few days to a couple of months depending on water conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords antioxidants sulfadiazine electron donating capacity dissolved organic matter environmental photochemistry 1 introduction sulfadiazine sdz is a sulfonamide antibiotic inhibiting the bacterial enzyme dihydropteroate synthase involved in the synthesis of folate that is an important growth factor for the bacterial cells madigan et al 2012 sdz is included in the world health organization who list of essential medicines who 2017 namely the most important medications needed in a basic health system it is used in the treatment of urinary tract infections toxoplasmosis malaria and against bacterial infections that may arise in the hiv disease nih 2017 sdz is metabolized in the human body with urinary excretion of the parent compound together with its hydroxylated sulfated and glucuronised derivatives vree et al 1995 sdz is partially removed but not completely eliminated from wastewater in wastewater treatment plants wwtps li and zhang 2011 huang et al 2016 the occurrence of sdz in wastewater treatment basins and wastewater effluents at μg l 1 levels gao et al 2012 vosough et al 2015 has the potential to induce sdz resistance in bacteria yuan et al 2014 in addition to wwtp effluents also the use of sdz in aquaculture and livestock breeding is an important sdz source to surface waters li et al 2016a sun et al 2016 due to the aforementioned sources sdz has been detected in surface waters at ng l 1 to sub μg l 1 levels chen et al 2013 giang et al 2015 li et al 2016b sakai et al 2016 although not among the most persistent sulfonamide antibiotics sdz has a biodegradation half life in river water of about 20 30 days adamek et al 2016 this compound can also undergo photodegradation by direct and indirect photochemistry diaz et al 2004 boreen et al 2005 bahnmüller et al 2014 and photodegradation has been shown to affect significantly its overall fate giang et al 2015 moreover it has been shown that sdz biodegradation can be accelerated by sdz photolysis intermediates pan et al 2014 the direct photodegradation of sdz has been found to be faster at higher ph bian and zhang 2016 and to be affected by the formation of complexes with dissolved fe iii although the importance of the latter pathway at the fe iii levels that naturally occur in surface waters is still uncertain zhang and ma 2013 batista et al 2014 the ph effect on photolysis is likely accounted for by the fact that sdz is a weak acid with pka 6 5 lin et al 1997 sanli et al 2010 therefore the occurrence of both the undissociated form and the anionic one hereafter hsdz and sdz respectively should be taken into account when modeling the environmental fate of sdz vide infra direct photolysis and indirect photoreactions with oh and the triplet states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter 3cdom account for the majority of sdz phototransformation in most surface water conditions boreen et al 2005 bahnmüller et al 2014 among these photoreaction pathways the direct photolysis occurs when a pollutant absorbs sunlight boreen et al 2003 in the case of indirect photochemistry the irradiation of chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom mainly yields 3cdom 1o2 and oh the radical oh is also produced by irradiation of nitrate and nitrite the radical oh occurs at a higher extent in shallow and low doc waters while the 3cdom and 1o2 reactions tend to prevail in high doc and deep environments vione et al 2014 cory et al 2009 wenk et al 2013 bianco et al 2015 minella et al 2016 the photochemical modeling of sdz phototransformation which is one of the goals of the present work is enabled by the literature availability of the direct photolysis quantum yields and of the reaction rate constants with oh and 1o2 boreen et al 2005 moreover the second order rate constants for the quenching of the triplet state of 4 carboxybenzophenone 3cbbp by hsdz and sdz have been measured recently by li et al 2015 cbbp is a suitable proxy for cdom as there is evidence that the 3cbbp reactivity is quite close to that of 3cdom avetta et al 2016 the triplet quenching rate constants are here assumed to be close to the rate constants of hsdz sdz transformation induced by 3cbbp and therefore to the rate constants of transformation by 3cdom the reaction between sdz and 3cdom is not a straightforward process however because of the occurrence of back reduction phenomena wenk and canonica 2012 wenk et al 2015 indeed the dissolved organic matter dom that occurs in natural waters comprises both photoactive moieties cdom and antioxidant groups e g phenolic moieties the 3cdom species are oxidants usually involved in one electron or h atom abstraction from dissolved substrates including the xenobiotics producing oxidized transformation intermediates the oxidized intermediates can undergo further reactions finally resulting in xenobiotic transformation in alternative they could also interact with easily oxidizable dom moieties to undergo back reduction and produce again the original xenobiotic sdz is among the xenobiotics that undergo the back reduction phenomenon which causes an inhibition of triplet sensitized degradation canonica and laubscher 2008 wenk and canonica 2012 back reduction processes have been described in the laboratory and they have the potential to inhibit the phototransformation of compounds such as sdz in deep and dom rich waters deep water columns are out of reach for laboratory experiments but they are accessible to photochemical modeling bodrato and vione 2014 to this purpose this paper has the goal of assessing the impact of back reduction under conditions that are representative of surface waters for instance high doc conditions would increase both the steady state 3cdom and the back reduction effect mcneill and canonica 2016 with an overall outcome on the importance of triplet sensitized phototransformation that is still to be assessed to do so however one needs additional experimental data the effect of antioxidants on the triplet sensitized degradation of sdz is presently available for a single ph value and with a model sensitizer that is different from 4 carboxybenzophenone in this paper we i study the back reduction process for both hsdz and sdz in synthetic solutions ii irradiate sdz in natural water samples to get insight into the antioxidant effect in shallow water iii verify that the observed trends can be reproduced by photochemical modeling and iv extrapolate the model predictions to deeper water columns we compare the sdz results with those obtained with 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp under similar conditions tmp is a compound for which photodegradation in natural water is mainly triggered by 3cdom the tmp direct photolysis and reactions with oh and 1o2 are only minor processes al housari et al 2010 de laurentiis et al 2012 moreover differently from sdz tmp does not undergo back reduction in the presence of dom antioxidants canonica and laubsher 2008 wenk et al 2015 2

glass stoppers when required the ph of the irradiated solutions was adjusted by addition of a phosphate buffer solution final concentration of phosphate 5 mm the tubes were placed in a dema hans mangels gmbh bornhein roisdorf germany model 125 merry go round photoreactor equipped with a heraeus noblelight tq718 medium pressure mercury lamp operated at 500 w and a borosilicate glass cooling jacket the used apparatus can irradiate up to nine tubes at the same time a 0 15 m nano3 solution passed through a lauda rk 20 cooling thermostat was used as a water bath to keep the irradiated tubes at a temperature of 25 0 0 5 c and to remove lamp radiation of wavelength 320 nm the latter condition was employed to minimize the direct photolysis of sdz the photolysis of nitrate yields nitrite that absorbs radiation at longer wavelengths mack and bolton 1999 and might modify the filter transmittance therefore the stability over time of the filter solution was monitored by measuring its transmittance at 360 nm and by checking that it was above 85 for the effective optical path length of 3 cm the irradiation intensity in the quartz tubes was checked by chemical actinometry using an aqueous solution of 4 nitroanisole 5 μm and pyridine 10 mm dulin and mill 1982 and it was estimated to vary by 7 over the whole series of irradiation experiments at scheduled irradiation times 0 5 ml

acetonitrile with retention time t r of 2 7 min and detection at 267 nm tmp was eluted with 50 a 50 b with t r 3 0 min and detection at 210 nm in most experiments the time trend of tmp and of sdz was fitted with an exponential function of the form c t c o e k t where c t is the substrate concentration at the time t c o the initial concentration and k the pseudo first order degradation rate constant the initial transformation rate was obtained as r k c o in some experiments i e in the case of sdz irradiated in natural water the time trend was observed to deviate from a pure pseudo first order kinetics in these cases data fitting was performed using an exponential trend with a residual c t a e k t b where a and b are free floating fit parameters and the initial transformation rate is given by r k c o a a b 1 such a deviation from pseudo first order is expected to arise from aging of the irradiated solutions possibly due to cdom photobleaching reversible formation of photolysis products as well as changes in the antioxidant capacity of the solutions the natural water samples were characterized for the absorption spectra and the content of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon doc and dic respectively the doc and dic values were measured by catalytic wet oxidation and by acidification plus gas stripping respectively followed by non dispersive ir detection the used instrument was a shimadzu toc vcsh analyzer equipped with an asi v autosampler further details concerning the analytical procedures are reported elsewhere carena et al 2017 the results of these determinations are reported in table sm1 in the supplementary material hereafter sm the doc of our lake water samples taken near the shore and potentially affected by terrestrial organic matter was often higher than typical values obtained in the center of the lake especially in the case of lago maggiore bertoni et al 2010 absorption spectra were taken with an agilent technologies cary 100 double beam uv visible spectrophotometer using 1 cm quartz cuvettes and 5 cm ones in the case of lake and paddy water the absorption spectra of hsdz and sdz are reported in fig sm1 sm those of the

632 ph meter the electron donating capacity edc of the lake and paddy waters expressed in molar concentration units was determined employing the recently developed size exclusion chromatographic sec method which uses a post column reaction with the stable radical anion of 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts chon et al 2015 briefly samples of the waters 2 5 ml were injected in a

absorbance detector pad and a variable wavelength uv vis absorbance detector vwd chromatography was performed on a toyopearl hw 50s column 8 300 mm 30 μm grace davison product from bgb boeckten

assessment of sdz photodegradation was carried out with the apex software aqueous photochemistry of environmentally occurring xenobiotics available for free as electronic supplementary information of bodrato and vione 2014 apex predicts photochemical reaction kinetics from photoreactivity parameters absorption spectra direct photolysis quantum yields and second order reaction rate constants with transient species and from data of water chemistry and depth bodrato and vione 2014 vione 2014 apex predictions have been validated by comparison with field data of pollutant phototransformation kinetics in surface freshwaters see for instance maddigapu et al 2011 marchetti et al 2013 bodrato and vione 2014 apex uses a fair weather summertime solar spectrum at mid latitude see figure sm1 in the sm frank and klöpffer 1988 sunlight irradiance is not constant in the natural environment due to fluctuations in meteorological conditions not included in apex and of diurnal and seasonal cycles to allow easier comparison between model results and environmental conditions apex uses as time unit a 24 h summer sunny day ssd equivalent to fair weather 15 july at 45 n latitude which takes the day night cycle into account the absorption of radiation by the photosensitizers cdom nitrate and nitrite and the target substrate is calculated based on competition for sunlight irradiance in a lambert beer approach bodrato and vione 2014 braslavsky 2007 apex applies to well mixed waters and gives average values over the water column which includes the contributions of the well illuminated surface layer and of darker water in the lower depths where irradiance is very low loiselle et al 2008 in the case of sdz literature data were used for the direct photolysis quantum yields and for the second order reaction rate constants with oh and 1o2 see table 1 boreen et al 2005 while separate photolysis quantum yields are reported for the two forms hsdz and sdz no separate oh and 1o2 rate constant values are available in the case of 1o2 this is a minor problem because the reaction plays a negligible role in sdz phototransformation vide infra similar reaction rate constants between sdz and oh have been measured at presumably acidic ph fenton reaction and at ph around 8 h2o2 photolysis where there is prevalence of hsdz and sdz respectively boreen et al 2005 baeza and knappe 2011 moreover successful modeling of sdz phototransformation by oh in the h2o2 uv process has been carried out with a single reaction rate constant in the ph range from 6 5 comparable values of hsdz and sdz to 8 4 strong prevalence of sdz wols et al 2014 as far as the triplet sensitized transformation is concerned the reported second order quenching constants of hsdz and sdz with the triplet state of 4 carboxybenzophenone 3cbbp li et al 2015 were taken as representative of the corresponding 3cdom rate constants this procedure has been recently shown to be appropriate in the cases of diclofenac naproxen and clofibric acid avetta et al 2016 triplet sensitized degradation is triggered by reaction between sdz and 3cdom boreen et al 2005 and it is inhibited by dom antioxidant moieties canonica and laubscher 2008 wenk and canonica 2012 bahnmüller et al 2014 wenk et al 2015 this effect is not due to a decrease of the rate of the primary reaction but rather to the back reduction of partially oxidized sdz to the parent compound such an observation can be summarized by the following equation 1 k sdz ao ψ k sdz where k sdz ao is the pseudo first order rate constant of sdz transformation either hsdz or sdz triggered by 3cdom or a surrogate of it e g 3cbbp in the presence of phenolic antioxidants ao k sdz is the pseudo first order rate constant without antioxidants and ψ 1 is the ratio of the two rate constants because the triplet sensitization process is a bimolecular reaction between sdz and 3cdom and because 3cdom is in steady state conditions canonica et al 2005 boreen et al 2005 one has k sdz k sdz 3 cdom 3cdom where k sdz 3 cdom is the second order reaction rate constant between sdz and 3cdom in the presence of antioxidant molecules the back reduction processes decrease the apparent degradation rate of sdz to enable this antioxidant effect to be taken into account within apex the second order reaction rate constant for sdz transformation was modified into an apparent rate constant k sdz 3 cdom ao that is lower than the actual one measured in the absence of antioxidants one has 2 k sdz ao ψ k sdz ψ k sdz 3 cdom 3 cdom k sdz 3 cdom ao 3 cdom from which one gets that k sdz 3 cdom ao ψ k sdz 3 cdom in this way the antioxidant effect on the degradation kinetics is seen as an apparent decrease of the second order reaction rate constant at equal 3cdom this is reasonable because under conditions that are significant for surface water bodies dissolved organic compounds including dom antioxidants are usually unable to quench a significant fraction of the photogenerated triplet states therefore dom does not affect the steady state 3cdom significantly wenk et al 2013 finally the apex modeling returns also the steady state 3cdom for given water conditions and water depth referred to a standard sunlight spectrum that corresponds to 22 w m 2 uv irradiance bodrato and vione 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 triplet sensitized sdz photodegradation effect of phenol as model antioxidant our first goal was the quantification of the antioxidant effect on the triplet sensitized degradation of sdz the two sdz forms acidic hsdz and basic sdz are known to react with 3cbbp to produce oxidation intermediates that may further react to yield transformation products to assess the possible effect of back reduction on this reaction we chose phenol as model antioxidant based on the fact that phenol is degraded by direct reaction with 3cbbp at a lesser extent than other model antioxidants including 4 methylphenol canonica and laubscher 2008 because both 3cbbp quenching and the back reduction of partially oxidized sdz are able to inhibit sdz photodegradation the use of phenol minimizes the quenching process and should allow the back reduction to be highlighted the possible consumption of 3cbbp by phenol was assessed by considering the 3cbbp decay kinetics k 3 cbbp 6 105 s 1 in aerated solution de laurentiis et al 2013 and an upper limit for the rate constant of 3cbbp quenching by phenol k 5 109 m 1 s 1 which is a typical upper limit for most triplet sensitized reactions mcneill and canonica 2016 considering that hsdz has pka 6 5 lin et al 1997 sanli et al 2010 and the carboxylic group of cbbp has pka 4 5 nist 2004 the hsdz experiments were carried out at ph 5 5 to have most sdz in the protonated form and most cbbp in the deprotonated one in contrast the sdz experiments were carried out at ph 8 5 where cbbp is deprotonated as well ph was adjusted with a phosphate buffer in both cases fig 2 a reports the time trend of 5 μm sdz in the presence of 40 μm cbbp at ph 5 5 with different concentration values of phenol 10 μm to minimize 3cbbp quenching the time trend of hsdz direct photolysis is also reported on the graph showing that the direct photolysis d p process was practically negligible no reliable direct photolysis quantum yield could be inferred from these data the insert in the figure shows the measured first order rate constants of hsdz degradation k hsdz as a function of phenol concentration together with the expected effect of phenol if it only acted as 3cbbp quencher which appears to be a minor process the observed experimental trend of k hsdz could be fitted well with equation 3 this equation is analogous to the equations derived in previous studies of the inhibitory effect of dom and model antioxidants on the excited triplet induced transformation of organic contaminants canonica and laubscher 2008 wenk et al 2011 wenk and canonica 2012 3 k hsdz k hsdz o 1 1 phenol phenol 1 2 where k hsdz o is the pseudo first order rate constant of hsdz degradation in the absence of phenol and phenol 1 2 19 5 2 5 μm is the phenol concentration that halves the observed degradation rate constant hereafter error bounds represent standard errors note that ψ 1 1 phenol phenol 1 2 see the definition of ψ in equation 1 the underlying concept of equation 3 is explained in the introduction fig 2b reports the time trend of 5 μm sdz in the presence of 40 μm cbbp at ph 8 5 with different phenol concentrations the direct photolysis of sdz also reported in the diagram was slow but its rate constants could be quantified by applying previously described actinometric methods canonica et al 2008 and using the spectral data of the filtered tq718 lamp leresche et al 2016 a direct photolysis quantum yield of 1 0 0 1 10 3 was determined which is close to that known from literature see boreen et al 2005 and table 1 the figure insert reports k sdz vs phenol as well as the expected effect of 3cbbp quenching by phenol itself a comparison between fig 2b and fig 2a suggests that the inhibitory effect of phenol was more marked in the case of sdz compared to hsdz the numerical fit of the k sdz vs phenol data with the equivalent of equation 3 obtained by replacing the hsdz labels with sdz yielded phenol 1 2 0 86 0 10 μm the different effects of phenol at the two investigated ph values might be accounted for by two phenomena i phenol has pka 10 nist 2004 and the fraction of phenolate at ph 8 5 is 103 times higher than at ph 5 5 phenolate is a stronger reducing agent compared to phenol wardman 1989 thus it can be reasonable that its antioxidant action is more effective interestingly humic substances have been shown to have an increasing antioxidant action expressed as edc with increasing ph aeschbacher et al 2012 which might be accounted for by the occurrence of phenolate anions at the higher ph values ii the radical species derived from the triplet sensitized oxidation of hsdz and sdz are probably different but they can undergo an acid base equilibrium in a similar way as the parent compounds tentscher et al 2013 4 hsdz sdz h 5 3cbbp hsdz cbbp hsdz 6 3cbbp sdz cbbp sdz 7 hsdz sdz h however it is not known whether these acid base reactions occur on a similar time scale as other transformation recombination processes relevant for the degradation of sdz the very different effects of phenol at ph 5 5 and 8 5 would suggest that the radical species of sdz do not interconvert quickly 3 2 photodegradation of sdz in natural water samples sdz was spiked to the six studied natural water samples to reach an initial concentration of 5 μm and these systems were then irradiated for up to 4 5 h two blank runs direct photolysis were also carried out at ph 5 5 hsdz and 8 5 sdz the ph values of natural water were included in the 7 8 range thereby ensuring a prevalence of sdz fully comparable irradiation experiments were carried out with 5 μm tmp which undergoes triplet sensitized oxidation with similar rate constant as sdz but does not undergo back reduction upon reaction with antioxidants canonica and laubscher 2008 wenk et al 2015 in the case of tmp 3 h irradiation was enough to attain complete photodegradation in all the natural waters except for lago maggiore m fig 3 a reports the initial degradation rates of tmp and sdz r tmp and r sdz respectively observed in the different cases the lake water samples are shown in order of increasing doc note that s santhià and sg s germano vercellese represent paddy water samples the doc values of which were intermediate between those of candia c and viverone v the direct photolysis of tmp and sdz was practically negligible except for sdz at ph 8 5 sdz the faster direct photolysis of sdz compared to hsdz is consistent with previous reports bian and zhang 2016 but the rate of sdz direct photolysis was much lower than the photodegradation rate we observed in natural water samples therefore the photodegradation of sdz in our natural water samples under our irradiation conditions should mainly take place by indirect photochemistry the photodegradation of tmp was particularly effective in paddy water in the case of lake water the tmp transformation rate increased with increasing doc as can be expected for a process that involves 3cdom but is not affected by back reduction canonica and laubscher 2008 bodhipaksha et al 2015 compared to tmp the phototransformation kinetics of sdz showed a much less marked dependence on the doc of either lake or paddy water similar results have already been reported in the case of sdz irradiated in river water bahnmüller et al 2014 paddy water had no peculiarly high doc when compared to the investigated lake water but it had higher absorbance see fig 1 interestingly the plot of r tmp vs the 300 nm absorbance of natural water a 1 300 nm see fig 3b yielded a reasonably straight line it is suggested that the kinetics of tmp photodegradation with respect to the amount of absorbed radiation were very similar in all the studied natural water samples in contrast r sdz reached a plateau already at relatively low values of a 1 300 nm the rationale for taking the water absorbance into account is that cdom is both the 3cdom source and the main light absorbing species in natural waters between 300 and 500 nm loiselle et al 2008 the present finding concerning r tmp vs a 1 300 nm is consistent with a previous report that the quantum yield of 3cdom photogeneration was comparable in paddy and lake water carena et al 2017 tmp at the used initial concentration 5 μm would carry out a minor quenching of 3cdom canonica and freiburghaus 2001 this issue allows for the use of the relationship r tmp k tmp 3 cdom tmp 3cdom to derive a 3cdom value that would be valid in the absence of tmp as well thus by assuming k tmp 3 cdom 3 109 m 1 s 1 al housari et al 2010 the 3cdom values that are reported in the right y axis of fig 3b were obtained as 3cdom r tmp tmp 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 differently from tmp sdz could undergo different transformation processes including the direct photolysis as well as the reactions with oh and 3cdom however the 0 15 m nitrate solution used to filter lamp radiation would largely reduce the photon flux absorbed by both sdz and nitrate in the samples thereby minimizing both direct photolysis and oh reactions as a consequence the primary reaction between sdz and 3cdom is potentially important in sdz degradation but the overall process would be inhibited by the back reactions between oxidized sdz and dom antioxidants canonica and laubscher 2008 wenk et al 2015 it is possible to assess the importance of the sdz back reactions in the irradiated samples by comparing the ratio of the degradation rates of tmp and sdz r tmp r sdz 1 with the electron donating capacity of the samples edc units of μmol e l 1 see table sm1 the edc parameter measures the molar concentration of dom antioxidants considering that sdz undergoes back reactions with dom antioxidants while tmp does not wenk et al 2015 the higher is the edc the higher is expected to be the r tmp r sdz 1 ratio if tmp and sdz mostly react with 3cdom fig 3c reports the correlation plot between r tmp r sdz 1 and the measured edc which suggests a very good linear trend interestingly the paddy fields showed higher values of edc per unit doc compared to lake water the reason is possibly linked to the fact that the biological processing of dom in paddy water is so high that the organic matter is renewed very quickly and has little time to undergo photochemical oxidation carena et al 2017 3 3 modeling of sdz phototransformation 3 3 1 model validation as already mentioned to model the effect of dom antioxidant moieties on the triplet sensitized degradation of sdz either hsdz or sdz it was assumed a decrease of the relevant second order reaction rate constants we used k sdz 3 cdom ao ψ k sdz 3 cdom with ψ 1 phenol phenol 1 2 1 1 as per equation 3 the main difficulty with this approach is that the natural dom contains phenolic compounds among other functionalities but it is not only made up of phenols the phenolic content of specific dom samples is known ritchie and perdue 2003 but one should make the additional hypothesis that natural dom phenols have the same or similar antioxidant effect as the phenol molecule fortunately the antioxidant effect of phenol has been compared with that of suwannee river fulvic acids srfa and of pony lake fulvic acids plfa in the case of the triplet sensitized transformation of n n dimethyl 4 cyanoaniline leresche et al 2016 the substrate degradation rate was halved in the presence of phenol 1 2 3 7 μmol l 1 of dom 1 2 3 2 mgc l 1 plfa or of dom 1 2 1 5 mgc l 1 srfa these concentration values allow for the determination of the phenol antioxidant equivalents of plfa and srfa thus the value of phenol 1 2 19 μmol l 1 we obtained for hsdz would correspond to dom 1 2 17 mgc l 1 plfa or to 8 mgc l 1 srfa similarly the value of phenol 1 2 0 9 μmol l 1 we obtained for sdz would correspond to dom 1 2 0 7 mgc l 1 plfa or to 0 3 mgc l 1 srfa we used these dom 1 2 values for the modeling of hsdz and sdz phototransformation assuming ψ 1 d o c d o m 1 2 1 1 it should be noted here that humic substances such as plfa and srfa are not the only dom components with phenolic moieties or antioxidant behavior other examples include for instance the tyrosine groups of peptides coble 1996 thus the degree by which plfa or srfa are representative of the antioxidant dom moieties has to be assessed anyway in addition to being the only substances with available dom 1 2 data these humic compounds make a reasonable choice because srfa is routinely used in the quality control of edc measurements chon et al 2015 moreover the fluorescence spectra of the paddy water samples used in our irradiation experiments have shown a strong prevalence of humic substances compared to proteins carena et al 2017 the apex software uses a standard sunlight spectrum for modeling under which conditions it is well known that sdz undergoes significant direct photolysis bahnmüller et al 2014 in contrast our irradiation set up was chosen to highlight only the triplet sensitized phototransformation of sdz therefore the validation of model predictions with the experimental data was carried out by considering the predicted sdz phototransformation kinetics accounted for by 3cdom alone to avoid problems linked with the different irradiation sources we used the steady state 3cdom to achieve a normalization between experimental data and model predictions the experimental 3cdom values are those obtained from the tmp phototransformation kinetics and they are reported in fig 3b the corresponding predicted values of 3cdom were obtained by adjusting the model parameters and by varying the input doc so that the modeled 3cdom values matched the experimental ones note that for short optical path lengths in the model it was used a water depth d 1 cm that is close to the optical path length of the experiments there is a direct proportionality between 3cdom and doc the match was carried out so that the model predicted 3cdom 5 10 13 m for doc 10 mgc l 1 this is not far from the doc values of the paddy water samples that yielded the highest experimental 3cdom finally because apex returns first order rate constants and not initial transformation rates the predicted rate constants were transformed into s 1 units and multiplied by sdz o 5 μm to get the predicted initial rates r sdz the experimental r sdz data reported in fig 4 a b are the same as those of fig 3b including the same meaning for open and solid symbols in repeated experiments but they are plotted as a function of the experimental 3cdom because two tmp degradation replicas were carried out for each condition the used 3cdom is the average of the values obtained in both sets of experiments in fig 4a the experimental data are compared with the model predictions in the plfa like scenario for hsdz dom 1 2 17 mgc l 1 for sdz dom 1 2 0 7 mgc l 1 and for a mixture containing 30 hsdz 70 sdz such a mixture would be observed at ph 7 in the case of the mixture one finds a reasonable agreement between model predictions and experimental data in fig 4b the same comparison is made in the srfa like scenario dom 1 2 8 mgc l 1 for hsdz and 0 3 mgc l 1 for sdz where the impact of back reduction is considerably higher than for plfa the mixture of 30 hsdz 70 sdz did not match the experimental data as well as in the previous case a better match with the experiments would be obtained with 50 hsdz 50 sdz but that would imply ph 6 5 that is not really compatible with the ph values of the studied water samples see sm in summary the plfa like scenario gave a somewhat better match with the experimental data than the srfa like scenario 3 3 2 modeling of sdz photodegradation under conditions representative of natural waters thus far only the reaction between sdz and 3cdom was modeled to allow for a comparison with the irradiation experiments by taking into account all the main phototransformation processes see table 1 for the relevant kinetic parameters one obtains the results reported in fig 5 these results should give insight into the actual behavior of sdz in natural waters fig 5a reports the modeled fractions of sdz transformation accounted for by the different photoreactions as a function of ph for a water depth d 5 m and doc 3 mgc l 1 when ph increases one has an increasing percentage of sdz with respect to hsdz pk a 6 5 moreover hsdz and sdz have similar phototransformation rate constants for doc 3 mgc l 1 vide infra the plot shows that the 3cdom process would prevail in the case of hsdz and that it would be gradually replaced by the direct photolysis as the sdz fraction gets higher in either case the oh reaction would only play a secondary role note that these conclusions are obtained for the plfa like scenario but very similar results apply to the srfa like case as well fig 5b reports the predicted half lives of hsdz and sdz in the plfa like and srfa like scenarios as a function of the doc for d 5 m the predicted half lives increase with increasing doc and also depending on the sdz form and the modeled scenario they vary from some days to several weeks similar transformation kinetics are predicted for hsdz and sdz at doc 2 3 mgc l 1 with very few differences between the srfa like and the plfa like scenarios at lower doc one expects the phototransformation of sdz to be slightly faster than that of hsdz while the reverse happens at higher doc in particular for doc 10 mgc l 1 the phototransformation of hsdz would be considerably faster than that of sdz in these doc conditions the predicted half lives are expected to significantly increase and the relevant rate constants to correspondingly decrease with increasing ph the steady state 3cdom increases with increasing doc while other processes such as direct photolysis and oh reactions are inhibited in high doc waters vione et al 2014 increasing doc would on the one side enhance the primary reaction of sdz with 3cdom but on the other hand it would also enhance back reduction it is interesting to see the expected impact of these two contrasting effects on the importance of 3cdom in the photodegradation of hsdz and sdz as the doc increases the plots shown in fig 5c f report as a function of the doc and for water depth d 5 m the modeled fractions of hsdz or sdz that undergo transformation via the different photoreaction pathways in the srfa like and plfa like scenarios the oh process undergoes the highest inhibition with increasing doc due to the scavenging of oh by dom vione et al 2014 the direct photolysis is also inhibited with increasing doc due to competition between hsdz sdz and cdom for sunlight irradiance however the direct photolysis undergoes lesser inhibition compared to the oh reaction which accounts for the trend with a maximum of the direct photolysis fraction as a function of the doc very interestingly the relative importance of the 3cdom process is predicted to increase with the doc in all the investigated scenarios including the srfa like case with sdz this is the scenario where the impact of back reduction is expected to be the highest to explain the above finding one should consider that the kinetics of all the processes are slowed down when the doc is high the oh reaction is inhibited by dom scavenging while cdom inhibits the direct photolysis by competition for irradiance the combination of cdom absorption saturation and back reduction slows down the degradation induced by 3cdom but to a lesser extent compared to the other two pathways as a result even in the presence of the antioxidant induced reduction process the relative importance of triplet sensitized degradation is predicted to increase with increasing doc 4 conclusions phenolic antioxidants are able to inhibit the triplet sensitized degradation of sdz the inhibition effect can be assessed in the laboratory by using model phenolic compounds phenol in the present case provided that they do not significantly quench the photogenerated triplet states the use of the equivalent anti oxidant behavior of srfa or plfa was here shown to be appropriate to extrapolate the laboratory results to the behavior of dom in natural water samples the plfa like case allowed for a better agreement with the experimental data the inhibition effect of phenol was more marked with the anionic form sdz than with the neutral one hsdz the extent of the inhibition was directly proportional to the electron donating capacity of the water sample therefore at least for short optical path lengths that are typical of laboratory irradiation set ups the kinetics of sdz phototransformation was poorly dependent on the amount of c dom in the studied water samples in sunlit surface waters direct photolysis and oh reaction are expected to account for the majority of the photodegradation of both hsdz and sdz if the doc is low 1 mgc l 1 with higher doc 3 4 mgc l 1 and despite the back reduction processes the 3cdom reactions would account for the majority of hsdz phototransformation in the case of sdz at high doc the direct photolysis would be the main phototransformation process interestingly although the 3cdom reactions are secondary processes for sdz in natural water settings their relative importance is expected to increase with increasing doc despite the considerable back reduction phenomenon back reduction is observed with several compounds and particularly with those having amine or sulfonamide groups canonica and laubscher 2008 davis et al 2017 our findings suggest that for many xenobiotics undergoing back reduction the process inhibition by dom would not prevent triplet sensitization from gaining importance with increasing doc in several cases the 3cdom reaction could still become the main photoprocess in dom rich i e high doc waters an increase in water ph shifts the prevailing sdz form from hsdz to sdz and it would enhance the direct photolysis at the expense of triplet sensitization when taking into account the possible variations of surface water conditions sdz is expected to be fairly photolabile under summertime sunlight the photochemical half lives would range from a few days to a couple of months which in many cases would successfully compete with the biodegradation kinetics to extend this study to other compounds it is necessary to know or measure their reaction rate constants with a reactive triplet state e g 3cbbp and to assess the values of phenol 1 2 or dom 1 2 under conditions of triplet

19868,this paper deals with the photochemical fate of two representative carbapenem antibiotics namely imipenem and meropenem in aqueous solutions under solar radiation the analytical method employed for the determination of the target compounds in various aqueous matrices such as ultrapure water municipal wastewater treatment plant effluents and river water at environmentally relevant concentrations was liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometry the absorption spectra of both compounds were measured in aqueous solutions at ph values from 6 to 8 and both compounds showed a rather strong absorption band centered at about 300 nm while their molar absorption coefficient was in the order from 9 103 104 l mol 1 cm 1 the kinetics of the photochemical degradation of the target compounds was studied in aqueous solutions under natural solar radiation in a solar reactor with compound parabolic collectors it was found that the photochemical degradation of both compounds at environmentally relevant concentrations follows first order kinetics and the quantum yield was in the order of 10 3 mol einsten 1 several parameters were studied such as solution ph the presence of nitrate ions and humic acids and the effect of water matrix in all cases it was found that the presence of various organic and inorganic constituents in the aqueous matrices do not contribute significantly either positively or negatively to the photochemical degradation of both compounds under natural solar radiation in a final set of photolysis experiments the effect of the level of irradiance was studied under simulated solar radiation and it was found that the quantum yield for the direct photodegradation of both compounds remained practically constant by changing the incident solar irradiance from 28 to 50 w m 2 graphical abstract image 1 keywords carbapenem antibiotics imipenem meropenem solar radiation photolysis quantum yield 1 introduction in recent years considerable attention has been given to the occurrence and fate of various pharmaceutical compounds in the aquatic environment and in particular to antibiotics michael et al 2013 luo et al 2014 carvalho and santos 2016 richardson and kimura 2016 antibiotics used in human medicine are either excreted metabolized or not by patients or dumped down the drain thus reaching municipal wastewater treatment plants mwwtps however conventional mwwtps are not intentionally designed for the removal of micropollutants including antibiotics therefore human antibiotics are only partially eliminated in mwwtps and they are released into the receiving aquatic bodies and eventually end up in the aquatic environment michael et al 2013 carvalho and santos 2016 indeed several studies have been performed on the occurrence and fate of antibiotics in environmental aqueous matrices and various classes of antibiotics have been detected in low concentrations typically in the order of ng l 1 to μg l 1 michael et al 2013 li 2014 luo et al 2014 carvalho and santos 2016 the most adverse effect attributed to the presence of antibiotics in the environment is the development of both genes and bacteria which are resistant to antibiotics thereby reducing the therapeutic capacity of antibiotics to prevent and treat diseases davies and davies 2010 rizzo et al 2013 manaia et al 2016 numerous national and global agencies and organizations including the european union and the world health organization have recognized antibiotic resistance as one of the most critical challenges of our time in particular mwwtps have been identified as hotspots for the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes into the environment rizzo et al 2013 there are several classes of natural synthetic or semi synthetic antibiotic compounds such as β lactams tetracyclines macrolides aminoglycosides sulfonamides and quinolones among others katzung et al 2012 bicyclic β lactams i e compounds containing the four membered 2 azetidinone ring or β lactam ring fused with another five or six membered heterocyclic ring containing sulfur such as penicillins and cephalosporins were among the first antimicrobial agents available for the therapy of various infectious diseases moreover β lactam antibiotics are currently the most used class of antibacterial agents for the treatment of various infectious diseases katzung et al 2012 however problems related to the development of resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins led to the development of more effective β lactam antibiotics such as carbapenems papp wallace et al 2011 carbapenems are synthetic antibiotics that contain a β lactam ring fused with a dihydropyrrole ring as well as a hydroxyethyl and a sulfur containing side chain representative carbapenems are imipenem meropenem doripenem and ertapenem carbapenems possess the broadest spectrum of activity and the greatest potency against gram positive and gram negative bacteria papp wallace et al 2011 katzung et al 2012 as a result carbapenems are often used as last line agents or antibiotics of last resort when patients with infections become gravely ill or are suspected of harboring resistant bacteria papp wallace et al 2011 unfortunately recently it has been discovered that some gram negative bacteria have developed resistance to carbapenems kumarasamy et al 2010 which is now spreading throughout the world and seriously threatens the efficiency of this essential class of life saving antibiotics papp wallace et al 2011 organic micropollutants including pharmaceuticals undergo several transformation processes in the aquatic environment including biotic such as biodegradation and bioaccumulation and abiotic such as hydrolysis photolysis oxidation and adsorption transformations wang and lin 2012 schwarzenbach et al 2017 photochemical degradation induced by solar radiation allows natural attenuation of pharmaceuticals and many other micropollutants both in surface waters and in wastewaters thus diminishing their detected concentrations in the aquatic environment challis et al 2014 yan and song 2014 in general it has been found that the effectiveness of photodecomposition depends on the integrative effects of photon flux the structure of the target molecule and the composition of the water matrix challis et al 2014 yan and song 2014 several recent studies have been performed on the photolysis of various pharmaceutical compounds in the aquatic environment challis et al 2014 yan and song 2014 including β lactam antibiotics andreozzi et al 2004 jiang et al 2010 xu et al 2011 carlos et al 2012 wang and lin 2012 2014 li and lin 2015 moreover recently meropenem has been found in mwwtps influents and effluents tran et al 2016a 2016b while imipenem was found in hospital wastewater effluents szekeres et al 2017 based on the above the aim of the present work was to study the photolytic degradation under solar radiation of two representative carbapenems namely imipenem and meropenem in aqueous solutions since solar photodegradation is an important natural attenuation process both in surface waters and in wastewaters the effect of various parameters was investigated such as initial antibiotics concentration ph of the solution the addition of nitrates and dissolved organic matter dom water matrix and level of irradiance the analysis of the kinetic data obtained from the above experiments made it possible to calculate the quantum yield of the photolysis of both compounds in aqueous solutions under solar radiation it should be noted that to the best of our knowledge the photolytic degradation of carbapenem antibiotics in aqueous solutions under solar radiation has not been reported in the literature yet 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials reagents and materials used in the present work are given in the supplementary material the chemical structures of imipenem monohydrate and meropenem trihydrate are shown in fig 1 for the development of the analytical methods individual stock standard solutions of each antibiotic were prepared in methanol at a concentration of 1000 mg l 1 and stored in amber screw capped glass vials at 20 c and in the dark for a maximum period of three weeks 2 2 aqueous matrices and solutions preparation experiments were carried out in three aqueous matrices namely i ultrapure water upw ii river water rw collected from andarax river near to padules almería spain and iii simulated mwwtp effluent ww the detailed composition of the ww and the main characteristics of each aqueous matrix are given in the supplementary material for the photolysis experiments aqueous solutions were prepared daily by dissolving the appropriate amounts of both antibiotics in the corresponding aqueous matrix the exact initial concentrations of the resulting aqueous solutions were measured by liquid chromatography vide infra and they were in the range from a few μg l 1 to a few hundred μg l 1 for both compounds these concentrations are considered as environmentally relevant since several pharmaceutical compounds have been identified in the aquatic environment in this range of concentrations luo et al 2014 richardson and kimura 2016 it should be emphasized that no organic solvents were used for the preparation of the aqueous solutions used for the irradiation experiments to avoid any complications resulting from the presence of organic solvents that may quench photogenerated transient species challis et al 2014 2 3 photolysis experiments under natural solar radiation photolysis experiments under natural solar radiation were carried out in a solar reactor with compound parabolic collectors cpc as shown in fig 2 this pilot plant consists of two twin photoreactors each one made of two pyrex glass tubes length 1 5 m inner diameter 45 mm thickness 2 5 mm fitted onto the focus of two cpc mirrors each with a 0 21 m2 illuminated surface i e the total illuminated surface of each photoreactor is equal to 0 42 m2 moreover the illuminated volume of each photoreactor is equal to 4 77 l it should be emphasized that cpc are non concentrating devices that is they are one sun equivalent and they are employed to distribute solar radiation on the surface of the tubes evenly modules are facing south and tilted at 37 from the horizontal local latitude aqueous solutions are driven by a centrifugal pump pan world nh 40px model and maintained in recirculation the crison 5335 sensors were used for ph monitoring while incident uva irradiance in w m 2 was measured employing a global uv radiometer delta ohm lp uva 02 av with a spectral response range from 327 nm to 384 nm mounted on a platform tilted at 37 the uva irradiance measurements were acquired throughout the entire experiments using a data acquisition card labjack u12 connected to a computer moreover the incident solar spectral irradiance was measured employing a spectroradiometer avaspec uls2048 2 purchased from avantes chemical actinometry was used for the calculation of the effective path length of radiation of the photoreactor employing p nitroanisole and pyridine dulin and mill 1982 laszakovits et al 2017 as described in detail in the supplementary material text s5 experiments under natural solar radiation were carried out during september 2014 from approximately 10 a m to 3 p m in sunny days and under clear sky conditions as expected the incident uva irradiance varied almost every minute and from day to day consequently for each experimental run the average uva irradiance was calculated by integrating the values recorded over the time of the experiments in all cases where the effect of various parameters on the photolytic degradation of both compounds was studied experiments were performed either in parallel or on successive days at about the same time in all cases it was found that the average uva irradiance of each experimental run did not differ significantly from one experiment to the other in a typical experimental run 7 l of the corresponding water matrix containing the target compounds at the desired initial concentration were loaded into the recirculation tanks of the cpc reactor while the cpc system was covered and kept in the dark after 15 min of recirculation in the dark for achieving perfect mixing conditions the cpc system was uncovered and at the same time started the acquisition of uva irradiance data samples periodically taken were analyzed for residual imipenem and meropenem concentration control experiments were performed in the dark to assess the possible hydrolysis of the target compounds by stirring aqueous solutions of both compounds in the aqueous matrices for more than 5 h at room temperature in all cases it was found that the hydrolysis of the target compounds was rather negligible after 5 h stirring in the dark 2 4 photolysis experiments under simulated solar radiation additional photolysis experiments by varying incident irradiance at predetermined levels were performed employing a suntest cps solar simulator purchased from atlas this solar simulator employs a xenon lamp with an emission range from 250 to 765 w m 2 complete emission spectrum and an emission wavelength from 300 to 800 nm experiments were carried out in a jacketed stirred tank reactor placed inside the suntest cps solar box which allowed water temperature to be controlled as shown in fig 3 the volume of this reactor was 0 500 l and the liquid depth was 7 0 cm while the surface area exposed to radiation was 7 14 10 3 m2 uva irradiance inside the solar box was measured with a pma2100 radiometer employing a uva sensor with spectral response in the 320 400 nm range purchased from solar light company the temperature of the reaction mixture was kept constant at 25 0 0 2 c using a thermostatic bath thermo scientific neslab rte7 2 5 analytical measurements the concentration of both micro contaminants in upw was monitored by hplc uv employing a c18 1 8 μm 4 6 50 mm analytical column and the injection volume was 100 μl for the determination of the analytes in more complex samples i e in rw and ww or at lower initial concentrations a more sensitive lc ms system was employed consisting of a hplc qtrap ms system the detailed description of the analytical methods is given in the supplementary material text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization and validation of the lc ms ms analytical method a careful optimization of the lc ms ms parameters was performed to obtain appropriate selectivity and sensibility for the analysis of target compounds in ww and rw as both target analytes are amphoteric and polar the ph of the mobile phases represented a critical factor in their chromatographic analysis different mobile phases and ph values were tested the best results regarding intensity resolution and peak shape were found with water 0 001 v v formic acid and methanol moreover the method was validated in terms of linearity sensitivity expressed as limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq matrix effects and precision loqs obtained were 2 3 orders of magnitude lower than that achieved by hplc uv matrix matched calibration was selected as calibration procedure to minimize the signal suppression effects observed mainly in the case of imipenem in ww the detailed description of the optimization and validation of the lc ms ms analytical method is given in the supplementary material text s3 3 2 photolysis under natural solar radiation 3 2 1 molar absorption coefficients of imipenem and meropenem the molar absorption coefficient ε λ in l mol 1 cm 1 expresses the ability of a compound to absorb radiation at a specific wavelength λ therefore the molar absorption coefficients of imipenem and meropenem were measured according to the beer lambert law in the uv region of the electromagnetic spectrum in aqueous solutions and at ph values from 6 to 8 adjusted by 20 mmol l 1 phosphate buffers and the results are shown in fig 4 moreover fig 4 also shows the incident solar spectral irradiance as it was measured by the spectroradiometer on the 14th of june 2017 at 14 14 local time in almeria spain as seen the absorption spectrum of both compounds extends to the uva region of the electromagnetic spectrum more specifically they both show a rather strong absorption band centered at about 300 nm as well as a relatively strong continuous absorption band below approximately 240 nm also as seen in fig 4 the ph of the solution in the range from 6 to 8 has a rather marginal effect on the absorption spectrum of both compounds more specifically as seen in fig 4a imipenem shows a rather strong absorption band centered at 299 nm and the molar absorption coefficient slightly decreases from 9300 to 9000 l mol 1 cm 1 by increasing the ph of the solution from 6 to 8 on the other hand meropenem shows a small bathochromic shift i e red shift and a hyperchromic effect and the wavelength of maximum absorption increases from 297 to 301 nm by increasing the ph of the solution from 6 to 8 while the molar absorption coefficient slightly increases from 10 700 to 11 000 l mol 1 cm 1 these results can be explained if we take into account the ionization constants of both compounds as seen in fig 1 both compounds have two pka values the first one is at about 4 3 for both compounds and corresponds to the acidic hydrogen of the carboxyl group of both molecules while the second one is at about 10 6 and 8 3 for imipenem and meropenem respectively and corresponds to an additional acidic hydrogen based on these pka values the fractional composition of the various molecular forms of both compounds was calculated as a function of the ph of the solution and the results are shown in figs s1 and s2 in the supplementary material as seen in the ph range from 6 to 8 imipenem exists predominately i e more than 98 in the single ionized form i e himi while in the ph range from 6 to 7 meropenem exists predominately i e more than 95 in the single ionized form i e hmer and at ph 8 it exists at about 67 in the single ionized form and 33 in the double ionized form i e mer2 consequently by changing solution ph from 6 to 8 no significant differences were observed in the absorption spectra of imipenem as the ionization of the molecule remains practically constant while for meropenem the two ionized forms i e hmer and mer2 are likely to have almost similar absorption spectra and hence relatively small differences were also observed in its absorption spectra based on the above absorption spectra of both compounds and on the fact that the solar radiation reaching the surface of the earth contains uv radiation in the uva and uvb region of the electromagnetic spectrum i e as can be seen in fig 4 for practical purposes radiation with wavelengths higher than 300 nm challis et al 2014 it is concluded that direct photolysis of both compounds under solar irradiation is possible in addition the average values of the molar absorption coefficient for each compound ε aver were calculated for the λ interval from 300 to 350 nm i e to the maximum wavelength in which they absorb in the uva region of the electromagnetic spectrum using the following eq 1 1 ε aver λ 300 nm λ max ε λ δ λ λ max 300 where λ max is the maximum wavelength in which they absorb in the uva region of the electromagnetic spectrum i e 350 nm and δλ 1 nm is the wavelength interval used in the spectrophotometer for the measurement of ε λ the average values of the molar absorption coefficient of both compounds are given in table s5 in the supplementary material and they will be used for the calculation of the quantum yield of their photolysis under solar radiation vide infra 3 2 2 direct photolysis under natural solar radiation in an initial set of direct photolysis experiments aqueous solutions of imipenem and meropenem in upw at inherent solution ph i e approximately 6 6 and in various initial concentrations were irradiated in the cpc system under natural solar radiation it should be noted that the ph of the solution was left uncontrolled and it was practically stable during the course of the reaction experiments were conducted by varying the initial concentration in the range from 0 0224 μmol l 1 i e 7 12 μg l 1 to 1 016 μmol l 1 i e 322 4 μg l 1 for imipenem and from 0 0136 μmol l 1 i e 5 96 μg l 1 to 0 7367 μmol l 1 i e 322 3 μg l 1 for meropenem and the results are shown in fig 5 a and b for imipenem and meropenem respectively as seen both compounds were readily degraded photochemically under natural solar radiation even at the relatively higher concentrations employed in the present work more specifically the photodegradation of meropenem was slightly higher i e approximately 93 than the corresponding photodegradation of imipenem i e approximately 88 after 300 min irradiation under natural solar radiation it should be noted that control experiments were performed in the dark and it was found that both compounds were rather stable after 5 h stirring of their aqueous solutions in the dark therefore the above results indicate that the observed degradation of both compounds can be attributed to their direct photolysis under natural solar radiation the above results show that photodegradation under natural solar radiation is a factor that may contribute significantly to the fate of these compounds when they are released to the aquatic environment 3 2 3 photodegradation kinetics as seen in fig 5a and b the rate of the photochemical degradation of both compounds under natural solar radiation remained practically constant within the limits of experimental error by varying the initial concentration from 0 0224 μmol l 1 i e 7 12 μg l 1 to 1 016 μmol l 1 i e 322 4 μg l 1 for imipenem and from 0 0136 μmol l 1 i e 5 96 μg l 1 to 0 7367 μmol l 1 i e 322 3 μg l 1 for meropenem these results indicate that at the experimental conditions employed in the present work the direct photolysis of both compounds in aqueous solutions in upw under natural solar radiation follows first order kinetics it has been well documented in the literature that the rate of the direct photochemical degradation of organic micropollutants in the aqueous phase at wavelength λ r λ in mol l 1 s 1 is given by the following equation zepp 1978 leifer 1988 beltrán et al 1995 2 r λ d c d t λ e n p o 0 s v 1 10 α λ ε λ c l ε λ c α λ ε λ c φ λ where c is the reactant concentration in mol l 1 e n p o 0 is the incident photon fluence rate on a chemical amount basis defined as the total number of moles of photons i e einsteins incident from all directions onto a small sphere divided by the cross sectional area of the sphere and per time interval in mol m 2 s 1 or einstein m 2 s 1 bolton and stefan 2002 braslavsky 2007 s is the surface area of the photochemical reactor exposed to radiation in m2 and v is the volume of the photochemical reactor in l α λ is the attenuation coefficient of the medium i e solvent at wavelength λ in cm 1 ε λ is the molar absorption coefficient of the reactant at wavelength λ in l mol 1 cm 1 l is the effective radiation absorption path length of the photochemical reactor in cm and φ λ is the quantum yield of the direct photochemical degradation of the micro pollutant at wavelength λ dimensionless or mol einsten 1 however in dilute aqueous solutions when radiation is weakly absorbed by the system i e when the absorbance is lower than 0 04 eq 2 simplifies to zepp 1978 leifer 1988 beltrán et al 1995 3 r λ d c d t λ 2 303 e n p o 0 s v l ε λ φ λ c then if we set 4 k 1 λ 2 303 e n p o 0 s v l ε λ φ λ eq 3 can be written as 5 d c d t λ k 1 λ c which corresponds to a first order kinetic rate law therefore in dilute aqueous solutions where the reactant weakly absorbs radiation the direct photolysis of the reactant follows first order kinetics zepp 1978 leifer 1988 beltrán et al 1995 eq 5 after integration at the boundary conditions yields the well known expression of the first order rate law 6 ln c c 0 k 1 λ t where c 0 is the initial concentration of the reactant in mol l 1 and k 1 λ 2 303 e n p o 0 s v lε λ φ λ is the first order rate constant of the direct photolysis of the reactant in s 1 the insets in fig 5 show the plot of ln c c 0 versus time for both compounds while table 1 shows the corresponding values of the first order rate constants and the correlation coefficients r2 as seen in table 1 under the experimental conditions employed in the present work the first order rate constants for the direct photolysis of imipenem in upw under natural solar radiation were in the range from 1 12 10 4 to 1 17 10 4 s 1 while the corresponding values for meropenem were in the range from 1 42 10 4 to 1 60 10 4 s 1 moreover the corresponding correlation coefficients r2 were always higher than 0 98 thus showing the relative good fitting of the experimental results to the first order kinetic rate law for both compounds in addition as seen in table 1 for each compound the first order rate constants obtained from the experiments conducted at various initial concentrations have minimal variance and the average values of the first order rate constant were 1 15 10 4 and 1 52 10 4 s 1 for imipenem and meropenem respectively while percent relative standard deviation rsd was 2 3 and 6 0 for imipenem and meropenem respectively 3 2 4 determination of the quantum yield the first order rate constants of both compounds determined in the previous section mainly depend on the experimental conditions employed in the photodegradation experiments such as the geometry of the photochemical reactor and the incident solar irradiance on the photochemical reactor therefore a more fundamental photochemical parameter is needed such as quantum yield to describe more adequately the photochemical fate of the compounds under investigation challis et al 2014 the quantum yield at wavelength λ φ λ determines the efficiency of a photochemical reaction and is defined as the number of moles of a compound that are transformed per number of moles of photons i e einsteins that are absorbed by the compound braslavsky 2007 in the present work the quantum yield of the direct photolysis of both compounds in aqueous solutions in upw under natural solar radiation was determined using eq 4 more specifically by solving eq 4 with respect to the quantum yield eq 4 can be written as follows zepp 1978 7 φ λ k 1 λ 2 303 e n p o 0 s v l ε λ it should be noted that in the above equation e n p o 0 is the incident photon fluence rate in the wavelength range from 300 to 350 nm while the molar absorption coefficient for each compound is the average value calculated for the λ interval from 300 to 350 nm using eq 1 and given in table s5 in the supplementary material for each experimental run e n p o 0 was calculated using the average incident uva irradiance measured by the radiometer as described in detail in text s4 in the supplementary material moreover the average effective path length of radiation of the cpc photochemical reactors was equal to l 0 93 cm as described in detail in text s5 in the supplementary material by substituting these values into the above eq 7 as well as the values of the first order rate constants determined in the previous section the quantum yields of the direct photolysis of both compounds were determined and the values are shown in table 1 as seen the average values of the quantum yield were 5 5 10 3 and 6 5 10 3 mol einsten 1 for imipenem and meropenem respectively while the corresponding rsd was 1 0 and 7 1 these values of the quantum yield are rather moderate to high since the quantum yields of the direct photolysis under solar radiation of various pharmaceutical compounds including β lactam antibiotics have been typically reported to be in the order from 10 6 to 10 2 mol einsten 1 carlos et al 2012 wang and lin 2012 challis et al 2014 these results confirm that indeed photochemical degradation of both compounds is an important factor determining their fate in the aquatic environment it should be emphasized that quantum yields are fundamental photochemical parameters of the studied antibiotics and they were obtained under controlled conditions in a cpc photoreactor to quantify radiation absorption and change in target compound concentration better therefore results are applicable under real environmental conditions whenever radiation absorption can be evaluated such as in wastewaters and in surface waters including river waters at this point it should be noted that for the calculation of the quantum yield it would be more accurate to measure the incident solar spectral irradiance for every experimental run however for routine measurements incident solar spectral irradiance cannot be measured very easily and accurately since the whole spectroradiometer system and more importantly the fiber optic cable is very sensitive to positioning and light displacements and may give different readings if not properly mounted on the other hand the delta ohm radiometer measuring global irradiance in the wavelength region from 327 nm to 384 nm is ideal for routine measurements since it can be mounted on the platform of the cpc photoreactor very easily and it gives very accurate and reproducible readings therefore incident uva irradiance measured by the delta ohm radiometer was correlated with the incident solar spectral irradiance measured by the spectroradiometer for the λ interval from 300 to 350 nm as described in detail in the supplementary material text s4 and then the quantum yield was calculated as explained in the previous paragraphs this method although not entirely accurate it gives a reasonably representative value of the quantum yield 3 2 5 effect of solution ph in further photolysis experiments under natural solar radiation the effect of solution ph was investigated as it can affect the photolysis process changing the molecule configuration and consequently the light absorbing properties of the compounds challis et al 2014 experiments were conducted at two ph values namely 6 and 8 adjusted by 5 mmol l 1 phosphate buffers while the initial concentration of imipenem and meropenem was 1 575 μmol l 1 i e 500 μg l 1 and 0 114 μmol l 1 i e 50 μg l 1 respectively this tight range of ph values was selected because natural waters do not often present values outside these limits experiments were performed in the cpc system and the results are shown in fig s10 in the supplementary material as seen by varying solution ph from 6 0 to 8 0 the first order rate constants of the direct photolysis of both compounds under natural solar radiation remained practically unchanged within the limits of experimental error then the quantum yield was calculated using the approach discussed in detail in the previous section it was found that the values of the quantum yield obtained from the experiments carried out at ph 6 and 8 did not show any noticeable differences to the corresponding values obtained from the direct photolysis of both compounds in upw more specifically for imipenem the quantum yield was 6 2 10 3 and 6 4 10 3 mol einsten 1 for the experiments carried out at ph 6 and 8 respectively while the corresponding average value for the experiments performed in upw was 5 5 10 3 mol einsten 1 table 1 on the other hand the quantum yield for the direct photolysis of meropenem at ph 6 and 8 was 5 1 10 3 and 4 1 10 3 mol einsten 1 respectively while in upw the corresponding average value was 6 5 10 3 mol einsten 1 table 1 these results indicate that solution ph has a rather marginal to negligible effect on the direct photolysis of both compounds under natural solar radiation in the range of values studied in the present work these results can be explained by taking into account the discussion mentioned in section 3 2 1 by changing solution ph from 6 to 8 the ionization of imipenem is practically unaffected and the same is true for meropenem in the ph range from 6 to 7 also at ph 8 the two ionized forms of meropenem i e hmer and mer2 are probably photolyzed with the same rate and therefore no significant changes were observed in the photolysis of the compound in the ph range from 6 to 8 3 2 6 effect of nitrates and humic acids in additional photolysis experiments under natural solar radiation the effect of several constituents of the aqueous matrix was investigated such as nitrates and dom among natural water constituents that are radical producers and scavengers nitrates have been recognized to have a significant effect on photolysis indeed several authors have found that the presence of nitrates accelerates photolysis removal rates of many organic pollutants due to nitrate excitation under uv irradiation that results in the formation of various reactive species including hydroxyl radicals and nitrogen reactive species gligorovski et al 2015 vione et al 2014 based on the above further photolysis experiments of both compounds were performed in upw in the presence of no3 at an initial concentration of 0 484 mmol l 1 i e 30 0 mg l 1 it should be noted that nitrate concentration in natural waters is highly dependent on geographic location and human agriculture activity and has been reported to lie in the range from 10 5 to 10 3 mol l 1 mao et al 2011 two photochemical experiments under natural solar radiation were run in parallel in the cpc system in upw in the absence and the presence of 0 484 mmol l 1 i e 30 0 mg l 1 no3 while the initial concentration of imipenem and meropenem was 1 350 μmol l 1 i e 428 6 μg l 1 and 0 127 μmol l 1 i e 55 5 μg l 1 respectively and the results are shown in fig s11 in the supplementary material as seen negligible differences were found for the experimental runs carried out with and without nitrates for both carbapenem antibiotics more specifically for imipenem the first order rate constant was 9 67 10 5 s 1 for the experiment carried out in the presence of nitrates while the corresponding value for the parallel experiment performed in upw was 1 28 10 4 s 1 in addition the first order rate constant for the photolysis of meropenem in the presence of nitrates was 1 94 10 4 s 1 while in upw the corresponding value was 1 76 10 4 s 1 the above results show that the presence of nitrate ions does not have any significant impact on the direct photolysis of both compounds in upw under natural solar radiation in addition solar irradiation of natural waters containing dom results in the photochemical generation of various transient species such as hydroxyl radicals dom in its triplet state and singlet oxygen among others vione et al 2014 these photogenerated transient species usually play a significant role in the photochemical transformations of organic pollutants in surface waters through various indirect photochemical degradation pathways challis et al 2014 vione et al 2014 yan and song 2014 however at the same time dom is a very efficient hydroxyl radical scavenger and it absorbs solar radiation very efficiently thus acting as a radiation filter in natural waters therefore dom can have either a positive or a negative impact on the photochemical transformation of various organic pollutants in surface waters depending on its chemical structure and its concentration in the present study further photolysis experiments were carried out in upw in the presence of ha at an initial concentration of 5 0 mg l 1 more specifically two photochemical experiments under natural solar radiation were run in parallel in the cpc system in upw in the absence and the presence of 5 0 mg l 1 ha while the initial concentration of imipenem and meropenem was 1 439 μmol l 1 i e 456 8 μg l 1 and 0 122 μmol l 1 i e 53 5 μg l 1 respectively and the results are shown in fig s12 in the supplementary material as seen no significant differences were observed between the experiments carried out with and without ha more specifically the first order rate constant of the photodegradation of imipenem was 1 15 10 4 s 1 for the experiment conducted in the presence of ha while the corresponding value for the parallel experiment performed in upw was 9 69 10 5 s 1 in addition the first order rate constant for the photodegradation of meropenem in the presence of ha was 9 22 10 5 s 1 while in upw the corresponding value was 1 27 10 4 s 1 the above results show that the presence of ha does not have any significant impact on the direct photolysis of both compounds in aqueous solutions under natural solar radiation overall from the experiments conducted in the presence of nitrates and ha it can be concluded that the elimination of both compounds in aqueous solutions under natural solar radiation takes place preferably or almost exclusively through direct photochemical degradation pathways rather than through indirect photochemical processes challis et al 2014 vione et al 2014 yan and song 2014 however it should be noted that in natural surface waters where the water column depth might be in the order of a few meters thus resulting in reduced penetration depth of uv radiation direct photolysis can be strongly inhibited by cdom as well as by other dissolved organic compounds and ions in such cases indirect photochemical reaction pathways triggered by various water components may play a significant role 3 2 7 effect of water matrix additional photolysis experiments of imipenem and meropenem were carried out in two aqueous matrices namely in rw and ww and the results were compared with those obtained in upw more specifically photochemical experiments under natural solar radiation were run in the cpc system at an initial concentration of 0 158 μmol l 1 i e 50 0 μg l 1 and 0 114 μmol l 1 i e 50 0 μg l 1 for imipenem and meropenem respectively and the results are shown in fig s13 in the supplementary material as seen no significant differences were observed for the experiments carried out either in upw or in rw and ww more specifically for imipenem the first order rate constant was 6 55 10 5 s 1 for the experiment carried out in upw while the corresponding value for the experiments conducted in rw and ww were 7 28 10 5 and 8 72 10 5 s 1 respectively in addition the first order rate constant for the direct photolysis of meropenem in upw was 7 31 10 5 s 1 while in rw and ww the corresponding values were 6 33 10 5 and 6 98 10 5 s 1 respectively overall the above results show that the presence of various organic and inorganic constituents in the aqueous matrices do not contribute significantly either positively or negatively to the photochemical degradation of imipenem and meropenem under natural solar radiation however once again it should be noted that when the water column depth is in the order of a few meters several indirect photochemical reaction pathways initiated by various dissolved constituents in the aqueous phase may play a significant role 3 3 photolysis under simulated solar radiation in a final set of photolysis experiments the effect of uva irradiance on the photodegradation of imipenem and meropenem was investigated in aqueous solutions in upw and under simulated solar radiation experiments were carried out in the suntest cps solar simulator so that the irradiance could be controlled and at the same time to keep the temperature constant at about 25 c the irradiance levels tested were in the range from 28 to 50 w m 2 because the uva irradiance at mid latitude is in the order of a few tens w m 2 cabrera reina et al 2014 vione at al 2014 moreover the initial concentration of imipenem and meropenem was 1 281 μmol l 1 i e 406 4 μg l 1 and 0 101 μmol l 1 i e 44 0 μg l 1 respectively and the results are shown in fig 6 as seen the first order rate constants of the direct photolysis of both compounds increased by increasing uva irradiance thus indicating that higher degradation rates were obtained for both compounds when increasing incident solar irradiance moreover the quantum yield for each experimental run and each compound was calculated using the approach discussed in detail in section 3 2 4 and the results are shown in fig 7 as seen for both compounds the photodegradation quantum yield remained practically constant by changing the incident solar irradiance from 28 to 50 w m 2 more specifically the quantum yield was in the range from 1 2 10 3 to 1 3 10 3 mol einsten 1 and from 1 4 10 3 to 1 6 10 3 mol einsten 1 for imipenem and meropenem respectively in the above range of irradiance values it should be noted that these values of the quantum yield calculated under simulated solar radiation were of the same order of magnitude as the corresponding values calculated under natural solar radiation table 1 but slightly smaller i e approximately 4 times smaller for both compounds such a discrepancy can be characterized as rather low to moderate challis et al 2014 similar discrepancies have been reported in the literature and have been attributed to several factors including small differences in the wavelength distribution between natural and simulated i e artificial solar radiation challis et al 2014 another reason for these discrepancies is linked with the calculations that were made in the present work by considering the average values of the molar absorption coefficients of the target pollutants 4 conclusions and outlook the conclusions drawn from the present work can be summarized as follows the photochemical degradation under solar radiation of imipenem and meropenem in aqueous solutions at environmentally relevant concentrations follows first order kinetics the quantum yields of their direct photolysis are in the order of 10 3 mol einsten 1 these relatively high values of the quantum yields show that the photochemical degradation of both compounds is a very critical factor which contributes significantly to their fate in the aquatic environment the photochemical degradation of both compounds in aqueous solutions under solar radiation is not influenced significantly by various parameters such as solution ph and the presence of nitrates humic acids as well as various organic and inorganic constituents of the aqueous matrix the photochemical degradation of both compounds in aqueous solutions under solar radiation takes place preferably or almost exclusively through direct photochemical degradation pathways whereas indirect photolysis reactions due to various photogenerated transient chemical species appear to be rather insignificant upon irradiation of both compounds in aqueous solutions under simulated solar radiation at various levels of incident solar irradiance in the range from 28 to 50 w m 2 the photodegradation quantum yield remained practically constant the quantum yields of the direct photolysis of both compounds under simulated solar radiation were of the same order of magnitude as the corresponding values obtained under natural solar radiation but approximately 4 times smaller such a discrepancy can be attributed to small differences in the wavelength distribution between natural and artificial solar radiation it should be noted that further work is under way to identify the phototransformation products of both compounds employing liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry moreover since it has been reported that photochemical degradation of various β lactam antibiotics results in higher toxicity wang and lin 2012 2014 li and lin 2015

19868,this paper deals with the photochemical fate of two representative carbapenem antibiotics namely imipenem and meropenem in aqueous solutions under solar radiation the analytical method employed for the determination of the target compounds in various aqueous matrices such as ultrapure water municipal wastewater treatment plant effluents and river water at environmentally relevant concentrations was liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometry the absorption spectra of both compounds were measured in aqueous solutions at ph values from 6 to 8 and both compounds showed a rather strong absorption band centered at about 300 nm while their molar absorption coefficient was in the order from 9 103 104 l mol 1 cm 1 the kinetics of the photochemical degradation of the target compounds was studied in aqueous solutions under natural solar radiation in a solar reactor with compound parabolic collectors it was found that the photochemical degradation of both compounds at environmentally relevant concentrations follows first order kinetics and the quantum yield was in the order of 10 3 mol einsten 1 several parameters were studied such as solution ph the presence of nitrate ions and humic acids and the effect of water matrix in all cases it was found that the presence of various organic and inorganic constituents in the aqueous matrices do not contribute significantly either positively or negatively to the photochemical degradation of both compounds under natural solar radiation in a final set of photolysis experiments the effect of the level of irradiance was studied under simulated solar radiation and it was found that the quantum yield for the direct photodegradation of both compounds remained practically constant by changing the incident solar irradiance from 28 to 50 w m 2 graphical abstract image 1 keywords carbapenem antibiotics imipenem meropenem solar radiation photolysis quantum yield 1 introduction in recent years considerable attention has been given to the occurrence and fate of various pharmaceutical compounds in the aquatic environment and in particular to antibiotics michael et al 2013 luo et al 2014 carvalho and santos 2016 richardson and kimura 2016 antibiotics used in human medicine are either excreted metabolized or not by patients or dumped down the drain thus reaching municipal wastewater treatment plants mwwtps however conventional mwwtps are not intentionally designed for the removal of micropollutants including antibiotics therefore human antibiotics are only partially eliminated in mwwtps and they are released into the receiving aquatic bodies and eventually end up in the aquatic environment michael et al 2013 carvalho and santos 2016 indeed several studies have been performed on the occurrence and fate of antibiotics in environmental aqueous matrices and various classes of antibiotics have been detected in low concentrations typically in the order of ng l 1 to μg l 1 michael et al 2013 li 2014 luo et al 2014 carvalho and santos 2016 the most adverse effect attributed to the presence of antibiotics in the environment is the development of both genes and bacteria which are resistant to antibiotics thereby reducing the therapeutic capacity of antibiotics to prevent and treat diseases davies and davies 2010 rizzo et al 2013 manaia et al 2016 numerous national and global agencies and organizations including the european union and the world health organization have recognized antibiotic resistance as one of the most critical challenges of our time in particular mwwtps have been identified as hotspots for the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes into the environment rizzo et al 2013 there are several classes of natural synthetic or semi synthetic antibiotic compounds such as β lactams tetracyclines macrolides aminoglycosides sulfonamides and quinolones among others katzung et al 2012 bicyclic β lactams i e compounds containing the four membered 2 azetidinone ring or β lactam ring fused with another five or six membered heterocyclic ring containing sulfur such as penicillins and cephalosporins were among the first antimicrobial agents available for the therapy of various infectious diseases moreover β lactam antibiotics are currently the most used class of antibacterial agents for the treatment of various infectious diseases katzung et al 2012 however problems related to the development of resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins led to the development of more effective β lactam antibiotics such as carbapenems papp wallace et al 2011 carbapenems are synthetic antibiotics that contain a β lactam ring fused with a dihydropyrrole ring as well as a hydroxyethyl and a sulfur containing side chain representative carbapenems are imipenem meropenem doripenem and ertapenem carbapenems possess the broadest spectrum of activity and the greatest potency against gram positive and gram negative bacteria papp wallace et al 2011 katzung et al 2012 as a result carbapenems are often used as last line agents or antibiotics of last resort when patients with infections become gravely ill or are suspected of harboring resistant bacteria papp wallace et al 2011 unfortunately recently it has been discovered that some gram negative bacteria have developed resistance to carbapenems kumarasamy et al 2010 which is now spreading throughout the world and seriously threatens the efficiency of this essential class of life saving antibiotics papp wallace et al 2011 organic micropollutants including pharmaceuticals undergo several transformation processes in the aquatic environment including biotic such as biodegradation and bioaccumulation and abiotic such as hydrolysis photolysis oxidation and adsorption transformations wang and lin 2012 schwarzenbach et al 2017 photochemical degradation induced by solar radiation allows natural attenuation of pharmaceuticals and many other micropollutants both in surface waters and in wastewaters thus diminishing their detected concentrations in the aquatic environment challis et al 2014 yan and song 2014 in general it has been found that the effectiveness of photodecomposition depends on the integrative effects of photon flux the structure of the target molecule and the composition of the water matrix challis et al 2014 yan and song 2014 several recent studies have been performed on the photolysis of various pharmaceutical compounds in the aquatic environment challis et al 2014 yan and song 2014 including β lactam antibiotics andreozzi et al 2004 jiang et al 2010 xu et al 2011 carlos et al 2012 wang and lin 2012 2014 li and lin 2015 moreover recently meropenem has been found in mwwtps influents and effluents tran et al 2016a 2016b while imipenem was found in hospital wastewater effluents szekeres et al 2017 based on the above the aim of the present work was to study the photolytic degradation under solar radiation of two representative carbapenems namely imipenem and meropenem in aqueous solutions since solar photodegradation is an important natural attenuation process both in surface waters and in wastewaters the effect of various parameters was investigated such as initial antibiotics concentration ph of the solution the addition of nitrates and dissolved organic matter dom water matrix and level of irradiance the analysis of the kinetic data obtained from the above experiments made it possible to calculate the quantum yield of the photolysis of both compounds in aqueous solutions under solar radiation it should be noted that to the best of our knowledge the photolytic degradation of carbapenem antibiotics in aqueous solutions under solar radiation has not been reported in the literature yet 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials reagents and materials used in the present work are given in the supplementary material the chemical structures of imipenem monohydrate and meropenem trihydrate are shown in fig 1 for the development of the analytical methods individual stock standard solutions of each antibiotic were prepared in methanol at a concentration of 1000 mg l 1 and stored in amber screw capped glass vials at 20 c and in the dark for a maximum period of three weeks 2 2 aqueous matrices and solutions preparation experiments were carried out in three aqueous matrices namely i ultrapure water upw ii river water rw collected from andarax river near to padules almería spain and iii simulated mwwtp effluent ww the detailed composition of the ww and the main characteristics of each aqueous matrix are given in the supplementary material for the photolysis experiments aqueous solutions were prepared daily by dissolving the appropriate amounts of both antibiotics in the corresponding aqueous matrix the exact initial concentrations of the resulting aqueous solutions were measured by liquid chromatography vide infra and they were in the range from a few μg l 1 to a few hundred μg l 1 for both compounds these concentrations are considered as environmentally relevant since several pharmaceutical compounds have been identified in the aquatic environment in this range of concentrations luo et al 2014 richardson and kimura 2016 it should be emphasized that no organic solvents were used for the preparation of the aqueous solutions used for the irradiation experiments to avoid any complications resulting from the presence of organic solvents that may quench photogenerated transient species challis et al 2014 2 3 photolysis experiments under natural solar radiation photolysis experiments under natural solar radiation were carried out in a solar reactor with compound parabolic collectors cpc as shown in fig 2 this pilot plant consists of two twin photoreactors each one made of two pyrex glass tubes length 1 5 m inner diameter 45 mm thickness 2 5 mm fitted onto the focus of two cpc mirrors each with a 0 21 m2 illuminated surface i e the total illuminated surface of each photoreactor is equal to 0 42 m2 moreover the illuminated volume of each photoreactor is equal to 4 77 l it should be emphasized that cpc are non concentrating devices that is they are one sun equivalent and they are employed to distribute solar radiation on the surface of the tubes evenly modules are facing south and tilted at 37 from the horizontal local latitude aqueous solutions are driven by a centrifugal pump pan world nh 40px model and maintained in recirculation the crison 5335 sensors were used for ph monitoring while incident uva irradiance in w m 2 was measured employing a global uv radiometer delta ohm lp uva 02 av with a spectral response range from 327 nm to 384 nm mounted on a platform tilted at 37 the uva irradiance measurements were acquired throughout the entire experiments using a data acquisition card labjack u12 connected to a computer moreover the incident solar spectral irradiance was measured employing a spectroradiometer avaspec uls2048 2 purchased from avantes chemical actinometry was used for the calculation of the effective path length of radiation of the photoreactor employing p nitroanisole and pyridine dulin and mill 1982 laszakovits et al 2017 as described in detail in the supplementary material text s5 experiments under natural solar radiation were carried out during september 2014 from approximately 10 a m to 3 p m in sunny days and under clear sky conditions as expected the incident uva irradiance varied almost every minute and from day to day consequently for each experimental run the average uva irradiance was calculated by integrating the values recorded over the time of the experiments in all cases where the effect of various parameters on the photolytic degradation of both compounds was studied experiments were performed either in parallel or on successive days at about the same time in all cases it was found that the average uva irradiance of each experimental run did not differ significantly from one experiment to the other in a typical experimental run 7 l of the corresponding water matrix containing the target compounds at the desired initial concentration were loaded into the recirculation tanks of the cpc reactor while the cpc system was covered and kept in the dark after 15 min of recirculation in the dark for achieving perfect mixing conditions the cpc system was uncovered and at the same time started the acquisition of uva irradiance data samples periodically taken were analyzed for residual imipenem and meropenem concentration control experiments were performed in the dark to assess the possible hydrolysis of the target compounds by stirring aqueous solutions of both compounds in the aqueous matrices for more than 5 h at room temperature in all cases it was found that the hydrolysis of the target compounds was rather negligible after 5 h stirring in the dark 2 4 photolysis experiments under simulated solar radiation additional photolysis experiments by varying incident irradiance at predetermined levels were performed employing a suntest cps solar simulator purchased from atlas this solar simulator employs a xenon lamp with an emission range from 250 to 765 w m 2 complete emission spectrum and an emission wavelength from 300 to 800 nm experiments were carried out in a jacketed stirred tank reactor placed inside the suntest cps solar box which allowed water temperature to be controlled as shown in fig 3 the volume of this reactor was 0 500 l and the liquid depth was 7 0 cm while the surface area exposed to radiation was 7 14 10 3 m2 uva irradiance inside the solar box was measured with a pma2100 radiometer employing a uva sensor with spectral response in the 320 400 nm range purchased from solar light company the temperature of the reaction mixture was kept constant at 25 0 0 2 c using a thermostatic bath thermo scientific neslab rte7 2 5 analytical measurements the concentration of both micro contaminants in upw was monitored by hplc uv employing a c18 1 8 μm 4 6 50 mm analytical column and the injection volume was 100 μl for the determination of the analytes in more complex samples i e in rw and ww or at lower initial concentrations a more sensitive lc ms system was employed consisting of a hplc qtrap ms system the detailed description of the analytical methods is given in the supplementary material text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization and validation of the lc ms ms analytical method a careful optimization of the lc ms ms parameters was performed to obtain appropriate selectivity and sensibility for the analysis of target compounds in ww and rw as both target analytes are amphoteric and polar the ph of the mobile phases represented a critical factor in their chromatographic analysis different mobile phases and ph values were tested the best results regarding intensity resolution and peak shape were found with water 0 001 v v formic acid and methanol moreover the method was validated in terms of linearity sensitivity expressed as limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq matrix effects and precision loqs obtained were 2 3 orders of magnitude lower than that achieved by hplc uv matrix matched calibration was selected as calibration procedure to minimize the signal suppression effects observed mainly in the case of imipenem in ww the detailed description of the optimization and validation of the lc ms ms analytical method is given in the supplementary material text s3 3 2 photolysis under natural solar radiation 3 2 1 molar absorption coefficients of imipenem and meropenem the molar absorption coefficient ε λ in l mol 1 cm 1 expresses the ability of a compound to absorb radiation at a specific wavelength λ therefore the molar absorption coefficients of imipenem and meropenem were measured according to the beer lambert law in the uv region of the electromagnetic spectrum in aqueous solutions and at ph values from 6 to 8 adjusted by 20 mmol l 1 phosphate buffers and the results are shown in fig 4 moreover fig 4 also shows the incident solar spectral irradiance as it was measured by the spectroradiometer on the 14th of june 2017 at 14 14 local time in almeria spain as seen the absorption spectrum of both compounds extends to the uva region of the electromagnetic spectrum more specifically they both show a rather strong absorption band centered at about 300 nm as well as a relatively strong continuous absorption band below approximately 240 nm also as seen in fig 4 the ph of the solution in the range from 6 to 8 has a rather marginal effect on the absorption spectrum of both compounds more specifically as seen in fig 4a imipenem shows a rather strong absorption band centered at 299 nm and the molar absorption coefficient slightly decreases from 9300 to 9000 l mol 1 cm 1 by increasing the ph of the solution from 6 to 8 on the other hand meropenem shows a small bathochromic shift i e red shift and a hyperchromic effect and the wavelength of maximum absorption increases from 297 to 301 nm by increasing the ph of the solution from 6 to 8 while the molar absorption coefficient slightly increases from 10 700 to 11 000 l mol 1 cm 1 these results can be explained if we take into account the ionization constants of both compounds as seen in fig 1 both compounds have two pka values the first one is at about 4 3 for both compounds and corresponds to the acidic hydrogen of the carboxyl group of both molecules while the second one is at about 10 6 and 8 3 for imipenem and meropenem respectively and corresponds to an additional acidic hydrogen based on these pka values the fractional composition of the various molecular forms of both compounds was calculated as a function of the ph of the solution and the results are shown in figs s1 and s2 in the supplementary material as seen in the ph range from 6 to 8 imipenem exists predominately i e more than 98 in the single ionized form i e himi while in the ph range from 6 to 7 meropenem exists predominately i e more than 95 in the single ionized form i e hmer and at ph 8 it exists at about 67 in the single ionized form and 33 in the double ionized form i e mer2 consequently by changing solution ph from 6 to 8 no significant differences were observed in the absorption spectra of imipenem as the ionization of the molecule remains practically constant while for meropenem the two ionized forms i e hmer and mer2 are likely to have almost similar absorption spectra and hence relatively small differences were also observed in its absorption spectra based on the above absorption spectra of both compounds and on the fact that the solar radiation reaching the surface of the earth contains uv radiation in the uva and uvb region of the electromagnetic spectrum i e as can be seen in fig 4 for practical purposes radiation with wavelengths higher than 300 nm challis et al 2014 it is concluded that direct photolysis of both compounds under solar irradiation is possible in addition the average values of the molar absorption coefficient for each compound ε aver were calculated for the λ interval from 300 to 350 nm i e to the maximum wavelength in which they absorb in the uva region of the electromagnetic spectrum using the following eq 1 1 ε aver λ 300 nm λ max ε λ δ λ λ max 300 where λ max is the maximum wavelength in which they absorb in the uva region of the electromagnetic spectrum i e 350 nm and δλ 1 nm is the wavelength interval used in the spectrophotometer for the measurement of ε λ the average values of the molar absorption coefficient of both compounds are given in table s5 in the supplementary material and they will be used for the calculation of the quantum yield of their photolysis under solar radiation vide infra 3 2 2 direct photolysis under natural solar radiation in an initial set of direct photolysis experiments aqueous solutions of imipenem and meropenem in upw at inherent solution ph i e approximately 6 6 and in various initial concentrations were irradiated in the cpc system under natural solar radiation it should be noted that the ph of the solution was left uncontrolled and it was practically stable during the course of the reaction experiments were conducted by varying the initial concentration in the range from 0 0224 μmol l 1 i e 7 12 μg l 1 to 1 016 μmol l 1 i e 322 4 μg l 1 for imipenem and from 0 0136 μmol l 1 i e 5 96 μg l 1 to 0 7367 μmol l 1 i e 322 3 μg l 1 for meropenem and the results are shown in fig 5 a and b for imipenem and meropenem respectively as seen both compounds were readily degraded photochemically under natural solar radiation even at the relatively higher concentrations employed in the present work more specifically the photodegradation of meropenem was slightly higher i e approximately 93 than the corresponding photodegradation of imipenem i e approximately 88 after 300 min irradiation under natural solar radiation it should be noted that control experiments were performed in the dark and it was found that both compounds were rather stable after 5 h stirring of their aqueous solutions in the dark therefore the above results indicate that the observed degradation of both compounds can be attributed to their direct photolysis under natural solar radiation the above results show that photodegradation under natural solar radiation is a factor that may contribute significantly to the fate of these compounds when they are released to the aquatic environment 3 2 3 photodegradation kinetics as seen in fig 5a and b the rate of the photochemical degradation of both compounds under natural solar radiation remained practically constant within the limits of experimental error by varying the initial concentration from 0 0224 μmol l 1 i e 7 12 μg l 1 to 1 016 μmol l 1 i e 322 4 μg l 1 for imipenem and from 0 0136 μmol l 1 i e 5 96 μg l 1 to 0 7367 μmol l 1 i e 322 3 μg l 1 for meropenem these results indicate that at the experimental conditions employed in the present work the direct photolysis of both compounds in aqueous solutions in upw under natural solar radiation follows first order kinetics it has been well documented in the literature that the rate of the direct photochemical degradation of organic micropollutants in the aqueous phase at wavelength λ r λ in mol l 1 s 1 is given by the following equation zepp 1978 leifer 1988 beltrán et al 1995 2 r λ d c d t λ e n p o 0 s v 1 10 α λ ε λ c l ε λ c α λ ε λ c φ λ where c is the reactant concentration in mol l 1 e n p o 0 is the incident photon fluence rate on a chemical amount basis defined as the total number of moles of photons i e einsteins incident from all directions onto a small sphere divided by the cross sectional area of the sphere and per time interval in mol m 2 s 1 or einstein m 2 s 1 bolton and stefan 2002 braslavsky 2007 s is the surface area of the photochemical reactor exposed to radiation in m2 and v is the volume of the photochemical reactor in l α λ is the attenuation coefficient of the medium i e solvent at wavelength λ in cm 1 ε λ is the molar absorption coefficient of the reactant at wavelength λ in l mol 1 cm 1 l is the effective radiation absorption path length of the photochemical reactor in cm and φ λ is the quantum yield of the direct photochemical degradation of the micro pollutant at wavelength λ dimensionless or mol einsten 1 however in dilute aqueous solutions when radiation is weakly absorbed by the system i e when the absorbance is lower than 0 04 eq 2 simplifies to zepp 1978 leifer 1988 beltrán et al 1995 3 r λ d c d t λ 2 303 e n p o 0 s v l ε λ φ λ c then if we set 4 k 1 λ 2 303 e n p o 0 s v l ε λ φ λ eq 3 can be written as 5 d c d t λ k 1 λ c which corresponds to a first order kinetic rate law therefore in dilute aqueous solutions where the reactant weakly absorbs radiation the direct photolysis of the reactant follows first order kinetics zepp 1978 leifer 1988 beltrán et al 1995 eq 5 after integration at the boundary conditions yields the well known expression of the first order rate law 6 ln c c 0 k 1 λ t where c 0 is the initial concentration of the reactant in mol l 1 and k 1 λ 2 303 e n p o 0 s v lε λ φ λ is the first order rate constant of the direct photolysis of the reactant in s 1 the insets in fig 5 show the plot of ln c c 0 versus time for both compounds while table 1 shows the corresponding values of the first order rate constants and the correlation coefficients r2 as seen in table 1 under the experimental conditions employed in the present work the first order rate constants for the direct photolysis of imipenem in upw under natural solar radiation were in the range from 1 12 10 4 to 1 17 10 4 s 1 while the corresponding values for meropenem were in the range from 1 42 10 4 to 1 60 10 4 s 1 moreover the corresponding correlation coefficients r2 were always higher than 0 98 thus showing the relative good fitting of the experimental results to the first order kinetic rate law for both compounds in addition as seen in table 1 for each compound the first order rate constants obtained from the experiments conducted at various initial concentrations have minimal variance and the average values of the first order rate constant were 1 15 10 4 and 1 52 10 4 s 1 for imipenem and meropenem respectively while percent relative standard deviation rsd was 2 3 and 6 0 for imipenem and meropenem respectively 3 2 4 determination of the quantum yield the first order rate constants of both compounds determined in the previous section mainly depend on the experimental conditions employed in the photodegradation experiments such as the geometry of the photochemical reactor and the incident solar irradiance on the photochemical reactor therefore a more fundamental photochemical parameter is needed such as quantum yield to describe more adequately the photochemical fate of the compounds under investigation challis et al 2014 the quantum yield at wavelength λ φ λ determines the efficiency of a photochemical reaction and is defined as the number of moles of a compound that are transformed per number of moles of photons i e einsteins that are absorbed by the compound braslavsky 2007 in the present work the quantum yield of the direct photolysis of both compounds in aqueous solutions in upw under natural solar radiation was determined using eq 4 more specifically by solving eq 4 with respect to the quantum yield eq 4 can be written as follows zepp 1978 7 φ λ k 1 λ 2 303 e n p o 0 s v l ε λ it should be noted that in the above equation e n p o 0 is the incident photon fluence rate in the wavelength range from 300 to 350 nm while the molar absorption coefficient for each compound is the average value calculated for the λ interval from 300 to 350 nm using eq 1 and given in table s5 in the supplementary material for each experimental run e n p o 0 was calculated using the average incident uva irradiance measured by the radiometer as described in detail in text s4 in the supplementary material moreover the average effective path length of radiation of the cpc photochemical reactors was equal to l 0 93 cm as described in detail in text s5 in the supplementary material by substituting these values into the above eq 7 as well as the values of the first order rate constants determined in the previous section the quantum yields of the direct photolysis of both compounds were determined and the values are shown in table 1 as seen the average values of the quantum yield were 5 5 10 3 and 6 5 10 3 mol einsten 1 for imipenem and meropenem respectively while the corresponding rsd was 1 0 and 7 1 these values of the quantum yield are rather moderate to high since the quantum yields of the direct photolysis under solar radiation of various pharmaceutical compounds including β lactam antibiotics have been typically reported to be in the order from 10 6 to 10 2 mol einsten 1 carlos et al 2012 wang and lin 2012 challis et al 2014 these results confirm that indeed photochemical degradation of both compounds is an important factor determining their fate in the aquatic environment it should be emphasized that quantum yields are fundamental photochemical parameters of the studied antibiotics and they were obtained under controlled conditions in a cpc photoreactor to quantify radiation absorption and change in target compound concentration better therefore results are applicable under real environmental conditions whenever radiation absorption can be evaluated such as in wastewaters and in surface waters including river waters at this point it should be noted that for the calculation of the quantum yield it would be more accurate to measure the incident solar spectral irradiance for every experimental run however for routine measurements incident solar spectral irradiance cannot be measured very easily and accurately since the whole spectroradiometer system and more importantly the fiber optic cable is very sensitive to positioning and light displacements and may give different readings if not properly mounted on the other hand the delta ohm radiometer measuring global irradiance in the wavelength region from 327 nm to 384 nm is ideal for routine measurements since it can be mounted on the platform of the cpc photoreactor very easily and it gives very accurate and reproducible readings therefore incident uva irradiance measured by the delta ohm radiometer was correlated with the incident solar spectral irradiance measured by the spectroradiometer for the λ interval from 300 to 350 nm as described in detail in the supplementary material text s4 and then the quantum yield was calculated as explained in the previous paragraphs this method although not entirely accurate it gives a reasonably representative value of the quantum yield 3 2 5 effect of solution ph in further photolysis experiments under natural solar radiation the effect of solution ph was investigated as it can affect the photolysis process changing the molecule configuration and consequently the light absorbing properties of the compounds challis et al 2014 experiments were conducted at two ph values namely 6 and 8 adjusted by 5 mmol l 1 phosphate buffers while the initial concentration of imipenem and meropenem was 1 575 μmol l 1 i e 500 μg l 1 and 0 114 μmol l 1 i e 50 μg l 1 respectively this tight range of ph values was selected because natural waters do not often present values outside these limits experiments were performed in the cpc system and the results are shown in fig s10 in the supplementary material as seen by varying solution ph from 6 0 to 8 0 the first order rate constants of the direct photolysis of both compounds under natural solar radiation remained practically unchanged within the limits of experimental error then the quantum yield was calculated using the approach discussed in detail in the previous section it was found that the values of the quantum yield obtained from the experiments carried out at ph 6 and 8 did not show any noticeable differences to the corresponding values obtained from the direct photolysis of both compounds in upw more specifically for imipenem the quantum yield was 6 2 10 3 and 6 4 10 3 mol einsten 1 for the experiments carried out at ph 6 and 8 respectively while the corresponding average value for the experiments performed in upw was 5 5 10 3 mol einsten 1 table 1 on the other hand the quantum yield for the direct photolysis of meropenem at ph 6 and 8 was 5 1 10 3 and 4 1 10 3 mol einsten 1 respectively while in upw the corresponding average value was 6 5 10 3 mol einsten 1 table 1 these results indicate that solution ph has a rather marginal to negligible effect on the direct photolysis of both compounds under natural solar radiation in the range of values studied in the present work these results can be explained by taking into account the discussion mentioned in section 3 2 1 by changing solution ph from 6 to 8 the ionization of imipenem is practically unaffected and the same is true for meropenem in the ph range from 6 to 7 also at ph 8 the two ionized forms of meropenem i e hmer and mer2 are probably photolyzed with the same rate and therefore no significant changes were observed in the photolysis of the compound in the ph range from 6 to 8 3 2 6 effect of nitrates and humic acids in additional photolysis experiments under natural solar radiation the effect of several constituents of the aqueous matrix was investigated such as nitrates and dom among natural water constituents that are radical producers and scavengers nitrates have been recognized to have a significant effect on photolysis indeed several authors have found that the presence of nitrates accelerates photolysis removal rates of many organic pollutants due to nitrate excitation under uv irradiation that results in the formation of various reactive species including hydroxyl radicals and nitrogen reactive species gligorovski et al 2015 vione et al 2014 based on the above further photolysis experiments of both compounds were performed in upw in the presence of no3 at an initial concentration of 0 484 mmol l 1 i e 30 0 mg l 1 it should be noted that nitrate concentration in natural waters is highly dependent on geographic location and human agriculture activity and has been reported to lie in the range from 10 5 to 10 3 mol l 1 mao et al 2011 two photochemical experiments under natural solar radiation were run in parallel in the cpc system in upw in the absence and the presence of 0 484 mmol l 1 i e 30 0 mg l 1 no3 while the initial concentration of imipenem and meropenem was 1 350 μmol l 1 i e 428 6 μg l 1 and 0 127 μmol l 1 i e 55 5 μg l 1 respectively and the results are shown in fig s11 in the supplementary material as seen negligible differences were found for the experimental runs carried out with and without nitrates for both carbapenem antibiotics more specifically for imipenem the first order rate constant was 9 67 10 5 s 1 for the experiment carried out in the presence of nitrates while the corresponding value for the parallel experiment performed in upw was 1 28 10 4 s 1 in addition the first order rate constant for the photolysis of meropenem in the presence of nitrates was 1 94 10 4 s 1 while in upw the corresponding value was 1 76 10 4 s 1 the above results show that the presence of nitrate ions does not have any significant impact on the direct photolysis of both compounds in upw under natural solar radiation in addition solar irradiation of natural waters containing dom results in the photochemical generation of various transient species such as hydroxyl radicals dom in its triplet state and singlet oxygen among others vione et al 2014 these photogenerated transient species usually play a significant role in the photochemical transformations of organic pollutants in surface waters through various indirect photochemical degradation pathways challis et al 2014 vione et al 2014 yan and song 2014 however at the same time dom is a very efficient hydroxyl radical scavenger and it absorbs solar radiation very efficiently thus acting as a radiation filter in natural waters therefore dom can have either a positive or a negative impact on the photochemical transformation of various organic pollutants in surface waters depending on its chemical structure and its concentration in the present study further photolysis experiments were carried out in upw in the presence of ha at an initial concentration of 5 0 mg l 1 more specifically two photochemical experiments under natural solar radiation were run in parallel in the cpc system in upw in the absence and the presence of 5 0 mg l 1 ha while the initial concentration of imipenem and meropenem was 1 439 μmol l 1 i e 456 8 μg l 1 and 0 122 μmol l 1 i e 53 5 μg l 1 respectively and the results are shown in fig s12 in the supplementary material as seen no significant differences were observed between the experiments carried out with and without ha more specifically the first order rate constant of the photodegradation of imipenem was 1 15 10 4 s 1 for the experiment conducted in the presence of ha while the corresponding value for the parallel experiment performed in upw was 9 69 10 5 s 1 in addition the first order rate constant for the photodegradation of meropenem in the presence of ha was 9 22 10 5 s 1 while in upw the corresponding value was 1 27 10 4 s 1 the above results show that the presence of ha does not have any significant impact on the direct photolysis of both compounds in aqueous solutions under natural solar radiation overall from the experiments conducted in the presence of nitrates and ha it can be concluded that the elimination of both compounds in aqueous solutions under natural solar radiation takes place preferably or almost exclusively through direct photochemical degradation pathways rather than through indirect photochemical processes challis et al 2014 vione et al 2014 yan and song 2014 however it should be noted that in natural surface waters where the water column depth might be in the order of a few meters thus resulting in reduced penetration depth of uv radiation direct photolysis can be strongly inhibited by cdom as well as by other dissolved organic compounds and ions in such cases indirect photochemical reaction pathways triggered by various water components may play a significant role 3 2 7 effect of water matrix additional photolysis experiments of imipenem and meropenem were carried out in two aqueous matrices namely in rw and ww and the results were compared with those obtained in upw more specifically photochemical experiments under natural solar radiation were run in the cpc system at an initial concentration of 0 158 μmol l 1 i e 50 0 μg l 1 and 0 114 μmol l 1 i e 50 0 μg l 1 for imipenem and meropenem respectively and the results are shown in fig s13 in the supplementary material as seen no significant differences were observed for the experiments carried out either in upw or in rw and ww more specifically for imipenem the first order rate constant was 6 55 10 5 s 1 for the experiment carried out in upw while the corresponding value for the experiments conducted in rw and ww were 7 28 10 5 and 8 72 10 5 s 1 respectively in addition the first order rate constant for the direct photolysis of meropenem in upw was 7 31 10 5 s 1 while in rw and ww the corresponding values were 6 33 10 5 and 6 98 10 5 s 1 respectively overall the above results show that the presence of various organic and inorganic constituents in the aqueous matrices do not contribute significantly either positively or negatively to the photochemical degradation of imipenem and meropenem under natural solar radiation however once again it should be noted that when the water column depth is in the order of a few meters several indirect photochemical reaction pathways initiated by various dissolved constituents in the aqueous phase may play a significant role 3 3 photolysis under simulated solar radiation in a final set of photolysis experiments the effect of uva irradiance on the photodegradation of imipenem and meropenem was investigated in aqueous solutions in upw and under simulated solar radiation experiments were carried out in the suntest cps solar simulator so that the irradiance could be controlled and at the same time to keep the temperature constant at about 25 c the irradiance levels tested were in the range from 28 to 50 w m 2 because the uva irradiance at mid latitude is in the order of a few tens w m 2 cabrera reina et al 2014 vione at al 2014 moreover the initial concentration of imipenem and meropenem was 1 281 μmol l 1 i e 406 4 μg l 1 and 0 101 μmol l 1 i e 44 0 μg l 1 respectively and the results are shown in fig 6 as seen the first order rate constants of the direct photolysis of both compounds increased by increasing uva irradiance thus indicating that higher degradation rates were obtained for both compounds when increasing incident solar irradiance moreover the quantum yield for each experimental run and each compound was calculated using the approach discussed in detail in section 3 2 4 and the results are shown in fig 7 as seen for both compounds the photodegradation quantum yield remained practically constant by changing the incident solar irradiance from 28 to 50 w m 2 more specifically the quantum yield was in the range from 1 2 10 3 to 1 3 10 3 mol einsten 1 and from 1 4 10 3 to 1 6 10 3 mol einsten 1 for imipenem and meropenem respectively in the above range of irradiance values it should be noted that these values of the quantum yield calculated under simulated solar radiation were of the same order of magnitude as the corresponding values calculated under natural solar radiation table 1 but slightly smaller i e approximately 4 times smaller for both compounds such a discrepancy can be characterized as rather low to moderate challis et al 2014 similar discrepancies have been reported in the literature and have been attributed to several factors including small differences in the wavelength distribution between natural and simulated i e artificial solar radiation challis et al 2014 another reason for these discrepancies is linked with the calculations that were made in the present work by considering the average values of the molar absorption coefficients of the target pollutants 4 conclusions and outlook the conclusions drawn from the present work can be summarized as follows the photochemical degradation under solar radiation of imipenem and meropenem in aqueous solutions at environmentally relevant concentrations follows first order kinetics the quantum yields of their direct photolysis are in the order of 10 3 mol einsten 1 these relatively high values of the quantum yields show that the photochemical degradation of both compounds is a very critical factor which contributes significantly to their fate in the aquatic environment the photochemical degradation of both compounds in aqueous solutions under solar radiation is not influenced significantly by various parameters such as solution ph and the presence of nitrates humic acids as well as various organic and inorganic constituents of the aqueous matrix the photochemical degradation of both compounds in aqueous solutions under solar radiation takes place preferably or almost exclusively through direct photochemical degradation pathways whereas indirect photolysis reactions due to various photogenerated transient chemical species appear to be rather insignificant upon irradiation of both compounds in aqueous solutions under simulated solar radiation at various levels of incident solar irradiance in the range from 28 to 50 w m 2 the photodegradation quantum yield remained practically constant the quantum yields of the direct photolysis of both compounds under simulated solar radiation were of the same order of magnitude as the corresponding values obtained under natural solar radiation but approximately 4 times smaller such a discrepancy can be attributed to small differences in the wavelength distribution between natural and artificial solar radiation it should be noted that further work is under way to identify the phototransformation products of both compounds employing liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry moreover since it has been reported that photochemical degradation of various β lactam antibiotics results in higher toxicity wang and lin 2012 2014 li and lin 2015

19869,for millions of people worldwide sewage polluted surface waters threaten water security food security and human health yet the extent of the problem and its causes are poorly understood given rapid widespread global urbanisation the impact of urban versus rural populations is particularly important but unknown exploiting previously unpublished archival data for the ganga ganges catchment we find a strong non linear relationship between upstream population density and microbial pollution and predict that these river systems would fail faecal coliform standards for irrigation waters available to 79 of the catchment s 500 million inhabitants overall this work shows that microbial pollution is conditioned by the continental scale network structure of rivers compounded by the location of cities whose growing populations contribute c 100 times more microbial pollutants per capita than their rural counterparts keywords faecal coliform river network population density catchment scale 1 background rising demands on water resources raise concerns about the sustainable provision of clean water worldwide unclean water poses significant risks of diarrhoea opportunistic infections and consequent malnutrition accounting for 1 7 million deaths annually of which 90 are in developing countries and almost half are children prüss ustün et al 2014 these deaths are primarily due to ingestion of faecal pathogens from humans or animals ashbolt 2004 kotloff et al 2013 prüss ustün et al 2014 india s growing population and economy are driving rapid urbanisation 30 of the population now live in urban areas census of india 2011a and exerting increased pressure on surface and groundwater availability in rural areas 67 of the population defecate in the open census of india 2011b a practice that poses severe risk to health and safety clasen et al 2010 mara et al 2010 ziegelbauer et al 2012 kotloff et al 2013 in urban areas 80 of the population have access to a toilet census of india 2011b but only 30 are connected to a sewage pipeline and few pipelines are connected to a treatment plant narain 2012 the impact of these sanitation problems on surface water quality has been documented for many years at individual sample locations or river reaches across india bhargava 1983 mukherjee et al 1993 baghel et al 2005 mishra et al 2009 central pollution control board 2010 however there has been no catchment wide quantification of the problem and limited indication of what is driving it the former is essential to fully understand the scale of intervention required while the latter might inform decision making on what to do where urban areas often dominate the microbial pollution signal in rivers tchobanoglous et al 1991 kay et al 2008 mcgrane et al 2014 but there is little consensus on the extent to which this reflects an increased impact per capita or simply a larger population and thus source this difference is important since a higher per capita impact indicates reduced attenuation perhaps due to more efficient delivery to the river system or less efficient treatment if the difference can be attributed to per capita contribution this will define the extent to which urban or rural focused interventions will improve surface water quality we address this question using archival water quality data from across the ganga ganges catchment and show the pattern of microbial pollution in its major rivers we compare instream concentrations of a pollution proxy with upstream densities of the two major sources of faecal pathogens humans and livestock at 100 sites spanning an approximate surface area of 106 km2 faecal pathogens are difficult to measure however thermo tolerant coliforms which originate in faeces i e faecal coliforms fc are easily detectable and routinely monitored as indicator organisms ashbolt et al 2001 fcs are not a perfect predictor of human pathogen presence rather they establish connectivity between defecation and some receiving environment which could be contributed to by a pathogen carrier new host specific tracing techniques allow more precise tracking of microbial pollution sources that can help to better assess risks to human health harwood et al 2014 field and samadpour 2007 however such techniques are not used within routine monitoring in india and thus do not have the spatial coverage required for our analysis furthermore the use of fcs for monitoring pollution is still regarded as a viable measure of drinking and irrigation water quality who 2017 two key issues that must be addressed are 1 the extent to which the fc signal that we observe reflects human sources and 2 the potential impact of fc die off in our pollution tracer upstream livestock and human population densities are strongly correlated at the catchment scale limiting our capacity to identify the source of the pollution signal to address this we seek to de correlate the predictor variables by using a mixing model to estimate contributions from each non overlapping segment of the catchment our sub catchments to address the impact of die off in our pollution tracer we adjust the population and livestock densities using a distance decay function then seek decay parameters that will maximise performance of our statistical model in the sections that follow we first introduce our null hypothesis that pollution should be linearly related to source density both with and without accounting for die off we then detail our data sources and methods for their analysis and introduce the mixing model that we use to calculate effective fc concentrations and source densities for each sub catchment the non overlapping segments of the catchment 2 theory expected relationship between fc concentration and upstream source density with and without die off the fc concentration cfc at a given location is defined by the ratio of the fc flux qfc to the water flux qw 1 c f c q f c q w under the assumption that there is no die off in fcs over time the fc flux is calculated from 2 q f c p h n h p a n a p h ρ h p a ρ a a where ph is the production rate of fcs per human head mpn 1 t 1 pa is the production rate per head of livestock mpn 1 t 1 nh and na are the total upstream populations of humans and livestock respectively ρh and ρa are the upstream population densities of humans and livestock respectively l 2 and a is the catchment area l2 under the assumption of spatially uniform and time invariant runoff rw l t 1 the water flux qw l3 t 1 is calculated from 3 q w r w a substituting equations 2 and 3 into equation 1 gives the following equation for fc concentration at each measurement point as a function of upstream population density 4 c f c p h ρ h p a ρ a r w k h ρ h k a ρ a where kh ph rw and ka pa rw it is clear from this relationship that under these assumptions cfc should be a linear function of upstream population and livestock density with the gradients defined by the ratio of production rate p to runoff rw the assumption of no fc die off is unlikely to be true but controls on die off remain poorly understood given the uncertainties die off is most often represented using an exponential decay based on first order kinetics crane and moore 1986 sadeghi and arnold 2002 cho et al 2012 5 q f c q 0 e k 1 t where q0 is the fc flux at time t0 the time of exit from the gut mpn t 1 t is time since exit t k1 is a decay coefficient t 1 assuming uniform time invariant fc velocity from source to measurement point the fc flux qfc can be expressed as a function of distance 6 q f c q 0 e k 1 x v where x is the travel distance from source to measurement point l and v is the characteristic velocity l t 1 changing population of people or livestock with distance x upstream of the sampling point can be calculated as the derivative of n x 7 n x d n d x ρ x d a d x a x d ρ d x assuming that fc production rates are time invariant and incorporating characteristic velocity into the decay coefficient to express decay in terms of distance the fc flux can be calculated by combining equations 2 6 and 7 and integrating over the range of travel

c e l l s ρ h i e k x i k a i 1 n c e l l s ρ a i e k x i where kh ph rw and ka pa rw re arranged in this form equation 11 shows that accounting for fc die off cfc remains a linear function of population and livestock density transformed to account for flowpath length as in the no die off case equation 4 the linear coefficients reflect the ratio of human or livestock production rate to runoff 3 methods we used water quality samples from 100 locations across the ganga catchment fig 1 collected and analysed by six agencies following a uniform protocol total and faecal coliform concentrations were estimated using the standardised 9221 b and 9221 e multiple tube fermentation techniques apha 1995 to establish the most probable number mpn of faecal coliforms per 100 ml at each site we collated 10 years of data 2002 2012 the frequency with which these data were sampled varies between sites from three samples per year at the two most remote himalayan sites to quarterly for 24 more himalayan sites and one or two samples per month at the remaining sites at 30 sites samples were collected at two locations across the river in some years in order to improve representation these data were quality checked for potential data entry or measurement errors we removed a total of 63 observations where fc concentrations exceeded total coliform tc concentrations since fc is a subset of tc we also removed two observations at a single site on the same date where fc concentration exceeded 1010 mpn 100 ml we consider this to be suspicious given that the concentration is 100 times the upper end of the range of observed concentrations for sewage influent tchobanoglous et al 1991 removing suspicious observations results in a loss of 0 5 of the full dataset and 3 at any individual site the error checked fc data at each site were poorly approximated by a normal distribution but were generally well approximated by a log normal distribution thus we used geometric means to summarise fc concentration for each site throughout our analysis to estimate upstream population density we used the gpwv3 gridded synthesis of census data from 2000 balk and yetman 2004 balk et al 2010 to estimate livestock density we used the fao global gridded livestock density data wint and robinson 2007 robinson et al 2014 weighted by estimates of fc production rates for each livestock type

density uld for each sample point were calculated using a d8 flow routing algorithm o callaghan and mark 1984 schwanghart and scherler 2014 and the hydrologically corrected 90 m srtm dem farr et al 2007 to examine the influence of coliform die off in transit and thus relax the assumption that coliforms behave as conservative tracers we introduced an exponential decay in coliform concentration with distance from the source we sampled the shape parameter that defines the rate of distance decay at 500 logarithmic intervals from 10 8 to 10 1 km 1 testing model performance in each case using ordinary least squares regression 3 1 mixing model the observation locations form a nested set of catchments where 82 of observation sites have at least one observation site upstream we deal with this nested sampling in two ways first by assessing the results for only non nested independent catchments however this considerably reduces the number of available observations second by performing the analysis using sub catchments where these are defined as the part of the catchment that drains to the current sample site without first draining through any upstream sample site the result of this definition is segmentation of the entire ganga catchment into 100 non overlapping sub catchments effective source density and fc concentration are then calculated for each sub catchment using an approach similar to that of granger et al 1996 and portenga et al 2015 for effective erosion rates in nested catchments to do this we assume that catchment area can be used as a proxy for discharge equation 3 and use a mixing model to calculate the concentration of the fc input for the sub catchment cfcr given the catchment area and fc concentration at the upstream and downstream boundaries 12 c

process to calculate the human and animal population densities ρr within the catchment area that drains into this sub catchment 13 ρ r n r a r ρ d a d i 1 n ρ u i a u i a d i 1 n a u i where ρui is the upstream population density of upstream boundary i and ρd is the upstream population density of the downstream boundary of the sub catchment 4 results 4 1 observed pattern of fc concentrations our results suggest that high fc concentrations previously reported at the reach and sub catchment scale mukherjee et al 1993 baghel et al 2005 mishra et al 2009 central pollution control board 2010 do not reflect isolated pockets of poor water quality but extensive pollution across the catchment decadal mean fc concentrations at sites across the ganga catchment range from 3 100 to 2 5 106 mpn 100 ml 70 of sites fail indian government desirable bathing limits central pollution control board 2008 with those that pass located almost exclusively in the sparsely populated catchment headwaters on the more populous plains 70 of the 80 sites fail the desirable limits and 63 of the 80 sites fail the maximum permissible 2500 mpn 100 ml limit central pollution control board 2008 locally high fc concentrations are generally associated with large population centres fig 1 most markedly for rivers with smaller catchment areas e g the varuna at varanasi fc concentrations are moderately reduced downstream of the yamuna ganga confluence as tributaries with lower fc concentrations dilute the main stem further downstream even large cities e g patna have limited influence and many samples on the main stem have very similar fc concentration reflecting the central tendency of water quality with increasing catchment area for nested catchments 4 2 catchment scale relationships between fc concentration and upstream source density since people and livestock are the primary sources of fcs we expect fc concentration to increase with the upstream density of these sources fig 2 suggests that the data fit this expectation if fc production per capita is spatially uniform delivery to the river is independent of population density and if water flux is a linear function of catchment area then we expect fc concentration to be a linear function of upstream source density with the form y βx see equations 1 4 for a full derivation variability in delivery to the river network or transit time through the river network that is uncorrelated with population density will introduce scatter to the relationship but should not alter its functional form however comparing the data with linear contours in fig 2 shows that the data are not a good fit to a linear function r2 0 1 power functions are a better fit r2 0 69 for upd and 0 62 for uld but over predict high and low fc values and under predict central values with both upd and uld quadratic relationships offer a further improvement r2 0 71 for upd and 0 68 for uld suggesting positive curvature in log log space but have a physically unreasonable negative slope at low population densities residuals from the quadratic function fitted by ordinary least squares regression for both population and livestock show some heteroscedasticity though white 1980 and bpk breusch and pagan 1979 koenker 1981 tests return p values that are always below 0 1 given this moderate heteroscedasticity and the insensitivity of ordinary least squares coefficients to heteroscedasticity we do not pursue more complex variance weighted analyses upd alone explains slightly more of the variance in fc concentration than uld but there is little difference between the explanatory power of these predictors and their combination in a multiple quadratic regression offers little improvement r2 0 71 this is consistent with the strong correlation between upstream population and livestock densities fig 2c a cubic function constrained to monotonic increase over the range of the data gives a similar performance to the quadratic r2 0 71 for upd and 0 68 for uld a linear spline in log log space with a single interior knot i e piecewise power function is the best fit for both individual predictors r2 0 73 for upd and 0 71 for uld suggesting a threshold rather than continuous change in power relationship between upd and fc concentration finally we test one further null hypothesis that there are two ranges of source density population or livestock with fc concentrations represented by their average value over each range this model is important to exclude given the appearance of clustered points within fig 2 but has difficult physical implications it implies a step change in contribution at some source density and a constant contribution independent of source density change i e a declining per head contribution within each range the step model r2 0 69 does not outperform any of the curved functions quadratic cubic or linear spline for upd though it is a slight improvement on quadratic and cubic spline functions for uld r2 0 70 these results demonstrate that there is positive curvature to the fc upd relationship independent of the particular functional form quadratic cubic or linear spline under consideration and that the fc uld relationship also contains positive curvature but can be almost as well described as two fc distributions at high and low population density 4 3 sub catchment relationships between fc concentration and upstream source density as for catchment analysis the sub catchment analysis suggests that people and livestock are the primary sources of fcs with fc concentration increasing with the upstream density of these sources fig 3 the relationship between source density and fc concentration is not linear for sub catchment based analysis or catchment based analysis fig 3 shows that as in the catchment analysis the data are not a good fit to any linear model r2 0 2 power functions are a better fit r2 0 54 for upd and 0 17 for uld but over predict high and low fc values and under predict central values for upd for uld the fit is very poor suggesting that in the sub catchment based analysis livestock density is only a weak control on fc concentration quadratic relationships in loglog space offer further improvement for upd r2 0 63 but not for uld r2 0 16 upd alone explains considerably more of the variance in fc concentration than uld their combination in a multiple quadratic regression offers some improvement r2 0 72 this reflects the reduced correlation between upd and uld for sub catchment r2 0 66 rather than catchment r2 0 95 analysis compare fig 2c with 3c the linear spline with a single knot i e piecewise power function or cubic function in loglog space constrained to monotonic increase result in similar fits relative to a quadratic for both upd r2 0 63 in both cases and uld r2 0 16 and 0 15 respectively this suggests that there is not clear evidence for a threshold rather than continuous change in power relationship between upd and fc concentration when examined at the sub catchment scale the results from these three quadratic cubic and linear spline approaches demonstrate that there is positive curvature to the fc upd relationship independent of the particular functional form under consideration they also demonstrate that upd is a far better predictor than uld for sub catchment scale analysis and that there is some merit in considering the two in combination this suggests that most instream fcs are human derived 4 4 per capita impact on instream fc concentration positive curvature to the fc upd and fc uld relationships indicates that fc concentration increases with upstream source density at an increasing rate per unit increase in upstream source density this can be interpreted as the change in fc per capita with increasing upstream source density the gradient of the line in logarithmic space reflects its exponent in linear space thus values 1 indicate positive curvature and increasing per capita impact those 1 indicate negative curvature and decreasing per capita impact with increased source density at low upstream source densities 10 people or 6 livestock per km2 fc concentrations are low and the gradient of all three best fit curves is slightly less than one indicating a slight decline in per capita impact with increasing upstream source density at source densities from 10 to 60 people or 6 30 livestock per km2 the gradient of all three best fit curves reaches then exceeds unity indicating that per capita impact reaches a minimum and begins increasing with increasing upstream source density for population density quadratic cubic and linear spline fits all predict a very similar relationship between upd and fc concentration for 102 upd 103 km2 fig 2a over this range the predicted fc concentration increases by three orders of magnitude from 102 to 105 mpn 100 ml indicating a 100 fold increase in per capita impact over the same range in population density 102 upd 103 km2 there is considerable variability in the per capita contribution from no change at the lower limit to a 10 000 fold increase at the upper limit a similar comparison can be made for individual sites with the linear trend lines in fig 2a acting as contours for per capita impact for example moving downstream from the catchment with lowest population density upd increases 10 fold from badrinath to srinagar 7 77 km2 but fc concentration increases only three fold 3 10 mpn 100 ml thus per capita impact declines by a factor of 3 continuing downstream from srinagar to kanpur upd increases by a factor of 6 77 450 km2 while the fc concentration increases by a factor of 1600 10 1 6 104 mpn 100 ml thus impact per capita increases by a factor of 300 per capita impact increases by a factor of 60 000 from its minimum for the rural pindar catchment b to its maximum for the densely populated yamuna at delhi a these results indicate that urban populations contribute more sewage to the river per capita than rural populations and that this increase 1 depends on the difference in population densities rather than changing sharply at a particular density 2 is large on average a factor of 100 and 3 is highly and asymmetrically variable ranging from a factor of 1 10 000 5 discussion 5 1 the relative importance of human or livestock fc sources both upd and uld are good predictors of fc concentration based on catchment scale analysis this may reflect the importance of both sources but is also very likely due to the strong positive correlation between upd and uld in the catchment based analysis fig 2c which makes it difficult to distinguish between the sources based on these data alone when calculated over large areas population and livestock density are highly correlated however at small scales population and livestock density can become de correlated e g in cities where population density is high but livestock density low our sub catchment based analysis breaks the catchment into smaller non nested segments disrupting the correlation between upd and uld fig 3c this analysis shows a small reduction in the percentage of variance in fc concentration explained by upd and a large reduction in that explained by uld in the sub catchment based analysis upd is a much better predictor of fc concentration than uld this is consistent with simple accounting estimates of export coefficients calculated using population and livestock densities with estimated fc production rates for the loading terms and observed fc concentration as the output assuming a human production rate of 2 109 mpn day tchobanoglous et al 1991 and livestock production rates detailed in the methods section livestock derived fc loads produced on any given day range from 2 1010 mpn km2 day for uld 3 km2 to 1 5 1013 mpn km2 day for uld 200 km2 while population derived fc loads range from 1 4 1010 mpn km2 day for upd 7 km2 to 2 1012 mpn km2 day for upd 1000 km2 yet over this range of source densities fc concentrations increase from 2 100 to 1 105 mpn 100 ml on average this results in export coefficients 100 times larger at high livestock and population densities than at low densities it is difficult to conceive of a mechanism for such an increase in export coefficient for livestock derived fcs as a function of source density 5 2 the relative importance of local or non local fc sources upd is a good predictor of instream fc concentrations across the ganga catchment explaining 73 of the observed variance in decadal mean fc concentrations from a catchment scale analysis and 63 from a sub catchment scale analysis figs 2a and 3a this is consistent with findings from catchments across the world tchobanoglous et al 1991 kay et al 2008 mcgrane et al 2014 and with previous reach scale findings in the ganga catchment mukherjee et al 1993 baghel et al 2005 mishra et al 2009 central pollution control board 2010 however there remains considerable variance in fc concentration unexplained by either upd or uld particularly at high population densities 100 people km2 figs 2 and 3 previous reach scale studies did not account for the upstream boundary condition either in terms of fc flux or upstream population mukherjee et al 1993 baghel et al 2005 mishra et al 2009 these studies implicitly assumed that point sources proximal to sample sites dominated the fc signal perhaps due to coliform die off in transit however while many of our sites near larger settlements have high coliform concentrations these concentrations are better explained by upstream population density r2 0 7 than population of the nearest settlement r2 0 25 examining paired samples above and below settlements suggests that in some cases positive residuals where fc concentration is greater than predicted may reflect sites immediately downstream of population centres however including a distance decay function in our analysis did not improve our ability to predict fc concentrations fig 4 shows that model performance is initially stable as the rate at which fcs decay with distance increases but that the performance is never better than that without distance decay and that performance declines markedly for decay rates greater than 0 01 km this reduction in performance relates to a reduction in decay adjusted population density primarily at sites with intermediate or dense populations fig 5 these results suggest that upd is an important but not singular factor in defining the connectivity between sources and receiving waters that defines the timescales and thus efficiency of delivery our approach neglects many processes that should be important in the transport of coliforms from source to the point of measurement e g weather dependent die off rates hydrological connectivity hydraulics at the cross section and reach scale however it is encouraging that even our simple empirical model explains a large fraction of the variance in microbial pollution concentrations 5 3 implications of the fc upd relationship the increase in per capita impact as upd increases likely reflects an increase in the efficiency of delivery rather than fc production perhaps due to changes in individual or corporate waste management decisions as population density increases at low population densities much of the population defecate in the open or in pit latrines census of india 2011b where faeces are less likely to be washed into the river and fcs are more likely to die in situ as population density increases and towns and cities grow the distance to open fields increases and there is a need for an alternative strategy to manage faeces this problem has historically confronted communities across the world leading to degradation of sanitary conditions and construction of sewers gandy 2004 allen 2008 benzerzour et al 2011 sewage systems vary in sophistication but generally involve the movement of excreta by water out of the population centre often made possible by piped domestic water the faeces have a much shorter residence time in the environment and fcs will be removed primarily by sewage treatment rather than die off in the environment in many indian cities the flux of sewage that is and must be removed from the population centre through a growing network of sewers and storm water drains is many times higher than the capacity of the sewage treatment facilities ansari et al 2000 in this case the predominant impact of the sewage network is to remove the sewage from the population centre and rapidly deliver it to the river untreated sewage removal is essential for the public health of the city but without effective treatment it comes at the cost of accentuated river pollution with associated public health implications for the population downstream here we demonstrate as others have central pollution control board 2010 the severe river pollution that results the extent to which this can be addressed by following the same trajectory towards centralised end of pipe sewage treatment has been called into question for practical and economic reasons jha 2003 bracken et al 2007 katukiza 2012 however there is a growing range of innovative water and energy efficient on site alternatives jha 2003 bracken et al 2007 gates foundation 2014 as well as a growing recognition that this is a social as well as physical or technical issue burra et al 2003 sharma and bhide 2005 mcfarlane 2008 it is important to emphasise that our results do not imply that open defecation is a safe approach to sewage management water is not the only vector for faecal oral disease transmission can also occur through food insects and direct contact wagner and lanoix 1958 thus safely disposing of faeces involves more than simply ensuring that they do not enter the watercourse there is good evidence to suggest that open defecation is extremely problematic for public health and safety clasen et al 2010 mara et al 2010 ziegelbauer et al 2012 5 4 network structure controls the spatial pattern of microbial pollution the relationship between upstream population density and fc concentration enables a simple predictive relationship albeit with considerable scatter this model predicts that 33 48 of rivers in the ganga catchment fail the indian government s safe bathing standards depending on the choice of standard fig 6 however many of those rivers that pass are in sparsely populated headwaters for 70 85 of the catchment s population their nearest river fails safe bathing standards central pollution control board 2008 for 79 it should not be used for flood irrigation irrigation of crops eaten raw or where children are involved in farming who 1989 blumenthal et al 2000 and for 51 it should not be used for irrigation with sprinklers blumenthal et al 2000 the pattern of predicted fc concentration from this empirical model is strongly influenced by the catchment s network structure fig 6 sparsely populated himalayan headwaters produce high discharges of clean water suppressing fc concentrations far downstream without this discharge plains fed rivers e g kali have high fc concentrations throughout the most polluted reach of the ganga is predicted to be between kanpur and allahabad upstream of kanpur the diluting effect of the headwaters persists while downstream of allahabad the ganga is diluted first by the less polluted yamuna strongly influenced by the chambal and then by the large left bank tributaries with their headwaters in the himalaya this may be the result of not only the topology but also the geometry of the network since the ganga at allahabad is at its furthest point from the mountain front meaning cleaner himalayan water must travel over a larger expanse of populated plain to reach that point interventions high up the river network have the highest potential for impacting fc concentration for a given fc flux reduction because 1 lower discharge on these rivers means that the same fc flux reduction will lead to a larger concentration reduction and 2 rivers are directed networks i e they accumulate thus a reduction in fc flux at a given location will impact only reaches downstream of it decisions about what to do where are difficult and necessarily political with many drivers bulkeley and mol 2003 but the findings of this study can help guide strategic investment in pollution reduction 6 conclusions the rivers of the ganga catchment are subject to widespread and in places severe microbial pollution 52 67 of measured sites fall below the indian government s upper and desirable limits for safe bathing and for 61 70 of the population model results suggest that their nearest river falls below these same bathing standards the network structure of the ganga catchment pre conditions certain rivers to be highly polluted and others with large himalayan headwaters to be more robust against pollution despite their location on the densely populated plains the entire population upstream not only those nearby contribute to microbial river pollution but urban populations contribute more pollution per capita than rural populations how much more depends on their respective population densities a person living in an area with 1000 km2 contributes on average 100 times more pollution to the river than they would in an area with 100 km2 while this is an average in the presence of considerable asymmetric variability the denser population in this case contribute at least as much pollution per capita at the lower limit and up to 10 000 times more at the upper limit densely populated areas dominate surface water pollution in the ganga catchment not only because they contain many people but because their faeces are more efficiently delivered to the river network we suggest that this increasing efficiency reflects the transmission speed of urban sewerage systems delivering the coliforms to the river more quickly with less die off and the limited capacity for sewage treatment within these systems addressing this problem requires investment in both sewage removal and treatment whether by increasing existing sewerage

19869,for millions of people worldwide sewage polluted surface waters threaten water security food security and human health yet the extent of the problem and its causes are poorly understood given rapid widespread global urbanisation the impact of urban versus rural populations is particularly important but unknown exploiting previously unpublished archival data for the ganga ganges catchment we find a strong non linear relationship between upstream population density and microbial pollution and predict that these river systems would fail faecal coliform standards for irrigation waters available to 79 of the catchment s 500 million inhabitants overall this work shows that microbial pollution is conditioned by the continental scale network structure of rivers compounded by the location of cities whose growing populations contribute c 100 times more microbial pollutants per capita than their rural counterparts keywords faecal coliform river network population density catchment scale 1 background rising demands on water resources raise concerns about the sustainable provision of clean water worldwide unclean water poses significant risks of diarrhoea opportunistic infections and consequent malnutrition accounting for 1 7 million deaths annually of which 90 are in developing countries and almost half are children prüss ustün et al 2014 these deaths are primarily due to ingestion of faecal pathogens from humans or animals ashbolt 2004 kotloff et al 2013 prüss ustün et al 2014 india s growing population and economy are driving rapid urbanisation 30 of the population now live in urban areas census of india 2011a and exerting increased pressure on surface and groundwater availability in rural areas 67 of the population defecate in the open census of india 2011b a practice that poses severe risk to health and safety clasen et al 2010 mara et al 2010 ziegelbauer et al 2012 kotloff et al 2013 in urban areas 80 of the population have access to a toilet census of india 2011b but only 30 are connected to a sewage pipeline and few pipelines are connected to a treatment plant narain 2012 the impact of these sanitation problems on surface water quality has been documented for many years at individual sample locations or river reaches across india bhargava 1983 mukherjee et al 1993 baghel et al 2005 mishra et al 2009 central pollution control board 2010 however there has been no catchment wide quantification of the problem and limited indication of what is driving it the former is essential to fully understand the scale of intervention required while the latter might inform decision making on what to do where urban areas often dominate the microbial pollution signal in rivers tchobanoglous et al 1991 kay et al 2008 mcgrane et al 2014 but there is little consensus on the extent to which this reflects an increased impact per capita or simply a larger population and thus source this difference is important since a higher per capita impact indicates reduced attenuation perhaps due to more efficient delivery to the river system or less efficient treatment if the difference can be attributed to per capita contribution this will define the extent to which urban or rural focused interventions will improve surface water quality we address this question using archival water quality data from across the ganga ganges catchment and show the pattern of microbial pollution in its major rivers we compare instream concentrations of a pollution proxy with upstream densities of the two major sources of faecal pathogens humans and livestock at 100 sites spanning an approximate surface area of 106 km2 faecal pathogens are difficult to measure however thermo tolerant coliforms which originate in faeces i e faecal coliforms fc are easily detectable and routinely monitored as indicator organisms ashbolt et al 2001 fcs are not a perfect predictor of human pathogen presence rather they establish connectivity between defecation and some receiving environment which could be contributed to by a pathogen carrier new host specific tracing techniques allow more precise tracking of microbial pollution sources that can help to better assess risks to human health harwood et al 2014 field and samadpour 2007 however such techniques are not used within routine monitoring in india and thus do not have the spatial coverage required for our analysis furthermore the use of fcs for monitoring pollution is still regarded as a viable measure of drinking and irrigation water quality who 2017 two key issues that must be addressed are 1 the extent to which the fc signal that we observe reflects human sources and 2 the potential impact of fc die off in our pollution tracer upstream livestock and human population densities are strongly correlated at the catchment scale limiting our capacity to identify the source of the pollution signal to address this we seek to de correlate the predictor variables by using a mixing model to estimate contributions from each non overlapping segment of the catchment our sub catchments to address the impact of die off in our pollution tracer we adjust the population and livestock densities using a distance decay function then seek decay parameters that will maximise performance of our statistical model in the sections that follow we first introduce our null hypothesis that pollution should be linearly related to source density both with and without accounting for die off we then detail our data sources and methods for their analysis and introduce the mixing model that we use to calculate effective fc concentrations and source densities for each sub catchment the non overlapping segments of the catchment 2 theory expected relationship between fc concentration and upstream source density with and without die off the fc concentration cfc at a given location is defined by the ratio of the fc flux qfc to the water flux qw 1 c f c q f c q w under the assumption that there is no die off in fcs over time the fc flux is calculated from 2 q f c p h n h p a n a p h ρ h p a ρ a a where ph is the production rate of fcs per human head mpn 1 t 1 pa is the production rate per head of livestock mpn 1 t 1 nh and na are the total upstream populations of humans and livestock respectively ρh and ρa are the upstream population densities of humans and livestock respectively l 2 and a is the catchment area l2 under the assumption of spatially uniform and time invariant runoff rw l t 1 the water flux qw l3 t 1 is calculated from 3 q w r w a substituting equations 2 and 3 into equation 1 gives the following equation for fc concentration at each measurement point as a function of upstream population density 4 c f c p h ρ h p a ρ a r w k h ρ h k a ρ a where kh ph rw and ka pa rw it is clear from this relationship that under these assumptions cfc should be a linear function of upstream population and livestock density with the gradients defined by the ratio of production rate p to runoff rw the assumption of no fc die off is unlikely to be true but controls on die off remain poorly understood given the uncertainties die off is most often represented using an exponential decay based on first order kinetics crane and moore 1986 sadeghi and arnold 2002 cho et al 2012 5 q f c q 0 e k 1 t where q0 is the fc flux at time t0 the time of exit from the gut mpn t 1 t is time since exit t k1 is a decay coefficient t 1 assuming uniform time invariant fc velocity from source to measurement point the fc flux qfc can be expressed as a function of distance 6 q f c q 0 e k 1 x v where x is the travel distance from source to measurement point l and v is the characteristic velocity l t 1 changing population of people or livestock with distance x upstream of the sampling point can be calculated as the derivative of n x 7 n x d n d x ρ x d a d x a x d ρ d x assuming that fc production rates are time invariant and incorporating characteristic velocity into the decay coefficient to express decay in terms of distance the fc flux can be calculated by combining equations 2 6 and 7 and integrating over the range of travel

c e l l s ρ h i e k x i k a i 1 n c e l l s ρ a i e k x i where kh ph rw and ka pa rw re arranged in this form equation 11 shows that accounting for fc die off cfc remains a linear function of population and livestock density transformed to account for flowpath length as in the no die off case equation 4 the linear coefficients reflect the ratio of human or livestock production rate to runoff 3 methods we used water quality samples from 100 locations across the ganga catchment fig 1 collected and analysed by six agencies following a uniform protocol total and faecal coliform concentrations were estimated using the standardised 9221 b and 9221 e multiple tube fermentation techniques apha 1995 to establish the most probable number mpn of faecal coliforms per 100 ml at each site we collated 10 years of data 2002 2012 the frequency with which these data were sampled varies between sites from three samples per year at the two most remote himalayan sites to quarterly for 24 more himalayan sites and one or two samples per month at the remaining sites at 30 sites samples were collected at two locations across the river in some years in order to improve representation these data were quality checked for potential data entry or measurement errors we removed a total of 63 observations where fc concentrations exceeded total coliform tc concentrations since fc is a subset of tc we also removed two observations at a single site on the same date where fc concentration exceeded 1010 mpn 100 ml we consider this to be suspicious given that the concentration is 100 times the upper end of the range of observed concentrations for sewage influent tchobanoglous et al 1991 removing suspicious observations results in a loss of 0 5 of the full dataset and 3 at any individual site the error checked fc data at each site were poorly approximated by a normal distribution but were generally well approximated by a log normal distribution thus we used geometric means to summarise fc concentration for each site throughout our analysis to estimate upstream population density we used the gpwv3 gridded synthesis of census data from 2000 balk and yetman 2004 balk et al 2010 to estimate livestock density we used the fao global gridded livestock density data wint and robinson 2007 robinson et al 2014 weighted by estimates of fc production rates for each livestock type cow and buffalo 1011 mpn day goats and sheep 1 2 1010 mpn day pigs 1 1 1010 mpn day poultry 1 4 108 mpn day asae standards 1998 upstream area upstream population density upd and upstream livestock density uld for each sample point were calculated using a d8 flow routing algorithm o callaghan and mark 1984 schwanghart and scherler 2014 and the hydrologically corrected 90 m srtm dem farr et al 2007 to examine the influence of coliform die off in transit and thus relax the assumption that coliforms behave as conservative tracers we introduced an exponential decay in coliform concentration with distance from the source we sampled the shape parameter that defines the rate of distance decay at 500 logarithmic intervals from 10 8 to 10 1 km 1 testing model performance in each case using ordinary least squares regression 3 1 mixing model the observation locations form a nested set of catchments where 82 of observation sites have at least one observation site upstream we deal with this nested sampling in two ways first by assessing the results for only non nested independent catchments however this considerably reduces the number of available observations second by performing the analysis using sub catchments where these are defined as the part of the catchment that drains to the current sample site without first draining through any upstream sample site the result of this definition is segmentation of the entire ganga catchment into 100 non overlapping sub catchments effective source density and fc concentration are then calculated for each sub catchment using an approach similar to that of granger et al 1996 and portenga et al 2015 for effective erosion rates in nested catchments to do this we assume that catchment area can be used as a proxy for discharge equation 3 and use a mixing model to calculate the concentration of the fc input for the sub catchment cfcr given the catchment area and fc concentration at the upstream and downstream boundaries 12 c f c r q f c r a r c f c d a d i 1 n c f c u i a u i a d i 1 n a u i where cfcui is the fc concentration at upstream boundary i and cfcd is the fc concentration at the downstream boundary of the sub catchment aui is the catchment area for upstream boundary i ad is the catchment area for the downstream boundary of the sub catchment and n is the number of upstream boundaries we repeat the same process to calculate the human and animal population densities ρr within the catchment area that drains into this sub catchment 13 ρ r n r a r ρ d a d i 1 n ρ u i a u i a d i 1 n a u i where ρui is the upstream population density of upstream boundary i and ρd is the upstream population density of the downstream boundary of the sub catchment 4 results 4 1 observed pattern of fc concentrations our results suggest that high fc concentrations previously reported at the reach and sub catchment scale mukherjee et al 1993 baghel et al 2005 mishra et al 2009 central pollution control board 2010 do not reflect isolated pockets of poor water quality but extensive pollution across the catchment decadal mean fc concentrations at sites across the ganga catchment range from 3 100 to 2 5 106 mpn 100 ml 70 of sites fail indian government desirable bathing limits central pollution control board 2008 with those that pass located almost exclusively in the sparsely populated catchment headwaters on the more populous plains 70 of the 80 sites fail the desirable limits and 63 of the 80 sites fail the maximum permissible 2500 mpn 100 ml limit central pollution control board 2008 locally high fc concentrations are generally associated with large population centres fig 1 most markedly for rivers with smaller catchment areas e g the varuna at varanasi fc concentrations are moderately reduced downstream of the yamuna ganga confluence as tributaries with lower fc concentrations dilute the main stem further downstream even large cities e g patna have limited influence and many samples on the main stem have very similar fc concentration reflecting the central tendency of water quality with increasing catchment area for nested catchments 4 2 catchment scale relationships between fc concentration and upstream source density since people and livestock are the primary sources of fcs we expect fc concentration to increase with the upstream density of these sources fig 2 suggests that the data fit this expectation if fc production per capita is spatially uniform delivery to the river is independent of population density and if water flux is a linear function of catchment area then we expect fc concentration to be a linear function of upstream source density with the form y βx see equations 1 4 for a full derivation variability in delivery to the river network or transit time through the river network that is uncorrelated with population density will introduce scatter to the relationship but should not alter its functional form however comparing the data with linear contours in fig 2 shows that the data are not a good fit to a linear function r2 0 1 power functions are a better fit r2 0 69 for upd and 0 62 for uld but over predict high and low fc values and under predict central values with both upd and uld quadratic relationships offer a further improvement r2 0 71 for upd and 0 68 for uld suggesting positive curvature in log log space but have a physically unreasonable negative slope at low population densities residuals from the quadratic function fitted by ordinary least squares regression for both population and livestock show some heteroscedasticity though white 1980 and bpk breusch and pagan 1979 koenker 1981 tests return p values that are always below 0 1 given this moderate heteroscedasticity and the insensitivity of ordinary least squares coefficients to heteroscedasticity we do not pursue more complex variance weighted analyses upd alone explains slightly more of the variance in fc concentration than uld but there is little difference between the explanatory power of these predictors and their combination in a multiple quadratic regression offers little improvement r2 0 71 this is consistent with the strong correlation between upstream population and livestock densities fig 2c a cubic function constrained to monotonic increase over the range of the data gives a similar performance to the quadratic r2 0 71 for upd and 0 68 for uld a linear spline in log log space with a single interior knot i e piecewise power function is the best fit for both individual predictors r2 0 73 for upd and 0 71 for uld suggesting a threshold rather than continuous change in power relationship between upd and fc concentration finally we test one further null hypothesis that there are two ranges of source density population or livestock with fc concentrations represented by their average value over each range this model is important to exclude given the appearance of clustered points within fig 2 but has difficult physical implications it implies a step change in contribution at some source density and a constant contribution independent of source density change i e a declining per head contribution within each range the step model r2 0 69 does not outperform any of the curved functions quadratic cubic or linear spline for upd though it is a slight improvement on quadratic and cubic spline functions for uld r2 0 70 these results demonstrate that there is positive curvature to the fc upd relationship independent of the particular functional form quadratic cubic or linear spline under consideration and that the fc uld relationship also contains positive curvature but can be almost as well described as two fc distributions at high and low population density 4 3 sub catchment relationships between fc concentration and upstream source density as for catchment analysis the sub catchment analysis suggests that people and livestock are the primary sources of fcs with fc concentration increasing with the upstream density of these sources fig 3 the relationship between source density and fc concentration is not linear for sub catchment based analysis or catchment based analysis fig 3 shows that as in the catchment analysis the data are not a good fit to any linear model r2 0 2 power functions are a better fit r2 0 54 for upd and 0 17 for uld but over predict high and low fc values and under predict central values for upd for uld the fit is very poor suggesting that in the sub catchment based analysis livestock density is only a weak control on fc concentration quadratic relationships in loglog space offer further improvement for upd r2 0 63 but not for uld r2 0 16 upd alone explains considerably more of the variance in fc concentration than uld their combination in a multiple quadratic regression offers some improvement r2 0 72 this reflects the reduced correlation between upd and uld for sub catchment r2 0 66 rather than catchment r2 0 95 analysis compare fig 2c with 3c the linear spline with a single knot i e piecewise power function or cubic function in loglog space constrained to monotonic increase result in similar fits relative to a quadratic for both upd r2 0 63 in both cases and uld r2 0 16 and 0 15 respectively this suggests that there is not clear evidence for a threshold rather than continuous change in power relationship between upd and fc concentration when examined at the sub catchment scale the results from these three quadratic cubic and linear spline approaches demonstrate that there is positive curvature to the fc upd relationship independent of the particular functional form under consideration they also demonstrate that upd is a far better predictor than uld for sub catchment scale analysis and that there is some merit in considering the two in combination this suggests that most instream fcs are human derived 4 4 per capita impact on instream fc concentration positive curvature to the fc upd and fc uld relationships indicates that fc concentration increases with upstream source density at an increasing rate per unit increase in upstream source density this can be interpreted as the change in fc per capita with increasing upstream source density the gradient of the line in logarithmic space reflects its exponent in linear space thus values 1 indicate positive curvature and increasing per capita impact those 1 indicate negative curvature and decreasing per capita impact with increased source density at low upstream source densities 10 people or 6 livestock per km2 fc concentrations are low and the gradient of all three best fit curves is slightly less than one indicating a slight decline in per capita impact with increasing upstream source density at source densities from 10 to 60 people or 6 30 livestock per km2 the gradient of all three best fit curves reaches then exceeds unity indicating that per capita impact reaches a minimum and begins increasing with increasing upstream source density for population density quadratic cubic and linear spline fits all predict a very similar relationship between upd and fc concentration for 102 upd 103 km2 fig 2a over this range the predicted fc concentration increases by three orders of magnitude from 102 to 105 mpn 100 ml indicating a 100 fold increase in per capita impact over the same range in population density 102 upd 103 km2 there is considerable variability in the per capita contribution from no change at the lower limit to a 10 000 fold increase at the upper limit a similar comparison can be made for individual sites with the linear trend lines in fig 2a acting as contours for per capita impact for example moving downstream from the catchment with lowest population density upd increases 10 fold from badrinath to srinagar 7 77 km2 but fc concentration increases only three fold 3 10 mpn 100 ml thus per capita impact declines by a factor of 3 continuing downstream from srinagar to kanpur upd increases by a factor of 6 77 450 km2 while the fc concentration increases by a factor of 1600 10 1 6 104 mpn 100 ml thus impact per capita increases by a factor of 300 per capita impact increases by a factor of 60 000 from its minimum for the rural pindar catchment b to its maximum for the densely populated yamuna at delhi a these results indicate that urban populations contribute more sewage to the river per capita than rural populations and that this increase 1 depends on the difference in population densities rather than changing sharply at a particular density 2 is large on average a factor of 100 and 3 is highly and asymmetrically variable ranging from a factor of 1 10 000 5 discussion 5 1 the relative importance of human or livestock fc sources both upd and uld are good predictors of fc concentration based on catchment scale analysis this may reflect the importance of both sources but is also very likely due to the strong positive correlation between upd and uld in the catchment based analysis fig 2c which makes it difficult to distinguish between the sources based on these data alone when calculated over large areas population and livestock density are highly correlated however at small scales population and livestock density can become de correlated e g in cities where population density is high but livestock density low our sub catchment based analysis breaks the catchment into smaller non nested segments disrupting the correlation between upd and uld fig 3c this analysis shows a small reduction in the percentage of variance in fc concentration explained by upd and a large reduction in that explained by uld in the sub catchment based analysis upd is a much better predictor of fc concentration than uld this is consistent with simple accounting estimates of export coefficients calculated using population and livestock densities with estimated fc production rates for the loading terms and observed fc concentration as the output assuming a human production rate of 2 109 mpn day tchobanoglous et al 1991 and livestock production rates detailed in the methods section livestock derived fc loads produced on any given day range from 2 1010 mpn km2 day for uld 3 km2 to 1 5 1013 mpn km2 day for uld 200 km2 while population derived fc loads range from 1 4 1010 mpn km2 day for upd 7 km2 to 2 1012 mpn km2 day for upd 1000 km2 yet over this range of source densities fc concentrations increase from 2 100 to 1 105 mpn 100 ml on average this results in export coefficients 100 times larger at high livestock and population densities than at low densities it is difficult to conceive of a mechanism for such an increase in export coefficient for livestock derived fcs as a function of source density 5 2 the relative importance of local or non local fc sources upd is a good predictor of instream fc concentrations across the ganga catchment explaining 73 of the observed variance in decadal mean fc concentrations from a catchment scale analysis and 63 from a sub catchment scale analysis figs 2a and 3a this is consistent with findings from catchments across the world tchobanoglous et al 1991 kay et al 2008 mcgrane et al 2014 and with previous reach scale findings in the ganga catchment mukherjee et al 1993 baghel et al 2005 mishra et al 2009 central pollution control board 2010 however there remains considerable variance in fc concentration unexplained by either upd or uld particularly at high population densities 100 people km2 figs 2 and 3 previous reach scale studies did not account for the upstream boundary condition either in terms of fc flux or upstream population mukherjee et al 1993 baghel et al 2005 mishra et al 2009 these studies implicitly assumed that point sources proximal to sample sites dominated the fc signal perhaps due to coliform die off in transit however while many of our sites near larger settlements have high coliform concentrations these concentrations are better explained by upstream population density r2 0 7 than population of the nearest settlement r2 0 25 examining paired samples above and below settlements suggests that in some cases positive residuals where fc concentration is greater than predicted may reflect sites immediately downstream of population centres however including a distance decay function in our analysis did not improve our ability to predict fc concentrations fig 4 shows that model performance is initially stable as the rate at which fcs decay with distance increases but that the performance is never better than that without distance decay and that performance declines markedly for decay rates greater than 0 01 km this reduction in performance relates to a reduction in decay adjusted population density primarily at sites with intermediate or dense populations fig 5 these results suggest that upd is an important but not singular factor in defining the connectivity between sources and receiving waters that defines the timescales and thus efficiency of delivery our approach neglects many processes that should be important in the transport of coliforms from source to the point of measurement e g weather dependent die off rates hydrological connectivity hydraulics at the cross section and reach scale however it is encouraging that even our simple empirical model explains a large fraction of the variance in microbial pollution concentrations 5 3 implications of the fc upd relationship the increase in per capita impact as upd increases likely reflects an increase in the efficiency of delivery rather than fc production perhaps due to changes in individual or corporate waste management decisions as population density increases at low population densities much of the population defecate in the open or in pit latrines census of india 2011b where faeces are less likely to be washed into the river and fcs are more likely to die in situ as population density increases and towns and cities grow the distance to open fields increases and there is a need for an alternative strategy to manage faeces this problem has historically confronted communities across the world leading to degradation of sanitary conditions and construction of sewers gandy 2004 allen 2008 benzerzour et al 2011 sewage systems vary in sophistication but generally involve the movement of excreta by water out of the population centre often made possible by piped domestic water the faeces have a much shorter residence time in the environment and fcs will be removed primarily by sewage treatment rather than die off in the environment in many indian cities the flux of sewage that is and must be removed from the population centre through a growing network of sewers and storm water drains is many times higher than the capacity of the sewage treatment facilities ansari et al 2000 in this case the predominant impact of the sewage network is to remove the sewage from the population centre and rapidly deliver it to the river untreated sewage removal is essential for the public health of the city but without effective treatment it comes at the cost of accentuated river pollution with associated public health implications for the population downstream here we demonstrate as others have central pollution control board 2010 the severe river pollution that results the extent to which this can be addressed by following the same trajectory towards centralised end of pipe sewage treatment has been called into question for practical and economic reasons jha 2003 bracken et al 2007 katukiza 2012 however there is a growing range of innovative water and energy efficient on site alternatives jha 2003 bracken et al 2007 gates foundation 2014 as well as a growing recognition that this is a social as well as physical or technical issue burra et al 2003 sharma and bhide 2005 mcfarlane 2008 it is important to emphasise that our results do not imply that open defecation is a safe approach to sewage management water is not the only vector for faecal oral disease transmission can also occur through food insects and direct contact wagner and lanoix 1958 thus safely disposing of faeces involves more than simply ensuring that they do not enter the watercourse there is good evidence to suggest that open defecation is extremely problematic for public health and safety clasen et al 2010 mara et al 2010 ziegelbauer et al 2012 5 4 network structure controls the spatial pattern of microbial pollution the relationship between upstream population density and fc concentration enables a simple predictive relationship albeit with considerable scatter this model predicts that 33 48 of rivers in the ganga catchment fail the indian government s safe bathing standards depending on the choice of standard fig 6 however many of those rivers that pass are in sparsely populated headwaters for 70 85 of the catchment s population their nearest river fails safe bathing standards central pollution control board 2008 for 79 it should not be used for flood irrigation irrigation of crops eaten raw or where children are involved in farming who 1989 blumenthal et al 2000 and for 51 it should not be used for irrigation with sprinklers blumenthal et al 2000 the pattern of predicted fc concentration from this empirical model is strongly influenced by the catchment s network structure fig 6 sparsely populated himalayan headwaters produce high discharges of clean water suppressing fc concentrations far downstream without this discharge plains fed rivers e g kali have high fc concentrations throughout the most polluted reach of the ganga is predicted to be between kanpur and allahabad upstream of kanpur the diluting effect of the headwaters persists while downstream of allahabad the ganga is diluted first by the less polluted yamuna strongly influenced by the chambal and then by the large left bank tributaries with their headwaters in the himalaya this may be the result of not only the topology but also the geometry of the network since the ganga at allahabad is at its furthest point from the mountain front meaning cleaner himalayan water must travel over a larger expanse of populated plain to reach that point interventions high up the river network have the highest potential for impacting fc concentration for a given fc flux reduction because 1 lower discharge on these rivers means that the same fc flux reduction will lead to a larger concentration reduction and 2 rivers are directed networks i e they accumulate thus a reduction in fc flux at a given location will impact only reaches downstream of it decisions about what to do where are difficult and necessarily political with many drivers bulkeley and mol 2003 but the findings of this study can help guide strategic investment in pollution reduction 6 conclusions the rivers of the ganga catchment are subject to widespread and in places severe microbial pollution 52 67 of measured sites fall below the indian government s upper and desirable limits for safe bathing and for 61 70 of the population model results suggest that their nearest river falls below these same bathing standards the network structure of the ganga catchment pre conditions certain rivers to be highly polluted and others with large himalayan headwaters to be more robust against pollution despite their location on the densely populated plains the entire population upstream not only those nearby contribute to microbial river pollution but urban populations contribute more pollution per capita than rural populations how much more depends on their respective population densities a person living in an area with 1000 km2 contributes on average 100 times more pollution to the river than they would in an area with 100 km2 while this is an average in the presence of considerable asymmetric variability the denser population in this case contribute at least as much pollution per capita at the lower limit and up to 10 000 times more at the upper limit densely populated areas dominate surface water pollution in the ganga catchment not only because they contain many people but because their faeces are more efficiently delivered to the river network we suggest that this increasing efficiency reflects the transmission speed of urban sewerage systems delivering the coliforms to the river more quickly with less die off and the limited capacity for sewage treatment within these systems addressing this problem requires investment in both sewage removal and treatment whether by increasing existing sewerage
