10225,the conventional sub surface drainage fd in the nile delta clay soil northern egypt results in excessive drainage and low irrigation efficiency ie however a shallower placement of drain might reduce drain outflow and increase ie the ultimate objective of the present study was to determine the optimum drain depth that minimizes drain outflow and maximizes ie and irrigation water use efficiency iwue while maintaining crop yield and soil salinity compared to fd at 120 cm below the soil surface bss the effect of four controlled drain depths cd at 40 60 80 and 100 cm bss on drain outflow ie salinity buildup yield and iwue were investigated for two seasons 2017 18 and 2018 19 wheat sunflower cropping system measurements were conducted for sunflower as a summer crop irrigation was applied based on the soil water content of fd treatment thus irrigation depth varied for each treatment the results showed that decreasing drain depth significantly reduced drain outflow and water input while ie seed yield and iwue were increased the maximum seed yield and iwue were obtained at the shallowest drains compared with fd at 120 cm drain depth at 40 cm decreased drain outflow by 77 20 and water input by 29 3 while increased seed yield and iwue by 27 and 86 respectively based on water balance water uptake from shallow groundwater was maximum for cd 40 cm treatment 31 05 of water uptake and was significantly higher than the other treatments however by the end of the second season treatment with drain depth at 40 cm bss recorded the highest soil salinity 3 6 ds m 1 due to the upward capillary rise of shallow groundwater increased soil salinity had no effect on seed yield because it was below the salinity threshold of sunflower in terms of ie and iwue decreasing drain depth to 40 cm bss is recommended but with potential salinity buildup therefore drain at 60 cm bss had similar seed yield to drain at 40 cm bss might lead to significant water saving 21 8 while maintaining seed yield and soil quality in conclusion modifying the drainage system by reducing drain depth and considering crop water uptake from shallow groundwater might contribute to water saving after all careful water and soil management e g periodic leaching and suitable cropping systems should be considered for salinity management when decreasing drain depth keywords drain discharge irrigation efficiency salinity buildup water use efficiency 1 introduction by 2050 the global population is expected to reach 9 6 billion berners lee et al 2018 fao 2015 providing food for the growing population is a primary future challenge page et al 2020 this challenge is exacerbated by water scarcity and climate change hunt et al 2020 javani et al 2018 sun et al 2020 mena countries middle east and north africa are highly susceptible to climate change consequences because they are more exposed to temperature increases less water availability and rapid population growth hamed et al 2018 mena countries represent the most water stressed region in the world that receives less than 300 mm annually mcnally et al 2019 radhouane 2013 therefore the average annual water resource is always below 1000 m3 per capita hamed et al 2018 besides the already existing water scarcity climate change is expected to impact drought water and food security thereby affecting the stability and security of the region hamed et al 2018 hence immediate and extreme actions have to be directed towards maximizing water use while minimizing the impact of climate change due to the very low amount and unpredictability of rainfall in mena countries the region is mainly dependent on irrigated agriculture however over irrigation groundwater and irrigation salinities and shallow water table result in waterlogging and soil salinization under such conditions the main function of drainage is to prevent waterlogging and soil salinization ayars et al 2006a ritzema 2016 satchithanantham et al 2012 conceptually free outflow drainage networks are designed for the highest wet period of the year however as drainage rates are inconstant throughout the year the free outflow may lead to excessive drainage campus 2019 javani et al 2018 liu et al 2019 ritzema 2016 excessive drainage might result in water deficit nutrients leaching and low irrigation system and water use efficiencies all of which lead to a yield reduction and adverse environmental and economic effects campus 2019 helmers et al 2012 javani et al 2018 sojka et al 2019 several efforts have been directed towards reducing the off site impacts of conventional sub surface drainage fd through the use of different drainage practices the most successful approach is controlled drainage javani et al 2018 sojka et al 2019 controlled drainage is a management method for controlling the amount of drained water with the aim of reducing the off site effects of drainage maintaining good yields as well as mitigating the effect of deficit water stress ayars et al 2006a ritzema 2016 therefore the role of subsurface drainage might be changed from only preventing waterlogging and or soil salinization to an essential element of integrated water and water table management javani et al 2018 satchithanantham et al 2012 sobeih et al 2017 the ultimate objective of water table management is to maintain it at the desired depth to ensure adequate root zone aeration ayars et al 2006a lavaire et al 2017 in controlled drainage drains are shallower than in fd thus water table is raised to a shallower depth a shallower placement of drain might minimizes deep percolation and increases the upward flow by capillarity substituting the decreased soil water content of the surface layer due to evapotranspiration ayars et al 2006a campus 2019 lu et al 2016 hence shallower drain might increase water availability for crops during dry periods thereby reducing drought or water deficit stresses lavaire et al 2017 lu et al 2016 skaggs et al 2012 controlling water table through decreasing drain depth might increase crop yield reduce leaching and increase water use and irrigation system efficiencies campus 2019 it is rich established that shallower placement of drain reduces the drained water volumes campus 2019 helmers et al 2012 javani et al 2018 lavaire et al 2017 liu et al 2019 ritzema 2016 skaggs et al 2012 sojka et al 2019 in a review article conducted by skaggs et al 2010 a reduction of 16 85 in drain outflows was reported the reductions in the drainage water volumes corresponded to an increase in evapotranspiration and crop water uptake craft et al 2018 lu et al 2016 and a reduction in n transport by 18 75 and total p transport by 35 45 depending on drainage system design climate soil and site conditions ayars et al 2006a craft et al 2018 drury et al 2009 helmers et al 2012 javani et al 2018 lavaire et al 2017 liu et al 2019 lu et al 2016 skaggs et al 2012 owing to the conservation in water and nutrients which become readily available for crops an increase in crop yields ranging from 10 to 64 was observed amatya et al 2006 craft et al 2018 javani et al 2018 skaggs et al 2012 however the effect of drain depth on crop yield showed conflicting results skaggs et al 2010 some studies reported yield losses in different crops allred et al 2003 drury et al 2009 while other authors reported mixed results for example satchithanantham et al 2012 found an increase in potato yield in a year over two years moreover drury et al 2009 reported a reduction of 17 4 in corn and soybean yields in two out of four years compared to fd controlled drainage increased corn and soybean yield by 11 and 10 respectively while no effect was observed for wheat poole et al 2013 in the nile delta clay soil northern egypt most of cultivated lands have a shallow water table creating waterlogging and salinization problems that lead to yield losses and land degradation therefore extensive subsurface drainage schemes have been implemented and presently most of the area is served by subsurface drainage at 120 cm the success in preventing waterlogging and salinization was clearly evident by the high productivity and maintained soil quality el ghannam et al 2016 however surface irrigation is the main irrigation system in the nile delta due to land defragmentation the low irrigation efficiency in combination with conventional subsurface fd at 120 cm bss has resulted in excessive drainage and low irrigation water use efficiency the significant amount of drainage flows creates adverse problems for downstream farmers and negatively affects the quality of water in spite of the situation there is no comprehensive study investigating the potential of modifying the drain depth to reduce drainage outflow and thus water input therefore the objective of the current study was to assess the influence of four drain levels depths in addition to the control on drain outflow soil salinity buildup irrigation system and water use efficiencies and crop yields 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and soil a field experiment was carried out in two successive seasons 2018 and 2019 at sakha agricultural research station farm kafr el sheikh governorate egypt the experimental field represents the nile delta clay soil northern egypt the experimental site is located at 31 07 n and 30 57 e and altitude 6 0 m above sea level the study area is characterized by a semi arid mediterranean climate with total annual precipitation averages of 123 2 and 113 8 mm for 2018 and 2019 respectively the precipitation is distributed mainly during the winter while no precipitation occurred during summer months fig 1 the minimum and maximum average temperature was recorded in january 13 7 and in july 28 6 c respectively the lowest and highest average daily reference evapotranspiration was observed in january 2 0 mm d 1 and in june 6 18 mm d 1 respectively the land in the experimental field site is almost flat with a slope lower than 0 005 the rice wheat cropping system is the dominant in the region besides being a highly water and energy demanding cropping system it is markedly contributing to soil degradation due to intensive dry and wet tillage puddling therefore some alternatives less water demanding cropping systems e g maize wheat and sunflower wheat have recently been proposed the dominant irrigation system in the region is flood irrigation the area under study is irrigated by nile fresh water ec 0 5 ds m 1 and served by subsurface drainage at 120 cm depth the groundwater level ranges from 0 9 m in summer due to rice cultivation to 1 1 m in winter the salinity of groundwater ranges from 0 9 ds m 1 in winter to 1 23 ds m 1 in summer the soil in the region constitutes alluvial flood deposits and is classified as clay soil typic torrifluvents soil survey staff 2014 representative surface soil samples at a depth of 0 30 cm were collected using the open auger some physical and chemical characteristics of the soil under investigation are shown in table 1 the collected soil samples were air dried pulverized passed through 2 mm sieve and analyzed analysis of soil texture was performed according to baruah and barthakur 1999 using the pipette method the textural class was determined by the united states department of agriculture usda system soil survey division staff 1993 soil bulk density was measured following the core method blake and hartge 1986 soil moisture was measured gravimetrically and volumetric water content was calculated by multiplying gravimetric water content by soil bulk density baruah and barthakur 1999 soil ph was measured in soil water suspension 1 2 5 while electrical conductivity ec cations and anions were determined in soil paste extract following standard methods of jackson 1973 2 2 experimental design and drainage treatments the experimental field is served by tile drainage system at 120 cm depth which was adopted at different drain depths by modifying the outlet elevation fig 2 in the present study in addition to the control sub surface drainage at 120 cm fd 120 four drainage treatments controlled drain depths were implemented i e 40 cd 40 60 cd 60 80 cd 80 and 100 cm cd 100 due to land limitation and to avoid interference between drainage treatments minimize water table seepage between treatments before initiating the experiment the main field was divided to five separate and isolated sub fields in which each treatment was applied in a separate sub field each sub field was divided into 3 plots with an area of 2000 m2 for each plot 20 m width 100 m length leading to overall 15 plots within each treatment sub field the three replicates were arranged in the same sub field with a 60 m buffering distance between every two replicates each plot was drained by three parallel laterals 75 mm in diameter with drain spacing of 20 m and depth of 120 cm every three laterals within each plot were connected to a manhole through riser fig 2 using control devices the outlet elevation was maintained at any given depth during the experiment 2 3 cultivated crops under different drainage treatments a wheat sunflower cropping system was applied triticum aestivum l sakha 8 variety helianthus annuus l sakha s3 variety in the first season wheat was sown on november 15th 2017 and harvested in mid may 2018 followed by sunflower which was sown on july 15th 2018 and harvested in the mid october 2018 almost the same dates were followed in the second season which ended on october 10th 2019 in the current study measurements were elaborated only for sunflower in such a clay soil wheat as a winter crop grows during the coldest period of the year is usually irrigated twice at sowing and before harvest the sunflower was sown by planter at the rate of 12 kg ha 1 adjusting the distances between rows to 70 cm and 30 cm between hills and at depth of 3 cm recommended rates of npk fertilizers were applied as follows n fertilizer was applied in the form of urea 46 5 n at a rate of 70 kg ha 1 at equal two doses before the post planting irrigation and before the second irrigation phosphorus fertilizer was applied in the form of calcium superphosphate 15 p2o5 at a rate of 350 kg ha 1 before tillage potassium fertilizer in the form of potassium sulphate 48 k2o at the rate of 120 kg ha 1 was added in one dose before the post planting irrigation before the harvest plant height cm and head diameter cm were measured the whole plots were harvested and seed yield at a moisture content of 14 was measured and expressed as kg ha 1 finally 100 seeds were counted and the corresponding mass g was determined 2 4 irrigation water input and drain outflow irrigation water was applied based on the soil water content of the control treatment fd 120 cm thus irrigation depth varied for each treatment after sowing in the first irrigation the same amount of water was provided to all treatments using furrow irrigation system an irrigation water flow meter was used to measure the applied water volume for each treatment subsequent irrigations for all treatments were applied when depleting 50 of the available water capacity awc for the fd 120 cm treatment at 50 field capacity fc all treatments were re irrigated to 100 of fc to determine when to irrigate soil moisture content of the control treatment between irrigations was daily measured manually gravimetric soil water content between irrigations was measured and volumetric water content was calculated by multiplying gravimetric soil water content by bulk density baruah and barthakur 1999 irrigation depth varied for each treatment even within each replicated plot under each treatment and was determined based on the root depth and soil moisture content before irrigation before each irrigation the root depth was measured at three locations within each treatment and the average was used to determine the irrigation depth all drainage treatments cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 and cd 100 cm were irrigated to 100 of fc in the next day of irrigating the control treatment the awc was calculated by subtracting volumetric water content at permanent wilting point pwp from volumetric water content at fc water content at fc was estimated using undisturbed soil samples the samples were saturated from the bottom using irrigation water 0 5 ds m 1 then samples were covered to prevent water loss by evaporation and allowed to drain until no drainage was observed 48 hr the retained volumetric water content in the soil was considered as the soil water content at fc abdallah et al 2019 agaba et al 2010 chen et al 2003 grzesiak et al 2019 water content at pwp was measured by subjecting the undisturbed soil samples to a suction of 1500 kpa after each irrigation drains were monitored on a daily base and when drain flow occurred drain discharge were measured twice a day until the drain showed negligible drainage and the daily average was calculated drain discharge was determined by measuring the amount of running water from drain during a certain interval using a calibrated container and a stopwatch javani et al 2018 drain discharge was expressed as m3 h 1 and converted to mm 2 5 crop water uptake from shallow groundwater groundwater contribution to estimate the crop uptake from shallow groundwater mm for each treatment first the actual sunflower evapotranspiration mm for the control treatment was calculated using the water balance equation as follows i p etc r d s where i is the applied irrigation water mm p is the precipitation mm etc is the actual sunflower evapotranspiration mm r is the runoff mm d is the drainage water mm and s is the change soil moisture due to the practical difficulties in precisely estimating the actual evapotranspiration through the water balance bluemling et al 2007 actual evapotranspiration was calculated as the difference between the applied water taking the control treatment fd 120 cm as a reference and summation of runoff and measured drainage water as no precipitation occurred during the growth period of the sunflower etccontrol i p r d crop water uptake from the shallow groundwater was calculated as follow g i etccontrol p r i d i where gi is the crop water uptake from shallow groundwater mm for certain treatment drain depth and r i and d i are the runoff and drainage water mm for the same treatment respectively 2 6 evaluation of surface irrigation under various drain depths under the different drainage treatments irrigation efficiency was evaluated according to james 1988 rz d ɵ vf c ɵ 100 where rz is the amount of stored water in the effective root zone m d is the depth of the effective root zone 0 4 m ɵvf c ɵ is the volumetric water content at field capacity and

and skogerboe 1987 z at b where z is the calculated infiltrated depth mm t is the opportunity intake time min a is the intercept and b is the slope of the line application efficiency ea was calculated by dividing the volume of water stored mm in the effective root zone to the applied irrigation water depth as follows ea wa dp r wa 100 the water distribution efficiency wde was calculated according to james 1988 as follows wde 1 y rz 100 where y is the average numerical deviation calculated from rz the average depth of water stored in the soil during irrigation rz d ɵ v f c ɵ 2 7 irrigation water use efficiency iwue irrigation wue was calculated as the ratio between seed yield and total volume of water applied according to abdallah 2017 abdallah et al 2018 javani et al 2018 using the following equation iwue sy vt where iwue is the irrigation water use efficiency kg m 3 sy is the seed yield kg ha 1 and vt is total volume of water applied m3 ha 1 2 8 soil salinity analysis soil salinity was measured three times before planting at the end of the first season and at the end of the second season soil samples were collected at 0 30 cm soil depth for all treatments soil salinity was measured in saturated soil paste extract following the standard method of jackson 1973 2 9 statistical analysis the data were subjected to analysis of variance anova using one way completely randomized design in glmmix procedure in sas 9 4 sas 2013 differences between means were confirmed by tukey s honestly significant difference hsd test significant effects and interactions were determined at a significance level of 5 p 0 05 3 results 3 1 average irrigation and drainage water volumes the results presented in table 2 show the average drain outflow values in terms of drainage time the time needed to show a negligible drainage by laterals after irrigation and drain discharge mm d 1 as affected by drain depth on average for the two seasons drainage outflow was negligible stopped after irrigation by 2 3 4 and 6 d for cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 and cd 100 respectively compared to 8 days for cf 120 table 2 decreasing drain depth not only reduced drainage time but also reduced the average drain discharge for example the average drain discharge in the first day after irrigation was 4 81 mm d 1 for the fd 120 cm treatment while the minimum drain discharge 2 48 mm d 1 was observed for the cd 40 cm treatment the reduction in drainage time and drain discharge resulted in a remarkable reduction in drainage water volumes as shown in table 3 decreasing drain depth significantly p 0 05 decreased the drain outflow of drainage water the reduction in drainage water volumes was proportional to drain depth in which cd 40 cm treatment drained out the lowest amount whereas the fd 120 cm recorded the highest drainage volume in the first growing season shallower placement of drain significantly p 0 05 reduced the average drainage water amounts by 77 20 65 76 56 16 and 40 16 for cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 and cd 100 cm respectively with regard to the fd 120 cm treatment the corresponding values in the second season were 78 5 66 0 56 9 and 39 16 table 3 the reduction in drainage water resulted in an obvious decline in the amounts of irrigation water for all drainage treatments for the two seasons table 3 shallower placement of drain significantly p 0 05 decreased the amount of applied water by 29 28 21 88 14 10 and 4 78 for cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 and cd 100 cm respectively compared with fd 120 cm treatment for the first season comparably in the second season the average applied water was decreased by 34 15 23 57 17 97 and 7 37 for cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 and cd 100 cm respectively relative to fd 120 cm treatment taking the fd 120 cm treatment as a reference the difference between the applied and drained water was considered as actual evapotranspiration etsunflower since all plants were not subjected to water deficit throughout the season all treatments were assumed to have similar etsunflower 432 6 mm and 387 0 mm for the first and second season respectively based on water balance for the two seasons the water uptake fron the shallow groundwater was maximum for cd 40 cm treatment and was significantly higher than the other treatments table 3 the water uptake fron the shallow groundwater was 131 7 and 35 0 mm for cd 40 and cd 60 respectively similar trends were calculated for the second season while no water uptake from the groundwater was recorded for cd 80 cd 100 and cd 120 cm for the two seasons 3 2 irrigation efficiency the evaluation of the surface irrigation efficiency was conducted for the post planting irrigation the second irrigation the average of the two seasons for applied water runoff depth required deep percolation water application efficiency and water distribution efficiency as affected by drain depth are presented in table 4 and illustrated in fig 3 the results reveal that applied water depth was significantly affected by drainage treatments in which the highest applied water depth 102 8 mm was recorded under fd 120 cm treatment in contrast the lowest water applied depth 69 4 mm was observed for cd 40 cm treatment the reduction in the applied water depth was proportional to drain depth decreasing the drain depth reduced the applied water depth by 32 50 26 84 14 88 and 8 65 for cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 and cd 100 cm respectively as compared with the fd 120 cm treatment not surprisingly the deep percolation markedly declined with decreasing drain depth the portion of deep percolation was reduced by 92 45 52 8 24 52 and 8 9 for cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 and cd 100 cm respectively with respect to the fd 120 cm treatment as expected the maximum runoff 219 0 mm was recorded at the shallowest drain depths cd 40 cm whereas the lowest value was obtained at cd 80 cm the effect of drain depth on the required water depth to refill root zone to field capacity was minimal since no significant differences were recorded due to decreasing drain depth the only exception is the cd 40 cm treatment in which a lower required water depth was recorded the values of water application efficiency ea were affected by its two components ratio between the total water stored in the root zone and total applied water the highest ea value 64 41 was obtained under cd 40 cm whereas the lowest ea was obtained at the highest drain depth fd 120 cm table 4 the calculated ea values for different drainage treatments were higher than fd 120 cm treatment by 32 40 22 73 10 64 and 3 1 for cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 and cd 100 respectively unexpectedly the values of water distribution efficiency were not affected by cd an exception is the cd 80 cm treatment in which a significantly higher water distribution efficiency was observed as compared with fd 120 cm treatment the effect of cd on water advance recession and opportunity intake times and therefore the infiltrated depth fig 3 and table s1 was markedly affected by decreasing drain depths for example the water advance time at 10 m distance was 8 11 14 18 and 22 min for cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 and cd 100 cm respectively instead of 22 min in the case of the fd 120 cm supplemental materials table s1 similarly the water recession time at 10 m distance was 165 180 200 210 and 225 min for cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 cd 100 and fd 120 cm treatment respectively therefore the highest infiltrated depth 117 0 mm was recorded for the deepest drain fd 120 cm while the lowest value of the infiltrated depth 62 3 mm was found for the shallowest drain cd 40 cm 3 3 sunflower yield yield components and irrigation water use efficiency the effect of drain depth on plant height cm was minimal table 5 where non significant differences were observed due to decreasing drain depths however the effect of drain depth was evident on head diameter seed yield and the weight of 100 seeds the maximum head diameter 18 1 cm and highest weight of 100 seeds 7 15 g were obtained for the shallowest drain depth cd 40 cm while the lowest values were recorded for deepest drain depth fd 120 cm table 5 in the two seasons relative to the control treatment all cd treatments showed a significantly higher head diameter except cd 100 cm that showed a statistically similar head diameter to the control no significant differences were observed between cd 40 cm and cd 60 cm treatments more importantly the sunflower seed yield was significantly affected by the drain depth for the two seasons maximum seed yield was observed for the cd 40 cm treatment that was at par with cd 60 cm treatment and significantly higher than the other treatments for the two seasons no significant differences were observed between cd 100 cm and fd 120 cm treatments table 5 decreasing drain depth significantly increased seed yield over the control treatment fd 120 cm by 24 5 16 44 12 1 and 8 2 in the first season and by 30 0 23 0 13 2 and 6 3 in the second season irrigation wue significantly increased due to decreasing drain depth with the drain depth of 40 cm having a significantly p 0 05 higher iwue compared to all treatments for the two seasons decreasing drain depth led to an increase in iwue over the control treatment fd 120 cm by 75 0 47 2 30 5 and 13 6 in the first season and by 97 3 60 5 39 4 and 15 7 in the second season no significant differences in the iwue were observed between cd 100 cm and fd 120 cm treatments table 5 for the two seasons 3 4 soil salinity the results illustrated in fig 4 show that shallow drain increase soil salinity of the upper soil surface 0 30 cm over time while drain at 120 cm had no effect a notable significant increase in soil salinity in all treatments was observed over time except the fd 120 cm treatment by the end of the second season soil salinity was 2 4 2 0 2 0 and 1 4 times over the initial soil salinity for cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 and cd 100 cm respectively while a non significant reduction in the case of the fd 120 cm treatment was observed 4 discussion the implementation of an extensive subsurface drainage network in the nile delta clay soil northern egypt successfully decreased waterlogging and land salinization however adopting a low efficient irrigation system surface irrigation together with the subsurface drainage at 120 cm depth resulted in excessive drainage and low irrigation water use efficiency iwue therefore it is important to control drain depth to decrease drain outflow and increase iwue in the present study over two seasons the influences of drain depths e g 40 60 80 and 100 cm below the soil surface bss on drain outflow soil salinity sunflower seed yield and iwue were compared with the control fd at 120 cm bss decreasing drain depth associated with a decline in the drain outflow consequently irrigation water remained available for plants in the root zone this was confirmed by the reduced applied water volume particularly at the shallowest drain depth cd 40 cm by decreasing drain depth the irrigation water not only remained available in the root zone but also the shallow groundwater was available for plant uptake thereby applying less irrigation water 4 1 drainage volume and irrigation water applied the increased drainage outflow of fd 120 cm treatment suggests a deeper water table during the growing season compared to shallow drain several studies found deeper water tables under conventional drainage than in controlled drain depth e g in eastern canada helmers et al 2012 in northern iran javani et al 2018 and in central poland sojka et al 2019 moreover the evident reduction in drain outflow observed in the present study when decreasing drain depth were reported in numerous studies worldwide i e in sweden wesström and messing 2007 canada drury et al 2009 sunohara et al 2016 the netherlands ritzema 2015 rozemeijer et al 2016 and the usa helmers et al 2012 jaynes 2012 liu et al 2019 negm et al 2017 poole et al 2018 youssef et al 2018 compared to the conventional drainage the reduction in drain outflow ranged from 33 to 45 javani et al 2018 17 80 skaggs et al 2010 2012 40 100 gunn et al 2015 30 youssef et al 2018 24 6 negm et al 2017 the high variation in the drain outflow could result from different climatic conditions i e rainfall amount distribution and intensity and reference evapotranspiration irrigation system soil properties and technical parameters of the drainage network i e drainage depth drain diameter and spacing and the height to which the outlet was raised negm et al 2017 sojka et al 2019 youssef et al 2018 the highest water conservation was recorded at the lowest drain depth cd 40 cm this results confirm the findings obtained by sojka et al 2019 according to which the most effective solution was found with a high shallow water table due to controlling outlet elevation conceptually the reduction in drain outflow led to an increase in soil water content that might be available for plant use rozemeijer et al 2016 sojka et al 2019 therefore a reduction in irrigation water volume was observed by decreasing drain depth in the control treatment the applied water depth was higher than the drainage treatments by 29 28 21 88 14 10 and 4 78 for cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 and cd 100 cm respectively interestingly decreasing the drain depth led to a significant groundwater storage in the root zone in particular for the cd 40 and cd 60 treatments this result corroborate the findings of rozemeijer et al 2016 in which they indicated that rising the outlet elevation resulted in a reduction in drain discharge and increased the groundwater storage in the soil interestingly decreasing drain depth makes the shallow groundwater available for crop use through capillary rise ayars et al 2006a maintaining a shallow drain in such clay soil suggests a shallower water table depth that increases the capillary up flow and the groundwater storage in the root zone ayars et al 2006a 2006b el ghannam et al 2016 the increased soil salinity observed in the present study for shallow drain treatments supports this scenario ayars et al 2006b similar to our results crop water uptake form the shallow groundwater amounted to 29 for corn 37 for cotton 53 for wheat and 63 for sugar beet ayars et al 2006b these variation in percentage of the groundwater contribution might be attributed to the variation in the cultivated crop climate soil properties irrigation system and technical design of the drainage network the very low initial soil salinity 1 5 ds m 1 confirms that large amount of irrigation water is applied in the presence of an efficient sub surface drainage system at 1 2 m below the soil surface however the increased soil salinity due to decreasing drain depth had no effect on seed yield because the values the maximum observed soil salinity was 3 6 ds m 1 were always less than the salinity threshold of sunflower 4 8 ds m 1 francois 1996 however in the control treatments soil salinity was reduced during the two growing seasons the maintained soil salinity of the control treatment might be due the excess irrigation and the efficient drainage that led to higher drainage volumes this result was supported by the findings of christen et al 2001 in which they reported that most of subsurface free drainage systems across australia were over draining allowing for salt leaching higher than salt was applied with irrigation water 4 2 plant growth parameters and water use efficiency the significant increase in crop yield owing to decreased drain depth particularly cd 40 cm and cd 60 cm was also observed in several studies drury et al 2009 javani et al 2018 nash et al 2015 skaggs et al 2012 sunohara et al 2016 the increase in crop yield might be attributed to the decrease in drain outflow that limits the outflow of nitrate and phosphorous consequently increases n and p availability for plants it is rich established that lower amounts of nitrate and or phosphorous are lost by leaching in the controlled drainage than in the subsurface conventional drainage due to the lower overall drain outflow liu et al 2019 nash et al 2015 negm et al 2017 rozemeijer et al 2016 sojka et al 2019 sunohara et al 2016 wesström and messing 2007 youssef et al 2018 the reduction in the nitrate load varied between 32 and 94 ale et al 2012 bonaiti and borin 2010 sojka et al 2019 wesström et al 2001 2014 this is confirmed by the results sojka et al 2019 which indicate that nitrate loss reductions are mainly due to reduced drainage outflow several studies also reported reductions in n loads ranging from 18 to 80 depending on the cultivated crop precipitation irrigation system and soil type adeuya et al 2012 cooke and verma 2012 drury et al 2009 gunn et al 2015 helmers et al 2012 jaynes 2012 ross et al 2016 youssef et al 2018 the observed increase in seed yield indicates that modifying the sub surface drainage network by decreasing drain depth can contribute to saving water and increasing productivity in the most important agricultural region in north africa 4 3 irrigation system efficiency the enhanced application efficiency ea observed for shallow drain treatments are in accordance with several studies that report similar positive effects bonaiti and borin 2010 javani et al 2018 mejia et al 2000 skaggs and youssef 2008 for example javani et al 2018 reported that the ie was higher in the shallow drain by 8 28 depending on the crop and water table depth the enhanced ea might be attributed to the increased soil water content before irrigation for shallow drain treatments evans and skaggs 2004 the high soil water content before irrigation and stream size in a clay soil characterized by low infiltration rate led to a significant reduction in the advance time table s1 the decreased advance time led to a reduction in water percolation and therefore enhanced the ea it is widely recognized that blocking the outflow water from the drainage network or raising the outlet level facilitates the effective storage of water in the place of its greatest demand drury et al 2009 helmers et al 2012 jaynes 2012 liu et al 2019 poole et al 2018 ritzema 2015 rozemeijer et al 2016 wesström and messing 2007 despite the marked increase in the ea the water distribution efficiency wde was non significantly affected by changing the outlet elevation this non significant effect could be attributed to the reduced advance time that allowed the water to be uniformly distributed along the furrow to the best of our knowledge this is the first study assessing the changes in wdu in response to changing drain depth where most studies focused on the ea since the ea in the nile delta is very low due to adapting flood irrigation the improvement of ea is one of the most important benefits of the modifying the sub surface drainage network the increased ea can contribute to significant water savings in this region therefore the conserved water might be directed to other locations in addition growing water savings contribute to reducing flood risk effects of drought and water competition between framers the observed increase in the iwue of shallow drain treatments is mainly attributable to the significantly higher seed yield and to noticeably decrease in water input the increased irrigation iwue resulted from decreased drain depth confirmed the findings of javani et al 2018 revealing that iwue under shallow drain was higher than fd by 26 and 40 the present study clearly demonstrates that a shallower drain depth might contribute to the mitigation of the effects of water scarcity in egypt by reducing drain outflow and water input in the nile delta in addition a shallow drain depth might be an effective tool for reducing peak discharges and drought stress ritzema 2015 more importantly in accordance with our results several studies indicate that the best benefits stemming from drainage management were obtained at shallow drain darzi naftchali et al 2013 javani et al 2018 sojka et al 2019 this also corroborates the finding of ayars et al 2006a indicating that in arid regions the main suggested modification in the drainage system is reducing drain depth and considering crop water uptake from shallow groundwater furthermore considering salinity buildup when decreasing drain depth is of big importance the upward movement of shallow groundwater will contribute the salinity built up as observed in the present study in the long term possible means of salt management are vital under these conditions in the present study the maximum soil salinity after two seasons 3 6 ds m 1 was still significantly lower that salinity threshold of sunflower 4 8 ds m 1 however the observed pattern of soil salinity implies that in the long term soil salinity will exceed the salinity threshold of sunflower and leaching requirement of 2 12 of irrigation water volumes calculated based on irrigation water salinity and salinity threshold of sunflower must be considered to avoid yield losses however other values of leaching requirements can be used according to the cultivated crop in terms of water management soil salinity should be maintained below salinity threshold of the cultivated crop ayers and westcot 1985 however in terms of soil quality soil salinity should be sustained below 4 ds m 1 richards 1954 when cultivating other crop soil salinity must be restored to its salinity threshold if need other salinity management aspects at farm and regional scales should be adopted in the long term besides the leaching requirements the shifting towards more salt tolerant crops is vital to avoid the negative impacts of the salinity build up in the long term also some agronomic practices i e more frequent irrigation and seeding methods can mitigate the influences of soil salinity it has been demonstrated that careful salinity management e g periodic leaching and suitable cropping systems e g salt tolerant crops might minimize the risk of salinity built up ayars et al 2006a further studies are needed while monitoring groundwater level as wells as well drainage water quality 5 conclusions in the nile delta clay soils flood irrigation and subsurface drainage fd have resulted in excessive drainage and low water use efficiency the influence of decreasing drain depth was assessed on drainage outflows salinity buildup irrigation system and water use efficiencies and seed yield of sunflower compared with fd 120 cm treatment decreasing drain depth reduced drain outflow by 77 85 65 85 56 5 and 39 45 for cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 and cd 100 cm respectively the reduction in drain outflow resulted in a decrease in applied water volumes by 31 7 22 82 16 03 and 6 05 for cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 and cd 100 cm respectively shallow drains make the shallow groundwater available for crop use through capillary rise shallow placement of drain at 40 cm bss increased seed yield and iwue by 27 0 and 86 0 respectively however a drain depth at 40 cm recorded the highest soil salinity 3 6 ds m 1 that was always less than the salinity threshold of sunflower 4 8 ds m 1 the present study shows that the most significant benefits were obtained at shallow drain compared with deeper drain in the nile delta northern egypt reducing drain depth and considering crop water uptake from shallow groundwater are vital management practices that maximize water saving however considering salinity buildup in the root zone when decreasing drain depth is of big importance careful water management and suitable cropping system could be possible means for salt management under these conditions to maintain soil salinity always bellow the salinity threshold of wheat sunflower as well as other cultivated crops funding this research was supported by soils

10225,the conventional sub surface drainage fd in the nile delta clay soil northern egypt results in excessive drainage and low irrigation efficiency ie however a shallower placement of drain might reduce drain outflow and increase ie the ultimate objective of the present study was to determine the optimum drain depth that minimizes drain outflow and maximizes ie and irrigation water use efficiency iwue while maintaining crop yield and soil salinity compared to fd at 120 cm below the soil surface bss the effect of four controlled drain depths cd at 40 60 80 and 100 cm bss on drain outflow ie salinity buildup yield and iwue were investigated for two seasons 2017 18 and 2018 19 wheat sunflower cropping system measurements were conducted for sunflower as a summer crop irrigation was applied based on the soil water content of fd treatment thus irrigation depth varied for each treatment the results showed that decreasing drain depth significantly reduced drain outflow and water input while ie seed yield and iwue were increased the maximum seed yield and iwue were obtained at the shallowest drains compared with fd at 120 cm drain depth at 40 cm decreased drain outflow by 77 20 and water input by 29 3 while increased seed yield and iwue by 27 and 86 respectively based on water balance water uptake from shallow groundwater was maximum for cd 40 cm treatment 31 05 of water uptake and was significantly higher than the other treatments however by the end of the second season treatment with drain depth at 40 cm bss recorded the highest soil salinity 3 6 ds m 1 due to the upward capillary rise of shallow groundwater increased soil salinity had no effect on seed yield because it was below the salinity threshold of sunflower in terms of ie and iwue decreasing drain depth to 40 cm bss is recommended but with potential salinity buildup therefore drain at 60 cm bss had similar seed yield to drain at 40 cm bss might lead to significant water saving 21 8 while maintaining seed yield and soil quality in conclusion modifying the drainage system by reducing drain depth and considering crop water uptake from shallow groundwater might contribute to water saving after all

is a primary future challenge page et al 2020 this challenge is exacerbated by water scarcity and climate change hunt et al 2020 javani et al 2018 sun et al 2020 mena countries middle east and north africa are highly susceptible to climate change consequences because they are more exposed to temperature increases less water availability and rapid population growth hamed et al 2018 mena countries represent the most water stressed region in the world that receives less than 300 mm annually mcnally et al 2019 radhouane 2013 therefore the average annual water resource is always below 1000 m3 per capita hamed et al 2018 besides the already existing water scarcity climate change is expected to impact drought water and food security thereby affecting the stability and security of the region hamed et al 2018 hence immediate and extreme actions have to be directed towards maximizing water use while minimizing the impact of climate change due to the very low amount and unpredictability of rainfall in mena countries the region is mainly dependent on irrigated agriculture however over irrigation groundwater and irrigation salinities and shallow water table result in waterlogging and soil salinization under such conditions the main function of drainage is to prevent waterlogging and soil salinization ayars et al 2006a ritzema 2016 satchithanantham et al 2012 conceptually free outflow drainage networks are designed for the highest wet period of the year however as drainage rates are inconstant throughout the year the free outflow may lead to excessive drainage campus 2019 javani et al 2018 liu et al 2019 ritzema 2016 excessive drainage might result in water deficit nutrients leaching and low irrigation system and water use efficiencies all of which lead to a yield reduction and adverse environmental and economic effects campus 2019 helmers et al 2012 javani et al 2018 sojka et al 2019 several efforts have been directed towards reducing the off site impacts of conventional sub surface drainage fd through the use of different drainage practices the most successful approach is controlled drainage javani et al 2018 sojka et al 2019 controlled drainage is a management method for controlling the amount of drained water with the aim of reducing the off site effects of drainage maintaining good yields as well as mitigating the effect of deficit water stress ayars et al 2006a ritzema 2016 therefore the role of subsurface drainage might be changed from only preventing waterlogging and or soil salinization to an essential element of integrated water and water table management javani et al 2018 satchithanantham et al 2012 sobeih et al 2017 the ultimate objective of water table management is to maintain it at the desired depth to ensure adequate root zone aeration ayars et al 2006a lavaire et al 2017 in controlled drainage drains are shallower than in fd thus water table is raised to a shallower depth a shallower placement of drain might minimizes deep percolation and increases the upward flow by capillarity substituting the decreased soil water content of the surface layer due to evapotranspiration ayars et al 2006a campus 2019 lu et al 2016 hence shallower drain might increase water availability for crops during dry periods thereby reducing drought or water deficit stresses lavaire et al 2017 lu et al 2016 skaggs et al 2012 controlling water table through decreasing drain depth might increase crop yield reduce leaching and increase water use and irrigation system efficiencies campus 2019 it is rich established that shallower placement of drain reduces the drained water volumes campus 2019 helmers et al 2012 javani et al 2018 lavaire et al 2017 liu et al 2019 ritzema 2016 skaggs et al 2012 sojka et al 2019 in a review article conducted by skaggs et al 2010 a reduction of 16 85 in drain outflows was reported the reductions in the drainage water volumes corresponded to an increase in evapotranspiration and crop water uptake craft et al 2018 lu et al 2016 and a reduction in n transport by 18 75 and total p transport by 35 45 depending on drainage system design climate soil and site conditions ayars et al 2006a craft et al 2018 drury et al 2009 helmers et al 2012 javani et al 2018 lavaire et al 2017 liu et al 2019 lu et al 2016 skaggs et al 2012 owing to the conservation in water and nutrients which become readily available for crops an increase in crop yields ranging from 10 to 64 was observed amatya et al 2006 craft et al 2018 javani et al 2018 skaggs et al 2012 however the effect of drain depth on crop yield showed conflicting results skaggs et al 2010 some studies reported yield losses in different crops allred et al 2003 drury et al 2009 while other authors reported mixed results for example satchithanantham et al 2012 found an increase in potato yield in a year over two years moreover drury et al 2009 reported a reduction of 17 4 in corn and soybean yields in two out of four years compared to fd controlled drainage increased corn and soybean yield by 11 and 10 respectively while no effect was observed for wheat poole et al 2013 in the nile delta clay soil northern egypt most of cultivated lands have a shallow water table creating waterlogging and salinization problems that lead to yield losses and land degradation therefore extensive subsurface drainage schemes have been implemented and presently most of the area is served by subsurface drainage at 120 cm the success in preventing waterlogging and salinization was clearly evident by the high productivity and maintained soil quality el ghannam et al 2016 however surface irrigation is the main irrigation system in the nile delta due to land defragmentation the low irrigation efficiency in combination with conventional subsurface fd at 120 cm bss has resulted in excessive drainage and low irrigation water use efficiency the significant amount of drainage flows creates adverse problems for downstream farmers and negatively affects the quality of water in spite of the situation there is no comprehensive study investigating the potential of modifying the drain depth to reduce drainage outflow and thus water input therefore the objective of the current study was to assess the influence of four drain levels depths in addition to the control on drain outflow soil salinity buildup irrigation system and water use efficiencies and crop yields 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and soil a field experiment was carried out in two successive seasons 2018 and 2019 at sakha agricultural research station farm kafr el sheikh governorate egypt the experimental field represents the nile delta clay soil northern egypt the experimental site is located at 31 07 n and 30 57 e and altitude 6 0 m above sea level the study area is characterized by a semi arid mediterranean climate with total annual precipitation averages of 123 2 and 113 8 mm for 2018 and 2019 respectively the precipitation is distributed mainly during the winter while no precipitation occurred during summer months fig 1 the minimum and maximum average temperature was recorded in january 13 7 and in july 28 6 c respectively the lowest and highest average daily reference evapotranspiration was observed in january 2 0 mm d 1 and in june 6 18 mm d 1 respectively the land in the experimental field site is almost flat with a slope lower than 0 005 the rice wheat cropping system is the dominant in the region besides being a highly water and energy demanding cropping system it is markedly contributing to soil degradation due to intensive dry and wet tillage puddling therefore some alternatives less water demanding cropping systems e g maize wheat and sunflower wheat have recently been proposed the dominant irrigation system in the region is flood irrigation the area under study is irrigated by nile fresh water ec 0 5 ds m 1 and served by subsurface drainage at 120 cm depth the groundwater level ranges from 0 9 m in summer due to rice cultivation to 1 1 m in winter the salinity of groundwater ranges from 0 9 ds m 1 in winter to 1 23 ds m 1 in summer the soil in the region constitutes alluvial flood deposits and is classified as clay soil typic torrifluvents soil survey staff 2014 representative surface soil samples at a depth of 0 30 cm were collected using the open auger some physical and chemical characteristics of the soil under investigation are shown in table 1 the collected soil samples were air dried pulverized passed through 2 mm sieve and analyzed analysis of soil texture was performed according to baruah and barthakur 1999 using the pipette method the textural class was determined by the united states department of agriculture usda system soil survey division staff 1993 soil bulk density was measured following the core method blake and hartge 1986 soil moisture was measured gravimetrically and volumetric water content was calculated by multiplying gravimetric water content by soil bulk density baruah and barthakur 1999 soil ph was measured in soil water suspension 1 2 5 while electrical conductivity ec cations and anions were determined in soil paste extract following standard methods of jackson 1973 2 2 experimental design and drainage treatments the experimental field is served by tile drainage system at 120 cm depth which was adopted at different drain depths by modifying the outlet elevation fig 2 in the present study in addition to the control sub surface drainage at 120 cm fd 120 four drainage treatments controlled drain depths were implemented i e 40 cd 40 60 cd 60 80 cd 80 and 100 cm cd 100 due to land limitation and to avoid interference between drainage treatments minimize water table seepage between treatments before initiating the experiment the main field was divided to five separate and isolated sub fields in which each treatment was applied in a separate sub field each sub field was divided into 3 plots with an area of 2000 m2 for each plot 20 m width 100 m length leading to overall 15 plots within each treatment sub field the three replicates were arranged in the same sub field with a 60 m buffering distance between every two replicates each plot was drained by three parallel laterals 75 mm in diameter with drain spacing of 20 m and depth of 120 cm every three laterals within each plot were connected to a manhole through riser fig 2 using control devices the outlet elevation was maintained at any given depth during the experiment 2 3 cultivated crops under different drainage treatments a wheat sunflower cropping system was applied triticum aestivum l sakha 8 variety helianthus annuus l sakha s3 variety in the first season wheat was sown on november 15th 2017 and harvested in mid may 2018 followed by sunflower which was sown on july 15th 2018 and harvested in the mid october 2018 almost the same dates were followed in the second season which ended on october 10th 2019 in the current study measurements were elaborated only for sunflower in such a clay soil wheat as a winter crop grows during the coldest period of the year is usually irrigated twice at sowing and before harvest the sunflower was sown by planter at the rate of 12 kg ha 1 adjusting the distances between rows to 70 cm and 30 cm between hills and at depth of 3 cm recommended rates of npk fertilizers were applied as follows n fertilizer was applied in the form of urea 46 5 n at a rate of 70 kg ha 1 at equal two doses before the post planting irrigation and before the second irrigation phosphorus fertilizer was applied in the form of calcium superphosphate 15 p2o5 at a rate of 350 kg ha 1 before tillage potassium fertilizer in the form of potassium sulphate 48 k2o at the rate of 120 kg ha 1 was added in one dose before the post planting irrigation before the harvest plant height cm and head diameter cm were measured the whole plots were harvested and seed yield at a moisture content of 14 was measured and expressed as kg ha 1 finally 100 seeds were counted and the corresponding mass g was determined 2 4 irrigation water input and drain outflow irrigation water was applied based on the soil water content of the control treatment fd 120 cm thus irrigation depth varied for each treatment after sowing in the first irrigation the same amount of water was provided to all treatments using furrow irrigation system an irrigation water flow meter was used to measure the applied water volume for each treatment subsequent irrigations for all treatments were applied when depleting 50 of the available water capacity awc for the fd 120 cm treatment at 50 field capacity fc all treatments were re irrigated to 100 of fc to determine when to irrigate soil moisture content of the control treatment between irrigations was daily measured manually gravimetric soil water content between irrigations was measured and volumetric water content was calculated by multiplying gravimetric soil water content by bulk density baruah and barthakur 1999 irrigation depth varied for each treatment even within each replicated plot under each treatment and was determined based on the root depth and soil moisture content before irrigation before each irrigation the root depth was measured at three locations within each treatment and the average was used to determine the irrigation depth all drainage treatments cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 and cd 100 cm were irrigated to 100 of fc in the next day of irrigating the control treatment the awc was calculated by subtracting volumetric water content at permanent wilting point pwp from volumetric water content at fc water content at fc was estimated using undisturbed soil samples the samples were saturated from the bottom using irrigation water 0 5 ds m 1 then samples were covered to prevent water loss by evaporation and allowed to drain until no drainage was observed 48 hr the retained volumetric water content in the soil was considered as the soil water content at fc abdallah et al 2019 agaba et al 2010 chen et al 2003 grzesiak et al 2019 water content at pwp was measured by subjecting the undisturbed soil samples to a suction of 1500 kpa after each irrigation drains were monitored on a daily base and when drain flow occurred drain discharge were measured twice a day until the drain showed negligible drainage and the daily average was calculated drain discharge was determined by measuring the amount of running water from drain during a certain interval using a calibrated container and a stopwatch javani et al 2018 drain discharge was expressed as m3 h 1 and converted to mm 2 5 crop water uptake from shallow groundwater groundwater contribution to estimate the crop uptake from shallow groundwater mm for each treatment first the actual sunflower evapotranspiration mm for the control treatment was calculated using the water balance equation as follows i p etc r d s where i is the applied irrigation water mm p is the precipitation mm etc is the actual sunflower evapotranspiration mm r is the runoff mm d is the drainage water mm and s is the change soil moisture due to the practical difficulties in precisely estimating the actual evapotranspiration through the water balance bluemling et al 2007 actual evapotranspiration was calculated as the difference between the applied water taking the control treatment fd 120 cm as a reference and summation of runoff and measured drainage water as no precipitation occurred during the growth period of the sunflower etccontrol i p r d crop water uptake from the shallow groundwater was calculated as follow g i etccontrol p r i d i where gi is the crop water uptake from shallow groundwater mm for certain treatment drain depth and r i and d i are the runoff and drainage water mm for the same treatment respectively 2 6 evaluation of surface irrigation under various drain depths under the different drainage treatments irrigation efficiency was evaluated according to james 1988 rz d ɵ vf c ɵ 100 where rz is the amount of stored water in the effective root zone m d is the depth of the effective root zone 0 4 m ɵvf c ɵ is the volumetric water content at field capacity and

by dividing the volume of water stored mm in the effective root zone to the applied irrigation water depth as follows ea wa dp r wa 100 the water distribution efficiency wde was calculated according to james 1988 as follows wde 1 y rz 100 where y is the average numerical deviation calculated from rz the average depth of water stored in the soil during irrigation rz d ɵ v f c ɵ 2 7 irrigation water use efficiency iwue irrigation wue was calculated as the ratio between seed yield and total volume of water applied according to abdallah 2017 abdallah et al 2018 javani et al 2018 using the following equation iwue sy vt where iwue is the irrigation water use efficiency kg m 3 sy is the seed yield kg ha 1 and vt is total volume of water applied m3 ha 1 2 8 soil salinity analysis soil salinity was measured three times before planting at the end of the first season and at the end of the second season soil samples were collected at 0 30 cm soil depth for all treatments soil salinity was measured in saturated soil paste extract following the standard method of jackson 1973 2 9 statistical analysis the data were subjected to analysis of variance anova using one way completely randomized design in glmmix procedure in sas 9 4 sas 2013 differences between means were confirmed by tukey s honestly significant difference hsd test significant effects and interactions were determined at a significance level of 5 p 0 05 3 results 3 1 average irrigation and drainage water volumes the results presented in table 2 show the average drain outflow values in terms of drainage time the time needed to show a negligible drainage by laterals after irrigation and drain discharge mm d 1 as affected by drain depth on average for the two seasons drainage outflow was negligible stopped after irrigation by 2 3 4 and 6 d for cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 and cd 100 respectively compared to 8 days for cf 120 table 2 decreasing drain depth not only reduced drainage time but also reduced the average drain discharge for example the average drain discharge in the first day after irrigation was 4 81 mm d 1 for the fd 120 cm treatment while the minimum drain discharge 2 48 mm d 1 was observed for the cd 40 cm treatment the reduction in drainage time and drain discharge resulted in a remarkable reduction in drainage water volumes as shown in table 3 decreasing drain depth significantly p 0 05 decreased the drain outflow of drainage water the reduction in drainage water volumes was proportional to drain depth in which cd 40 cm treatment drained out the lowest amount whereas the fd 120 cm recorded the highest drainage volume in the first growing season shallower placement of drain significantly p 0 05 reduced the average drainage water amounts by 77 20 65 76 56 16 and 40 16 for cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 and cd 100 cm respectively with regard to the fd 120 cm treatment the corresponding values in the second season were 78 5 66 0 56 9 and 39 16 table 3 the reduction in drainage water resulted in an obvious decline in the amounts of irrigation water for all drainage treatments for the two seasons table 3 shallower placement of drain significantly p 0 05 decreased the amount of applied water by 29 28 21 88 14 10 and 4 78 for cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 and cd 100 cm respectively compared with fd 120 cm treatment for the first season comparably in the second season the average applied water was decreased by 34 15 23 57 17 97 and 7 37 for cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 and cd 100 cm respectively relative to fd 120 cm treatment taking the fd 120 cm treatment as a reference the difference between the applied and drained water was considered as actual evapotranspiration etsunflower since all plants were not subjected to water deficit throughout the season all treatments were assumed to have similar etsunflower 432 6 mm and 387 0 mm for the first and second season respectively based on water balance for the two seasons the water uptake fron the shallow groundwater was maximum for cd 40 cm treatment and was significantly higher than the other treatments table 3 the water uptake fron the shallow groundwater was 131 7 and 35 0 mm for cd 40 and cd 60 respectively similar trends were calculated for the second season while no water uptake from the groundwater was recorded for cd 80 cd 100 and cd 120 cm for the two seasons 3 2 irrigation efficiency the evaluation of the surface irrigation efficiency was conducted for the post planting irrigation the second irrigation the average of the two seasons for applied water runoff depth required deep percolation water application efficiency and water distribution efficiency as affected by drain depth are presented in table 4 and illustrated in fig 3 the results reveal that applied water depth was significantly affected by drainage treatments in which the highest applied water depth 102 8 mm was recorded under fd 120 cm treatment in contrast the lowest water applied depth 69 4 mm was observed for cd 40 cm treatment the reduction in the applied water depth was proportional to drain depth decreasing the drain depth reduced the applied water depth by 32 50 26 84 14 88 and 8 65 for cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 and cd 100 cm respectively as compared with the fd 120 cm treatment not surprisingly the deep percolation markedly declined with decreasing drain depth the portion of deep percolation was reduced by 92 45 52 8 24 52 and 8 9 for cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 and cd 100 cm respectively with respect to the fd 120 cm treatment as expected the maximum runoff 219 0 mm was recorded at the shallowest drain depths cd 40 cm whereas the lowest value was obtained at cd 80 cm the effect of drain depth on the required water depth to refill root zone to field capacity was minimal since no significant differences were recorded due to decreasing drain depth the only exception is the cd 40 cm treatment in which a lower required water depth was recorded the values of water application efficiency ea were affected by its two components ratio between the total water stored in the root zone and total applied water the highest ea value 64 41 was obtained under cd 40 cm whereas the lowest ea was obtained at the highest drain depth fd 120 cm table 4 the calculated ea values for different drainage treatments were higher than fd 120 cm treatment by 32 40 22 73 10 64 and 3 1 for cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 and cd 100 respectively unexpectedly the values of water distribution efficiency were not affected by cd an exception is the cd 80 cm treatment in which a significantly higher water distribution efficiency was observed as compared with fd 120 cm treatment the effect of cd on water advance recession and opportunity intake times and therefore the infiltrated depth fig 3 and table s1 was markedly affected by decreasing drain depths for example the water advance time at 10 m distance was 8 11 14 18 and 22 min for cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 and cd 100 cm respectively instead of 22 min in the case of the fd 120 cm supplemental materials table s1 similarly the water recession time at 10 m distance was 165 180 200 210 and 225 min for cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 cd 100 and fd 120 cm treatment respectively therefore the highest infiltrated depth 117 0 mm was recorded for the deepest drain fd 120 cm while the lowest value of the infiltrated depth 62 3 mm was found for the shallowest drain cd 40 cm 3 3 sunflower yield yield components and irrigation water use efficiency the effect of drain depth on plant height cm was minimal table 5 where non significant differences were observed due to decreasing drain depths however the effect of drain depth was evident on head diameter seed yield and the weight of 100 seeds the maximum head diameter 18 1 cm and highest weight of 100 seeds 7 15 g were obtained for the shallowest drain depth cd 40 cm while the lowest values were recorded for deepest drain depth fd 120 cm table 5 in the two seasons relative to the control treatment all cd treatments showed a significantly higher head diameter except cd 100 cm that showed a statistically similar head diameter to the control no significant differences were observed between cd 40 cm and cd 60 cm treatments more importantly the sunflower seed yield was significantly affected by the drain depth for the two seasons maximum seed yield was observed for the cd 40 cm treatment that was at par with cd 60 cm treatment and significantly higher than the other treatments for the two seasons no significant differences were observed between cd 100 cm and fd 120 cm treatments table 5 decreasing drain depth significantly increased seed yield over the control treatment fd 120 cm by 24 5 16 44 12 1 and 8 2 in the first season and by 30 0 23 0 13 2 and 6 3 in the second season irrigation wue significantly increased due to decreasing drain depth with the drain depth of 40 cm having a significantly p 0 05 higher iwue compared to all treatments for the two seasons decreasing drain depth led to an increase in iwue over the control treatment fd 120 cm by 75 0 47 2 30 5 and 13 6 in the first season and by 97 3 60 5 39 4 and 15 7 in the second season no significant differences in the iwue were observed between cd 100 cm and fd 120 cm treatments table 5 for the two seasons 3 4 soil salinity the results illustrated in fig 4 show that shallow drain increase soil salinity of the upper soil surface 0 30 cm over time while drain at 120 cm had no effect a notable significant increase in soil salinity in all treatments was observed over time except the fd 120 cm treatment by the end of the second season soil salinity was 2 4 2 0 2 0 and 1 4 times over the initial soil salinity for cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 and cd 100 cm respectively while a non significant reduction in the case of the fd 120 cm treatment was observed 4 discussion the implementation of an extensive subsurface drainage network in the nile delta clay soil northern egypt successfully decreased waterlogging and land salinization however adopting a low efficient irrigation system surface irrigation together with the subsurface drainage at 120 cm depth resulted in excessive drainage and low irrigation water use efficiency iwue therefore it is important to control drain depth to decrease drain outflow and increase iwue in the present study over two seasons the influences of drain depths e g 40 60 80 and 100 cm below the soil surface bss on drain outflow soil salinity sunflower seed yield and iwue were compared with the control fd at 120 cm bss decreasing drain depth associated with a decline in the drain outflow consequently irrigation water remained available for plants in the root zone this was confirmed by the reduced applied water volume particularly at the shallowest drain depth cd 40 cm by decreasing drain depth the irrigation water not only remained available in the root zone but also the shallow groundwater was available for plant uptake thereby applying less irrigation water 4 1 drainage volume and irrigation water applied the increased drainage outflow of fd 120 cm treatment suggests a deeper water table during the growing season compared to shallow drain several studies found deeper water tables under conventional drainage than in controlled drain depth e g in eastern canada helmers et al 2012 in northern iran javani et al 2018 and in central poland sojka et al 2019 moreover the evident reduction in drain outflow observed in the present study when decreasing drain depth were reported in numerous studies worldwide i e in sweden wesström and messing 2007 canada drury et al 2009 sunohara et al 2016 the netherlands ritzema 2015 rozemeijer et al 2016 and the usa helmers et al 2012 jaynes 2012 liu et al 2019 negm et al 2017 poole et al 2018 youssef et al 2018 compared to the conventional drainage the reduction in drain outflow ranged from 33 to 45 javani et al 2018 17 80 skaggs et al 2010 2012 40 100 gunn et al 2015 30 youssef et al 2018 24 6 negm et al 2017 the high variation in the drain outflow could result from different climatic conditions i e rainfall amount distribution and intensity and reference evapotranspiration irrigation system soil properties and technical parameters of the drainage network i e drainage depth drain diameter and spacing and the height to which the outlet was raised negm et al 2017 sojka et al 2019 youssef et al 2018 the highest water conservation was recorded at the lowest drain depth cd 40 cm this results confirm the findings obtained by sojka et al 2019 according to which the most effective solution was found with a high shallow water table due to controlling outlet elevation conceptually the reduction in drain outflow led to an increase in soil water content that might be available for plant use rozemeijer et al 2016 sojka et al 2019 therefore a reduction in irrigation water volume was observed by decreasing drain depth in the control treatment the applied water depth was higher than the drainage treatments by 29 28 21 88 14 10 and 4 78 for cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 and cd 100 cm respectively interestingly decreasing the drain depth led to a significant groundwater storage in the root zone in particular for the cd 40 and cd 60 treatments this result corroborate the findings of rozemeijer et al 2016 in which they indicated that rising the outlet elevation resulted in a reduction in drain discharge and increased the groundwater storage in the soil interestingly decreasing drain depth makes the shallow groundwater available for crop use through capillary rise ayars et al 2006a maintaining a shallow drain in such clay soil suggests a shallower water table depth that increases the capillary up flow and the groundwater storage in the root zone ayars et al 2006a 2006b el ghannam et al 2016 the increased soil salinity observed in the present study for shallow drain treatments supports this scenario ayars et al 2006b similar to our results crop water uptake form the shallow groundwater amounted to 29 for corn 37 for cotton 53 for wheat and 63 for sugar beet ayars et al 2006b these variation in percentage of the groundwater contribution might be attributed to the variation in the cultivated crop climate soil properties irrigation system and technical design of the drainage network the very low initial soil salinity 1 5 ds m 1 confirms that large amount of irrigation water is applied in the presence of an efficient sub surface drainage system at 1 2 m below the soil surface however the increased soil salinity due to decreasing drain depth had no effect on seed yield because the values the maximum observed soil salinity was 3 6 ds m 1 were always less than the salinity threshold of sunflower 4 8 ds m 1 francois 1996 however in the control treatments soil salinity was reduced during the two growing seasons the maintained soil salinity of the control treatment might be due the excess irrigation and the efficient drainage that led to higher drainage volumes this result was supported by the findings of christen et al 2001 in which they reported that most of subsurface free drainage systems across australia were over draining allowing for salt leaching higher than salt was applied with irrigation water 4 2 plant growth parameters and water use efficiency the significant increase in crop yield owing to decreased drain depth particularly cd 40 cm and cd 60 cm was also observed in several studies drury et al 2009 javani et al 2018 nash et al 2015 skaggs et al 2012 sunohara et al 2016 the increase in crop yield might be attributed to the decrease in drain outflow that limits the outflow of nitrate and phosphorous consequently increases n and p availability for plants it is rich established that lower amounts of nitrate and or phosphorous are lost by leaching in the controlled drainage than in the subsurface conventional drainage due to the lower overall drain outflow liu et al 2019 nash et al 2015 negm et al 2017 rozemeijer et al 2016 sojka et al 2019 sunohara et al 2016 wesström and messing 2007 youssef et al 2018 the reduction in the nitrate load varied between 32 and 94 ale et al 2012 bonaiti and borin 2010 sojka et al 2019 wesström et al 2001 2014 this is confirmed by the results sojka et al 2019 which indicate that nitrate loss reductions are mainly due to reduced drainage outflow several studies also reported reductions in n loads ranging from 18 to 80 depending on the cultivated crop precipitation irrigation system and soil type adeuya et al 2012 cooke and verma 2012 drury et al 2009 gunn et al 2015 helmers et al 2012 jaynes 2012 ross et al 2016 youssef et al 2018 the observed increase in seed yield indicates that modifying the sub surface drainage network by decreasing drain depth can contribute to saving water and increasing productivity in the most important agricultural region in north africa 4 3 irrigation system efficiency the enhanced application efficiency ea observed for shallow drain treatments are in accordance with several studies that report similar positive effects bonaiti and borin 2010 javani et al 2018 mejia et al 2000 skaggs and youssef 2008 for example javani et al 2018 reported that the ie was higher in the shallow drain by 8 28 depending on the crop and water table depth the enhanced ea might be attributed to the increased soil water content before irrigation for shallow drain treatments evans and skaggs 2004 the high soil water content before irrigation and stream size in a clay soil characterized by low infiltration rate led to a significant reduction in the advance time table s1 the decreased advance time led to a reduction in water percolation and therefore enhanced the ea it is widely recognized that blocking the outflow water from the drainage network or raising the outlet level facilitates the effective storage of water in the place of its greatest demand drury et al 2009 helmers et al 2012 jaynes 2012 liu et al 2019 poole et al 2018 ritzema 2015 rozemeijer et al 2016 wesström and messing 2007 despite the marked increase in the ea the water distribution efficiency wde was non significantly affected by changing the outlet elevation this non significant effect could be attributed to the reduced advance time that allowed the water to be uniformly distributed along the furrow to the best of our knowledge this is the first study assessing the changes in wdu in response to changing drain depth where most studies focused on the ea since the ea in the nile delta is very low due to adapting flood irrigation the improvement of ea is one of the most important benefits of the modifying the sub surface drainage network the increased ea can contribute to significant water savings in this region therefore the conserved water might be directed to other locations in addition growing water savings contribute to reducing flood risk effects of drought and water competition between framers the observed increase in the iwue of shallow drain treatments is mainly attributable to the significantly higher seed yield and to noticeably decrease in water input the increased irrigation iwue resulted from decreased drain depth confirmed the findings of javani et al 2018 revealing that iwue under shallow drain was higher than fd by 26 and 40 the present study clearly demonstrates that a shallower drain depth might contribute to the mitigation of the effects of water scarcity in egypt by reducing drain outflow and water input in the nile delta in addition a shallow drain depth might be an effective tool for reducing peak discharges and drought stress ritzema 2015 more importantly in accordance with our results several studies indicate that the best benefits stemming from drainage management were obtained at shallow drain darzi naftchali et al 2013 javani et al 2018 sojka et al 2019 this also corroborates the finding of ayars et al 2006a indicating that in arid regions the main suggested modification in the drainage system is reducing drain depth and considering crop water uptake from shallow groundwater furthermore considering salinity buildup when decreasing drain depth is of big importance the upward movement of shallow groundwater will contribute the salinity built up as observed in the present study in the long term possible means of salt management are vital under these conditions in the present study the maximum soil salinity after two seasons 3 6 ds m 1 was still significantly lower that salinity threshold of sunflower 4 8 ds m 1 however the observed pattern of soil salinity implies that in the long term soil salinity will exceed the salinity threshold of sunflower and leaching requirement of 2 12 of irrigation water volumes calculated based on irrigation water salinity and salinity threshold of sunflower must be considered to avoid yield losses however other values of leaching requirements can be used according to the cultivated crop in terms of water management soil salinity should be maintained below salinity threshold of the cultivated crop ayers and westcot 1985 however in terms of soil quality soil salinity should be sustained below 4 ds m 1 richards 1954 when cultivating other crop soil salinity must be restored to its salinity threshold if need other salinity management aspects at farm and regional scales should be adopted in the long term besides the leaching requirements the shifting towards more salt tolerant crops is vital to avoid the negative impacts of the salinity build up in the long term also some agronomic practices i e more frequent irrigation and seeding methods can mitigate the influences of soil salinity it has been demonstrated that careful salinity management e g periodic leaching and suitable cropping systems e g salt tolerant crops might minimize the risk of salinity built up ayars et al 2006a further studies are needed while monitoring groundwater level as wells as well drainage water quality 5 conclusions in the nile delta clay soils flood irrigation and subsurface drainage fd have resulted in excessive drainage and low water use efficiency the influence of decreasing drain depth was assessed on drainage outflows salinity buildup irrigation system and water use efficiencies and seed yield of sunflower compared with fd 120 cm treatment decreasing drain depth reduced drain outflow by 77 85 65 85 56 5 and 39 45 for cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 and cd 100 cm respectively the reduction in drain outflow resulted in a decrease in applied water volumes by 31 7 22 82 16 03 and 6 05 for cd 40 cd 60 cd 80 and cd 100 cm respectively shallow drains make the shallow groundwater available for crop use through capillary rise shallow placement of drain at 40 cm bss increased seed yield and iwue by 27 0 and 86 0 respectively however a drain depth at 40 cm recorded the highest soil salinity 3 6 ds m 1 that was always less than the salinity threshold of sunflower 4 8 ds m 1 the present study shows that the most significant benefits were obtained at shallow drain compared with deeper drain in the nile delta northern egypt reducing drain depth and considering crop water uptake from shallow groundwater are vital management practices that maximize water saving however considering salinity buildup in the root zone when decreasing drain depth is of big importance careful water management and suitable cropping system could be possible means for salt management under these conditions to maintain soil salinity always bellow the salinity threshold of wheat sunflower as well as other cultivated crops funding this research was supported by soils

10226,ridge furrow mulching patterns are beneficial to improve crop yields and rainwater use efficiency but it is not clear whether they can improve productivity and simultaneously maintain soil fertility on the loess plateau of china a three year 2013 2016 field trial was conducted during the rotation of wheat triticum aestivum l maize zea mays l to investigate the effects of ridge furrow mulching patterns on soil moisture soil fertility grain yield and water use efficiency wue four ridge furrow planting patterns included 1 white plastic film mulch over the ridge rw 2 straw mulch over the furrow rs 3 white plastic film mulch over the ridge and straw mulch over the furrow rws and 4 black plastic film mulch over the ridge and straw mulch over the furrow rbs flat planting without mulch was ck the results showed that rw rs rws and rbs significantly improved soil water storage and aboveground biomass throughout each winter wheat and summer maize growing season compared with ck finally winter wheat grain yield and wue in the four mulching treatments markedly increased by 13 0 32 9 and 22 5 41 5 in a wet and cool season 15 5 35 2 and 19 3 41 9 in a season with normal rainfall and temperatures and 27 2 58 9 and 15 3 33 4 in a dry and warm season respectively maize grain yield and wue increased by 12 8 35 0 and 19 5 46 2 in a season with normal rainfall and temperature 15 0 38 5 and 18 0 39 9 in a dry and cool season and 17 4 50 5 and 13 0 42 5 in a dry and warm season respectively among the four mulching treatments rws and rbs significantly improved the yield and wue of wheat and maize relative to rw and rs over the three years after three years soil total nitrogen content in rws and rbs was significantly greater than in rs besides soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen and soil dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen contents in rws and rbs were all markedly higher than in rw and rs our results indicated that rws and rbs were a promising agricultural practice that improved crop production and simultaneously maintained soil fertility in a rain fed semi arid region of china keywords ridge furrow mulching pattern wheat maize rotation yield soil fertility water use efficiency loess plateau of china 1 introduction the global population will reach nine billion by 2050 which implies that there will be a substantial increase in food production demand tilman et al 2011 therefore farmers will have to produce greater crop yields from a limited and decreasing area of arable land fang 2018 water is one of the major limiting factors on crop yield and will become scarcer and more unevenly distributed across the world due to global climate change and the influence of human activity in the 21st century karthe et al 2014 therefore to ensure food security regions with different climate characteristics and different amounts and distributions of water resources need to find adaptive water saving and yield increasing agricultural practices the loess plateau which is spread over approximately 64 million hectares supports about 100 million people and is the major dryland farming area of china chen et al 2015 groundwater resources are sparse and deep which means that most of the farmland on the loess plateau relies solely on rainfall li and xiao 1992 however precipitation at many sites is only 200 400 mm per year and more than 60 of the rainfall falls between june and september in this region wang et al 2012a b and precipitation has declined at a rate of 1 2 mm per year over the last five decades wang 2009 the limited and uneven distribution of water resources and high evaporation rates constrain agricultural development on the loess plateau it has been reported that the two major local cereal crops maize and wheat have low yields 2500 3500 kg ha 1 and 1500 3000 kg ha 1 respectively due to the imbalance between crop water requirements and water supply hu et al 2009 ye and liu 2012 the region has been exceedingly poor for a long time and farmers cannot satisfy the primary demand for grains made by the increasing population li 1999 therefore agricultural practices that increase crop yields by reducing soil evaporation and improving rainwater use efficiency are urgently needed on the loess plateau plastic film mulching pm can reduce soil evaporation increase soil moisture and temperature and improve crop yield and water use efficiency wue li et al 2013 yaghi et al 2013 liu et al 2015 gu et al 2019a therefore it has been widely adopted on the loess plateau over the last few decades recently ridge furrow film mulching rffm which combines pm and the ridge furrow planting method has become popular because it not only has the benefits of pm but also can efficiently collect and utilize rainwater compared with conventional flat planting without film mulching gan et al 2013 however the higher soil moisture and temperature under rffm have led to a more rapid conversion of soil nutrients because rffm improves the micro ecological environment for microorganisms compared with flat planting without mulching gu et al 2018a for example previous research has shown that soil organic carbon soc decomposition was more rapid under rffm and this has led to increasing concern about the sustainability of the soil over the long term when the rffm method is used gan et al 2013 steinmetz et al 2016 therefore it is particularly important to explore an optimal agricultural practice that when combined with rffm can simultaneously improve crop productivity and maintain soil fertility on the loess plateau in recent years straw mulching has also become widespread in winter wheat summer maize double cropping systems on the loess plateau due to the increased use of machinery and response to a ban on straw burning by the chinese government dong et al 2018 straw mulching can reduce soil evaporation loss and keep the soil warmer in winter and cooler in summer chen et al 2007 however straw mulching has not always been shown to increase maize and wheat yields due to poor soil heat and moisture preservation effects taa et al 2004 gao et al 2009 nevertheless straw mulching is seen as an effective practice that can provide soil organic matter and greatly improve the soc concentration dong et al 2018 therefore we hypothesized that combining straw mulching and rffm would concurrently improve crop productivity and maintain soil fertility in a winter wheat summer maize double cropping system the overall objectives of this study were to 1 compare the effects of different film and straw mulching patterns on soil moisture soil fertility grain yield and wue in different meteorological years and 2 determine which pattern can improve crop productivity and simultaneously maintain soil fertility in a winter wheat summer maize double cropping system on the loess plateau of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 the simple description of the experimental site the continuous winter wheat and summer maize field experiments were conducted from 2013 to 2016 at shaanxi experimental center of water saving irrigation 34 18 n 108 24 e 521 m a s l located in the southern part of the loess plateau china the area has a typical semiarid warm temperature and continental monsoon climate the mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm with 65 of the rain falling between june and september the mean annual pan evaporation and air temperature are about 1500 mm and 12 9 c dong et al 2018 respectively and the soil in the experimental field was a silty clay loam composed of 8 sand 75 silt and 17 clay in the 0 20 cm soil layer the soil properties within the upper 30 cm of the soil are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design and field management the field experiment contained popular planting and mulching treatments for winter wheat and summer maize and each treatment was replicated three times the plots were arranged in a randomized block design and were 5 4 2 m in size the planting patterns were displayed in fig 1 the treatments were rw ridge furrow planting with white plastic film mulch over the ridge rs ridge furrow planting with straw mulch over the furrow rws ridge furrow planting with white plastic film mulch over the ridge and straw mulch over the furrow rbs ridge furrow planting with black plastic film mulch over the ridge and straw mulch over the furrow and ck conventional flat planting without mulch the plastic film was made of polyethylene and was 0 008 mm thick winter wheat and summer maize straw 3 5 cm in length was applied at 6 0 t ha 1 to the summer maize and winter wheat plots after the seeds were sown in the rs rws and rbs treatments the winter wheat cv xiaoyan 22 seeds were sown at a rate of 195 kg ha 1 on october 18 2013 october 17 2014 and october 15 2015 and the crops were harvested on june 2 2014 june 5 2015 and june 8 2016 respectively the summer maize cv zhengdan 958 seeds were sown at a density of 66 250 plants ha 1 on june 15 2014 june 15 2015 and june 12 2016 and the crops were harvested on october 10 2014 october 10 2015 and october 2 2016 respectively after harvest the plastic film was removed and the experimental field was tilled using a rotary tine the planting and mulching treatment in each plot was fixed over the three years in each plot basal fertilizers including urea n 46 calcium superphosphate p2o5 16 and potassium sulfate k2o 51 were applied at 180 kg n ha 1 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 90 kg k2o ha 1 respectively before the films and straws were applied in each growing season no irrigation and topdressing fertilizers were applied in the three winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons 2 3 measurements and methods 2 3 1 weather conditions daily rainfall and air temperatures during each growing season were measured by yangling national meteorological observation station which is located 30 m away from the experimental field this study used the rainfall anomaly percentage pr to quantify the dry and wet levels during each wheat and maize growing season lu et al 2009 it is calculated using the following formula 1 p r p p la p la where p mm is the precipitation in each growing season and p la mm is the long term average precipitation 2003 2013 in this study the seasons can be classified as severe wet partial wet normal partial dry and severe dry if 50 p r 75 25 p r 50 25 p r 25 50 p r 25 and 75 p r 50 respectively 2 3 2 soil moisture for winter wheat soil samples were taken at the sowing seedling jointing heading filling and maturity stages for summer maize soil samples were taken every 20 days from sowing to harvest the soil water storage sws dynamics in the 0 40 cm soil layer were monitored by manually taking three soil samples using an auger at 10 cm intervals from the middle of two planting rows in the ck plots and the middle and both edges of the furrows in the rw rs rws and rbs plots the mean soil gravimetric water content gwc was calculated using the oven drying method the sws mm was calculated using the following equation 2 sws gwc γ sd where γ is the soil bulk density g cm 3 of each soil layer and sd is soil depth mm 2 3 3 soil temperature the daily soil temperature dynamics throughout each growing season were determined by recording the soil temperatures at 20 cm depth in each plot soil temperature was recorded from 08 00 to 18 00 two hours intervals every 15 d for winter wheat and every 10 d for summer maize from sowing to harvest the rectangular geothermometers were placed in the middle of the ck plots and in the middle of the ridges and furrows and at the edges of the ridges in the rw rs rws and rbs plots daily soil temperature for ck was calculated by the mean value of the six measurements for rw rs rws and rbs was calculated by the mean value of the six measurements taken by the three geothermometers 2 3 4 soil fertility when the 2016 summer maize harvest took place three soil samples at 0 40 cm depth were taken randomly with an auger at 20 cm intervals in the middle and at both edges of the furrows to determine soc soil total nitrogen tn soil microbial biomass carbon smbc soil microbial biomass nitrogen smbn soil dissolved organic carbon sdoc and soil dissolved organic nitrogen sdon content the soc content was determined using the dichromate wet oxidation method mebius 1960 and the tn content was ascertained using an automatic kjeldahl distillation titration unit liu et al 1996 the smbc and smbn were measured after using the chloroform fumigation k2so4 extraction method brookes et al 1985 vance et al 1987 the smbc in the extracts was determined by the k2cr2o7 feso4 additional heating method and the smbn in the extracts was determined by the kjeldahl method the sdoc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn concentrations were determined using the jones procedures jones and willett 2006 and a shimadzu toc tn analyzer shimadzu corp kyoto japan the sdon content was the difference between the tdn concentration and the combined nitrate nitrogen no3 n and ammonium nitrogen nh4 n concentrations which were determined colorimetrically by the salicylate nitroprusside method on an automated continuous flow analyzer aa3 seal norderstedt germany 2 3 5 shoot biomass the winter wheat aboveground biomass was measured at the seedling jointing heading filling and maturity stages and the summer maize aboveground biomass was measured every 20 days from sowing to harvest thirty winter wheat plants ten plants in the middle row and twenty plants in the side rows for the rw rs rws and rbs plots and ten summer maize plants were sampled randomly from the plot each time the sampled plants were separated by organs then dried in an oven at 105 c for 0 5 h and at 75 c until they reached a relatively constant weight the shoot biomass was the total oven dried weights of the leaves stems and kernels 2 3 6 yield and wue three rows of winter wheat in the same planting furrow for rw rs rws and rbs and two rows of summer maize in the middle of each plot were hands harvested at maturity the maize ears and wheat spikes were shelled and air dried so that the yield could be determined the water content of kernels was about 13 after air drying water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated as follows 3 w u e y e t where y kg ha 1 and et mm are kernel yield and the evapotranspiration of winter wheat and summer maize in each growing season respectively to calculate the et of each treatment soil water contents to a depth of 2 m were determined before sowing and after harvest in each growing season then the sws before sowing swsbs mm and sws after harvest swsah mm were calculated using eq 2 the et was calculated by 4 e t p i d r s w s bs s w s ah where p is precipitation mm i is irrigation amount mm which equaled zero in this study because no irrigation was applied d is the deep drainage into the lower 200 cm boundary mm which was assumed to be negligible in this study because no heavy rain or irrigation occurred during each maize growing season and r is runoff mm which was considered to be zero because each plot was surrounded by ridges to prevent runoff 2 4 data analysis all data are presented as the mean value of the three replicates spss 18 0 was used to conduct the analysis of variance and significant differences between treatments were determined by the least significant differences lsd test at the p 0 05 level the figures were created using origin 8 0 3 results 3 1 rainfall and air temperature the total precipitation during the winter wheat seasons of 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 was 274 8 239 4 and 153 8 mm respectively with rainfall anomalies of 28 6 12 0 and 28 0 which meant that the seasons were classified as partial wet normal rainfall and partial dry seasons respectively fig 2 and table 2 in addition more rainfall occurred between middle february and harvest during the winter wheat seasons of 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 the 2014 summer maize season was categorized as a normal rainfall season with 393 2 mm precipitation and 2015 and 2016 were both classified as partial dry seasons with 283 9 mm and 284 6 mm rainfall respectively fig 2 and table 3 the maize plants suffered severe drought from sowing to early august in 2014 and from early august to harvest in 2016 daily air temperature almost followed the same trend for the three winter wheat growing seasons except that a lower temperature was recorded in january during the 2015 2016 season fig 2 average seasonal temperatures were 8 1 c 8 8 c and 9 1 c in the 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 seasons respectively and the average temperature from 2003 2004 to 2012 2013 during the winter wheat growing seasons was 8 6 c therefore the winter wheat growing seasons of 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 were defined as a cool normal temperature and warm seasons respectively the daily air temperature was higher during the early growth stages and lower during the late growth stages of summer maize in 2014 and 2015 compared with 2016 and showed an opposite tendency in the 2016 maize season fig 2 the average temperatures during the summer maize growing seasons were 23 4 c 22 8 c and 25 2 c in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively and the corresponding temperature for the long term average from 2003 to 2013 was 23 9 c therefore summer maize growing seasons of 2014 2015 and 2016 were classified as normal temperature cool and warm seasons respectively 3 2 soil moisture the planting and mulching treatments significantly influenced sws at 0 40 cm depth during the three winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons fig 3 the sws showed an up and down trend in each winter wheat and summer maize growing season except for the dry and warm winter wheat season of 2015 2016 where rainfall was only 153 8 mm the sws values for all five treatments decreased from sowing to harvesting in this season the mulching treatments especially rws and rbs consistently and significantly improved sws during the winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons and before the winter wheat was sown in 2013 furthermore the mulching treatments markedly increased sws relative to ck before sowing in the winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons except the winter wheat season of 2013 2014 the four mulching treatments significantly improved sws by 7 0 10 0 compared with ck before sowing in the 2016 summer maize season during the wet and cool winter wheat season of 2013 2014 average sws was 7 8 6 2 12 0 and 14 1 higher in rw rs rws and rbs than in ck respectively in seasons with normal rainfall and temperatures the mulching treatments significantly improved sws by 9 2 18 5 for the 2014 summer maize season and by 5 4 14 5 for the winter wheat season of 2014 2015 compared with ck in the dry and cool summer maize season of 2015 sws in ck was 5 3 9 0 4 1 6 1 7 4 14 5 and 8 9 13 4 lower than in rw rs rws and rbs respectively in the dry and warm seasons average sws in rw rs rws and rbs increased by 6 2 4 8 10 4 and 11 5 in the winter wheat season of 2015 2016 and by 4 1 7 7 13 0 and 12 8 in the summer maize season of 2016 respectively compared with ck 3 3 soil temperature the dynamic changes in the soil temperatures at 20 cm soil depth had similar patterns for the different mulching treatments during the three winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons fig 4 the soil temperatures varied from 0 5 c to 24 5 c during the winter wheat growing season and from 15 5 c to 34 2 c during the summer maize growing season across the three years during the winter wheat growing season the mulching treatments had significant influences on soil temperature from 0 to 150 days after sowing das but the significant effects disappeared after 150 das fig 4 soil temperatures in rws rbs and rw significantly improved by 0 6 2 5 c 0 4 1 9 c and 0 3 1 6 c respectively compared with ck from 0 to 150 das across the three seasons a comparison between the ck and rs treatments showed that soil temperatures were higher in ck from 0 to 45 das increased in rs from 60 to 135 das and were almost the same as each other from 150 das to harvest irrespective of treatment the average soil temperature for the winter wheat growing season was 2 0 and 2 4 c higher in 2014 2015 a season with normal temperature and 2015 2016 a warm season than in 2013 2014 where the average temperature was 9 4 c a cool season during the three summer maize growth seasons soil temperature was highest in rw followed by rws and lowest in rs furthermore the soil temperatures in rw and rws were significantly higher than in ck rbs and rs from 0 to 60 das but there were no significant differences among the five treatments after 60 das fig 4 the soil temperatures from 0 to 60 das increased by an average of 2 1 c and 1 7 c in the rw and rws treatments and decreased by 0 8 c and 0 5 c under rs and rbs respectively compared with ck regardless of treatments the average soil temperature during the summer maize growing season was 1 0 c and 2 8 c higher in 2014 a season with normal temperatures and 2016 a warm season respectively than in 2015 when the temperature was 25 1 c a cool season 3 4 soil fertility the soc contents in the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm layers were highest in rs followed by rbs and rws but rw had the lowest soc after three years of the winter wheat and summer maize rotation system fig 5a the soc content in rs was significantly higher than in the other treatments except for rbs at 20 40 cm depth the soc content at 0 40 cm depth in rw decreased by 6 7 on average compared with ck and the soc values at 0 40 cm depth in rs rbs and rws significantly improved by 16 9 8 3 and 11 4 respectively compared with ck in the 0 20 cm layer tn contents for the rw rs rws and rbs were all significantly greater than in ck and the tn content in rws and rbs was significantly higher than in rw and rs fig 5b in the 20 40 cm layer the tn content in ck was only significantly lower than the rws and rbs and tn content did not differ significantly among the four mulching treatments the smbc and smbn contents in the 0 20 and 20 40 cm layers were significantly improved by mulching treatments fig 5c and d the rbs had the highest smbc content among the four mulching treatments followed by rws however smbn content was the opposite of smbc the smbc and smbn contents in rws were not significantly different from rbs at the 0 20 or 20 40 cm soil depths at 0 20 cm depth rs contained significantly more smbc and significantly less smbn than rw however there was no significant differences in smbc and smbn contents between rw and rs at 20 40 cm depth although the smbc content was higher in rs and the smbn content was higher in rw at 0 40 cm depth the average smbc contents in rw rs rws and rbs significantly increased by 25 5 33 3 41 3 and 43 3 and the corresponding smbn contents significantly increased by 32 7 17 2 47 4 and 43 7 respectively compared with ck the mulching treatments increased sdoc and sdon contents compared with ck in the 0 20 and 20 40 cm soil layers but the improvements were not significant for the rw treatment fig 5e and f among the four mulching treatments rws and rbs improved sdoc and sdon contents relative to rw and rs except that the sdoc contents at 20 40 cm depth in rs and rws did not significantly differ from each other in the 0 20 and 20 40 cm layers the average sdoc content increased by 12 8 and 6 4 in rws and 15 0 and 8 4 in rbs compared with rw and rs respectively and sdon content increased by 42 1 and 17 3 in rws and 36 2 and 12 5 in rbs compared with rw and rs respectively 3 5 shoot biomass the mulching treatments significantly increased the shoot biomasses of winter wheat and summer maize throughout the growing seasons compared with ck fig 6 furthermore the shoot biomasses of winter wheat and summer maize in rws and rbs were significantly greater than in rw and rs the shoot biomass of winter wheat was consistently highest in rws followed by rbs however there were no significant differences between the two treatments except that shoot biomass was significantly higher by 4 1 8 1 465 760 kg ha 1 in rws than in rbs from the jointing to maturity stages in 2013 2014 wet and cool season the shoot biomass of winter wheat in rw and rs did not significantly differ during the 2013 2014 whereas aboveground biomass production in rw was significantly higher at the jointing filling and maturity stages in 2014 2015 a season with normal rainfall and temperature and at the jointing heading filling and maturity stages in 2015 2016 a dry and warm season the average biomass values for all three growing seasons showed that shoot biomasses of winter wheat at maturity in rws rbs rw and rs were significantly higher by 29 8 3670 kg ha 1 24 6 3020 kg ha 1 16 7 2050 kg ha 1 and 13 4 1649 kg ha 1 than in ck respectively regardless of treatments average shoot biomass of winter wheat at maturity in 2015 2016 significantly decreased by 27 0 4351 kg ha 1 and 22 3 3393 kg ha 1 compared with 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 respectively in contrast to winter wheat summer maize shoot biomass was consistently highest in rbs followed by rws but significant differences between the two treatments were only observed from 80 das to maturity in 2016 the shoot biomass was 6 7 9 8 577 910 kg ha 1 higher for rbs than for rws likewise the aboveground summer maize biomass was consistently higher for rs than for rw across the three seasons but significant differences were only found from 80 das to maturity in 2016 where shoot biomass was 8 4 11 0 529 1044 kg ha 1 higher in rs irrespective of treatments the summer maize average shoot biomass at maturity was highest in 2014 it was significantly higher by 16 1 2487 kg ha 1 and 45 8 5627 kg ha 1 than in 2015 and 2016 respectively the summer maize averages for the three growing seasons at maturity in rbs rws rs and rw were significantly higher by 39 9 4903 kg ha 1 35 5 4357 kg ha 1 24 3 2982 kg ha 1 and 19 8 2430 kg ha 1 compared with ck respectively 3 6 winter wheat and summer maize grain yields the mulching treatments significantly increased winter wheat grain yield in each season compared with ck fig 7a they significantly improved winter wheat yields by 13 0 32 9 in 2013 2014 a wet and cool season 15 5 35 2 in 2014 2015 a season with normal rainfall and temperatures and 27 2 58 9 in 2015 2016 a dry and warm season the rws treatment consistently produced the highest grain yield followed by rbs but there were no significant differences between rws and rbs except that grain yield was higher for rbs than for the rws in the 2013 2014 the grain yield was significantly higher for rbs and rws than for the rw and rs besides the yield was significantly lower for the rs than for the rw in the 2015 2016 growing season however there were no significant differences between the two treatments in the wet and cool season of 2013 2014 and in the normal season of 2014 2015 in contrast to winter wheat rbs consistently produced the highest maize yields across the three seasons followed by rws fig 7b grain yield in rbs was not significantly different from rws in 2014 and 2015 but was significantly lower than rws in 2016 the yield increasing effects of rbs 35 0 50 5 and rws 31 2 41 9 were significantly higher than for rw 12 8 17 4 and rs 15 9 25 9 the yield was significantly higher for the rs than for the rw in 2016 but there were no significant differences between the two treatments in 2014 and 2015 3 7 et and wue in the 2013 2014 a wet and cool season and 2014 2015 a season with normal rainfall and temperatures winter wheat seasons the mulching treatments especially rbs significantly decreased et by 4 8 7 8 and 3 6 6 0 respectively compared with ck table 4 in 2015 2016 a dry and warm season the et in the mulching treatments was significantly greater than in ck and et in rws and rbs was significantly higher than in rw and rs regardless of the types of season the wue in the mulching treatments was significantly higher than in ck the wue in rws was higher than in rbs but there were no significant differences between the two treatments over all three seasons irrespective of the treatments ets and wues in 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 were significantly higher than in 2015 2016 in 2014 a season with normal rainfall and temperature summer maize grown under ck consumed significantly more water than under the mulching treatments but there were no significant differences among the four mulching treatments table 5 in 2015 a cool season with normal rainfall during the early growing period and partially dry during the late growing period the et was almost the same among all five treatments however in 2016 a warm season with a severe dry period during the late growing period the et values in rw rs rws and rbs were significantly greater by 3 9 8 7 5 5 and 5 6 than in ck respectively the wues in rws and rbs were significantly higher than in rw and rs across the three seasons and wue in rbs consistently higher than in rws regardless of treatments et was highest in 2014 and lowest in 2015 whereas wue was highest in 2015 and lowest in 2016 the total ets for winter wheat and summer maize from 2013 to 2016 did not significantly differ among the five treatments table 6 the rw rs rws and rbs treatments significantly improved total yield and wue compared with ck the total yield and wue improvements in rws and rbs were significantly higher than in rw and rs but there were no significant differences between rws and rbs and between rw and rs 4 discussion 4 1 soil moisture and temperature water scarcity is a constant and growing problem on the loess plateau where rainfall is low and evaporation rates are high more seriously most of the rainfall is lower than 5 mm and cannot be absorbed and utilized by crops gu et al 2017 it has been reported that only 25 30 of the rainfall can be absorbed and utilized by crops and that more than 70 of the rainfall was wasted through evaporation and runoff wang et al 2012a b mulching has been shown to be an effective agricultural practice that can be used to conserve water by suppressing soil evaporation especially during the early crop growth stage when the crop canopy is small gu et al 2018b the ridge furrow planting pattern is also a widely used agricultural system on the loess plateau that can prevent runoff and conserve soil water if mulching and the ridge furrow planting pattern were combined then soil moisture conservation could be further improved gan et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 in this study sws was consistently higher in rw rs rws and rbs than in ck throughout the three years fig 3 among the four mulching treatments sws was significantly higher in rws and rbs than in rw and rs the reason might be that rws and rbs not only harvest rainwater especially light precipitation 5 mm using the mulching ridges but also reduce soil evaporation by mulching the ridges and furrows whereas rw and rs are only able carry out one of these two functions yin et al 2016 in addition sws in rbs was slightly greater than in rws during the three winter wheat seasons whereas sws in rbs and rws were almost equal to each other during the three summer maize seasons this may be because 1 the higher soil temperature in rws improved the growth of winter wheat which would consume more soil water to support the increased shoot biomass in contrast the lower soil temperature in rbs improved the growth of summer maize which would also lead to increased soil moisture consumption 2 the black plastic film decreased weed growth and reduced the inefficient consumption of soil moisture by winter wheat the increased crop water consumption was comparable to the reduced ineffective water loss for summer maize under rbs qin et al 2018 yin et al 2016 in addition the variation in sws was mainly influenced by rainfall amount and distribution rainfall in the 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 winter wheat seasons and the 2014 summer maize season mainly fell during the late growth stages which meant that sws first decreased and then increased in these seasons fig 3 however sws in the 2015 and 2016 summer maize seasons showed an up down trend because precipitation in these seasons fell evenly throughout the season the sws in the 2015 2016 winter wheat season decreased throughout the whole season due to the scarce rainfall the average sws throughout the winter wheat season in the dry 2015 2016 season was 14 5 16 1 lower than in the wet 2013 2014 season and 9 0 11 2 lower than in 2014 2015 season which had normal rainfall the mulching treatments especially white plastic film significantly influenced soil temperature before 150 das for winter wheat and before 60 das for summer maize after that the significant differences between the mulching treatments and ck disappeared fig 4 this result agreed with previous studies haapala et al 2015 subrahmaniyan et al 2018 and the main reason is that the mulched area probably received a majority of the solar energy in the early growth stages when the crop canopy was small and this energy would have warmed the topsoil in contrast the large mature plant canopies during the late growth stages blocked the solar energy and the solar warming effect was reduced zhou et al 2009 the soil temperature results for each mulching treatment were different for winter wheat before 150 das and summer maize before 60 das for winter wheat the plastic film mulching treatments rw rws and rbs all led to higher soil temperatures than for ck whereas for summer maize the soil temperature in ck was significantly lower than in rw and rws but was markedly higher than in rbs in addition the rws soil temperature was generally much higher than the rbs soil temperature especially in the summer maize season the result might be due to the low light permeability and low pass through of radiant heat characteristics of black plastic film in the summer season when the temperatures are high moreno and moreno 2008 wang et al 2015 reported that the topsoil was insulated by straw mulching when the weather was colder our results demonstrated that the soil temperature in rs was 0 2 0 8 c higher than the in ck in the winter season from 60 to 135 das however the soil temperature in rs was lower than in ck before 60 das for winter wheat and summer maize this may have been due to the straw mulch on the soil surface forming a physical barrier that could block the solar radiation and prevent exchange between the soil and atmosphere which would decrease the soil temperature when the air temperature was higher and increase the soil temperature when the air temperature was lower kar and kumar 2007 4 2 soil fertility plastic film mulching has been extensively used in the arid and semi arid regions of china to increase crop productivity however how this practice may affect soil fertility is still unclear soil organic carbon a major indicator of agricultural ecosystem sustainability can be greatly influenced by plastic film mulching li et al 2007 in this study the soc content at 0 20 cm soil depth in rw was significantly lower than in ck after three years of a winter wheat and summer maize rotation fig 5a this result was consistent with zhang et al 2015 and tian et al 2013 the reasons might be that the higher soil moistures and temperatures under plastic film mulching could improve microbial activity and increase soc mineralization which would lead to a decrease in the soc content and a decline in soil quality zhou et al 2012 our results indicated that plastic film mulching may not be a long term solution for improving agricultural productivity while maintaining soil fertility yin et al 2019 showed that the stimulation of soc mineralization by the increased soil temperature and moisture in the mulched treatments could be balanced by an increase in carbon input to the soil relative to the non mulched treatments this was confirmed by this study which showed that rs rws and rbs treatments significantly improved the soc content in the 0 20 cm soil layer and the rs and rbs treatments significantly improved soc in the 20 40 cm soil layer compared with ck and rw fig 5a total nitrogen is also an important indicator of soil fertility the higher soil moisture and temperature levels under the mulching treatments accelerated soil mineralization which increased tn content zhou et al 2012 in this study the four mulching treatments all increased soil tn content in the 0 20 and 20 40 cm soil layers after three years of a winter wheat and summer maize rotation fig 5b however the increase was only 3 5 8 5 this small increase might be due to the greater plant biomass under the mulching treatments absorbing more soil n smbc and smbn these changes may influence nutrient cycling in agricultural ecosystems furthermore smbc and smbn are considered to be important indicators of soil quality although they only account for a small proportion of soc and tn powlson et al 1987 mclauchlan and hobbie 2004 in this study rw rs rws and rbs significantly improved smbc and smbn contents compared with ck in the 0 20 and 20 40 cm soil layers fig 5c and d our results supported by liu et al 2013 and gu et al 2019b who found that smbc and smbn contents in the topsoil under film mulching were markedly greater than under the non mulching treatments and that this might be due to the higher topsoil moistures and temperatures under the mulches leading to improved soil biochemical properties and soil microbial activity zhou et al 2012 in addition the higher soil moistures and appropriate soil temperatures led to significantly higher smbc and smbn concentrations in the rws and rbs treatments compared with the rw and rs treatments especially in the 0 20 cm soil layer in this study sdoc and sdon contents in ck did not differ significantly from rw in the 0 20 and 20 40 cm soil layers fig 5e and f which was probably because the increases in soil moisture and temperature under plastic film mulching changed the soil biological characteristics stimulated microbial activity and increased sdoc and sdon consumption which would decrease the sdoc and sdon concentrations neff and asner 2001 in contrast the sdoc and sdon contents in rs rws and rbs were markedly higher than in ck at both the 0 20 and 20 40 cm soil depths and this was probably because crop straw decomposition released a substantial amount of doc increased labile organic c and n and alleviated microbial nutrient limitations li et al 2016 xie et al 2017 in our study the soc contents in rws and rbs were greater than in rw and ck but were lower than in rs whereas the tn smbc smbn sdoc and sdon contents in rws and rbs were all higher than rw rs and ck in the 0 20 and 20 40 cm soil layers after three years of winter wheat and summer maize rotation fig 5 this indicated that a combination of plastic film mulching and straw mulching could maintain soil fertility in a winter wheat and summer maize rotation system on the loess plateau 4 3 grain yield and wue many previous studies have reported that ridge furrowing with mulching significantly increased crop yield and wue ren et al 2016 mo et al 2017 gu et al 2018b qin et al 2018 our study produced similar results the mulching treatments rw rs rws and rbs markedly increased the winter wheat and summer maize grain yields and wues over the three years fig 7 tables 4 and 5 the yield and wue increase under the ridge furrow with mulching treatments were mainly because more soil water was saved through reduced soil evaporation furthermore more collected rainwater was used during the crop transpiration process especially during critical growth stages liu et al 2010 gu et al 2016 the rw treatment with plastic film mulching over ridges allows any rainwater falling onto the ridges to flow along the slope and then infiltrate the furrow soils which increases root zone soil moisture gu et al 2016 ren et al 2016 however rs with straw mulching over furrows can inhibit soil evaporation and thus conserve soil moisture chen et al 2007 li et al 2013 dong et al 2018 the rws and rbs treatments which combined rw and rs not only harvested rainwater by film mulching the ridges but also conserved soil moisture by straw mulching the furrows combining these processes significantly increased soil moisture retention the greater soil moisture and the lower water losses throughout the winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons meant that the yields and wues for winter wheat and summer maize in rws and rbs were significantly higher than in rw and rs over the three years this confirmed the results reported by yin et al 2016 and hu et al 2019 besides this study also found that rs produced significantly lower winter wheat yields in the dry and warm season 2015 2016 compared with rw in contrast the warm season 2016 markedly increased summer maize yields in rs compared with rw fig 7 drought and low temperatures during the over wintering growth stage were the major factors that limited winter wheat yield in the dry and warm winter wheat season drought became the leading factor limiting yield and higher soil moisture under rw due to the better rainwater collection effect led to higher yields in rw than in rs high temperatures and drought also limited the summer maize yield in the dry and warm 2016 summer maize season no rain fell during the tasseling and filling stages from late july to middle september therefore no rainwater was harvested by the mulching ridges and a large amount of soil moisture was lost through the bare furrows this meant that drought and high temperature limited summer maize yields in 2016 some studies have reported that black plastic film can produce significantly higher maize yields than white plastic film eldoma et al 2016 mo et al 2017 qin et al 2018 but the reverse results as well as no difference between the two colored films have also been reported by mbah et al 2010 the greater warming effect under white film mulching could lead to root senescence and reduced plant growth which would lead to summer maize yield reductions especially in a warm season with adequate accumulated temperature qin et al 2018 our study demonstrated that maize yield in rws was significantly lower 6 0 368 kg ha 1 than in rbs for the warm season of 2016 when the average air temperature was 25 2 c whereas the maize yield did not significantly differ between rbs and rws in the cool season of 2015 the average air temperature was 22 8 c and the season of 2014 when the air temperature was normal the average air temperature was 23 4 c in contrast the greater warming effect under white film improved winter wheat growth in our study rws consistently produced higher winter wheat yields than rbs over the three seasons fig 7 furthermore winter wheat yields in rws were higher than rbs in the cool season of 2013 2014 the average air temperature was 8 05 c and there were no significant differences between the two treatments in the season of 2014 2015 the air temperature was normal and in the season of 2015 2016 the air temperature was above average our results demonstrated that the winter wheat yield and wue in rws were higher than in rbs but the reverse was true for summer maize where wue was higher in rbs however rws for winter wheat and rbs for summer maize was not conducted in the present study and the mulching effects of this treatment on soil hydrothermal conditions soil fertility grain yield et and wue in continuous winter wheat and summer maize cropping system on the losses plateau need to be further explored 5 conclusions the rw rs rws and rbs can greatly improve soil moisture shoot biomass grain yield and wue in winter wheat and summer maize cropping system compared with ck after three years soil fertility indicators soc tn smbc smbn sdoc and sdon contents were higher in rws and rbs than in rw rs and ck furthermore rws and rbs produced significantly higher grain yields and wues than rw and rs therefore rws or rbs can be recommended as a promising agricultural practice that simultaneously improves crop productivity and sustains soil fertility when continuous winter wheat and summer maize cropping systems in rain fed semi arid regions of china are used in addition rws for winter wheat and rbs for summer maize should be considered when attempting to further improve crop yields in a continuous winter wheat and summer maize cropping system declaration of competing interest the authors

10226,ridge furrow mulching patterns are beneficial to improve crop yields and rainwater use efficiency but it is not clear whether they can improve productivity and simultaneously maintain soil fertility on the loess plateau of china a three year 2013 2016 field trial was conducted during the rotation of wheat triticum aestivum l maize zea mays l to investigate the effects of ridge furrow mulching patterns on soil moisture soil fertility grain yield and water use efficiency wue four ridge furrow planting patterns included 1 white plastic film mulch over the ridge rw 2 straw mulch over the furrow rs 3 white plastic film mulch over the ridge and straw mulch over the furrow rws and 4 black plastic film mulch over the ridge and straw mulch over the furrow rbs flat planting without mulch was ck the results showed that rw rs rws and rbs significantly improved soil water storage and aboveground biomass throughout each winter wheat and summer maize growing season compared with ck finally winter wheat grain yield and wue in the four mulching treatments markedly increased by 13 0 32 9 and 22 5 41 5 in a wet and cool season 15 5 35 2 and 19 3 41 9 in a season with normal rainfall and temperatures and 27 2 58 9 and 15 3 33 4 in a dry and warm season respectively maize grain yield and wue increased by 12 8 35 0 and 19 5 46 2 in a season with normal rainfall and temperature 15 0 38 5 and 18 0 39 9 in a dry and cool season and 17 4 50 5 and 13 0 42 5 in a dry and warm season respectively among the four mulching treatments rws and rbs significantly improved the yield and wue of wheat and maize relative to rw and rs over the three years after three years soil total nitrogen content in rws and rbs was significantly greater than in rs besides soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen and soil dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen contents in rws and rbs were all markedly higher than in rw and rs our results indicated that rws and rbs were a promising agricultural practice

tilman et al 2011 therefore farmers will have to produce greater crop yields from a limited and decreasing area of arable land fang 2018 water is one of the major limiting factors on crop yield and will become scarcer and more unevenly distributed across the world due to global climate change and the influence of human activity in the 21st century karthe et al 2014 therefore to ensure food security regions with different climate characteristics and different amounts and distributions of water resources need to find adaptive water saving and yield increasing agricultural practices the loess plateau which is spread over approximately 64 million hectares supports about 100 million people and is the major dryland farming area of china chen et al 2015 groundwater resources are sparse and deep which means that most of the farmland on the loess plateau relies solely on rainfall li and xiao 1992 however precipitation at many sites is only 200 400 mm per year and more than 60 of the rainfall falls between june and september in this region wang et al 2012a b and precipitation has declined at a rate of 1 2 mm per year over the last five decades wang 2009 the limited and uneven distribution of water resources and high evaporation rates constrain agricultural development on the loess plateau it has been reported that the two major local cereal crops maize and wheat have low yields 2500 3500 kg ha 1 and 1500 3000 kg ha 1 respectively due to the imbalance between crop water requirements and water supply hu et al 2009 ye and liu 2012 the region has been exceedingly poor for a long time and farmers cannot satisfy the primary demand for grains made by the increasing population li 1999 therefore agricultural practices that increase crop yields by reducing soil evaporation and improving rainwater use efficiency are urgently needed on the loess plateau plastic film mulching pm can reduce soil evaporation increase soil moisture and temperature and improve crop yield and water use efficiency wue li et al 2013 yaghi et al 2013 liu et al 2015 gu et al 2019a therefore it has been widely adopted on the loess plateau over the last few decades recently ridge furrow film mulching rffm which combines pm and the ridge furrow planting method has become popular because it not only has the benefits of pm but also can efficiently collect and utilize rainwater compared with conventional flat planting without film mulching gan et al 2013 however the higher soil moisture and temperature under rffm have led to a more rapid conversion of soil nutrients because rffm improves the micro ecological environment for microorganisms compared with flat planting without mulching gu et al 2018a for example previous research has shown that soil organic carbon soc decomposition was more rapid under rffm and this has led to increasing concern about the sustainability of the soil over the long term when the rffm method is used gan et al 2013 steinmetz et al 2016 therefore it is particularly important to explore an optimal agricultural practice that when combined with rffm can simultaneously improve crop productivity and maintain soil fertility on the loess plateau in recent years straw mulching has also become widespread in winter wheat summer maize double cropping systems on the loess plateau due to the increased use of machinery and response to a ban on straw burning by the chinese government dong et al 2018 straw mulching can reduce soil evaporation loss and keep the soil warmer in winter and cooler in summer chen et al 2007 however straw mulching has not always been shown to increase maize and wheat yields due to poor soil heat and moisture preservation effects taa et al 2004 gao et al 2009 nevertheless straw mulching is seen as an effective practice that can provide soil organic matter and greatly improve the soc concentration dong et al 2018 therefore we hypothesized that combining straw mulching and rffm would concurrently improve crop productivity and maintain soil fertility in a winter wheat summer maize double cropping system the overall objectives of this study were to 1 compare the effects of different film and straw mulching patterns on soil moisture soil fertility grain yield and wue in different meteorological years and 2 determine which pattern can improve crop productivity and simultaneously maintain soil fertility in a winter wheat summer maize double cropping system on the loess plateau of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 the simple description of the experimental site the continuous winter wheat and summer maize field experiments were conducted from 2013 to 2016 at shaanxi experimental center of water saving irrigation 34 18 n 108 24 e 521 m a s l located in the southern part of the loess plateau china the area has a typical semiarid warm temperature and continental monsoon climate the mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm with 65 of the rain falling between june and september the mean annual pan evaporation and air temperature are about 1500 mm and 12 9 c dong et al 2018 respectively and the soil in the experimental field was a silty clay loam composed of 8 sand 75 silt and 17 clay in the 0 20 cm soil layer the soil properties within the upper 30 cm of the soil are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design and field management the field experiment contained popular planting and mulching treatments for winter wheat and summer maize and each treatment was replicated three times the plots were arranged in a randomized block design and were 5 4 2 m in size the planting patterns were displayed in fig 1 the treatments were rw ridge furrow planting with white plastic film mulch over the ridge rs ridge furrow planting with straw mulch over the furrow rws ridge furrow planting with white plastic film mulch over the ridge and straw mulch over the furrow rbs ridge furrow planting with black plastic film mulch over the ridge and straw mulch over the furrow and ck conventional flat planting without mulch the plastic film was made of polyethylene and was 0 008 mm thick winter wheat and summer maize straw 3 5 cm in length was applied at 6 0 t ha 1 to the summer maize and winter wheat plots after the seeds were sown in the rs rws and rbs treatments the winter wheat cv xiaoyan 22 seeds were sown at a rate of 195 kg ha 1 on october 18 2013 october 17 2014 and october 15 2015 and the crops were harvested on june 2 2014 june 5 2015 and june 8 2016 respectively the summer maize cv zhengdan 958 seeds were sown at a density of 66 250 plants ha 1 on june 15 2014 june 15 2015 and june 12 2016 and the crops were harvested on october 10 2014 october 10 2015 and october 2 2016 respectively after harvest the plastic film was removed and the experimental field was tilled using a rotary tine the planting and mulching treatment in each plot was fixed over the three years in each plot basal fertilizers including urea n 46 calcium superphosphate p2o5 16 and potassium sulfate k2o 51 were applied at 180 kg n ha 1 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 90 kg k2o ha 1 respectively before the films and straws were applied in each growing season no irrigation and topdressing fertilizers were applied in the three winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons 2 3 measurements and methods 2 3 1 weather conditions daily rainfall and air temperatures during each growing season were measured by yangling national meteorological observation station which is located 30 m away from the experimental field this study used the rainfall anomaly percentage pr to quantify the dry and wet levels during each wheat and maize growing season lu et al 2009 it is calculated using the following formula 1 p r p p la p la where p mm is the precipitation in each growing season and p la mm is the long term average precipitation 2003 2013 in this study the seasons can be classified as severe wet partial wet normal partial dry and severe dry if 50 p r 75 25 p r 50 25 p r 25 50 p r 25 and 75 p r 50 respectively 2 3 2 soil moisture for winter wheat soil samples were taken at the sowing seedling jointing heading filling and maturity stages for summer maize soil samples were taken every 20 days from sowing to harvest the soil water storage sws dynamics in the 0 40 cm soil layer were monitored by manually taking three soil samples using an auger at 10 cm intervals from the middle of two planting rows in the ck plots and the middle and both edges of the furrows in the rw rs rws and rbs plots the mean soil gravimetric water content gwc was calculated using the oven drying method the sws mm was calculated using the following equation 2 sws gwc γ sd where γ is the soil bulk density g cm 3 of each soil layer and sd is soil depth mm 2 3 3 soil temperature the daily soil temperature dynamics throughout each growing season were determined by recording the soil temperatures at 20 cm depth in each plot soil temperature was recorded from 08 00 to 18 00 two hours intervals every 15 d for winter wheat and every 10 d for summer maize from sowing to harvest the rectangular geothermometers were placed in the middle of the ck plots and in the middle of the ridges and furrows and at the edges of the ridges in the rw rs rws and rbs plots daily soil temperature for ck was calculated by the mean value of the six measurements for rw rs rws and rbs was calculated by the mean value of the six measurements taken by the three geothermometers 2 3 4 soil fertility when the 2016 summer maize harvest took place three soil samples at 0 40 cm depth were taken randomly with an auger at 20 cm intervals in the middle and at both edges of the furrows to determine soc soil total nitrogen tn soil microbial biomass carbon smbc soil microbial biomass nitrogen smbn soil dissolved organic carbon sdoc and soil dissolved organic nitrogen sdon content the soc content was determined using the dichromate wet oxidation method mebius 1960 and the tn content was ascertained using an automatic kjeldahl distillation titration unit liu et al 1996 the smbc and smbn were measured after using the chloroform fumigation k2so4 extraction method brookes et al 1985 vance et al 1987 the smbc in the extracts was determined by the k2cr2o7 feso4 additional heating method and the smbn in the extracts was determined by the kjeldahl method the sdoc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn concentrations were determined using the jones procedures jones and willett 2006 and a shimadzu toc tn analyzer shimadzu corp kyoto japan the sdon content was the difference between the tdn concentration and the combined nitrate nitrogen no3 n and ammonium nitrogen nh4 n concentrations which were determined colorimetrically by the salicylate nitroprusside method on an automated continuous flow analyzer aa3 seal norderstedt germany 2 3 5 shoot biomass the winter wheat aboveground biomass was measured at the seedling jointing heading filling and maturity stages and the summer maize aboveground biomass was measured every 20 days from sowing to harvest thirty winter wheat plants ten plants in the middle row and twenty plants in the side rows for the rw rs rws and rbs plots and ten summer maize plants were sampled randomly from the plot each time the sampled plants were separated by organs then dried in an oven at 105 c for 0 5 h and at 75 c until they reached a relatively constant weight the shoot biomass was the total oven dried weights of the leaves stems and kernels 2 3 6 yield and wue three rows of winter wheat in the same planting furrow for rw rs rws and rbs and two rows of summer maize in the middle of each plot were hands harvested at maturity the maize ears and wheat spikes were shelled and air dried so that the yield could be determined the water content of kernels was about 13 after air drying water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated as follows 3 w u e y e t where y kg ha 1 and et mm are kernel yield and the evapotranspiration of winter wheat and summer maize in each growing season respectively to calculate the et of each treatment soil water contents to a depth of 2 m were determined before sowing and after harvest in each growing season then the sws before sowing swsbs mm and sws after harvest swsah mm were calculated using eq 2 the et was calculated by 4 e t p i d r s w s bs s w s ah where p is precipitation mm i is irrigation amount mm which equaled zero in this study because no irrigation was applied d is the deep drainage into the lower 200 cm boundary mm which was assumed to be negligible in this study because no heavy rain or irrigation occurred during each maize growing season and r is runoff mm which was considered to be zero because each plot was surrounded by ridges to prevent runoff 2 4 data analysis all data are presented as the mean value of the three replicates spss 18 0 was used to conduct the analysis of variance and significant differences between treatments were determined by the least significant differences lsd test at the p 0 05 level the figures were created using origin 8 0 3 results 3 1 rainfall and air temperature the total precipitation during the winter wheat seasons of 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 was 274 8 239 4 and 153 8 mm respectively with rainfall anomalies of 28 6 12 0 and 28 0 which meant that the seasons were classified as partial wet normal rainfall and partial dry seasons respectively fig 2 and table 2 in addition more rainfall occurred between middle february and harvest during the winter wheat seasons of 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 the 2014 summer maize season was categorized as a normal rainfall season with 393 2 mm precipitation and 2015 and 2016 were both classified as partial dry seasons with 283 9 mm and 284 6 mm rainfall respectively fig 2 and table 3 the maize plants suffered severe drought from sowing to early august in 2014 and from early august to harvest in 2016 daily air temperature almost followed the same trend for the three winter wheat growing seasons except that a lower temperature was recorded in january during the 2015 2016 season fig 2 average seasonal temperatures were 8 1 c 8 8 c and 9 1 c in the 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 seasons respectively and the average temperature from 2003 2004 to 2012 2013 during the winter wheat growing seasons was 8 6 c therefore the winter wheat growing seasons of 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 were defined as a cool normal temperature and warm seasons respectively the daily air temperature was higher during the early growth stages and lower during the late growth stages of summer maize in 2014 and 2015 compared with 2016 and showed an opposite tendency in the 2016 maize season fig 2 the average temperatures during the summer maize growing seasons were 23 4 c 22 8 c and 25 2 c in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively and the corresponding temperature for the long term average from 2003 to 2013 was 23 9 c therefore summer maize growing seasons of 2014 2015 and 2016 were classified as normal temperature cool and warm seasons respectively 3 2 soil moisture the planting and mulching treatments significantly influenced sws at 0 40 cm depth during the three winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons fig 3 the sws showed an up and down trend in each winter wheat and summer maize growing season except for the dry and warm winter wheat season of 2015 2016 where rainfall was only 153 8 mm the sws values for all five treatments decreased from sowing to harvesting in this season the mulching treatments especially rws and rbs consistently and significantly improved sws during the winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons and before the winter wheat was sown in 2013 furthermore the mulching treatments markedly increased sws relative to ck before sowing in the winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons except the winter wheat season of 2013 2014 the four mulching treatments significantly improved sws by 7 0 10 0 compared with ck before sowing in the 2016 summer maize season during the wet and cool winter wheat season of 2013 2014 average sws was 7 8 6 2 12 0 and 14 1 higher in rw rs rws and rbs than in ck respectively in seasons with normal rainfall and temperatures the mulching treatments significantly improved sws by 9 2 18 5 for the 2014 summer maize season and by 5 4 14 5 for the winter wheat season of 2014 2015 compared with ck in the dry and cool summer maize season of 2015 sws in ck was 5 3 9 0 4 1 6 1 7 4 14 5 and 8 9 13 4 lower than in rw rs rws and rbs respectively in the dry and warm seasons average sws in rw rs rws and rbs increased by 6 2 4 8 10 4 and 11 5 in the winter wheat season of 2015 2016 and by 4 1 7 7 13 0 and 12 8 in the summer maize season of 2016 respectively compared with ck 3 3 soil temperature the dynamic changes in the soil temperatures at 20 cm soil depth had similar patterns for the different mulching treatments during the three winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons fig 4 the soil temperatures varied from 0 5 c to 24 5 c during the winter wheat growing season and from 15 5 c to 34 2 c during the summer maize growing season across the three years during the winter wheat growing season the mulching treatments had significant influences on soil temperature from 0 to 150 days after sowing das but the significant effects disappeared after 150 das fig 4 soil temperatures in rws rbs and rw significantly improved by 0 6 2 5 c 0 4 1 9 c and 0 3 1 6 c respectively compared with ck from 0 to 150 das across the three seasons a comparison between the ck and rs treatments showed that soil temperatures were higher in ck from 0 to 45 das increased in rs from 60 to 135 das and were almost the same as each other from 150 das to harvest irrespective of treatment the average soil temperature for the winter wheat growing season was 2 0 and 2 4 c higher in 2014 2015 a season with normal temperature and 2015 2016 a warm season than in 2013 2014 where the average temperature was 9 4 c a cool season during the three summer maize growth seasons soil temperature was highest in rw followed by rws and lowest in rs furthermore the soil temperatures in rw and rws were significantly higher than in ck rbs and rs from 0 to 60 das but there were no significant differences among the five treatments after 60 das fig 4 the soil temperatures from 0 to 60 das increased by an average of 2 1 c and 1 7 c in the rw and rws treatments and decreased by 0 8 c and 0 5 c under rs and rbs respectively compared with ck regardless of treatments the average soil temperature during the summer maize growing season was 1 0 c and 2 8 c higher in 2014 a season with normal temperatures and 2016 a warm season respectively than in 2015 when the temperature was 25 1 c a cool season 3 4 soil fertility the soc contents in the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm layers were highest in rs followed by rbs and rws but rw had the lowest soc after three years of the winter wheat and summer maize rotation system fig 5a the soc content in rs was significantly higher than in the other treatments except for rbs at 20 40 cm depth the soc content at 0 40 cm depth in rw decreased by 6 7 on average compared with ck and the soc values at 0 40 cm depth in rs rbs and rws significantly improved by 16 9 8 3 and 11 4 respectively compared with ck in the 0 20 cm layer tn contents for the rw rs rws and rbs were all significantly greater than in ck and the tn content in rws and rbs was significantly higher than in rw and rs fig 5b in the 20 40 cm layer the tn content in ck was only significantly lower than the rws and rbs and tn content did not differ significantly among the four mulching treatments the smbc and smbn contents in the 0 20 and 20 40 cm layers were significantly improved by mulching treatments fig 5c and d the rbs had the highest smbc content among the four mulching treatments followed by rws however smbn content was the opposite of smbc the smbc and smbn contents in rws were not significantly different from rbs at the 0 20 or 20 40 cm soil depths at 0 20 cm depth rs contained significantly more smbc and significantly less smbn than rw however there was no significant differences in smbc and smbn contents between rw and rs at 20 40 cm depth although the smbc content was higher in rs and the smbn content was higher in rw at 0 40 cm depth the average smbc contents in rw rs rws and rbs significantly increased by 25 5 33 3 41 3 and 43 3 and the corresponding smbn contents significantly increased by 32 7 17 2 47 4 and 43 7 respectively compared with ck the mulching treatments increased sdoc and sdon contents compared with ck in the 0 20 and 20 40 cm soil layers but the improvements were not significant for the rw treatment fig 5e and f among the four mulching treatments rws and rbs improved sdoc and sdon contents relative to rw and rs except that the sdoc contents at 20 40 cm depth in rs and rws did not significantly differ from each other in the 0 20 and 20 40 cm layers the average sdoc content increased by 12 8 and 6 4 in rws and 15 0 and 8 4 in rbs compared with rw and rs respectively and sdon content increased by 42 1 and 17 3 in rws and 36 2 and 12 5 in rbs compared with rw and rs respectively 3 5 shoot biomass the mulching treatments significantly increased the shoot biomasses of winter wheat and summer maize throughout the growing seasons compared with ck fig 6 furthermore the shoot biomasses of winter wheat and summer maize in rws and rbs were significantly greater than in rw and rs the shoot biomass of winter wheat was consistently highest in rws followed by rbs however there were no significant differences between the two treatments except that shoot biomass was significantly higher by 4 1 8 1 465 760 kg ha 1 in rws than in rbs from the jointing to maturity stages in 2013 2014 wet and cool season the shoot biomass of winter wheat in rw and rs did not significantly differ during the 2013 2014 whereas aboveground biomass production in rw was significantly higher at the jointing filling and maturity stages in 2014 2015 a season with normal rainfall and temperature and at the jointing heading filling and maturity stages in 2015 2016 a dry and warm season the average biomass values for all three growing seasons showed that shoot biomasses of winter wheat at maturity in rws rbs rw and rs were significantly higher by 29 8 3670 kg ha 1 24 6 3020 kg ha 1 16 7 2050 kg ha 1 and 13 4 1649 kg ha 1 than in ck respectively regardless of treatments average shoot biomass of winter wheat at maturity in 2015 2016 significantly decreased by 27 0 4351 kg ha 1 and 22 3 3393 kg ha 1 compared with 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 respectively in contrast to winter wheat summer maize shoot biomass was consistently highest in rbs followed by rws but significant differences between the two treatments were only observed from 80 das to maturity in 2016 the shoot biomass was 6 7 9 8 577 910 kg ha 1 higher for rbs than for rws likewise the aboveground summer maize biomass was consistently higher for rs than for rw across the three seasons but significant differences were only found from 80 das to maturity in 2016 where shoot biomass was 8 4 11 0 529 1044 kg ha 1 higher in rs irrespective of treatments the summer maize average shoot biomass at maturity was highest in 2014 it was significantly higher by 16 1 2487 kg ha 1 and 45 8 5627 kg ha 1 than in 2015 and 2016 respectively the summer maize averages for the three growing seasons at maturity in rbs rws rs and rw were significantly higher by 39 9 4903 kg ha 1 35 5 4357 kg ha 1 24 3 2982 kg ha 1 and 19 8 2430 kg ha 1 compared with ck respectively 3 6 winter wheat and summer maize grain yields the mulching treatments significantly increased winter wheat grain yield in each season compared with ck fig 7a they significantly improved winter wheat yields by 13 0 32 9 in 2013 2014 a wet and cool season 15 5 35 2 in 2014 2015 a season with normal rainfall and temperatures and 27 2 58 9 in 2015 2016 a dry and warm season the rws treatment consistently produced the highest grain yield followed by rbs but there were no significant differences between rws and rbs except that grain yield was higher for rbs than for the rws in the 2013 2014 the grain yield was significantly higher for rbs and rws than for the rw and rs besides the yield was significantly lower for the rs than for the rw in the 2015 2016 growing season however there were no significant differences between the two treatments in the wet and cool season of 2013 2014 and in the normal season of 2014 2015 in contrast to winter wheat rbs consistently produced the highest maize yields across the three seasons followed by rws fig 7b grain yield in rbs was not significantly different from rws in 2014 and 2015 but was significantly lower than rws in 2016 the yield increasing effects of rbs 35 0 50 5 and rws 31 2 41 9 were significantly higher than for rw 12 8 17 4 and rs 15 9 25 9 the yield was significantly higher for the rs than for the rw in 2016 but there were no significant differences between the two treatments in 2014 and 2015 3 7 et and wue in the 2013 2014 a wet and cool season and 2014 2015 a season with normal rainfall and temperatures winter wheat seasons the mulching treatments especially rbs significantly decreased et by 4 8 7 8 and 3 6 6 0 respectively compared with ck table 4 in 2015 2016 a dry and warm season the et in the mulching treatments was significantly greater than in ck and et in rws and rbs was significantly higher than in rw and rs regardless of the types of season the wue in the mulching treatments was significantly higher than in ck the wue in rws was higher than in rbs but there were no significant differences between the two treatments over all three seasons irrespective of the treatments ets and wues in 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 were significantly higher than in 2015 2016 in 2014 a season with normal rainfall and temperature summer maize grown under ck consumed significantly more water than under the mulching treatments but there were no significant differences among the four mulching treatments table 5 in 2015 a cool season with normal rainfall during the early growing period and partially dry during the late growing period the et was almost the same among all five treatments however in 2016 a warm season with a severe dry period during the late growing period the et values in rw rs rws and rbs were significantly greater by 3 9 8 7 5 5 and 5 6 than in ck respectively the wues in rws and rbs were significantly higher than in rw and rs across the three seasons and wue in rbs consistently higher than in rws regardless of treatments et was highest in 2014 and lowest in 2015 whereas wue was highest in 2015 and lowest in 2016 the total ets for winter wheat and summer maize from 2013 to 2016 did not significantly differ among the five treatments table 6 the rw rs rws and rbs treatments significantly improved total yield and wue compared with ck the total yield and wue improvements in rws and rbs were significantly higher than in rw and rs but there were no significant differences between rws and rbs and between rw and rs 4 discussion 4 1 soil moisture and temperature water scarcity is a constant and growing problem on the loess plateau where rainfall is low and evaporation rates are high more seriously most of the rainfall is lower than 5 mm and cannot be absorbed and utilized by crops gu et al 2017 it has been reported that only 25 30 of the rainfall can be absorbed and utilized by crops and that more than 70 of the rainfall was wasted through evaporation and runoff wang et al 2012a b mulching has been shown to be an effective agricultural practice that can be used to conserve water by suppressing soil evaporation especially during the early crop growth stage when the crop canopy is small gu et al 2018b the ridge furrow planting pattern is also a widely used agricultural system on the loess plateau that can prevent runoff and conserve soil water if mulching and the ridge furrow planting pattern were combined then soil moisture conservation could be further improved gan et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 in this study sws was consistently higher in rw rs rws and rbs than in ck throughout the three years fig 3 among the four mulching treatments sws was significantly higher in rws and rbs than in rw and rs the reason might be that rws and rbs not only harvest rainwater especially light precipitation 5 mm using the mulching ridges but also reduce soil evaporation by mulching the ridges and furrows whereas rw and rs are only able carry out one of these two functions yin et al 2016 in addition sws in rbs was slightly greater than in rws during the three winter wheat seasons whereas sws in rbs and rws were almost equal to each other during the three summer maize seasons this may be because 1 the higher soil temperature in rws improved the growth of winter wheat which would consume more soil water to support the increased shoot biomass in contrast the lower soil temperature in rbs improved the growth of summer maize which would also lead to increased soil moisture consumption 2 the black plastic film decreased weed growth and reduced the inefficient consumption of soil moisture by winter wheat the increased crop water consumption was comparable to the reduced ineffective water loss for summer maize under rbs qin et al 2018 yin et al 2016 in addition the variation in sws was mainly influenced by rainfall amount and distribution rainfall in the 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 winter wheat seasons and the 2014 summer maize season mainly fell during the late growth stages which meant that sws first decreased and then increased in these seasons fig 3 however sws in the 2015 and 2016 summer maize seasons showed an up down trend because precipitation in these seasons fell evenly throughout the season the sws in the 2015 2016 winter wheat season decreased throughout the whole season due to the scarce rainfall the average sws throughout the winter wheat season in the dry 2015 2016 season was 14 5 16 1 lower than in the wet 2013 2014 season and 9 0 11 2 lower than in 2014 2015 season which had normal rainfall the mulching treatments especially white plastic film significantly influenced soil temperature before 150 das for winter wheat and before 60 das for summer maize after that the significant differences between the mulching treatments and ck disappeared fig 4 this result agreed with previous studies haapala et al 2015 subrahmaniyan et al 2018 and the main reason is that the mulched area probably received a majority of the solar energy in the early growth stages when the crop canopy was small and this energy would have warmed the topsoil in contrast the large mature plant canopies during the late growth stages blocked the solar energy and the solar warming effect was reduced zhou et al 2009 the soil temperature results for each mulching treatment were different for winter wheat before 150 das and summer maize before 60 das for winter wheat the plastic film mulching treatments rw rws and rbs all led to higher soil temperatures than for ck whereas for summer maize the soil temperature in ck was significantly lower than in rw and rws but was markedly higher than in rbs in addition the rws soil temperature was generally much higher than the rbs soil temperature especially in the summer maize season the result might be due to the low light permeability and low pass through of radiant heat characteristics of black plastic film in the summer season when the temperatures are high moreno and moreno 2008 wang et al 2015 reported that the topsoil was insulated by straw mulching when the weather was colder our results demonstrated that the soil temperature in rs was 0 2 0 8 c higher than the in ck in the winter season from 60 to 135 das however the soil temperature in rs was lower than in ck before 60 das for winter wheat and summer maize this may have been due to the straw mulch on the soil surface forming a physical barrier that could block the solar radiation and prevent exchange between the soil and atmosphere which would decrease the soil temperature when the air temperature was higher and increase the soil temperature when the air temperature was lower kar and kumar 2007 4 2 soil fertility plastic film mulching has been extensively used in the arid and semi arid regions of china to increase crop productivity however how this practice may affect soil fertility is still unclear soil organic carbon a major indicator of agricultural ecosystem sustainability can be greatly influenced by plastic film mulching li et al 2007 in this study the soc content at 0 20 cm soil depth in rw was significantly lower than in ck after three years of a winter wheat and summer maize rotation fig 5a this result was consistent with zhang et al 2015 and tian et al 2013 the reasons might be that the higher soil moistures and temperatures under plastic film mulching could improve microbial activity and increase soc mineralization which would lead to a decrease in the soc content and a decline in soil quality zhou et al 2012 our results indicated that plastic film mulching may not be a long term solution for improving agricultural productivity while maintaining soil fertility yin et al 2019 showed that the stimulation of soc mineralization by the increased soil temperature and moisture in the mulched treatments could be balanced by an increase in carbon input to the soil relative to the non mulched treatments this was confirmed by this study which showed that rs rws and rbs treatments significantly improved the soc content in the 0 20 cm soil layer and the rs and rbs treatments significantly improved soc in the 20 40 cm soil layer compared with ck and rw fig 5a total nitrogen is also an important indicator of soil fertility the higher soil moisture and temperature levels under the mulching treatments accelerated soil mineralization which increased tn content zhou et al 2012 in this study the four mulching treatments all increased soil tn content in the 0 20 and 20 40 cm soil layers after three years of a winter wheat and summer maize rotation fig 5b however the increase was only 3 5 8 5 this small increase might be due to the greater plant biomass under the mulching treatments absorbing more soil n smbc and smbn these changes may influence nutrient cycling in agricultural ecosystems furthermore smbc and smbn are considered to be important indicators of soil quality although they only account for a small proportion of soc and tn powlson et al 1987 mclauchlan and hobbie 2004 in this study rw rs rws and rbs significantly improved smbc and smbn contents compared with ck in the 0 20 and 20 40 cm soil layers fig 5c and d our results supported by liu et al 2013 and gu et al 2019b who found that smbc and smbn contents in the topsoil under film mulching were markedly greater than under the non mulching treatments and that this might be due to the higher topsoil moistures and temperatures under the mulches leading to improved soil biochemical properties and soil microbial activity zhou et al 2012 in addition the higher soil moistures and appropriate soil temperatures led to significantly higher smbc and smbn concentrations in the rws and rbs treatments compared with the rw and rs treatments especially in the 0 20 cm soil layer in this study sdoc and sdon contents in ck did not differ significantly from rw in the 0 20 and 20 40 cm soil layers fig 5e and f which was probably because the increases in soil moisture and temperature under plastic film mulching changed the soil biological characteristics stimulated microbial activity and increased sdoc and sdon consumption which would decrease the sdoc and sdon concentrations neff and asner 2001 in contrast the sdoc and sdon contents in rs rws and rbs were markedly higher than in ck at both the 0 20 and 20 40 cm soil depths and this was probably because crop straw decomposition released a substantial amount of doc increased labile organic c and n and alleviated microbial nutrient limitations li et al 2016 xie et al 2017 in our study the soc contents in rws and rbs were greater than in rw and ck but were lower than in rs whereas the tn smbc smbn sdoc and sdon contents in rws and rbs were all higher than rw rs and ck in the 0 20 and 20 40 cm soil layers after three years of winter wheat and summer maize rotation fig 5 this indicated that a combination of plastic film mulching and straw mulching could maintain soil fertility in a winter wheat and summer maize rotation system on the loess plateau 4 3 grain yield and wue many previous studies have reported that ridge furrowing with mulching significantly increased crop yield and wue ren et al 2016 mo et al 2017 gu et al 2018b qin et al 2018 our study produced similar results the mulching treatments rw rs rws and rbs markedly increased the winter wheat and summer maize grain yields and wues over the three years fig 7 tables 4 and 5 the yield and wue increase under the ridge furrow with mulching treatments were mainly because more soil water was saved through reduced soil evaporation furthermore more collected rainwater was used during the crop transpiration process especially during critical growth stages liu et al 2010 gu et al 2016 the rw treatment with plastic film mulching over ridges allows any rainwater falling onto the ridges to flow along the slope and then infiltrate the furrow soils which increases root zone soil moisture gu et al 2016 ren et al 2016 however rs with straw mulching over furrows can inhibit soil evaporation and thus conserve soil moisture chen et al 2007 li et al 2013 dong et al 2018 the rws and rbs treatments which combined rw and rs not only harvested rainwater by film mulching the ridges but also conserved soil moisture by straw mulching the furrows combining these processes significantly increased soil moisture retention the greater soil moisture and the lower water losses throughout the winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons meant that the yields and wues for winter wheat and summer maize in rws and rbs were significantly higher than in rw and rs over the three years this confirmed the results reported by yin et al 2016 and hu et al 2019 besides this study also found that rs produced significantly lower winter wheat yields in the dry and warm season 2015 2016 compared with rw in contrast the warm season 2016 markedly increased summer maize yields in rs compared with rw fig 7 drought and low temperatures during the over wintering growth stage were the major factors that limited winter wheat yield in the dry and warm winter wheat season drought became the leading factor limiting yield and higher soil moisture under rw due to the better rainwater collection effect led to higher yields in rw than in rs high temperatures and drought also limited the summer maize yield in the dry and warm 2016 summer maize season no rain fell during the tasseling and filling stages from late july to middle september therefore no rainwater was harvested by the mulching ridges and a large amount of soil moisture was lost through the bare furrows this meant that drought and high temperature limited summer maize yields in 2016 some studies have reported that black plastic film can produce significantly higher maize yields than white plastic film eldoma et al 2016 mo et al 2017 qin et al 2018 but the reverse results as well as no difference between the two colored films have also been reported by mbah et al 2010 the greater warming effect under white film mulching could lead to root senescence and reduced plant growth which would lead to summer maize yield reductions especially in a warm season with adequate accumulated temperature qin et al 2018 our study demonstrated that maize yield in rws was significantly lower 6 0 368 kg ha 1 than in rbs for the warm season of 2016 when the average air temperature was 25 2 c whereas the maize yield did not significantly differ between rbs and rws in the cool season of 2015 the average air temperature was 22 8 c and the season of 2014 when the air temperature was normal the average air temperature was 23 4 c in contrast the greater warming effect under white film improved winter wheat growth in our study rws consistently produced higher winter wheat yields than rbs over the three seasons fig 7 furthermore winter wheat yields in rws were higher than rbs in the cool season of 2013 2014 the average air temperature was 8 05 c and there were no significant differences between the two treatments in the season of 2014 2015 the air temperature was normal and in the season of 2015 2016 the air temperature was above average our results demonstrated that the winter wheat yield and wue in rws were higher than in rbs but the reverse was true for summer maize where wue was higher in rbs however rws for winter wheat and rbs for summer maize was not conducted in the present study and the mulching effects of this treatment on soil hydrothermal conditions soil fertility grain yield et and wue in continuous winter wheat and summer maize cropping system on the losses plateau need to be further explored 5 conclusions the rw rs rws and rbs can greatly improve soil moisture shoot biomass grain yield and wue in winter wheat and summer maize cropping system compared with ck after three years soil fertility indicators soc tn smbc smbn sdoc and sdon contents were higher in rws and rbs than in rw rs and ck furthermore rws and rbs produced significantly higher grain yields and wues than rw and rs therefore rws or rbs can be recommended as a promising agricultural practice that simultaneously improves crop productivity and sustains soil fertility when continuous winter wheat and summer maize cropping systems in rain fed semi arid regions of china are used in addition rws for winter wheat and rbs for summer maize should be considered when attempting to further improve crop yields in a continuous winter wheat and summer maize cropping system declaration of competing interest the authors

10227,improving water saving irrigation technology and water use efficiency are often regarded as effective ways to control the amount of agricultural water consumption but the rebound effect may offset this effort in practice based on the sample of 30 provinces in china from 2000 to 2017 this paper applies the meta frontier data envelopment analysis method to measure agricultural water efficiency and then estimates the rebound rate of agricultural water resource applying difference generalized method of moments and elasticity analysis formula further the difference in difference model is used to test the effectiveness of china s water rights reform on china s agricultural water rebound rate in recent years the results show that 1 within the survey period the average agricultural water rebound rate of china in short term and long term were 0 49 and 0 66 respectively and the water rebound rate in all provinces were positive indicating that water rebound effect was widespread in china s agricultural water market 2 agricultural water rebound rates were significantly different among regions which was higher in western region while were comparatively smaller in the eastern and central regions 3 the water rights pilot project failed to restrain the rebound of agricultural water use but promoted it which may be resulted from the market frictions of water trade according to the results recommendations are put forward for the governments to reinforce management of water improve water rights system and reduce trade costs in order to reduce the friction of agricultural water market and the effective use of water resource keywords water rebound effect agricultural water efficiency technological heterogeneity meta frontier policy testing water rights system 1 introduction water shortage has always been a crucial constraint to the sustainable development of china s agriculture as shown in fig 1 more than 60 of china s total water consumption was caused by agricultural sector while water resource is scarce there are still extensive and wasteful water use problems in china s agriculture sector huang et al 2020 song et al 2018 to promote intensive use of water resources and reduce waste chinese government has been taking several measures to improve agricultural water use efficiency including constructing water saving irrigation projects and generalizing mechanical irrigation after years of efforts the water saving irrigation rate water saving irrigation area gross crop area rose from 15 in 2000 to 29 in 2017 and the number of agricultural irrigation and drainage machines increased from 477 457 in 2000 to 778 181 in 2017 it is generally believed that efficient water saving irrigation technology can save a large amount of water resources graveline et al 2014 huang et al 2020 however although china has made significant progress in water saving irrigation and water use efficiency its water consumption in agricultural sector did not decline as expected similar phenomena are widely found in other parts of the world which is known as rebound effect brinegar and ward 2009 dagnino and ward 2012 fang and zhang 2020a garcía garizábal and causapé 2010 huffaker 2008 huffaker and whittlesey 2000 lecina et al 2010 li and zhao 2018 peterson and ding 2005 playán and mateos 2006 qureshi et al 2010 rodriguez diaz et al 2011 scheierling et al 2006 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 whittlesey 2003 the european commission pointed out in 2012 that people should be aware of the potential rebound effect in water saving irrigation induced by technological advance this is an alarming issue to the sustainable development of china s agriculture the mechanism of rebound effect in agricultural water can be summarized in two aspects first the hydrological mechanism advanced technological irrigation can match the crop s need of water more precisely and uniformly making it easy for farmers to expand production scale thus water consumption is increased along with increased crop yield brinegar and ward 2009 dagnino and ward 2012 kuil et al 2018 lecina et al 2010 lopez gunn et al 2012 perry 2007 qureshi et al 2010 scheierling et al 2006 sears et al 2018 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 wu et al 2018 the second is economic mechanism that is the efficiency improvement of irrigation forces the water price to reduce and farmers would change their water using behaviors in response to the income effect and substitution effect caused by lower water price freire gonzalez 2019 song et al 2018 wheeler et al 2020 most of the previous studies analyzed the agricultural water rebound effect from the perspective of theory and comparative analysis kuil et al 2018 molle and tanouti 2017 sears et al 2018 and few of them have measured the rebound effect quantificationally except for song et al 2018 who established a direct comparison method using the contribution rate of technological progress to construct indicators of the agricultural water rebound effect in china they found that the magnitude of china s average agricultural water rebound effect in 1998 2014 reached 61 49 confirming the existence of water rebound effects in china s agricultural sector although song et al 2018 pioneered in estimating the agricultural water rebound rate in china their method of calculating the rebound effect using the contribution rate of technological progress does not directly reflect the definition of the rebound effect which might cause errors paul et al 2019 song et al 2018 through the above analysis the upgrade of irrigation technology is likely to cause a greater rebound of agricultural water use in the absence of supporting policies and management measures yan et al 2020 if policy measures are taken to restrict the additional water supply the rebound effect can be weakened berbel et al 2015 explored measures to lessen the rebound effect of agricultural water in the guadalquivir basin southern spain they suggested that the keys to reducing the rebound effect lay in 1 strictly limiting the scale of cultivated land 2 reducing the supply of water rights 3 redistributing the saved water resources to achieve environmental goals zhang et al 2019 demonstrated that alternative restrictions on water supply and irrigatable land could effectively constrain water use and consumption after modernizing the irrigation systems fang and zhang 2020a and li and zhao 2018 found that the water rights system could suppress the growth of water consumption fang and zhang 2020a further summarized the mechanism in which the water rights system worked as the revenue driven effect and the industrial water pressure effect it can be concluded that to restrain the rebound effect there must be measures to limit the water use behaviors of farmers many developed countries have already executed marketization reform on water resources and water rights transaction comparatively speaking the marketization of water resources in china started late and the water resource market is lack of uniform pricing standard for agricultural consumption in some districts agricultural water is even completely free to access which is the root cause of such rampant overuse of water recourses facing with increasingly severe water shortages comprehensive agricultural water price reforms have been put on the agenda since 2014 with henan ningxia jiangxi hubei inner mongolia gansu and guangdong being the first batch of pilot districts the main subject of the reform is to establish a water saving management system including water prices system water rights system together with awards and construction management systems to promote the transformation of agricultural water use from extensive to intensive however these policies and measures are still under exploring and it is still unknown whether these measures can restrain the rebound of water resources in practice based on these concerns this study focused on two scientific problems first it is necessary to examine whether there is rebound effect on china s agricultural water market since it has been hotly debated second it is also salutary to test the effectiveness of china s water rights system and discuss the possible reasons by analyzing the influence of water rights pilot on agricultural water rebound effect some important research contributions are made in this paper firstly the difference in difference method is applied to test the influence of water rights pilot on the agricultural water rebound effect and expound the results from the perspective of agricultural market friction as far as we know this is the first study on testing the effectiveness of china s water rights system reform since it was implemented in 2014 secondly the meta frontier dea method based on technical heterogeneity was used to estimate the water resource utilization efficiency which is more in accordance with the actual situation of china s economy meanwhile weather condition and the price of production means that are not affected by the farmers are chosen to be the independent variables for the regression model to avoid endogenous problem hence the estimation of rebound rate is ensured to be accurate thirdly compared with previous studies we estimate the rebound effect in both short run and long run providing more profound implications for policy making in china s water market 2 methods and models 2 1 estimating agricultural water rebound rate referring to sorrell and dimitropoulos 2008 the water rebound rate of agriculture sector can be defined as 1 r 1 w η where w η denotes the efficiency elasticity of agricultural water demand the ideal state is that 1 increase in technical efficiency would lead to 1 reduce in water demand however as there is rebound effect part of the potential water saving capability is offset and we use 1 w η to represent the offset proportion 2 w η dlnw dln η where w is the water demand in agriculture sector and η is the agricultural water use efficiency thus eq 2 measures the efficiency elasticity of agricultural water demand in order to get w η a demand function of the optimal agricultural water use is formulated in this paper price of agricultural production factors weather condition and agricultural water use efficiency are taken as the three most crucial determinants generally speaking agricultural capital and water resources are complementary production elements jointly promoting agricultural outputs weather condition is also expected to have a positive correlation with the agricultural water demand because high temperature generally induces more sur face evaporation and accelerates the metabolism of crops requiring more input of water besides technology is also an essential element affecting agricultural water demand because technology can change the yield under the same inputs and could influence people s consumption hobbies intuitively the above three influential factors of water resource are not controlled by farmers thus prevent endogeneity problem in this model methodologically the demand function can be written in the nature logarithm form 3 ln w it f ln p it ln s it ln η it μ i u t ε it where w it represents the optimal agricultural water demand for dmu t in i period p it is the price of agricultural production factors using the price index of agricultural production means as proxy variable s it denotes weather condition using illumination hours as proxy variable η it is the agricultural water use efficiency as the efficiency cannot be observed directly it is estimated with input and output data μ i is the province specific intercept u t the year specific intercept and ε it is the error term referring to adetutu et al 2016 it is a dynamic optimization process to make the water demand reach the optimal level which can be written as follow 4 ln w it ln w it 1 1 θ ln w it ln w it 1 where w it represents the actual agricultural water demand and 1 θ is the proportion of adjustment between adjacent periods combining eq 3 and eq 4 the following equation is obtained 5 ln w it θ ln w it 1 1 θ f ln p it ln s it ln η it ω i ω t ω it where ω i 1 θ μ i and υ it 1 θ ε it furthermore f ln p it ln s it ln η it can be approximated by its second taylor expansion thus eq 5 is transformed to 6 ln w it θ ln w it 1 β 1 ln p it β 2 ln s it β 3 ln η it β 4 2 ln p it ln s it β 5 2 ln p it ln η it β 6 2 ln s it ln η it β 7 2 ln p it 2 β 8 2 ln s it 2 β 9 2 ln η it 2 ω i ω t ω it taking the derivative of eq 6 the short run efficiency elasticity of agricultural water demand is obtained 7 w η s β 3 β 5 2 ln p it β 6 2 ln s it β 9 ln η it eq 7 indicates that w η s is not a constant but varies among dmus and periods influenced by p it s it and η it as shown in eq 4 and eq 5 the agricultural water demand in a certain period w it is correlated to that in the last period w it 1 this implies that the change of agricultural water use efficiency has a long term effect on agricultural water demand here is an example suppose that one unit increase in the agricultural water use efficiency would lead to γ unit decrease in water demand at t period then the impact would be θ γ at t 1 period and θ 2 γ in t 2 period so forth and so on the total effect of per unit increase of the efficiency can be calculated as γ θ γ θ 2 γ θ n γ and the sum value is approximately equal to γ 1 θ combining with eq 7 the long term efficiency elasticity of agricultural water demand can be written as follows 8 w η l β 3 β 5 2 ln a it β 6 2 ln y it β 9 ln η it 1 θ based on the efficiency elasticity of agricultural water demand in short term and long term expressed in eq 7 and eq 8 the agricultural water rebound effect in short term and long term can be denoted as r 1 w η s and 1 w η l respectively according to eq 1 when the magnitude of the agricultural water rebound effect i e r is greater than 1 that is r 0 efficiency improvement will result in increase of agricultural water demand such case is also called backfire phenomenon or tempering effect an extreme situation of jevon s paradox when 0 r 1 the higher efficiency of water use can lead to decrease in water demand but its water saving potential is partly offset by the rebound effect if r 0 then there is no rebound effect in agricultural water use in other words the potential of a higher efficiency to save water is fully exploited in order to estimate the short run and long run rebound rate of agricultural water in eq 7 and eq 8 water use efficiency η it is needed in the next part of this section we will introduce the meta dea method which is applied to estimate water use efficiency 2 2 estimation of total factors water use efficiency assuming that a production system can be classified into h groups according to certain standards and each group contains j decision making units j 1 2 j applying m kinds of inputs to produce n kinds of outputs x x 1 x 2 x m r m y y 1 y 2 y n r n based on these settings a production technology t can be defined as 9 t x y x can produce y specific to this paper capital k labor l and water resources w are the main inputs and agricultural gdp is the output thus the production technology set of the group h can be described as 10 t h k l w y δ h k l w c a n produce y with technology δ h considering that the geographical location resource endowment and economic development stage of each provinces in china differs a lot the selected 30 provinces are divided into three regions namely the eastern region the central region and the western region this grouping method has been widely used in studies of chinese problems bai et al 2020 feng and wang 2017 li et al 2019 lin and bai 2020 yu et al 2019 zhang and zhou 2020 the grouping results are shown in table 1 the groups are assumed to use different technics each year hence different production technology frontiers are required to be constructed based on the production technology set in eq 10 the distance function of group h in year t is defined as eq 11 11 d ht k l w y sup ρ k l w ρ y t ht the economic implication of the distance function is to calculate the maximum degree ρ of potential water saving under given technology holding other input factors capital k and labor l and output y unchanged under this premise water use efficiency can be defined as the ratio of the optimal input quantity of water to the actual one accordingly the total factor water use efficiency based on the given technology frontier can be written as 12 mtfee ht 1 d ht k l w y in addition the technology set t of group h in year t can be obtained by solving the following linear programming 13 t ht k l w y n 1 n h ω ht n k ht mn k ht m m 1 2 m n 1 n h ω ht n l ht mn l ht m m 1 2 m n 1 n h ω ht n w ht mn w ht m m 1 2 m n 1 n h ω ht n y ht in y ht n i 1 2 i ω ht n 0 n 1 2 n h in this function ω is a non negative weight vector x ht mn x ht m m 1 2 m indicates that the actual input exceeds the optimal level on the technical frontier n 1 n h ω ht n y ht in y ht n i 1 2 i indicates that the actual output is less than the output on the technical frontier based on the above constraints the water resource efficiency of each dmu under technology of the group can be calculated as 14 gglpi target water consumption based on the front frontier actual water consumption as the common frontier is the data envelope of group frontiers it can be defined as 15 t u h 1 ht t ht correspondingly the distance function can be defined as 16 d t k l w y sup ρ k l w ρ y t thus the water efficiency under the common frontier is written as follow 17 mtfee t 1 d t k l w y all the group frontiers h 1 2 h are enveloped to construct a common frontier which can be expressed as follows 18 mt t k l w y h 1 h n 1 n h ω ht n k mn k m m 1 2 m h 1 h n 1 n h ω ht n l mn l m m 1 2 m h 1 h n 1 n h ω ht n w mn w m m 1 2 m h 1 h j 1 n h ω h n y in y i i 1 2 i ω h n 0 n 1 2 n h h 1 2 h similar to the definition of gglpi the water resource efficiency index mglpi based on the common frontier is symbolized as 19 mglpi target water consumption based on the common frontier actual water consumption obviously the value of mglpi is between 0 and 1 if the mglpi is equal to 1 then the dmu is effective under the frontier technology based on the above analysis the water use efficiency of each dmu based on the common frontier can be obtained according to du and li 2019 fei and lin 2016 the change of water use efficiency can be decomposed into three parts shown as the following formula 20 mmepi t s d s j k t l t w t y t d t j k t l t w t y t d s j k s l s w s y s d t j k s l s w s y s 1 2 d t j k t l t w t y t d s j k s l s w s y s d t k t l t w t y t d t j k t l t

represent the changes of water use efficiency caused by technological progress intra group technological efficiency changes and inter group catch up changes respectively if the values of them are greater than 1 it means the index promotes the water use efficiency to increase otherwise it restrains the growth of water use efficiency 3 research results 3 1 data resources to evaluate the agricultural water rebound rate a panel data model of 30 provinces in china from 2000 to 2017 is conducted in this paper considering the consistency and availability of the sample data taiwan hong kong macao and tibet are not included in this study agricultural water consumption w capital k labor l and agricultural output y are used to estimate the agricultural water use efficiency besides data of provincial sunshine hours s and price of agricultural production means p are also collected to build the water demand function and measure water rebound effect all data are extracted from national or provincial statistical yearbooks of china the descriptive statistics of the variables are listed in table 2 3 2 water use efficiency of agricultural sector based on the sample data meta frontier dea method is applied to estimate the agricultural water use efficiency and results are demonstrated in table 3 in general the average agricultural water efficiency of china during 2000 2017 was 0 47 and the annual water use efficiency was declining year by year it indicates that china s agricultural water use efficiency did not reach the potential optimal level which might due to the backward irrigation technology as well as the lack of sound agricultural water management system as can be seen in table 3 beijing had the highest agricultural water efficiency among the 30 provinces at 0 994 followed by shanghai whose efficiency was 0 992 these two provinces are advanced in technology and management leading to an intensive way to use water by contract the bottom three provinces were xinjiang ningxia and gansu with the efficiency values of 0 059 0 064 and 0 155 respectively these three provinces with low water efficiency are in the western part of china and have a long history of water shortages and poor technology which bring about inefficient water use from a regional perspective water efficiency of the eastern region was always far ahead of those of the central and the west and the efficiency of the central and the west was approximately at the same level as presented in fig 2 the reason for such geographical differences can be contributed to the reason that the east is superior to other regions in terms of economy resource endowment technology and management specific to the central and western regions the water use efficiency of the central region was slightly higher than that of the west before 2012 this is probably because the central region has better economic foundation and agricultural infrastructures in comparison with the west after 2012 with the implement of western development strategy and targeted agricultural poverty alleviation policy water saving technology was gradually popularized in the west since then the central region was surpassed by the west in terms of agricultural water efficiency to explain the decline of water efficiency in china s agricultural sector during the sample period the change of water use efficiency is decomposed into technological catch up changes technological advance changes and intra group efficiency changes according to eq 20 the results are shown in fig 3 the technological advance effects in all the three regions are greater than 1 demonstrating that these regions have made significant progress in technology which considerably improved water efficiency this result supports the founding of huang et al 2017 that water saving technologies can reduce water use and improve the productivity of water moreover the intra group efficiency value in the east and the west were smaller than 1 which means that provinces in these two regions did not realize the optimal usage of water recourse under given technology in other words their actual water input tended to deviate from the given technological frontier this indicates that management of agricultural water use is also an important factor that influences the final water efficiency nian et al 2020 for the technological catch up index it was equal to 1in most eastern provinces illustrating that the eastern region represented the most advanced technological level of the country in the other two regions the technological catch up index was generally smaller than 1 which means that the technological frontier of these regions was tending to moving away from the optimal frontier contrastively the technological gap among the three regions enlarged during 2010 2015 and then gradually narrowed after 2015 serving as another reason for the decline of water use efficiency in the central and west after 2010 in addition to technological and administrative reasons above mentioned climate change is another possible reason for the changes of water use efficiency the climate change especially the global warming can lead to higher temperature and reduction in precipitation thus accelerates water evaporation on farm land and force farmers to irrigate plants more frequently all these natural phenomena can change people s behavior of using water and increase working intensity of irrigation facilities leading to efficiency loss bigelow and zhang 2018 huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 3 3 estimates of agricultural water rebound effect to measure agricultural water rebound rate the coefficients in eq 6 need to be estimated since the explanatory variables of eq 6 contain lagged value of the dependent variable difference generalized method of moments dif gmm is used for regression analysis to solve the endogenous problem the effectiveness of dif gmm is based on the premise that there is no autocorrelation between the disturbance and possible lagged values of dependent variable which are used as instrumental variables the results of arellano bond test show that the probability value of ar 1 in first order autocorrelation and ar 2 in second order autocorrelation are 0 642 and 0 996 respectively thereby it cannot reject the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation in the disturbance υ it besides the results of sargan test and hansen test reveal that the instrumental variables in this model were not related to the disturbance term meanwhile time effect is considered in the model to reduce estimating error year dummy variables for 2000 2018 as well as the individual dummy variables for the 30 provinces are generated using stata the regression results are listed in table 4 combined with the regression results of dif gmm and eqs 7 and 8 the agricultural water rebound rate in short run and long run is obtained macroscopically a description of the nation wide agricultural water rebound rate is presented in table 5 as listed the average short run and long run rebound rate of china was 0 4931 and 0 6601 respectively both were smaller than 1 but greater than 0 this indicates that the increase in agricultural water efficiency can reduce agricultural water use to some extent but this effect was partly offset by the rebound effect specifically when water use efficiency increases it temporarily offsets 49 32 of the potential water saving in the short run and permanently counteracted 66 01 in the long run particularly the minimum short run rebound effect was negative in some provinces demonstrating that the water saving capability was realized but rebound effect still can be found in long run fig 4 and fig 5 plot the provincial agricultural water rebound rate in short run and long run respectively it can be concluded from the diagrams that the sample provinces suffered from severer rebound effect in the long run than in short run on the bright side the rebound effect was showing a downward trend during the sample period indicating that the rebound effect was weakening on provincial scale larger rebound effect in both short run and long run was observed in west china especially in guizhou xinjiang sichuan and chongqing statistically the average short run rebound rate of the four provinces were 0 76 0 60 0 68 and 0 65 respectively while the average long run rebound effect was 0 84 0 73 0 78 and 0 78 to be specific xinjiang is in the northwest china with extremely dry climate thus a large amount of water was required for irrigation purpose as for sichuan and chongqing they are situated in mountainous area of high altitude inconvenient for diversion irrigation due to the above reasons the four provinces are afflicted by water shortage according to saunders 2000 when the requirement for a certain resource is not satisfied the efficiency improvement is very likely to cause a large rebound effect in this resource in contract the rebound effect diminishes when the demand approaches saturation liaoning had the lowest rebound rate of 0 28 in the short run and 0 51 in the long run and it even fully realized the water saving potential in some of the years from a regional perspective as shown in fig 6 the rebound rate of the west was the highest among the three regions with the average short term value being 0 55 and long term value being 0 70 the central region took the second place average short term value at 0 47 average long term value at 0 65 and the lowest rebound rate was in the east average short term value at 0 64 average long term value at 0 46 this is probably because that the water management system was more mature in the east with more strict and better supervision by contrast the west region was comparatively fell behind and there are little measures to limit farmers water use behaviors in response to water shortage this paper verifies the conclusions of song et al 2018 and fang et al 2020 on china s agricultural water rebound effect based on simplified direct comparison method and slacks based measure sbm based of malmquist index methods they demonstrated that the rebound rate was 61 49 and 70 3 different from their studies this paper distinguishes the rebound rate from the short run to the long run providing significant evidence for china s policy making in saving agricultural water with a farsighted vision besides there are also similar studies focus on water rebound effect in china huang et al 2017 wang et al 2020 and other countries berbel et al 2018 berbel and mateos 2014 freire gonzalez 2019 lankford et al 2020 pfeiffer and lin 2014 song et al 2018 wheeler et al 2020 some of the previous studies have already concerned about the effect of water rights system on agricultural water use fang and zhang 2020a wang et al 2017 wheeler et al 2020 some studies found that water rights transaction would promote water rebound effect owing to the following factors related to market friction 1 water stealing due to weak law enforcement 2 inaccurate metering of water resources 3 unauthorized exploitation of surface water and groundwater 4 water wasting caused by excessive subsidies meanwhile other scholars argue that the water rights transaction can benefit water saving and verify their opinions with empirical analysis aghaie et al 2020 fang and zhang 2020b li and zhao 2018 wang et al 2017 so far scholars have not reached an agreement on weather water rights transaction promotes or restrains water saving in agriculture thus the actual effectiveness of water rights pilot is discussed in the next section with the concerns on china s reality 4 discussion the above analysis verifies that it is hard to achieve the water saving target by technological improvement alone thereby relevant management policy is necessary in a general way water is a public resource without exclusion thus everyone has an incentive to overuse it therefore it is widely believed that water rebound effect can be restrained by exerting exclusiveness on water recourse to be specific via constructing price and rights system berbel et al 2015 fang and zhang 2020a li and zhao 2018 zhang et al 2019 starting in 2014 china has lunched the water rights pilot experiment in seven provinces i e henan ningxia jiangxi hubei inner mongolia gansu and guangdong in these pilot districts tradable water rights are distributed into villages and families by the end of 2017 all the pilot districts had passed the examination and water rights system began to be carried out nationwide in this section the effectiveness of water rights reform is to be tested from the perspective of rebound effect in other words to examine whether the agricultural water rebound effect can be restrained by water rights system in view of the advantages of difference in difference estimation did in testing the effects of policy implementation this paper applied did method and differentiated the experimental group and the control group according to whether the water rights pilot is implemented and then the did model is constructed as eq 21 21 awre i t β 0 β 1 ingroup β 2 inyear β 3 ingroup inyear β 4 control i t μ i u t ε it where ingroup is defined as a binary indicator of the water rights pilot ingroup 1 means the province i is one of the seven pilot districts which are set to be the experimental group ingroup 0 means the province i belongs to the control group without did not executed the water right plot and is belong to the control group china s water rights pilot project started in 2014 hence the observation period is divided into two part accordingly in terms of time dimension ingroup 0 denotes the pre pilot period i e before 2014 and ingroup 1 represents the post pilot period i e after 2014 in this model the most concerned coefficient is β 3 which measures the impact of water rights pilot on the rebound effect of agricultural water use to be specific it can be concluded that the water rights system has promoted the agricultural water rebound effect when β 3 is positive otherwise it has restrained the rebound effect moreover control i t represents the control variable vectors including effective irrigation area eia water and soil erosion management area wsm planting structure stru the ratio of food crop planting area to total planting area and government financial subsidy gov the last two variables μ i and u t are disturbance terms representing the influence of individual effect and time effect respectively bertrand et al 2004 state that the precondition for the feasibility of did is that the dependent variables of the experimental group and the control group have paralleled changing trends before the policy shock therefore the common trends test on the agricultural water rebound effect of the experimental group and the control group is carried out to verify the feasibility of the model and the result is provided in fig 7 as can be seen the experimental group and the control group had highly consistent changing trends before the execution of water rights pilot in 2014 but after the year that the government piloted the water rights system the rebound rate of the control group turned to decline faster than the experimental group this indicates that it is workable that we use the did model to explore the impact of water rights pilot on water rebound effect in this paper table 6 reports the did estimation of the effects of water rights pilot on agricultural water rebound rate to obtain more robust results bootstrap method is used to adjust the standard errors for the prediction errors and the regression results are presented in the third column of table 6 according to the regression result the coefficient of the interaction term i e ingroup inyear is positive at the significance level of 0 05 compared with the provinces where water rights pilot has not been conducted agricultural water rebound rate was about 0 0297 higher in pilot districts this gap suggests that the water rights system reform did not restrain the rebound effect of agricultural water use but promoted it among the control variables both the water and soil erosion management area wsm and the planting structure stru had significant enhancing effects on the rebound effect of agricultural water use while the coefficients of effective irrigation area eia and government subsidies gov are not significant generally water and soil erosion management take place in areas with harsh water and soil conditions such as saline and sandy land which are mainly located in central and western china contributing to water shortage in these places as discussed in section 4 water shortage is likely to cause a greater retaliatory rebound of water in china there is less profit margin for food crop sales because of the government s restrictions on agriculture in this context the increase of farmers income largely relies on expanding planting area and increasing production and the expansion of production further increased water consumption leading to a rebound in agricultural water the original intention of setting the water rights trading system is to promote the allocation of water resources under market rules and competitive pricing so as to further achieve the purpose of saving resources and achieve the maximum utility of water resource however the empirical result of this paper indicates that the rebound effect was more serious in provinces with water rights trading which means the pilot of water rights promoted the rebound of water resources instead of restraining it in general the possible reasons for this result are related to the ineffective water allocation caused by the trading frictions firstly the unclear initial property rights hindered the water users from participating in market transactions when separating the rights of exploitation from ownership public rights and private rights are often mixed up leading to vague distribution of initial rights to be specific clear definitions have not been made about the nature and actual actions of tradable water rights and relevant rules are also absent secondly the trading activity and liquidity of the market are inadequate at the present stage the water rights transaction still heavily relies on administrative forces lacking of systems to capitalize water rights into mortgage or shareholding meanwhile excessive reliance on government subsidies makes it cheap or even free to use water which leads to a huge waste of water resources and impeding the growth of water rights trading market thirdly standardized water rights trading system has not been formed in china and scientific metering and monitoring methods are still in the exploratory stage due to the above reasons there is no uniform standard on price setting of water rights transaction and the transaction prices differ a lot among regions and can hardly reflect the real shadow prices of water resources as an example the price of the rights to draw water from the yellow river in inner mongolia is mainly based on the cost of water saving transformation invested in water saving agricultural irrigation while the water rights price of henan province is set according to the supply price of the south to north water diversion project since there is little spontaneous trading behavior in the market the relationship between supply and demand can hardly affect the price fluctuation of water rights through market function to sum up because of the existence of market frictions it is hard for china to achieve completely competitive trading in agricultural water resources market within a short time for now excessive reliance on administration and lack of market rules is leading to more waste of water and serious rebound effect 5 conclusions this paper uses the panel data of china s agricultural sector to estimate the agricultural water rebound rate and to verify the influence of water rights pilot on agricultural water rebound effect the empirical result shows that china s average agricultural water use efficiency in the survey period was only 0 47 and the average short run and long run agricultural water use rebound rate were 0 49 and 0 66 respectively these findings illustrate that there was a rebound effect in china agricultural water market from a regional perspective the agricultural water rebound effect was more serious in the west while being weaker in the east and central regions in addition this paper suggests that the water rights pilot in china from 2014 to 2017 failed to restrain the rebound of agricultural water use but promoted it which may be resulted from the market frictions of water trade based on the above conclusions the following policy recommendations are proposed to realize the optimal use of agricultural water in china 1 management policies must be carried out together with the improvement of irrigation technologies to lessen agricultural water rebound effect since the potential water saving capability of improved water use efficiency is partly offset by rebound effect management policies must be imposed to restrict farmers water use behaviors and fully realize the benefit of efficiency improvement 2 the comprehensive reform of agricultural water prices should be carried forward and it is urgent to build a market oriented agricultural water rights system for china s agricultural water market to reduce the market friction and realize the effective allocation of water resources through the market it is essential to clearly define the property rights of water resources scientifically make water metering and strictly enforce the monitoring system 3 according to coase theory market is efficient under zero transaction costs but its efficiency would be lower than pareto efficiency if the transaction costs is positive at present china s water rights market is accompanied by high transaction costs including searching costs negotiation costs examining and approving costs contract costs and implementation costs etc therefore the key to improving the effectiveness of water rights market lies in the reduction of transaction costs which should be the most important direction of future efforts declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this work was supported by project of the national natural science foundation

10227,improving water saving irrigation technology and water use efficiency are often regarded as effective ways to control the amount of agricultural water consumption but the rebound effect may offset this effort in practice based on the sample of 30 provinces in china from 2000 to 2017 this paper applies the meta frontier data envelopment analysis method to measure agricultural water efficiency and then estimates the rebound rate of agricultural water resource applying difference generalized method of moments and elasticity analysis formula further the difference in difference model is used to test the effectiveness of china s water rights reform on china s agricultural water rebound rate in recent years the results show that 1 within the survey period the average agricultural water rebound rate of china in short term and long term were 0 49 and 0 66 respectively and the water rebound rate in all provinces were positive indicating that water rebound effect was widespread in china s agricultural water market 2 agricultural water rebound rates were significantly different among regions which was higher in western region while were comparatively smaller in the eastern and central regions 3 the water rights pilot project failed to restrain the rebound of agricultural water use but promoted it which may be resulted from the market frictions of water trade according to the results recommendations are put forward for the governments to reinforce management of water improve water rights system and reduce trade costs in order to reduce the friction of agricultural water market and the effective use of water resource keywords water rebound effect agricultural water efficiency technological heterogeneity meta frontier policy testing water rights system 1 introduction water shortage has always been a crucial constraint to the sustainable development of china s agriculture as shown in fig 1 more than 60 of china s total water consumption was caused by agricultural sector while water resource is scarce there are still extensive and wasteful water use problems in china s agriculture sector huang et al 2020 song et al 2018 to promote intensive use of water resources and reduce waste chinese government has been taking several measures to improve agricultural water use efficiency including constructing water saving irrigation projects and generalizing mechanical irrigation after years of efforts the water saving irrigation rate water saving irrigation area gross crop area rose from 15 in 2000 to 29 in 2017 and the number of agricultural irrigation and drainage machines increased from 477 457 in 2000 to 778 181 in 2017 it is generally believed that efficient water saving irrigation technology can save a large amount of water resources graveline et al 2014 huang et al 2020 however although china has made significant progress in water saving irrigation and water use efficiency its water consumption in agricultural sector did not decline as expected similar phenomena are widely found in other parts of the world which is known as rebound effect brinegar and ward 2009 dagnino and ward 2012 fang and zhang 2020a garcía garizábal and causapé 2010 huffaker 2008 huffaker and whittlesey 2000 lecina et al 2010 li and zhao 2018 peterson and ding 2005 playán and mateos 2006 qureshi et al 2010 rodriguez diaz et al 2011 scheierling et al 2006 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 whittlesey 2003 the european commission pointed out in 2012 that people should be aware of the potential rebound effect in water saving irrigation induced by technological advance this is an alarming issue to the sustainable development of china s agriculture the mechanism of rebound effect in agricultural water can be summarized in two aspects first the hydrological mechanism advanced technological irrigation can match the crop s need of water more precisely and uniformly making it easy for farmers to expand production scale thus water consumption is increased along with increased crop yield brinegar and ward 2009 dagnino and ward 2012 kuil et al 2018 lecina et al 2010 lopez gunn et al 2012 perry 2007 qureshi et al 2010 scheierling et al 2006 sears et al 2018 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 wu et al 2018 the second is economic mechanism that is the efficiency improvement of irrigation forces the water price to reduce and farmers would change their water using behaviors in response to the income effect and substitution effect caused by lower water price freire gonzalez 2019 song et al 2018 wheeler et al 2020 most of the previous studies analyzed the agricultural water rebound effect from the perspective of theory and comparative analysis kuil et al 2018 molle and tanouti 2017 sears et al 2018 and few of them have measured the rebound effect quantificationally except for song et al 2018 who established a direct comparison method using the contribution rate of technological progress to construct indicators of the agricultural water rebound effect in china they found that the magnitude of china s average agricultural water rebound effect in 1998 2014 reached 61 49 confirming the existence of water rebound effects in china s agricultural sector although song et al 2018 pioneered in estimating the agricultural water rebound rate in china their method of calculating the rebound effect using the contribution rate of technological progress does not directly reflect the definition of the rebound effect which might cause errors paul et al 2019 song et al 2018 through the above analysis the upgrade of irrigation technology is likely to cause a greater rebound of agricultural water use in the absence of supporting policies and management measures yan et al 2020 if policy measures are taken to restrict the additional water supply the rebound effect can be weakened berbel et al 2015 explored measures to lessen the rebound effect of agricultural water in the guadalquivir basin southern spain they suggested that the keys to reducing the rebound effect lay in 1 strictly limiting the scale of cultivated land 2 reducing the supply of water rights 3 redistributing the saved water resources to achieve environmental goals zhang et al 2019 demonstrated that alternative restrictions on water supply and irrigatable land could effectively constrain water use and consumption after modernizing the irrigation systems fang and zhang 2020a and li and zhao 2018 found that the water rights system could suppress the growth of water consumption fang and zhang 2020a further summarized the mechanism in which the water rights system worked as the revenue driven effect and the industrial water pressure effect it can be concluded that to restrain the rebound effect there must be measures to limit the water use behaviors of farmers many developed countries have already executed marketization reform on water resources and water rights transaction comparatively speaking the marketization of water resources in china started late and the water resource market is lack of uniform pricing standard for agricultural consumption in some districts agricultural water is even completely free to access which is the root cause of such rampant overuse of water recourses facing with increasingly severe water shortages comprehensive agricultural water price reforms have been put on the agenda since 2014 with henan ningxia jiangxi hubei inner mongolia gansu and guangdong being the first batch of pilot districts the main subject of the reform is to establish a water saving management system including water prices system water rights system together with awards and construction management systems to promote the transformation of agricultural water use from extensive to intensive however these policies and measures are still under exploring and it is still unknown whether these measures can restrain the rebound of water resources in practice based on these concerns this study focused on two scientific problems first it is necessary to examine whether there is rebound effect on china s agricultural water market since it has been hotly debated second it is also salutary to test the effectiveness of china s water rights system and discuss the possible reasons by analyzing the influence of water rights pilot on agricultural water rebound effect some important research contributions are made in this paper firstly the difference in difference method is applied to test the influence of water rights pilot on the agricultural water rebound effect and expound the results from the perspective of agricultural market friction as far as we know this is the first study on testing the effectiveness of china s water rights system reform since it was implemented in 2014 secondly the meta frontier dea method based on technical heterogeneity was used to estimate the water resource utilization efficiency which is more in accordance with the actual situation of china s economy meanwhile weather condition and the price of production means that are not affected by the farmers are chosen to be the independent variables for the regression model to avoid endogenous problem hence the estimation of rebound rate is ensured to be accurate thirdly compared with previous studies we estimate the rebound effect in both short run and long run providing more profound implications for policy making in china s water market 2 methods and models 2 1 estimating agricultural water rebound rate referring to sorrell and dimitropoulos 2008 the water rebound rate of agriculture sector can be defined as 1 r 1 w η where w η denotes the efficiency elasticity of agricultural water demand the ideal state is that 1 increase in technical efficiency would lead to 1 reduce in water demand however as there is rebound effect part of the potential water saving capability is offset and we use 1 w η to represent the offset proportion 2 w η dlnw dln η where w is the water demand in agriculture sector and η is the agricultural water use efficiency thus eq 2 measures the efficiency elasticity of agricultural water demand in order to get w η a demand function of the optimal agricultural water use is formulated in this paper price of agricultural production factors weather condition and agricultural water use efficiency are taken as the three most crucial determinants generally speaking agricultural capital and water resources are complementary production elements jointly promoting agricultural outputs weather condition is also expected to have a positive correlation with the agricultural water demand because high temperature generally induces more sur face evaporation and accelerates the metabolism of crops requiring more input of water besides technology is also an essential element affecting agricultural water demand because technology can change the yield under the same inputs and could influence people s consumption hobbies intuitively the above three influential factors of water resource are not controlled by farmers thus prevent endogeneity problem in this model methodologically the demand function can be written in the nature logarithm form 3 ln w it f ln p it ln s it ln η it μ i u t ε it where w it represents the optimal agricultural water demand for dmu t in i period p it is the price of agricultural production factors using the price index of agricultural production means as proxy variable s it denotes weather condition using illumination hours as proxy variable η it is the agricultural water use efficiency as the efficiency cannot be observed directly it is estimated with input and output data μ i is the province specific intercept u t the year specific intercept and ε it is the error term referring to adetutu et al 2016 it is a dynamic optimization process to make the water demand reach the optimal level which can be written as follow 4 ln w it ln w it 1 1 θ ln w it ln w it 1 where w it represents the actual agricultural water demand and 1 θ is the proportion of adjustment between adjacent periods combining eq 3 and eq 4 the following equation is obtained 5 ln w it θ ln w it 1 1 θ f ln p it ln s it ln η it ω i ω t ω it where ω i 1 θ μ i and υ it 1 θ ε it furthermore f ln p it ln s it ln η it can be approximated by its second taylor expansion thus eq 5 is transformed to 6 ln w it θ ln w it 1 β 1 ln p it β 2 ln s it β 3 ln η it β 4 2 ln p it ln s it β 5 2 ln p it ln η it β 6 2 ln s it ln η it β 7 2 ln p it 2 β 8 2 ln s it 2 β 9 2 ln η it 2 ω i ω t ω it taking the derivative of eq 6 the short run efficiency elasticity of agricultural water demand is obtained 7 w η s β 3 β 5 2 ln p it β 6 2 ln s it β 9 ln η it eq 7 indicates that w η s is not a constant but varies among dmus and periods influenced by p it s it and η it as shown in eq 4 and eq 5 the agricultural water demand in a certain period w it is correlated to that in the last period w it 1 this implies that the change of agricultural water use efficiency has a long term effect on agricultural water demand here is an example suppose that one unit increase in the agricultural water use efficiency would lead to γ unit decrease in water demand at t period then the impact would be θ γ at t 1 period and θ 2 γ in t 2 period so forth and so on the total effect of per unit increase of the efficiency can be calculated as γ θ γ θ 2 γ θ n γ and the sum value is approximately equal to γ 1 θ combining with eq 7 the long term efficiency elasticity of agricultural water demand can be written as follows 8 w η l β 3 β 5 2 ln a it β 6 2 ln y it β 9 ln η it 1 θ based on the efficiency elasticity of agricultural water demand in short term and long term expressed in eq 7 and eq 8 the agricultural water rebound effect in short term and long term can be denoted as r 1 w η s and 1 w η l respectively according to eq 1 when the magnitude of the agricultural water rebound effect i e r is greater than 1 that is r 0 efficiency improvement will result in increase of agricultural water demand such case is also called backfire phenomenon or tempering effect an extreme situation of jevon s paradox when 0 r 1 the higher efficiency of water use can lead to decrease in water demand but its water saving potential is partly offset by the rebound effect if r 0 then there is no rebound effect in agricultural water use in other words the potential of a higher efficiency to save water is fully exploited in order to estimate the short run and long run rebound rate of agricultural water in eq 7 and eq 8 water use efficiency η it is needed in the next part of this section we will introduce the meta dea method which is applied to estimate water use efficiency 2 2 estimation of total factors water use efficiency assuming that a production system can be classified into h groups according to certain standards and each group contains j decision making units j 1 2 j applying m kinds of inputs to produce n kinds of outputs x x 1 x 2 x m r m y y 1 y 2 y n r n based on these settings a production technology t can be defined as 9 t x y x can produce y specific to this paper capital k labor l and water resources w are the main inputs and agricultural gdp is the output thus the production technology set of the group h can be described as 10 t h k l w y δ h k l w c a n produce y with technology δ h considering that the geographical location resource endowment and economic development stage of each provinces in china differs a lot the selected 30 provinces are divided into three regions namely the eastern region the central region and the western region this grouping method has been widely used in studies of chinese problems bai et al 2020 feng and wang 2017 li et al 2019 lin and bai 2020 yu et al 2019 zhang and zhou 2020 the grouping results are shown in table 1 the groups are assumed to use different technics each year hence different production technology frontiers are required to be constructed based on the production technology set in eq 10 the distance function of group h in year t is defined as eq 11 11 d ht k l w y sup ρ k l w ρ y t ht the economic implication of the distance function is to calculate the maximum degree ρ of potential water saving under given technology holding other input factors capital k and labor l and output y unchanged under this premise water use efficiency can be defined as the ratio of the optimal input quantity of water to the actual one accordingly the total factor water use efficiency based on the given technology frontier can be written as 12 mtfee ht 1 d ht k l w y in addition the technology set t of group h in year t can be obtained by solving the following linear programming 13 t ht k l w y n 1 n h ω ht n k ht mn k ht m m 1 2 m n 1 n h ω ht n l ht mn l ht m m 1 2 m n 1 n h ω ht n w ht mn w ht m m 1 2 m n 1 n h ω ht n y ht in y ht n i 1 2 i ω ht n 0 n 1 2 n h in this function ω is a non negative weight vector x ht mn x ht m m 1 2 m indicates that the actual input exceeds the optimal level on the technical frontier n 1 n h ω ht n y ht in y ht n i 1 2 i indicates that the actual output is less than the output on the technical frontier based on the above constraints the water resource efficiency of each dmu under technology of the group can be calculated as 14 gglpi target water consumption based on the front frontier actual water consumption as the common frontier is the data envelope of group frontiers it can be defined as 15 t u h 1 ht t ht correspondingly the distance function can be defined as 16 d t k l w y sup ρ k l w ρ y t thus the water efficiency under the common frontier is written as follow 17 mtfee t 1 d t k l w y all the group frontiers h 1 2 h are enveloped to construct a common frontier which can be expressed as follows 18 mt t k l w y h 1 h n 1 n h ω ht n k mn k m m 1 2 m h 1 h n 1 n h ω ht n l mn l m m 1 2 m h 1 h n 1 n h ω ht n w mn w m m 1 2 m h 1 h j 1 n h ω h n y in y i i 1 2 i ω h n 0 n 1 2 n h h 1 2 h similar to the definition of gglpi the water resource efficiency index mglpi based on the common frontier is symbolized as 19 mglpi target water consumption based on the common frontier actual water consumption obviously the value of mglpi is between 0 and 1 if the mglpi is equal to 1 then the dmu is effective under the frontier technology based on the above analysis the water use efficiency of each dmu based on the common frontier can be obtained according to du and li 2019 fei and lin 2016 the change of water use efficiency can be decomposed into three parts shown as the following formula 20 mmepi t s d s j k t l t w t y t d t j k t l t w t y t d s j k s l s w s y s d t j k s l s w s y s 1 2 d t j k t l t w t y t d s j k s l s w s y s d t k t l t w t y t d t j k t l t

represent the changes of water use efficiency caused by technological progress intra group technological efficiency changes and inter group catch up changes respectively if the values of them are greater than 1 it means the index promotes the water use efficiency to increase otherwise it restrains the growth of water use efficiency 3 research results 3 1 data resources to evaluate the agricultural water rebound rate a panel data model of 30 provinces in china from 2000 to 2017 is conducted in this paper considering the consistency and availability of the sample data taiwan hong kong macao and tibet are not included in this study agricultural water consumption w capital k labor l and agricultural output y are used to estimate the agricultural water use efficiency besides data of provincial sunshine hours s and price of agricultural production means p are also collected to build the water demand function and measure water rebound effect all data are extracted from national or provincial statistical yearbooks of china the descriptive statistics of the variables are listed in table 2 3 2 water use efficiency of agricultural sector based on the sample data meta frontier dea method is applied to estimate the agricultural water use efficiency and results are demonstrated in table 3 in general the average agricultural water efficiency of china during 2000 2017 was 0 47 and the annual water use efficiency was declining year by year it indicates that china s agricultural water use efficiency did not reach the potential optimal level which might due to the backward irrigation technology as well as the lack of sound agricultural water management system as can be seen in table 3 beijing had the highest agricultural water efficiency among the 30 provinces at 0 994 followed by shanghai whose efficiency was 0 992 these two provinces are advanced in technology and management leading to an intensive way to use water by contract the bottom three provinces were xinjiang ningxia and gansu with the efficiency values of 0 059 0 064 and 0 155 respectively these three provinces with low water efficiency are in the western part of china and have a long history of water shortages and poor technology which bring about inefficient water use from a regional perspective water efficiency of the eastern region was always far ahead of those of the central and the west and the efficiency of the central and the west was approximately at the same level as presented in fig 2 the reason for such geographical differences can be contributed to the reason that the east is superior to other regions in terms of economy resource endowment technology and management specific to the central and western regions the water use efficiency of the central region was slightly higher than that of the west before 2012 this is probably because the central region has better economic foundation and agricultural infrastructures in comparison with the west after 2012 with the implement of western development strategy and targeted agricultural poverty alleviation policy water saving technology was gradually popularized in the west since then the central region was surpassed by the west in terms of agricultural water efficiency to explain the decline of water efficiency in china s agricultural sector during the sample period the change of water use efficiency is decomposed into technological catch up changes technological advance changes and intra group efficiency changes according to eq 20 the results are shown in fig 3 the technological advance effects in all the three regions are greater than 1 demonstrating that these regions have made significant progress in technology which considerably improved water efficiency this result supports the founding of huang et al 2017 that water saving technologies can reduce water use and improve the productivity of water moreover the intra group efficiency value in the east and the west were smaller than 1 which means that provinces in these two regions did not realize the optimal usage of water recourse under given technology in other words their actual water input tended to deviate from the given technological frontier this indicates that management of agricultural water use is also an important factor that influences the final water efficiency nian et al 2020 for the technological catch up index it was equal to 1in most eastern provinces illustrating that the eastern region represented the most advanced technological level of the country in the other two regions the technological catch up index was generally smaller than 1 which means that the technological frontier of these regions was tending to moving away from the optimal frontier contrastively the technological gap among the three regions enlarged during 2010 2015 and then gradually narrowed after 2015 serving as another reason for the decline of water use efficiency in the central and west after 2010 in addition to technological and administrative reasons above mentioned climate change is another possible reason for the changes of water use efficiency the climate change especially the global warming can lead to higher temperature and reduction in precipitation thus accelerates water evaporation on farm land and force farmers to irrigate plants more frequently all these natural phenomena can change people s behavior of using water and increase working intensity of irrigation facilities leading to efficiency loss bigelow and zhang 2018 huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 3 3 estimates of agricultural water rebound effect to measure agricultural water rebound rate the coefficients in eq 6 need to be estimated since the explanatory variables of eq 6 contain lagged value of the dependent variable difference generalized method of moments dif gmm is used for regression analysis to solve the endogenous problem the effectiveness of dif gmm is based on the premise that there is no autocorrelation between the disturbance and possible lagged values of dependent variable which are used as instrumental variables the results of arellano bond test show that the probability value of ar 1 in first order autocorrelation and ar 2 in second order autocorrelation are 0 642 and 0 996 respectively thereby it cannot reject the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation in the disturbance υ it besides the results of sargan test and hansen test reveal that the instrumental variables in this model were not related to the disturbance term meanwhile time effect is considered in the model to reduce estimating error year dummy variables for 2000 2018 as well as the individual dummy variables for the 30 provinces are generated using stata the regression results are listed in table 4 combined with the regression results of dif gmm and eqs 7 and 8 the agricultural water rebound rate in short run and long run is obtained macroscopically a description of the nation wide agricultural water rebound rate is presented in table 5 as listed the average short run and long run rebound rate of china was 0 4931 and 0 6601 respectively both were smaller than 1 but greater than 0 this indicates that the increase in agricultural water efficiency can reduce agricultural water use to some extent but this effect was partly offset by the rebound effect specifically when water use efficiency increases it temporarily offsets 49 32 of the potential water saving in the short run and permanently counteracted 66 01 in the long run particularly the minimum short run rebound effect was negative in some provinces demonstrating that the water saving capability was realized but rebound effect still can be found in long run fig 4 and fig 5 plot the provincial agricultural water rebound rate in short run and long run respectively it can be concluded from the diagrams that the sample provinces suffered from severer rebound effect in the long run than in short run on the bright side the rebound effect was showing a downward trend during the sample period indicating that the rebound effect was weakening on provincial scale larger rebound effect in both short run and long run was observed in west china especially in guizhou xinjiang sichuan and chongqing statistically the average short run rebound rate of the four provinces were 0 76 0 60 0 68 and 0 65 respectively while the average long run rebound effect was 0 84 0 73 0 78 and 0 78 to be specific xinjiang is in the northwest china with extremely dry climate thus a large amount of water was required for irrigation purpose as for sichuan and chongqing they are situated in mountainous area of high altitude inconvenient for diversion irrigation due to the above reasons the four provinces are afflicted by water shortage according to saunders 2000 when the requirement for a certain resource is not satisfied the efficiency improvement is very likely to cause a large rebound effect in this resource in contract the rebound effect diminishes when the demand approaches saturation liaoning had the lowest rebound rate of 0 28 in the short run and 0 51 in the long run and it even fully realized the water saving potential in some of the years from a regional perspective as shown in fig 6 the rebound rate of the west was the highest among the three regions with the average short term value being 0 55 and long term value being 0 70 the central region took the second place average short term value at 0 47 average long term value at 0 65 and the lowest rebound rate was in the east average short term value at 0 64 average long term value at 0 46 this is probably because that the water management system was more mature in the east with more strict and better supervision by contrast the west region was comparatively fell behind and there are little measures to limit farmers water use behaviors in response to water shortage this paper verifies the conclusions of song et al 2018 and fang et al 2020 on china s agricultural water rebound effect based on simplified direct comparison method and slacks based measure sbm based of malmquist index methods they demonstrated that the rebound rate was 61 49 and 70 3 different from their studies this paper distinguishes the rebound rate from the short run to the long run providing significant evidence for china s policy making in saving agricultural water with a farsighted vision besides there are also similar studies focus on water rebound effect in china huang et al 2017 wang et al 2020 and other countries berbel et al 2018 berbel and mateos 2014 freire gonzalez 2019 lankford et al 2020 pfeiffer and lin 2014 song et al 2018 wheeler et al 2020 some of the previous studies have already concerned about the effect of water rights system on agricultural water use fang and zhang 2020a wang et al 2017 wheeler et al 2020 some studies found that water rights transaction would promote water rebound effect owing to the following factors related to market friction 1 water stealing due to weak law enforcement 2 inaccurate metering of water resources 3 unauthorized exploitation of surface water and groundwater 4 water wasting caused by excessive subsidies meanwhile other scholars argue that the water rights transaction can benefit water saving and verify their opinions with empirical analysis aghaie et al 2020 fang and zhang 2020b li and zhao 2018 wang et al 2017 so far scholars have not reached an agreement on weather water rights transaction promotes or restrains water saving in agriculture thus the actual effectiveness of water rights pilot is discussed in the next section with the concerns on china s reality 4 discussion the above analysis verifies that it is hard to achieve the water saving target by technological improvement alone thereby relevant management policy is necessary in a general way water is a public resource without exclusion thus everyone has an incentive to overuse it therefore it is widely believed that water rebound effect can be restrained by exerting exclusiveness on water recourse to be specific via constructing price and rights system berbel et al 2015 fang and zhang 2020a li and zhao 2018 zhang et al 2019 starting in 2014 china has lunched the water rights pilot experiment in seven provinces i e henan ningxia jiangxi hubei inner mongolia gansu and guangdong in these pilot districts tradable water rights are distributed into villages and families by the end of 2017 all the pilot districts had passed the examination and water rights system began to be carried out nationwide in this section the effectiveness of water rights reform is to be tested from the perspective of rebound effect in other words to examine whether the agricultural water rebound effect can be restrained by water rights system in view of the advantages of difference in difference estimation did in testing the effects of policy implementation this paper applied did method and differentiated the experimental group and the control group according to whether the water rights pilot is implemented and then the did model is constructed as eq 21 21 awre i t β 0 β 1 ingroup β 2 inyear β 3 ingroup inyear β 4 control i t μ i u t ε it where ingroup is defined as a binary indicator of the water rights pilot ingroup 1 means the province i is one of the seven pilot districts which are set to be the experimental group ingroup 0 means the province i belongs to the control group without did not executed the water right plot and is belong to the control group china s water rights pilot project started in 2014 hence the observation period is divided into two part accordingly in terms of time dimension ingroup 0 denotes the pre pilot period i e before 2014 and ingroup 1 represents the post pilot period i e after 2014 in this model the most concerned coefficient is β 3 which measures the impact of water rights pilot on the rebound effect of agricultural water use to be specific it can be concluded that the water rights system has promoted the agricultural water rebound effect when β 3 is positive otherwise it has restrained the rebound effect moreover control i t represents the control variable vectors including effective irrigation area eia water and soil erosion management area wsm planting structure stru the ratio of food crop planting area to total planting area and government financial subsidy gov the last two variables μ i and u t are disturbance terms representing the influence of individual effect and time effect respectively bertrand et al 2004 state that the precondition for the feasibility of did is that the dependent variables of the experimental group and the control group have paralleled changing trends before the policy shock therefore the common trends test on the agricultural water rebound effect of the experimental group and the control group is carried out to verify the feasibility of the model and the result is provided in fig 7 as can be seen the experimental group and the control group had highly consistent changing trends before the execution of water rights pilot in 2014 but after the year that the government piloted the water rights system the rebound rate of the control group turned to decline faster than the experimental group this indicates that it is workable that we use the did model to explore the impact of water rights pilot on water rebound effect in this paper table 6 reports the did estimation of the effects of water rights pilot on agricultural water rebound rate to obtain more robust results bootstrap method is used to adjust the standard errors for the prediction errors and the regression results are presented in the third column of table 6 according to the regression result the coefficient of the interaction term i e ingroup inyear is positive at the significance level of 0 05 compared with the provinces where water rights pilot has not been conducted agricultural water rebound rate was about 0 0297 higher in pilot districts this gap suggests that the water rights system reform did not restrain the rebound effect of agricultural water use but promoted it among the control variables both the water and soil erosion management area wsm and the planting structure stru had significant enhancing effects on the rebound effect of agricultural water use while the coefficients of effective irrigation area eia and government subsidies gov are not significant generally water and soil erosion management take place in areas with harsh water and soil conditions such as saline and sandy land which are mainly located in central and western china contributing to water shortage in these places as discussed in section 4 water shortage is likely to cause a greater retaliatory rebound of water in china there is less profit margin for food crop sales because of the government s restrictions on agriculture in this context the increase of farmers income largely relies on expanding planting area and increasing production and the expansion of production further increased water consumption leading to a rebound in agricultural water the original intention of setting the water rights trading system is to promote the allocation of water resources under market rules and competitive pricing so as to further achieve the purpose of saving resources and achieve the maximum utility of water resource however the empirical result of this paper indicates that the rebound effect was more serious in provinces with water rights trading which means the pilot of water rights promoted the rebound of water resources instead of restraining it in general the possible reasons for this result are related to the ineffective water allocation caused by the trading frictions firstly the unclear initial property rights hindered the water users from participating in market transactions when separating the rights of exploitation from ownership public rights and private rights are often mixed up leading to vague distribution of initial rights to be specific clear definitions have not been made about the nature and actual actions of tradable water rights and relevant rules are also absent secondly the trading activity and liquidity of the market are inadequate at the present stage the water rights transaction still heavily relies on administrative forces lacking of systems to capitalize water rights into mortgage or shareholding meanwhile excessive reliance on government subsidies makes it cheap or even free to use water which leads to a huge waste of water resources and impeding the growth of water rights trading market thirdly standardized water rights trading system has not been formed in china and scientific metering and monitoring methods are still in the exploratory stage due to the above reasons there is no uniform standard on price setting of water rights transaction and the transaction prices differ a lot among regions and can hardly reflect the real shadow prices of water resources as an example the price of the rights to draw water from the yellow river in inner mongolia is mainly based on the cost of water saving transformation invested in water saving agricultural irrigation while the water rights price of henan province is set according to the supply price of the south to north water diversion project since there is little spontaneous trading behavior in the market the relationship between supply and demand can hardly affect the price fluctuation of water rights through market function to sum up because of the existence of market frictions it is hard for china to achieve completely competitive trading in agricultural water resources market within a short time for now excessive reliance on administration and lack of market rules is leading to more waste of water and serious rebound effect 5 conclusions this paper uses the panel data of china s agricultural sector to estimate the agricultural water rebound rate and to verify the influence of water rights pilot on agricultural water rebound effect the empirical result shows that china s average agricultural water use efficiency in the survey period was only 0 47 and the average short run and long run agricultural water use rebound rate were 0 49 and 0 66 respectively these findings illustrate that there was a rebound effect in china agricultural water market from a regional perspective the agricultural water rebound effect was more serious in the west while being weaker in the east and central regions in addition this paper suggests that the water rights pilot in china from 2014 to 2017 failed to restrain the rebound of agricultural water use but promoted it which may be resulted from the market frictions of water trade based on the above conclusions the following policy recommendations are proposed to realize the optimal use of agricultural water in china 1 management policies must be carried out together with the improvement of irrigation technologies to lessen agricultural water rebound effect since the potential water saving capability of improved water use efficiency is partly offset by rebound effect management policies must be imposed to restrict farmers water use behaviors and fully realize the benefit of efficiency improvement 2 the comprehensive reform of agricultural water prices should be carried forward and it is urgent to build a market oriented agricultural water rights system for china s agricultural water market to reduce the market friction and realize the effective allocation of water resources through the market it is essential to clearly define the property rights of water resources scientifically make water metering and strictly enforce the monitoring system 3 according to coase theory market is efficient under zero transaction costs but its efficiency would be lower than pareto efficiency if the transaction costs is positive at present china s water rights market is accompanied by high transaction costs including searching costs negotiation costs examining and approving costs contract costs and implementation costs etc therefore the key to improving the effectiveness of water rights market lies in the reduction of transaction costs which should be the most important direction of future efforts declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this work was supported by project of the national natural science foundation

10228,droughts are one of the most damaging and complex natural disasters in the world and they frequently affect agricultural production drought monitoring is essential for decision makers seeking to minimize the socio economic impacts related to drought events in this study we propose a methodology to identify the most suitable drought indices and data sources for monitoring the impact of drought on crops mozambique is used as a case study as it represents a challenging example because of its poor hydroclimatic monitoring network and a lack of disaggregated data for agricultural production a total of seven standardized drought indicators spi spei ssi svci stci svhi and stws at different scales 1 3 6 and 12 months were obtained from global databases and evaluated as possible predictors of the annual variability of agricultural yields at the national level a statistical model of crop yields based on time series was used to measure the explanatory capacity of each index spei and ssi were the most effective at detecting the country s historical drought records regardless of whether nationally averaged values or the percentages of area affected by drought paa were used however paa was found to be a more accurate predictor of variability in crop yields the variability of most cereals maize millet and sorghum was adequately explained by the paa of spei 3 with that of other crops cashew nuts cassava potatoes tea tobacco and vegetables being explained by the paa of ssi 12 specific indicators were proposed for monitoring wheat and sugar cane these results can directly support managers and decision makers in developing drought contingency plans in mozambique to further demonstrate the potential of this methodology it should be tested in other regions with a greater availability of agricultural data including spatial disaggregation keywords drought index drought impacts crop yield statistical model mozambique 1 introduction droughts represent one of the most extensive costly recurrent and complex types of natural disasters worldwide bryant et al 2005 mishra and singh 2010 given that it is related to water availability the agricultural sector is especially sensitive to this natural phenomenon negative impacts like a decrease in quantity and or quality of crops directly affect food security and consequently the quality of life within a region or country backlund et al 2008 such impacts are more perceptible in high drought risk regions e g southern africa and rainfed agriculture systems tigkas et al 2019 droughts are classified into four widely accepted types meteorological agricultural hydrological and socio economic wilhite and glantz 1985 each type is typically characterized and described through drought indices dis hayes et al 2011 several dis have been developed over the last century world meteorological organization and global water partnership 2016 most dis require climatic and or hydrological data with at least 30 years of observation as inputs for a reliable temporal drought analysis whereas at least one data station per 5000 km2 is recommended for spatial analyses aghakouchak et al 2015 in recent decades different institutions have constructed and updated various large scale climate and hydrological data sets e g abatzoglou et al 2018 beck et al 2017a harris et al 2020 thomas et al 2014 these products provide gauge based satellite derived or reanalysis based estimates and can constitute a suitable alternative for calculating dis in data scarce regions e g nashwan et al 2020 though these global products are not without limitations beck et al 2017b sun et al 2018 they have been used in several drought and agriculture related studies worldwide and constitute a reliable data source agutu et al 2017 champagne et al 2019 du et al 2018 garcía león et al 2019 jayanthi et al 2013 lawal et al 2019 potopová et al 2020 rojas et al 2011 drought studies related to agriculture usually use correlation tests and statistical models to explain the relationship between farming yields and drought indicators shi et al 2013 these models can be based on a single point or area time series methods spatial and temporal variations panel methods or solely spatial variations cross section methods lobell and burke 2010 the type of model can be chosen depending on the spatial and temporal detail of the crop yield series shi et al 2013 garcía león et al 2019 and peña gallardo et al 2019a researched the relationships between drought indices and crop yields at the provincial and regional scale in spain using panel methods for the same purpose jayanthi et al 2013 used the time series method in malawi because they only had data on agricultural yields at the national level regardless of the method chosen crop yields are frequently subject to a detrending process to extract the yield trend and remove the variability in productivity caused by non climate factors e g improvements in farming techniques seed hybrid development and irrigation optimization champagne et al 2019 peña gallardo et al 2019b before developing the statistical model the above studies showed that site and crop specific studies are required to identify the most suitable di and data sources for monitoring the impact of drought on crops however there is currently no standard methodology to assess the performance of dis in explaining crop yield variability to fill this research gap in this study we propose a methodological framework to be applied at the national scale comprising three steps first we use global gauge based and satellite derived datasets to calculate several well known dis and validate them with historical drought records in addition to nationally average drought indicator values new aggregated descriptors based on the areas affected by drought are considered to better capture regional variability when working at this scale second we analyze the time variability among dis to identify those that are strongly correlated and potentially provide redundant information then we develop a time series based statistical crop model to predict national yields using dis as predictors building on the above analysis we identify a di or set of dis as well as the data sources to compute them that can be used to monitor crop yields the proposed methodology is applied to mozambique as a case study with an emphasis on determining a climatic drought related explanation of the national crop yield variability the case study is challenging because this country does not currently have an operational measurement network that meets optimum criteria easterling 2013 data on agricultural yields are limited and previous research on drought impacts is scarce however it is also of considerable interest because of the role played by agriculture in the sustainable development in this region and the concerns raised by climate change mozambique is one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world approximately 70 of the population works in agriculture representing 24 of the gdp ministério da agricultura e segurança alimentar 2015 it is also located in one of the most drought and climate change prone areas eriksen and silva 2009 ipcc 2014 osbahr et al 2008 patt and schröter 2008 which increases the vulnerability of its agricultural sector for these reasons this country is immersed in several development programs led by the food and agricultural organization fao midgley et al 2012 and the world food programme wfp wfp 2007 among others aimed at implementing climate change adaptation strategies to enhance the resilience and sustainability of agriculture it is in this context that this work explores the impact of drought on agricultural production in mozambique the overall aim of this study is to develop a methodology of general applicability to identify the most suitable dis and data sources for monitoring the impact of drought on crops at national scale two methodological aspects are worth noting 1 the reliance on freely global scale datasets to obtain a comprehensive set of potential dis and 2 the exploration of alternatives to averaging di values over the entire country that are intended to better capture the local and regional drought conditions when working at such scale the proposed methodology may thus be of special interest in countries with data scarcity where ground data observations are neither sufficient nor timely available for drought monitoring and countries with significant regional variability in drought occurrence where nationally average drought indicator values may conceal regional differences the methodology is tested in mozambique to the knowledge of the authors this is the first study that compares drought indices for an agricultural drought risk assessment in this country this study endeavors to act as a tool for supporting decision makers focusing on the performance of dis in explaining yields and yield variability at the national scale the results can help assess drought related risks to crop production and are ultimately intended to contribute to developing an agricultural drought monitoring system in this country as such we acknowledge the need to reconcile the demands for highly detailed analysis with the extent of the resource requirements infrastructure operational needs etc and data availability 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area mozambique lies in southeast africa fig 1a and covers a continental area of 801 590 km2 the weather system is dominated in the north by the inter tropical convergence zone and in the south by antarctic polar fronts and tropical temperate troughs manhique et al 2011 the climate is tropical with a hot and rainy summer season from november to march and a cool and dry winter season from april to october midgley et al 2012 the annual average temperature varies from 17 8 c to 32 8 c fig 1e and has increased by 1 25 2 0 c in the last 60 years ragab and prudhomme 2002 the annual average precipitation is 1032 mm 75 of which occurs during summertime owing to these conditions the sowing and harvesting season generally extends from november to april rojas et al 2011 farming is one of the main activities in the country 70 of the population depending on subsistence farming with over 80 of the total cultivated area used to produce staple food crops because of the lack of hydraulic infrastructure for irrigation over 95 of this agricultural production is mainly rainfed and without fertilizer consumption fao 2016 the country is prone to drought which has caused temporary food insecurity in the past fao 2016 according to the international disaster database em dat 2019 and the international research institute for climate and society iri hellmuth et al 2007 mozambique has experienced various annual and interannual drought episodes in recent decades in terms of socio economic impacts the most important were the droughts that occurred in 1979 1980 1983 1984 1987 1991 1992 1994 1995 1998 2001 2003 2005 2007 2008 2010 and 2016 2 2 meteorological hydrological and vegetation data the data

affected by droughts the drought indices dis used in this study table 1 rely on the meteorological vegetation condition and hydrological data described in the previous section although several dis exist dai 2011 world meteorological organization and global water partnership 2016 we selected seven widely known dis that have been successfully used in drought and agriculture related investigations agutu et al 2017 sun et al 2012 the standardized precipitation index spi n mckee et al 1993 shows precipitation anomalies with respect to the long average of p considering a window period of n months its computation consists of fitting p time series accumulated at a chosen n months period with a two parameter gamma probability distribution and later standardizing this result the standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index spei n vicente serrano et al 2010 the standardized soil moisture index ssi n hao and aghakouchak 2013 the standardized vegetation condition index svci n the standardized temperature condition index stci n the standardized vegetation health index svhi n and the standardized terrestrial water storage stws n agutu et al 2017 were calculated following the same mathematical procedure as the spi but used the corresponding variables as inputs rather than p the spei n uses the difference between p and etp which is understood as the climatic water balance ssi svci n stci n and svhi n used the sm vci tci and vhi respectively as previously calculated according to kogan 1995 whereas the stws n used the tws the spei n and stws n were fitted to a three parameter log logistic probability distribution following vicente serrano et al 2010 the seven indices were calculated for four temporal accumulations n of 1 3 6 and 12 months considering that farming periods for selected crops are less than one year the indices were evaluated according to the categories explained in table 2 for standardized indexes following the recommendations of mckee et al 1993 we computed the dis time series for each cru cell and then aggregated them into a single national time series for this purpose we averaged the dis values over the entire territory 343 cells weighted by cell area in the country a to obtain a single national monthly time series for each di we also calculated the percentage area affected by droughts paa by considering the intensity thresholds indicated in table 2 we determined the percentage of cells under the different intensity categories using the dis time series for each cell on a monthly scale the annual paa was obtained through aggregating from a monthly to annual series over the calendar year the idea behind the calculation of the paa is to evaluate alternatives to national averaged di values that can better capture in a single value subnational differences in drought conditions the spatial averaging performed for computing the national di values can in some cases hide extreme drought conditions occurring at a more regional scale which is not the case with the paa computation the time span covered by the dis and paa series depended on the availability of main data as indicated in table 1 2 4 crop yield data the country level annual crop yield data y for mozambique was obtained from the fao data portal http www fao org faostat en data qc for the period of 2002 2017 fig 2 crops included maize millet sorghum wheat cashew nuts cassava potatoes sugar cane tea tobacco and vegetables according to kasnakoglu and mayo 2004 this data source represents one of the most credible readily available y dataset because of its monitoring data quality and statistical process more recently agutu et al 2017 used it successfully in a nearby region to characterize agricultural drought crop statistics are not routinely compiled in mozambique at the sub national level e g by agroecological zones or provincial levels the availability of sub national production statistics is in fact very limited in the majority of sub saharan african countries you et al 2009 at present regional yields in mozambique are available for around 8 non consecutive years depending on the specific crop and region from sources like the fao agro maps database http kids fao org agromaps george 2006 or the agricultural statistics yearbooks ministério da agricultura e segurança alimentar 2015 however these data are insufficient to support the type of analysis proposed in this paper and were therefore not considered in this study mozambique has only recently started to improve its farming techniques this could be attributed to the social economic and political issues mozambique has faced in recent decades causing limited developments in agriculture fao 2016 however we decided that it might be necessary to apply a detrending process to the crop data in order to eliminate variations that may result from abiotic factors market prices government policy etc y trends were calculated using the mann kendall mk trend test method mann 1945 millet cashew nuts cassava potatoes sugar cane tobacco and vegetables had positive and significant trends tea showed a negative and non significant trend whereas the other crops had positive and non significant trends the crop yield series were detrended by fitting a linear regression model and extracting the residuals the average crop yield was added to the residual series to produce the detrended yield data the analyses shown in this paper were conducted on the detrended data series and the detrending process was applied only for y with significant trends hereafter detrended crops yield are simply referred as y 2 5 skill assessment and benchmarking of drought indices in the first step of the proposed methodology the performance of the different drought indices for drought detection was analyzed for this purpose the historical drought record from emdat and iri was compared with the time series of the average national dis values and the annual paa for each di the emdat is part of the centre for research on the epidemiology of disasters cred which initiated its active disaster data collection in 1973 guha sapir et al 2015 hence skill assessment was conducted from 1973 to 2017 on a yearly basis in this work a year qualified as a drought year if at least two consecutive months were under moderate drought intensity table 2 according to the dis series this two month criterion allows the exclusion of short droughts which are presumably of minor importance as done in previous studies spinoni et al 2019 in the case of the paa series a drought year was designated if the annual paa value reached 30 although this is an arbitrary threshold the percentage of land impacted by drought is directly related to the number of agricultural households affected and therefore with the drought impact on productivity rojas et al 2011 the performance metrics used were the probability of detection pod or hit rate and the probability of false detection pofd or false alarm rate computed according to wilks 2006 1 p o d 100 h h m 2 p o f d 100 f a c n f a where h are hits m misses fa are false alarms and cn are correct negatives h represents the coincidence of drought of both series historical records and dis paa series and m corresponds to the presence of a drought in the records and the absence of this event in the dis paa series fa occurs if there is no drought in the records but one occurs in the dis paa series and finally cn represents the years in which there is no drought in both series the euclidean distance between the point x1 pofd y1 pod of each di and paa series and the point with the best possible performance x2 pofd 0 y2 pod 100 was used to benchmark performance shorter distances thus indicated better performance a correlation analysis between the dis series was performed in the second step of the methodology we calculated the pearson correlation coefficients between all monthly dis series averaged at the country scale the correlation coefficients were analyzed to assess if the information provided by the different dis was redundant 2 6 statistical crop yield model in the third step of the methodology we developed a statistical crop yield model for mozambique by assuming that y was the response of a function of k independent variables x which in this context included the dis and paa as possible predictors given y 0 and following shi et al 2013 an exponential time series model was adopted as follows 3 ln y t f x t 1 x t 2 x t k β 0 j 1 k β j x t j ε t where y is the vector of annual crop yields fig 2 t is the year x represents the vector with the candidate predictors β j are the constant coefficients and ε the error both single and multiple candidate predictors are considered to develop the models eq 3 transforms in a simple linear regression model with one explanatory variable or in a multiple linear regression respectively the times series considered as candidate predictors for the models are 1 the national average dis of all months of the year january to december 2 the annual national average dis 3 the annual average paa under a certain intensity category moderate severe or extreme the multiple linear regression models use the annual average paa under the three aforementioned intensity categories as candidate predictors i e three independent variables fig 3 summarizes the steps in a methodological flow chart 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison with historical drought records the temporal patterns of the national averaged dis series are plotted in fig 4 each di detected several droughts of different intensity categories moderate green severe orange and extreme red the longer the temporal accumulation n for each di is the later the dry periods are detected and they are also less frequent this result can be explained by the time scale of the di and the drought propagation through the hydrological cycle the historical droughts of 1987 1991 1992 1994 1995 2005 and 2016 were the main drought events detected by the majority of dis according to the di linked to soil moisture ssi an extreme intensity was reached in up to four of these events the dis related to vegetation conditions svci stci and svhi also classified the 1991 1992 event as extreme the remaining dis spi spei and stws distinguished several drought events including the five named above but the intensities were lower moderate and severe in these dis extreme intensities were completely smoothed out by the spatial averaging process stci n and stws n indicated drought conditions in mozambique between 12 0 and 14 1 during the analyzed period spi n and svci n reported the shortest time under drought conditions less than 7 2 when the extreme drought threshold was considered scvi n indicated that such conditions were present less than 2 1 of the time whereas less than 0 4 of the time was classified in this intensity category according to spi n similar to the dis time series observations the historical droughts in 1987 1991 1992 1994 1995 2005 and 2016 were the events that were most clearly detected by majority of the paa series these drought periods have also been highlighted in previous studies brida and owiyo 2013 jayanthi et al 2013 trambauer et al 2014 in these significant events the total area affected by drought and its distribution in intensity categories differed between dis in 1992 up to 74 of the mozambican territory was below the moderate drought threshold and 53 reached the extreme intensity according to spei 12 in 2016 stws 6 showed that 90 of the country was facing a moderate drought 5 of which corresponded to an extreme intensity however spei 12 indicated a paa greater than 20 in the extreme category to benchmark the capacity of detection of historical drought events by the different indices the pod and pofd metrics were computed as described in section 2 5 table 3 shows the skill assessment of the national averaged dis series and paa series according to the distance d to the point with the best possible performance the rankings of dis according to their performances were quite similar for both series dis and paa in both cases the best performance was obtained by spei 3 and spei 6 with more than 50 of pod and with pofd ranging from 7 to 26 similar performances were obtained with these two indices when considering thresholds for drought detection between 20 and 35 of the annual paa value demonstrating that the indexes are robust with respect to slight variations in the definition of a drought year these results are consistent with previous studies that found that emdat drought disasters were best matched with severe droughts identified using meteorological dis for mid high temporal accumulations united nations 2009 the worst detection performance was provided by the dis related to vegetation conditions svhi and svci nonetheless all the dis detected the most important drought events because they affected the entire hydrological cycle the national averaged dis series are likely missing some climatic hydrological or vegetative information of specific regions within the country for example drought conditions that affect an area of the country might be concealed by wet conditions in another region this is not the case for the paa series which a priori makes them a better option for working at a national scale however both the dis and the paa series showed a similar detection capability of historical records overall the meteorological indices spei and spi most closely matched the historical records however none of the dis were able to perfectly capture all the drought periods collected from historical records i e pod lower than 100 and they identified drought conditions outside the drought years recorded in the historical disaster databases i e pofd greater than 0 this may be attributed to the following reasons on the one hand unrelated circumstances might have worsened the consequences of what would otherwise be considered as a mild drought being recorded as drought year in the records for example a other natural disasters occurring between dry periods such as the heavy floods in 1981 and 1985 and between 2000 and 2001 brida and owiyo 2013 midgley et al 2012 patt and schröter 2008 b civil war and conflicts such as the conflict from 1982 to 1984 against zimbabwe hellmuth et al 2007 c epidemics such as the cholera outbreak in 1983 1984 eriksen and silva 2009 or d food security crises as in the 2001 2005 period fao 2006 on the other hand the drought events in mozambique were reported at the national level even if they occurred only in a specific region of the country therefore the national dis series obtained after averaging at national level and the paa may not adequately reflect regional information 3 2 correlation between drought indices the occurrence intensity and duration of drought periods in mozambique showed some variability between the different dis in this step we compared the drought variation patterns between each di fig 5 shows the pearson coefficients between the dis time series the strongest correlations are painted blue and non significant ρ 0 05 correlations are denoted as struck through overall the strongest correlations were found between the indices associated with meteorological variables spi and spei and between those related to soil moisture ssi these were followed by those associated with soil conditions and temperature stci and svhi in general a di with a temporal accumulation of 1 month had a very high or nearly perfect correlation with the same di at a 3 month scale the same was observed between the temporal aggregations of 3 and 6 months and between 6 and 12 months the indexes associated with the vegetation condition albeit without meteorological variables such as temperature in their calculation svci as well as stws exhibited considerably different variabilities from the rest of dis with low correlation values these two dis also had the most non significant correlations with other dis the svci is an index that indicates the condition of the vegetation and thus can reflect other factors external to the climate e g irrigation forestation and afforestation stws on the other hand characterizes the total availability of surface and underground water so its variation depends on the complete hydrological process of the area and not solely on one or two climatological parameters the lowest correlations were found for the highest temporal accumulation swt 12 which could be related to multiannual droughts not analyzed in this paper the results of the correlation analyses are consistent with the physical meaning of the different dis although there is a time lag between the meteorological forcing and the hydrological responses dis based on meteorological variables with 6 and 12 month accumulations showed strong correlations with dis based on vegetation hydrological data the results suggest that only one of these meteorological dis spi and spei with n 6 and n 12 months could be used alone in any subsequent analysis as they provided very similar information and had high correlations with other dis scvi may be used but considering that it does not have an important correlation with hydroclimatic indicators it should be used in conjunction with another di 3 3 explanation of crop yield variability because of the close relationship between y and drought conditions especially in areas with little hydraulic infrastructure such as mozambique non irrigated agriculture a time series statistical model was proposed to find the di that better explains the annual yield variability of the 11 selected crops as explained in section 2 6 the candidate predictors were the averaged national dis of each month jan to dec the annual averaged national dis annual the annual paa at moderate a mod severe a sev and extreme a ext intensities and the sum of the annual paa at moderate severe and extreme intensities a sum totaling 17 time estimates for each di because 28 dis were analyzed this created a total of 17 28 476 candidate predictors for each type of crop fig s1 supplementary materials shows all r2 values of the statistical model results for each crop the crop types are represented on the y axis and the candidate predictors are on the x axis the strongest positive correlations are plotted as red many of the estimates were non significant p 0 05 the main reason for such low coefficients has already been mentioned there are no regional data on crops droughts can however affect specific regions of the country that contribute little to the overall national yield the use of national aggregated estimates in these cases means that we are searching for correlations between droughts affecting one area of the country and yields produced in others it is also worth noting that this study is focused on rainfed agriculture but some crops e g vegetables or sugar cane might be irrigated in some areas adding noise to the yield data mozambique is thus a highly complex scenario area based analysis in countries where disaggregated data are available will certainly improve the results however if a certain number of indicators containing reasonable correlations with crops are determined this can act as a valuable tool for decision makers who currently do not have objective data to guide their policies as more data become available the same methodology can be applied to improve drought monitoring the best candidate predictors of y were different for each crop this is because not all crops are equally sensitive to drought nor do they have the same water harvesting or storage capacities in general the best predictors were those based on the paa and related to agricultural and hydrological droughts being predictors that incorporate spatial information below the national level they showed a better relationship with y than national indicators that lost spatial information in their computation again we note that introducing spatial disaggregation improved the results if in addition to incorporating spatial information from the dis data for the evolution of crops by area were available the results would be much more accurate considering that some of the indicators had high correlations between themselves which meant that their spatial temporal drought patterns were similar the determination coefficients resulting from the proposed model were understandably similar between themselves for example spi 6 and spei 3 best explained the variability of the sorghum with r2 values of 0 70 and 0 67 respectively with a correlation of 0 70 between them to limit the number of indicators the predictive capacities between these two dis can be considered highly similar spei 3 can ultimately be chosen as it also provides reasonable results in other crops such as millet and maize thus the proposal of indicators should be compacted to a minimum number that can explain the variability of the 11 crops fig s1 supplementary materials allows for an analysis of which di reasonably explains the evolution of each of the crops of the 11 crops analyzed 8 of them showed a high correlation with 2 predictor candidates spei 3 a sum reasonably explained the evolution of cereals maize millet and sorghum and ssi 12 a sum explained the rest of the crops cashew nuts cassava potatoes tea tobacco and vegetables fig 6 this suggests that dis that consider not solely precipitation but soil moisture conditions either directly or indirectly can provide a better assessment of the potential impacts on agricultural production the differences in the phenological characteristics and the cultivation period of the studied crops can justify the need for considering different dis spei and ssi at both short and long timescales 3 months and 12 months the variability of the cereal yields is typically best explained by short term meteorological di chen et al 2016 peña gallardo et al 2019a whereas other crops such as tubers and vegetables respond to soil moisture drought conditions at a longer timescale daryanto et al 2016 sorensen 2005 it should also be noted that the choice of a limited set of indices for the sake of simplicity and operational use comes at the cost of more difficult physical interpretation of the results there were some crops that did not neatly fit into these general trends wheat also responded well to spei as did all other cereals but spei 6 aug presented a much better fit than spei 3 a sum used for all other cereals thus the former predictor stands out one possible reason may be a widespread or uniform distribution of wheat crops where the zoning provided by paa based indicators does not offer an added value this is however a hypothesis as disaggregated data are not available the last peculiarity is that of sugar cane this crop had acceptable correlations with other indicators so it could have been included within the general block however sugar cane also had an excellent correlation with the svci 6 a sum indicator as demonstrated in fig 6 so the best fit di was selected in this case it is difficult to estimate the reason for the adjustment although lisboa et al 2018 highlighted the good strong predictive capacity of sugarcane yields using ndvi data the modeled and measured y are compared for all crops in fig 6 the lack of spatially detailed agricultural data made mozambique a difficult place to find relationships between y and dis nevertheless the method applied here discovered relationships that adequately explained the variance of y for some crops proving that it can be used in other regions or countries however as these are national approximations for a considerable territory these results should be considered with care 4 concluding remarks the aim of this research was to test a methodology that could evaluate various drought indices as tools for monitoring drought and to test their ability to explain the annual variability of crop yields the case study was carried out for mozambique which was especially challenging given its poor monitoring system and lack of local regional data on crop yields thus data from global databases and national agricultural data were used the proposed indicators successfully detected the main drought events from 1973 to 2017 according to historical records and accurately noted their duration and intensity the spei and ssi indicators had the best capacity to detect historical droughts through using both nationally averaged time series and the paa variability in crop yields was associated with agricultural and hydrological droughts this variability was explained for the majority of crops using two generic indicators spei 3 a sum explained the performance of various cereal crops maize millet and sorghum whereas ssi 12 a sum correlated well with several other crops cashew nuts cassava potatoes tea tobacco and vegetables some specific indicators were proposed for two specific crops spei 6 of august wheat and svci 6 sum sugar cane spei and ssi also offered the best results in terms of their ability to explain historical drought events in addition because the state level agricultural data were used the annual area affected by drought paa used in both spei 3 a sum and ssi 12 a sum explained the variance of agricultural yields more effectively than the national level drought indicators in summary the proposed methodology allowed us to confirm the use of these drought indicators in their different temporal accumulations as a tool to monitor and characterize droughts and model the annual yields of specific crops in mozambique this methodology should be tested in other regions with a greater availability of agricultural data including spatial disaggregation these results can be used as a support mechanism by managers and decision makers for drought contingency plans in mozambique however there is a need to deepen the analysis of droughts in this country at the regional level to provide an improved basis for drought management at the local level declaration of

10228,droughts are one of the most damaging and complex natural disasters in the world and they frequently affect agricultural production drought monitoring is essential for decision makers seeking to minimize the socio economic impacts related to drought events in this study we propose a methodology to identify the most suitable drought indices and data sources for monitoring the impact of drought on crops mozambique is used as a case study as it represents a challenging example because of its poor hydroclimatic monitoring network and a lack of disaggregated data for agricultural production a total of seven standardized drought indicators spi spei ssi svci stci svhi and stws at different scales 1 3 6 and 12 months were obtained from global databases and evaluated as possible predictors of the annual variability of agricultural yields at the national level a statistical model of crop yields based on time series was used to measure the explanatory capacity of each index spei and ssi were the most effective at detecting the country s historical drought records regardless of whether nationally averaged values or the percentages of area affected by drought paa were used however paa was found to be a more accurate predictor of variability in crop yields the variability of most cereals maize millet and sorghum was adequately explained by the paa of spei 3 with that of other crops cashew nuts cassava potatoes tea tobacco and vegetables being explained by the paa of ssi 12 specific indicators were proposed for monitoring wheat and sugar cane these results can directly support managers and decision makers in developing drought contingency plans in mozambique to further demonstrate the potential of this methodology it should be tested in other regions with a greater availability of agricultural data including spatial disaggregation keywords drought index drought impacts crop yield statistical model mozambique 1 introduction droughts represent one of the most extensive costly recurrent and complex types of natural disasters worldwide bryant et al 2005 mishra and singh 2010 given that it is related to water availability the agricultural sector is especially sensitive to this natural phenomenon negative impacts like a decrease in quantity and or quality of crops directly affect food security and consequently the quality of life within a region or country backlund et al 2008 such impacts are more perceptible in high drought risk regions e g southern africa and rainfed agriculture systems tigkas et al 2019 droughts are classified into four widely accepted types meteorological agricultural hydrological and socio economic wilhite and glantz 1985 each type is typically characterized and described through drought indices dis hayes et al 2011 several dis have been developed over the last century world meteorological organization and global water partnership 2016 most dis require climatic and or hydrological data with at least 30 years of observation as inputs for a reliable temporal drought analysis whereas at least one data station per 5000 km2 is recommended for spatial analyses aghakouchak et al 2015 in recent decades different institutions have constructed and updated various large scale climate and hydrological data sets e g abatzoglou et al 2018 beck et al 2017a harris et al 2020 thomas et al 2014 these products provide gauge based satellite derived or reanalysis based estimates and can constitute a suitable alternative for calculating dis in data scarce regions e g nashwan et al 2020 though these global products are not without limitations beck et al 2017b sun et al 2018 they have been used in several drought and agriculture related studies worldwide and constitute a reliable data source agutu et al 2017 champagne et al 2019 du et al 2018 garcía león et al 2019 jayanthi et al 2013 lawal et al 2019 potopová et al 2020 rojas et al 2011 drought studies related to agriculture usually use correlation tests and statistical models to explain the relationship between farming yields and drought indicators shi et al 2013 these models can be based on a single point or area time series methods spatial and temporal variations panel methods or solely spatial variations cross section methods lobell and burke 2010 the type of model can be chosen depending on the spatial and temporal detail of the crop yield series shi et al 2013 garcía león et al 2019 and peña gallardo et al 2019a researched the relationships between drought indices and crop yields at the provincial and regional scale in spain using panel methods for the same purpose jayanthi et al 2013 used the time series method in malawi because they only had data on agricultural yields at the national level regardless of the method chosen crop yields are frequently subject to a detrending process to extract the yield trend and remove the variability in productivity caused by non climate factors e g improvements in farming techniques seed hybrid development and irrigation optimization champagne et al 2019 peña gallardo et al 2019b before developing the statistical model the above studies showed that site and crop specific studies are required to identify the most suitable di and data sources for monitoring the impact of drought on crops however there is currently no standard methodology to assess the performance of dis in explaining crop yield variability to fill this research gap in this study we propose a methodological framework to be applied at the national scale comprising three steps first we use global gauge based and satellite derived datasets to calculate several well known dis and validate them with historical drought records in addition to nationally average drought indicator values new aggregated descriptors based on the areas affected by drought are considered to better capture regional variability when working at this scale second we analyze the time variability among dis to identify those that are strongly correlated and potentially provide redundant information then we develop a time series based statistical crop model to predict national yields using dis as predictors building on the above analysis we identify a di or set of dis as well as the data sources to compute them that can be used to monitor crop yields the proposed methodology is applied to mozambique as a case study with an emphasis on determining a climatic drought related explanation of the national crop yield variability the case study is challenging because this country does not currently have an operational measurement network that meets optimum criteria easterling 2013 data on agricultural yields are limited and previous research on drought impacts is scarce however it is also of considerable interest because of the role played by agriculture in the sustainable development in this region and the concerns raised by climate change mozambique is one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world approximately 70 of the population works in agriculture representing 24 of the gdp ministério da agricultura e segurança alimentar 2015 it is also located in one of the most drought and climate change prone areas eriksen and silva 2009 ipcc 2014 osbahr et al 2008 patt and schröter 2008 which increases the vulnerability of its agricultural sector for these reasons this country is immersed in several development programs led by the food and agricultural organization fao midgley et al 2012 and the world food programme wfp wfp 2007 among others aimed at implementing climate change adaptation strategies to enhance the resilience and sustainability of agriculture it is in this context that this work explores the impact of drought on agricultural production in mozambique the overall aim of this study is to develop a methodology of general applicability to identify the most suitable dis and data sources for monitoring the impact of drought on crops at national scale two methodological aspects are worth noting 1 the reliance on freely global scale datasets to obtain a comprehensive set of potential dis and 2 the exploration of alternatives to averaging di values over the entire country that are intended to better capture the local and regional drought conditions when working at such scale the proposed methodology may thus be of special interest in countries with data scarcity where ground data observations are neither sufficient nor timely available for drought monitoring and countries with significant regional variability in drought occurrence where nationally average drought indicator values may conceal regional differences the methodology is tested in mozambique to the knowledge of the authors this is the first study that compares drought indices for an agricultural drought risk assessment in this country this study endeavors to act as a tool for supporting decision makers focusing on the performance of dis in explaining yields and yield variability at the national scale the results can help assess drought related risks to crop production and are ultimately intended to contribute to developing an agricultural drought monitoring system in this country as such we acknowledge the need to reconcile the demands for highly detailed analysis with the extent of the resource requirements infrastructure operational needs etc and data availability 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area mozambique lies in southeast africa fig 1a and covers a continental area of 801 590 km2 the weather system is dominated in the north by the inter tropical convergence zone and in the south by antarctic polar fronts and tropical temperate troughs manhique et al 2011 the climate is tropical with a hot and rainy summer season from november to march and a cool and dry winter season from april to october midgley et al 2012 the annual average temperature varies from 17 8 c to 32 8 c fig 1e and has increased by 1 25 2 0 c in the last 60 years ragab and prudhomme 2002 the annual average precipitation is 1032 mm 75 of which occurs during summertime owing to these conditions the sowing and harvesting season generally extends from november to april rojas et al 2011 farming is one of the main activities in the country 70 of the population depending on subsistence farming with over 80 of the total cultivated area used to produce staple food crops because of the lack of hydraulic infrastructure for irrigation over 95 of this agricultural production is mainly rainfed and without fertilizer consumption fao 2016 the country is prone to drought which has caused temporary food insecurity in the past fao 2016 according to the international disaster database em dat 2019 and the international research institute for climate and society iri hellmuth et al 2007 mozambique has experienced various annual and interannual drought episodes in recent decades in terms of socio economic impacts the most important were the droughts that occurred in 1979 1980 1983 1984 1987 1991 1992 1994 1995 1998 2001 2003 2005 2007 2008 2010 and 2016 2 2 meteorological hydrological and vegetation data the data

affected by droughts the drought indices dis used in this study table 1 rely on the meteorological vegetation condition and hydrological data described in the previous section although several dis exist dai 2011 world meteorological organization and global water partnership 2016 we selected seven widely known dis that have been successfully used in drought and agriculture related investigations agutu et al 2017 sun et al 2012 the standardized precipitation index spi n mckee et al 1993 shows precipitation anomalies with respect to the long average of p considering a window period of n months its computation consists of fitting p time series accumulated at a chosen n months period with a two parameter gamma probability distribution and later standardizing this result the standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index spei n vicente serrano et al 2010 the standardized soil moisture index ssi n hao and aghakouchak 2013 the standardized vegetation condition index svci n the standardized temperature condition index stci n the standardized vegetation health index svhi n and the standardized terrestrial water storage stws n agutu et al 2017 were calculated following the same mathematical procedure as the spi but used the corresponding variables as inputs rather than p the spei n uses the difference between p and etp which is understood as the climatic water balance ssi svci n stci n and svhi n used the sm vci tci and vhi respectively as previously calculated according to kogan 1995 whereas the stws n used the tws the spei n and stws n were fitted to a three parameter log logistic probability distribution following vicente serrano et al 2010 the seven indices were calculated for four temporal accumulations n of 1 3 6 and 12 months considering that farming periods for selected crops are less than one year the indices were evaluated according to the categories explained in table 2 for standardized indexes following the recommendations of mckee et al 1993 we computed the dis time series for each cru cell and then aggregated them into a single national time series for this purpose we averaged the dis values over the entire territory 343 cells weighted by cell area in the country a to obtain a single national monthly time series for each di we also calculated the percentage area affected by droughts paa by considering the intensity thresholds indicated in table 2 we determined the percentage of cells under the different intensity categories using the dis time series for each cell on a monthly scale the annual paa was obtained through aggregating from a monthly to annual series over the calendar year the idea behind the calculation of the paa is to evaluate alternatives to national averaged di values that can better capture in a single value subnational differences in drought conditions the spatial averaging performed for computing the national di values can in some cases hide extreme drought conditions occurring at a more regional scale which is not the case with the paa computation the time span covered by the dis and paa series depended on the availability of main data as indicated in table 1 2 4 crop yield data the country level annual crop yield data y for mozambique was obtained from the fao data portal http www fao org faostat en data qc for the period of 2002 2017 fig 2 crops included maize millet sorghum wheat cashew nuts cassava potatoes sugar cane tea tobacco and vegetables according to kasnakoglu and mayo 2004 this data source represents one of the most credible readily available y dataset because of its monitoring data quality and statistical process more recently agutu et al 2017 used it successfully in a nearby region to characterize agricultural drought crop statistics are not routinely compiled in mozambique at the sub national level e g by agroecological zones or provincial levels the availability of sub national production statistics is in fact very limited in the majority of sub saharan african countries you et al 2009 at present regional yields in mozambique are available for around 8 non consecutive years depending on the specific crop and region from sources like the fao agro maps database http kids fao org agromaps george 2006 or the agricultural statistics yearbooks ministério da agricultura e segurança alimentar 2015 however these data are insufficient to support the type of analysis proposed in this paper and were therefore not considered in this study mozambique has only recently started to improve its farming techniques this could be attributed to the social economic and political issues mozambique has faced in recent decades causing limited developments in agriculture fao 2016 however we decided that it might be necessary to apply a detrending process to the crop data in order to eliminate variations that may result from abiotic factors market prices government policy etc y trends were calculated using the mann kendall mk trend test method mann 1945 millet cashew nuts cassava potatoes sugar cane tobacco and vegetables had positive and significant trends tea showed a negative and non significant trend whereas the other crops had positive and non significant trends the crop yield series were detrended by fitting a linear regression model and extracting the residuals the average crop yield was added to the residual series to produce the detrended yield data the analyses shown in this paper were conducted on the detrended data series and the detrending process was applied only for y with significant trends hereafter detrended crops yield are simply referred as y 2 5 skill assessment and benchmarking of drought indices in the first step of the proposed methodology the performance of the different drought indices for drought detection was analyzed for this purpose the historical drought record from emdat and iri was compared with the time series of the average national dis values and the annual paa for each di the emdat is part of the centre for research on the epidemiology of disasters cred which initiated its active disaster data collection in 1973 guha sapir et al 2015 hence skill assessment was conducted from 1973 to 2017 on a yearly basis in this work a year qualified as a drought year if at least two consecutive months were under moderate drought intensity table 2 according to the dis series this two month criterion allows the exclusion of short droughts which are presumably of minor importance as done in previous studies spinoni et al 2019 in the case of the paa series a drought year was designated if the annual paa value reached 30 although this is an arbitrary threshold the percentage of land impacted by drought is directly related to the number of agricultural households affected and therefore with the drought impact on productivity rojas et al 2011 the performance metrics used were the probability of detection pod or hit rate and the probability of false detection pofd or false alarm rate computed according to wilks 2006 1 p o d 100 h h m 2 p o f d 100 f a c n f a where h are hits m misses fa are false alarms and cn are correct negatives h represents the coincidence of drought of both series historical records and dis paa series and m corresponds to the presence of a drought in the records and the absence of this event in the dis paa series fa occurs if there is no drought in the records but one occurs in the dis paa series and finally cn represents the years in which there is no drought in both series the euclidean distance between the point x1 pofd y1 pod of each di and paa series and the point with the best possible performance x2 pofd 0 y2 pod 100 was used to benchmark performance shorter distances thus indicated better performance a correlation analysis between the dis series was performed in the second step of the methodology we calculated the pearson correlation coefficients between all monthly dis series averaged at the country scale the correlation coefficients were analyzed to assess if the information provided by the different dis was redundant 2 6 statistical crop yield model in the third step of the methodology we developed a statistical crop yield model for mozambique by assuming that y was the response of a function of k independent variables x which in this context included the dis and paa as possible predictors given y 0 and following shi et al 2013 an exponential time series model was adopted as follows 3 ln y t f x t 1 x t 2 x t k β 0 j 1 k β j x t j ε t where y is the vector of annual crop yields fig 2 t is the year x represents the vector with the candidate predictors β j are the constant coefficients and ε the error both single and multiple candidate predictors are considered to develop the models eq 3 transforms in a simple linear regression model with one explanatory variable or in a multiple linear regression respectively the times series considered as candidate predictors for the models are 1 the national average dis of all months of the year january to december 2 the annual national average dis 3 the annual average paa under a certain intensity category moderate severe or extreme the multiple linear regression models use the annual average paa under the three aforementioned intensity categories as candidate predictors i e three independent variables fig 3 summarizes the steps in a methodological flow chart 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison with historical drought records the temporal patterns of the national averaged dis series are plotted in fig 4 each di detected several droughts of different intensity categories moderate green severe orange and extreme red the longer the temporal accumulation n for each di is the later the dry periods are detected and they are also less frequent this result can be explained by the time scale of the di and the drought propagation through the hydrological cycle the historical droughts of 1987 1991 1992 1994 1995 2005 and 2016 were the main drought events detected by the majority of dis according to the di linked to soil moisture ssi an extreme intensity was reached in up to four of these events the dis related to vegetation conditions svci stci and svhi also classified the 1991 1992 event as extreme the remaining dis spi spei and stws distinguished several drought events including the five named above but the intensities were lower moderate and severe in these dis extreme intensities were completely smoothed out by the spatial averaging process stci n and stws n indicated drought conditions in mozambique between 12 0 and 14 1 during the analyzed period spi n and svci n reported the shortest time under drought conditions less than 7 2 when the extreme drought threshold was considered scvi n indicated that such conditions were present less than 2 1 of the time whereas less than 0 4 of the time was classified in this intensity category according to spi n similar to the dis time series observations the historical droughts in 1987 1991 1992 1994 1995 2005 and 2016 were the events that were most clearly detected by majority of the paa series these drought periods have also been highlighted in previous studies brida and owiyo 2013 jayanthi et al 2013 trambauer et al 2014 in these significant events the total area affected by drought and its distribution in intensity categories differed between dis in 1992 up to 74 of the mozambican territory was below the moderate drought threshold and 53 reached the extreme intensity according to spei 12 in 2016 stws 6 showed that 90 of the country was facing a moderate drought 5 of which corresponded to an extreme intensity however spei 12 indicated a paa greater than 20 in the extreme category to benchmark the capacity of detection of historical drought events by the different indices the pod and pofd metrics were computed as described in section 2 5 table 3 shows the skill assessment of the national averaged dis series and paa series according to the distance d to the point with the best possible performance the rankings of dis according to their performances were quite similar for both series dis and paa in both cases the best performance was obtained by spei 3 and spei 6 with more than 50 of pod and with pofd ranging from 7 to 26 similar performances were obtained with these two indices when considering thresholds for drought detection between 20 and 35 of the annual paa value demonstrating that the indexes are robust with respect to slight variations in the definition of a drought year these results are consistent with previous studies that found that emdat drought disasters were best matched with severe droughts identified using meteorological dis for mid high temporal accumulations united nations 2009 the worst detection performance was provided by the dis related to vegetation conditions svhi and svci nonetheless all the dis detected the most important drought events because they affected the entire hydrological cycle the national averaged dis series are likely missing some climatic hydrological or vegetative information of specific regions within the country for example drought conditions that affect an area of the country might be concealed by wet conditions in another region this is not the case for the paa series which a priori makes them a better option for working at a national scale however both the dis and the paa series showed a similar detection capability of historical records overall the meteorological indices spei and spi most closely matched the historical records however none of the dis were able to perfectly capture all the drought periods collected from historical records i e pod lower than 100 and they identified drought conditions outside the drought years recorded in the historical disaster databases i e pofd greater than 0 this may be attributed to the following reasons on the one hand unrelated circumstances might have worsened the consequences of what would otherwise be considered as a mild drought being recorded as drought year in the records for example a other natural disasters occurring between dry periods such as the heavy floods in 1981 and 1985 and between 2000 and 2001 brida and owiyo 2013 midgley et al 2012 patt and schröter 2008 b civil war and conflicts such as the conflict from 1982 to 1984 against zimbabwe hellmuth et al 2007 c epidemics such as the cholera outbreak in 1983 1984 eriksen and silva 2009 or d food security crises as in the 2001 2005 period fao 2006 on the other hand the drought events in mozambique were reported at the national level even if they occurred only in a specific region of the country therefore the national dis series obtained after averaging at national level and the paa may not adequately reflect regional information 3 2 correlation between drought indices the occurrence intensity and duration of drought periods in mozambique showed some variability between the different dis in this step we compared the drought variation patterns between each di fig 5 shows the pearson coefficients between the dis time series the strongest correlations are painted blue and non significant ρ 0 05 correlations are denoted as struck through overall the strongest correlations were found between the indices associated with meteorological variables spi and spei and between those related to soil moisture ssi these were followed by those associated with soil conditions and temperature stci and svhi in general a di with a temporal accumulation of 1 month had a very high or nearly perfect correlation with the same di at a 3 month scale the same was observed between the temporal aggregations of 3 and 6 months and between 6 and 12 months the indexes associated with the vegetation condition albeit without meteorological variables such as temperature in their calculation svci as well as stws exhibited considerably different variabilities from the rest of dis with low correlation values these two dis also had the most non significant correlations with other dis the svci is an index that indicates the condition of the vegetation and thus can reflect other factors external to the climate e g irrigation forestation and afforestation stws on the other hand characterizes the total availability of surface and underground water so its variation depends on the complete hydrological process of the area and not solely on one or two climatological parameters the lowest correlations were found for the highest temporal accumulation swt 12 which could be related to multiannual droughts not analyzed in this paper the results of the correlation analyses are consistent with the physical meaning of the different dis although there is a time lag between the meteorological forcing and the hydrological responses dis based on meteorological variables with 6 and 12 month accumulations showed strong correlations with dis based on vegetation hydrological data the results suggest that only one of these meteorological dis spi and spei with n 6 and n 12 months could be used alone in any subsequent analysis as they provided very similar information and had high correlations with other dis scvi may be used but considering that it does not have an important correlation with hydroclimatic indicators it should be used in conjunction with another di 3 3 explanation of crop yield variability because of the close relationship between y and drought conditions especially in areas with little hydraulic infrastructure such as mozambique non irrigated agriculture a time series statistical model was proposed to find the di that better explains the annual yield variability of the 11 selected crops as explained in section 2 6 the candidate predictors were the averaged national dis of each month jan to dec the annual averaged national dis annual the annual paa at moderate a mod severe a sev and extreme a ext intensities and the sum of the annual paa at moderate severe and extreme intensities a sum totaling 17 time estimates for each di because 28 dis were analyzed this created a total of 17 28 476 candidate predictors for each type of crop fig s1 supplementary materials shows all r2 values of the statistical model results for each crop the crop types are represented on the y axis and the candidate predictors are on the x axis the strongest positive correlations are plotted as red many of the estimates were non significant p 0 05 the main reason for such low coefficients has already been mentioned there are no regional data on crops droughts can however affect specific regions of the country that contribute little to the overall national yield the use of national aggregated estimates in these cases means that we are searching for correlations between droughts affecting one area of the country and yields produced in others it is also worth noting that this study is focused on rainfed agriculture but some crops e g vegetables or sugar cane might be irrigated in some areas adding noise to the yield data mozambique is thus a highly complex scenario area based analysis in countries where disaggregated data are available will certainly improve the results however if a certain number of indicators containing reasonable correlations with crops are determined this can act as a valuable tool for decision makers who currently do not have objective data to guide their policies as more data become available the same methodology can be applied to improve drought monitoring the best candidate predictors of y were different for each crop this is because not all crops are equally sensitive to drought nor do they have the same water harvesting or storage capacities in general the best predictors were those based on the paa and related to agricultural and hydrological droughts being predictors that incorporate spatial information below the national level they showed a better relationship with y than national indicators that lost spatial information in their computation again we note that introducing spatial disaggregation improved the results if in addition to incorporating spatial information from the dis data for the evolution of crops by area were available the results would be much more accurate considering that some of the indicators had high correlations between themselves which meant that their spatial temporal drought patterns were similar the determination coefficients resulting from the proposed model were understandably similar between themselves for example spi 6 and spei 3 best explained the variability of the sorghum with r2 values of 0 70 and 0 67 respectively with a correlation of 0 70 between them to limit the number of indicators the predictive capacities between these two dis can be considered highly similar spei 3 can ultimately be chosen as it also provides reasonable results in other crops such as millet and maize thus the proposal of indicators should be compacted to a minimum number that can explain the variability of the 11 crops fig s1 supplementary materials allows for an analysis of which di reasonably explains the evolution of each of the crops of the 11 crops analyzed 8 of them showed a high correlation with 2 predictor candidates spei 3 a sum reasonably explained the evolution of cereals maize millet and sorghum and ssi 12 a sum explained the rest of the crops cashew nuts cassava potatoes tea tobacco and vegetables fig 6 this suggests that dis that consider not solely precipitation but soil moisture conditions either directly or indirectly can provide a better assessment of the potential impacts on agricultural production the differences in the phenological characteristics and the cultivation period of the studied crops can justify the need for considering different dis spei and ssi at both short and long timescales 3 months and 12 months the variability of the cereal yields is typically best explained by short term meteorological di chen et al 2016 peña gallardo et al 2019a whereas other crops such as tubers and vegetables respond to soil moisture drought conditions at a longer timescale daryanto et al 2016 sorensen 2005 it should also be noted that the choice of a limited set of indices for the sake of simplicity and operational use comes at the cost of more difficult physical interpretation of the results there were some crops that did not neatly fit into these general trends wheat also responded well to spei as did all other cereals but spei 6 aug presented a much better fit than spei 3 a sum used for all other cereals thus the former predictor stands out one possible reason may be a widespread or uniform distribution of wheat crops where the zoning provided by paa based indicators does not offer an added value this is however a hypothesis as disaggregated data are not available the last peculiarity is that of sugar cane this crop had acceptable correlations with other indicators so it could have been included within the general block however sugar cane also had an excellent correlation with the svci 6 a sum indicator as demonstrated in fig 6 so the best fit di was selected in this case it is difficult to estimate the reason for the adjustment although lisboa et al 2018 highlighted the good strong predictive capacity of sugarcane yields using ndvi data the modeled and measured y are compared for all crops in fig 6 the lack of spatially detailed agricultural data made mozambique a difficult place to find relationships between y and dis nevertheless the method applied here discovered relationships that adequately explained the variance of y for some crops proving that it can be used in other regions or countries however as these are national approximations for a considerable territory these results should be considered with care 4 concluding remarks the aim of this research was to test a methodology that could evaluate various drought indices as tools for monitoring drought and to test their ability to explain the annual variability of crop yields the case study was carried out for mozambique which was especially challenging given its poor monitoring system and lack of local regional data on crop yields thus data from global databases and national agricultural data were used the proposed indicators successfully detected the main drought events from 1973 to 2017 according to historical records and accurately noted their duration and intensity the spei and ssi indicators had the best capacity to detect historical droughts through using both nationally averaged time series and the paa variability in crop yields was associated with agricultural and hydrological droughts this variability was explained for the majority of crops using two generic indicators spei 3 a sum explained the performance of various cereal crops maize millet and sorghum whereas ssi 12 a sum correlated well with several other crops cashew nuts cassava potatoes tea tobacco and vegetables some specific indicators were proposed for two specific crops spei 6 of august wheat and svci 6 sum sugar cane spei and ssi also offered the best results in terms of their ability to explain historical drought events in addition because the state level agricultural data were used the annual area affected by drought paa used in both spei 3 a sum and ssi 12 a sum explained the variance of agricultural yields more effectively than the national level drought indicators in summary the proposed methodology allowed us to confirm the use of these drought indicators in their different temporal accumulations as a tool to monitor and characterize droughts and model the annual yields of specific crops in mozambique this methodology should be tested in other regions with a greater availability of agricultural data including spatial disaggregation these results can be used as a support mechanism by managers and decision makers for drought contingency plans in mozambique however there is a need to deepen the analysis of droughts in this country at the regional level to provide an improved basis for drought management at the local level declaration of

10229,holding proper ratio between groundwater extraction and surface water allocation in conjunctive use of water resources may be a desirable way for simultaneously controlling the aquifer sustainability and meeting the increasing agricultural water demands this paper focuses on maximizing the agricultural net benefits nb while avoiding the vital groundwater resources to excessively withdraw when utilized to supply the water demands and provide desirable net benefits for this purpose the gravitational search algorithm gsa is employed as the optimizer and linked to the artificial neural network ann as the simulator of the groundwater level gwl variations the study area is the west of the irrigation network of qazvin plain in iran this area is divided into two zones low gwl drawdown zone zone 1 and high gwl drawdown zone zone 2 for each zone nine scenarios are defined considering three climatic years each of which is assigned three different crop patterns totally resulting in 18 scenarios the results show that the simulation optimization models can decrease the groundwater drawdown in all scenarios by 0 77 1 84 m in zone 1 and by 1 28 1 97 m in zone 2

irrigation conjunctive use 1 introduction conjunctive management of surface and ground water resources in agriculture requires revisiting strategies implemented in water resources allocation spatial and temporal management of water supply and demand and annual water delivery planning furthermore defining a suitable crop pattern to simultaneously be in accordance with the interests of the farmers and the sustainability of the environment may cause the conjunctive use goals to be fulfilled this kind of management may have a great role in reducing water consumption improving the aquifer conditions and controlling the costs of extraction regulation and transfer of the water in this field extensive studies have been done some of which are briefly referred here for solving the conjunctive water use optimization problem several techniques have been suggested generally the techniques offering proper solutions include linear programming lp nonlinear programming nlp dynamic programming dp as well as the meta heuristic algorithms using linear and nonlinear methods in complex problems may bring about several problems the disadvantages of these methods include the dependency of them on the gradient search techniques in which the simplicity of the gradient calculations causes major errors in complex projects increased number of combinations creating computational problems and the curse of dimensionality are among the weaknesses the dynamic programming models suffer from meta heuristic algorithms are nature inspired algorithms not easily trapped in local optima and do not require the objective functions to be continuous and smooth in their domain also these algorithms can solve a variety of nonlinear and non convex problems exposing these methods as very flexible easy to implement and computationally efficient techniques to solve a wide range of optimization problems 1 1 optimization models studies montazar et al 2010 used a linear programming model for allocating surface and groundwater aiming at increasing benefits and groundwater extraction control in ten scenarios considering the deficit irrigation in qazvin plain in iran their results showed that deficit irrigation can improve aquifer sustainability and increase the benefits from the agricultural activities karamouz et al 2010 utilized a genetic algorithm for optimizing the conjunctive use in varamin plain in iran in addition to providing a suitable crop pattern this model estimated 15 year monthly time series demands and surface and ground water allocation volumes delavar et al 2012 applied a real time modeling approach for water allocation in an irrigation system this model employed the neural networks and the optimization modules to determine the surface water allocations considering the growing stages and sensitivity to water stress at different stages this model was able to reduce the water losses from 42 to 12 lalehzari et al 2016 employed a multi objective non dominated storing genetic algorithm type ii nsga ii to maximize net benefits and the water use efficiency regulwar and pradhan 2013 used a linear membership function to fuzzify the objective function and the decision variables including the cultivated area surface and ground water volumes to maximize the benefits wu et al 2016 used an integrated coupled groundwater and surface water flow model gsflow as the optimizer of the conjunctive water use and a surrogate based simulation model named dycors dynamic coordinate search using responses surface models li et al 2016 developed a bi objective model under fuzzy uncertainty for determining the irrigation water allocation with different flow levels in china results showed the feasibility and applicability of this model for implementation in agriculture with high efficiency in water saving safavi and falsafioun 2017 used the ga algorithm for conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources under deficit irrigation for a 5 year irrigation plan and compared the results of the employed model with those observed in the actual operation results indicated that water consumption could be reduced by 24 million cubic meters while the net benefits return could be decreased by 22 yousefi et al 2018 solved a tri objective optimization problem aiming at maximizing net benefits reducing nitrogen leaching and improving the aquifer sustainability using multi objective particle swarm optimization mopso in varamin network irrigation 1 2 simulation optimization models studies in recent years some studies are conducted to solve the conjunctive use problems utilizing the linked simulation optimization models karamouz et al 2004 suggested a method combining the genetic algorithm ga with the artificial neural networks ann to maximize the water supply and control the variations of the groundwater level in the south of tehran iran safavi et al 2010 linked ga with ann to minimize shortages of irrigation water in dry periods for three irrigation scenarios concerning the limitation in groundwater extraction safavi and esmikhani 2013 used the support vector machines svms as the simulation model for estimating the groundwater level variations in koohpayeh plain in isfahan iran thereafter they linked the simulator with ga as the optimization model heydari et al 2016 employed a simulation optimization model for minimizing the groundwater quality variations amid considering the economic goals safavi and enteshari 2016 applied a simulation optimization model based on ann as the simulator and the ant system as optimizer their results showed that the developed model can determine water exploitation volumes which not only decrease the water deficits but also improve aquifer conditions rezaei et al 2017a introduced a new algorithm named fuzzy multi objective particle swarm optimization f mopso they linked this model with a simulation model and applied the resulting model to a 10 year long term period in the zayanderoud network in isfahan iran the outcomes of this study were revealed to be better than a couple of other well known mopsos rezaei et al 2017b developed the tri objective version of the f mopso to design an optimal multi crop pattern plan over a long term simulation period considering economic environmental issues necessary to be addressed in any water resources management scheme milan et al 2018 used modflow code as the simulation model and a linear fuzzy programming model as the optimizer sepahvand et al 2019 used a genetic programming gp method for simulating the surface water groundwater interactions they linked this simulation model to a multi objective genetic algorithm moga as the optimization model they conclude that using this linked model the net agricultural benefits increase in different climatic conditions the gravitational search algorithm gsa was first introduced as a physics based meta heuristic algorithm by rashedi et al 2009 it is based on newton s law of gravity the main unique contributions of the gsa to the field of the optimization may be listed below 1 in the gsa each search agent observes the performance of a variety of other agents and tends to move towards them with different accelerations 2 in the gsa the best search agents attract the other ones with the accelerations directly proportional to the best agents fitness and inversely proportional to the distance from them in this way the more the fitness of a certain agent the more the attractive power of that agent moreover the more the distance between a certain agent and the other agents the less the attractive power of that certain agent these regulations could accelerate the less diversified agents movements towards the fitted agents and speeding up the convergence on the one hand and de accelerate the more diversified agents movements towards the fitted ones on the other hand since the diversified search agents should maintain their position in the search space to enhance their exploration capability these settings are quite justified as a result the exploration capability of the gsa is much stronger and more efficient than a series of the other meta heuristics mainly due to retarding the diversified search agents movements toward the guide agents to enforce the diversity to be toughly preserved in the search space this strength point of the gsa may however make the algorithm be trapped in local optima especially when the optimization problem is so large scale and high dimensional nevertheless for a moderate dimensional problem the exploration capability of this algorithm may be taken into account as a competitive and completely advantageous feature the gsa offers as compared to the other meta heuristics 3 selecting the best fitted elite agents at each of the iterations to lead the other agents could activate the elitism mechanism in the gsa furthermore the number of these elite agents is decreasing by lapse of iterations to hold a proper balance between the exploration and the exploitation 4 the gsa is a memory less meta heuristic algorithm helping mitigate the computational cost of the algorithm as compared to the similar competitive meta heuristics 5 the gsa gives a random number to each dimension of the search agents when being updated making this algorithm an entirely stochastic search algorithm here a number of gsa applications in the field of the water resources management are highlighted moeini et al 2017 used the constrained gsa for optimizing the hydropower operation of dez reservoir iran the other studies of gsa applied this algorithm in other fields of science asmadi et al 2014 attempted to validate the performance of the gsa algorithm for the optimization of the water releases from a reservoir in malaysia asmadi et al 2016 compared artificial bee algorithm with the gsa algorithm when applying them to optimally solve a reservoir operation problem aimed to minimize the deficit in the releases for irrigation purposes fallah et al 2019 used the gsa algorithm for the optimal design of water distribution networks to achieve an optimal size of pipes karami et al 2019 applied a hybrid algorithm linking gsa to particle swarm optimization pso algorithm for minimizing irrigation deficits in a multi reservoir system the results revealed that the performance of the hybrid algorithm is promising 1 3 the present study and the organization of the paper in the water resources management problems there is always a contradiction between the economic benefits and the environmental benefits this contrast could show itself both in how to allocate the water resources and how to set the water demands especially in an agricultural area holding a nice balance between these two aspects of the water resources to gain the maximum benefits from the management practices could provide the sustainability for the environmental resources while not disrupting the livelihood of the people involved in the operation of the water resources this paper focuses on presenting an optimal water allocation policy to irrigate an agricultural area this policy is on the one hand set with regard to the crop sensitivity to the deficit irrigation such that less water is allocated to the more sensitive periods and the more water is allocated to the less sensitive periods on the other hand the crop pattern is also modified based on this policy to diminish the water demands of the crops as much as possible to be adjusted to the deficit water allocated to the crops in this way not only the water demands are better met contributing the water productivity and thus the net benefits to be maximized but also the water resources especially the groundwater are saved to hold the aquifer sustainability for the exploitation at the future among the innovations of the approach followed in this paper some points may be mentioned as follows 1 there are three different types for the crop patterns studied in this paper which differ not only in the area assigned to the crops but also in the crop combination 2 considering three climatic conditions and dividing the aquifer covered by the study area into two low drawdown and high drawdown zones and setting the bounds defined for the groundwater level variations as adjusted to the nature of these two zones 3 defining 18 different management scenarios to enable the model to offer the best operating policy for each of these scenarios and 4 utilizing the gsa as its first application to optimize the conjunctive water use in practice these innovations are all the new practices in the field of conjunctive water use management not conducted in the previous studies some of which are reviewed in this paper in section 2 the characteristics of the study area are presented in section 3 the methodology is described in different steps including introducing the gravitational search algorithm defining the formulae of the optimization model defining a trained artificial neural network as a surface water groundwater simulation model defining the three crop pattern distributions and the simulation and optimization model preparations in section 4 the results of the groundwater level variations crop patterns achieved net benefits and the water allocation policy as a result of running 18 different scenarios are presented section 5 provides some discussions over the results and finally section 6 concludes the paper 2 case study the west of irrigation network of qazvin winq plain in iran is adopted as the study area this network consists of one reservoir dam taleghan a conveying tunnel and an extensive irrigation system including the main canal and 13 secondary canals canal ii the system also has lateral canals iii and canals iv this network was located between 35 24 n to 36 48 n latitude and 48 45 e to 50 51 e longitude the climate of the region is arid and semi arid with average annual precipitation equal to 312 mm the mean annual temperature is 14 4 c the precipitation distribution is severely non uniform in time and space resulting in water shortage in arid seasons the whole area is estimated to cover 35 000 ha of which net irrigated area is 23 000 ha consisting of 8200 ha of fallow and 14 800 ha of cultivated area the area of orchards is about 700 ha the area located at the west of the irrigation network includes the main canal and 5 secondary canals canal ii the characteristics of the network designed for the qazvin irrigation command area are presented in table 1 according to the common network operation regulations the average efficiency of the water transmission from the head of the main canal to the beginning of the canal iii is 75 and in the corresponding efficiency for the canals of types iii and iv is 80 furthermore the efficiency of water use on farms is 50 thus the total efficiency from the head of canal iii to its ending is 40 surface water resources are not sufficient to meet the irrigation demands of crops and the water shortages are covered by the groundwater extraction included in the governmental integrated wells and the private agricultural wells the main reason for choosing this area as the case study is the large withdrawal of the groundwater level in the recent years resulting from less surface water allocation in the west of the network compared to its east there are 116 wells owned by the network and 30 wells that are consolidated in the region the efficiency for the transmission of the groundwater from each well is 80 and the efficiency of the water use in the farms is 50 thus the total efficiency for each well is adopted as 40 a scheme of the groundwater level lines and their annual variations from october 2002 to october 2019 show that the groundwater level in the study area has drastically declined by 35 7 m in just 17 years the existing crop pattern includes the fall crops such as wheat and barley and summer crops such as sugar beet tomato corn maize fodder maize beans peas potato and alfalfa there are also grapes apples and several other fruits growing in the orchards fig 1 shows the position of the study area including the main canals and secondary canals and their branches fig 2 describes a typical crop calendar including the main crops cultivated in the qazvin irrigation network 3 methodology 3 1 gravitational search algorithm in the gravitational search algorithm the concepts of mass newton s gravitational force and newton s gravitational law are utilized in this algorithm candidate solutions are a set of objects being affected by the gravitational force and are frequently changing their positions based on their masses and the distances to other objects solutions generally the better the fitness of an object the greater the mass of that object will be the gsa does the optimization process in two major steps first step the formation of the system defining the laws and setting the parameters involved in this algorithm the space of the system encompasses a set of n objects each of which has a mass each object also has a position in the search space the position of the mass i in the dimension d is denoted by x i d considering all m dimensions of the search space the position vector of the object i can be represented by x i as shown in eq 1 1 x i x i

formulation the main objective of the model developed in this paper is to maximize the agricultural net benefits in the conjunctive use of surface and ground water resources this objective is subject to several constraints depicted as follows 1 to meet the market requirements and also the farmers own needs for the food products they grow within their agricultural activities the cultivated area assigned to each crop is assumed to be greater than the half of the existing area of that crop as the minimum area assigned to that crop furthermore the total cultivated area is set not to exceed the total existing cultivated area as the potential cultivable area in the agricultural region 16 a jk t 0 5 a jk 17 j 1 j a jk t a k a jk t is the cultivated area assigned to the crop j in zone k in water year t normal wet or dry year a jk is the existing area of the crop j in zone k a k is the total existing cultivated area in zone k 2 the surface water allocation and the groundwater extraction volumes are in turn bounded to the historical monthly minimum and maximum volume exploited and allocated to each region as the eqs 18 and 19 suggest 18 min sw ik sw ik max sw i k 19 min gw ik gw ik max gw ik where min sw ik and max sw ik are respectively the minimum and maximum of the surface water allocated to zone k in the month i in the head in a long term 17 year period moreover min gw ik and max gw ik are respectively the minimum and maximum volume of the groundwater extracted from zone k in the month i in a long term 17 year period sw ik and gw ik are respectively the volume of surface water and groundwater allocated to zone k in the month i 3 the annual total surface water allocation volume is also assumed not to exceed the existing total annual allocation in the respective water year this constraint could meet the special climatic conditions of each water year when dealt with in a separate scenario 20 i 1 12 sw ik sw k sw ik is the surface water allocated in the month i and zone k and sw k is the annual total surface water allocated in a given water year in zone k 4 the annual cumulative groundwater level drawdown is assumed not to exceed a maximum allowable bound being set depending on the given water year and a given region and based on the availability of the surface water and groundwater in that water year and that region 21 i 1 12 drop ik drop k drop ik is the groundwater level drawdown in the month i in zone k and drop k is the upper bound assumed for the annual total groundwater level drawdown in zone k in a given year and a given region 5 as recommended by the agricultural organization for this network the portion of the area out of the total cultivable area for the fall crops should be 50 this portion should also be 15 for the summer crops and should be 35 for the fallow however we aim at spanning a widened range for the crops cultivated area to impart the model flexibility to set the optimal areas for the crops these ranges are set to be 45 50 for the fall crops and 15 20 for the summer crops in this way the total cultivated area is set to 65 while 35 of the total area is left as the fallow area this constraint is met via eq 22 22 p 1 p a pk 0 30 q 1 q a qk i 1 2 3 p j 1 2 3 q where a pk is the area of fall crops a qk is the area of the summer crop p is the number of fall crops and q is the number of summer crops 6 the annual total demands of the crops should be greater than or equal to the water supplied by the surface and ground water resources in the study area 23 i 1 12 j 1 n d ijk a z b z i 1 12 sup ik 24 sup ik sw ik gw ik where i is the indicator of the month j is the indicator of the crop n is the number of crops sup ik is the gross water volume supplying zone k in month i d ijk is the water demand of crop j in the month i and zone k a z is farm water use efficiency set to be 0 50 here b z is water use efficiency in the channels set to be 0 80 here sw ik is the net surface water allocated to zone k in month i gw ik is the net groundwater allocated to zone k in the month i the main goal of the optimization model could be formulated as follows 25 maximize z i 1 n p i y a i c i a i n is the number of main crops in the region z is the net benefit p i is the selling price of each crop in rial kg c i is the cost of crop production in rial ha a i is the area of each crop and y a i is the actual yield of the crop i per unit cultivated area in kg ha over the whole planning period or the given water year tafteh et al 2013 proposed the following formula to calculate the relative yield of crops in qazvin plain as the case study of this paper as follows 26 y a y m i 1 n 1 k yi 1 et a i et m i k yi i 1 n k yi where y a is the actual yield of a given crop per unit cultivated area calculated for all the crops included in the crop patterns adopted in this study kg ha y m is the maximum yield of a given crop per unit cultivated area achieved upon its water requirement is fully met kg ha et a i is the actual evapotranspiration in the growth stage i mm et m i is the potential evapotranspiration in the growth stage i mm k yi is the yield response factor in the growth stage i and n is the number of growth stages of a given crop the amounts of the yield response factors for the main crops involved in the crop patterns existing in the qazvin plain is shown in table 2 tafteh et al 2014 deficit irrigation means that the water resources mobilized to supply the water demands are reduced while the crop water demands are also decreased as long as the demand percentage met would be at a desirable level to help enhance the crop yields and thus the net benefits thereafter the crop yield response factor which is also known as the crop sensitivity to the deficit irrigation should be addressed to better maximize the yields and the benefits as the main goal of the agricultural activities such that the more the yield response factor in a period the more water demands should be reduced in that period and the less the yield response factor in a period the less water demands should be decreased in that period furthermore the process of reduction of the water demands is carried out through well setting the crops in an optimal crop pattern such that the more area is assigned to the less water demanding crops and the less area is allocated to the more water demanding crops this procedure is going well when the total cultivated area of the crops remains at a constant range otherwise it is clear that by increasing the total area the total water demands are also increased and degrade the quality of the optimal crop pattern this is why we considered an upper bound for the total cultivated area in a water year underpinned by the explanations here we aim at performing the deficit irrigation in this study and optimally designing a crop pattern to be most adapted to the deficit irrigation in this way not only the net benefit is reached at a desirable level but also the allocation of the water resources especially the groundwater is reduced to cause the aquifer to be more sustainable 3 3 artificial neural network ann in this paper an artificial neural network ann is used to simulate the groundwater level variations as the state variables included in the objective function evaluations of the optimization model the ann code is derived and implemented in the matlab environment several monthly available data sets each of which is consisting of the time series of input data in a 17 year historical period are collected and inserted into the ann model in the training process the total number of input data is equal to 204 the input data encompasses a set of affecting parameters on the groundwater level variations including evapotranspiration temperature precipitation surface water allocation with different time lags up to 2 months groundwater extraction the difference between the discharge in the inflow and outflow points of the river running in the study area recharging the aquifer with different time lags up to 1 month and finally the initial depth to the groundwater table level at each month furthermore output of the ann is the groundwater level variations whose value is positive in the case of water rise and is negative in the case of water drawdown an amount of 70 of the data sets is used for training 20 is allocated to test and 10 is put aside for validation the ann is a 17 5 1 network including 5 neurons in the hidden layer to evaluate the performance of each network two statistical criteria are used 1 the root mean square error rmse and 2 the coefficient of correlation r these criteria can be mathematically formulated as follows 27 rmse i 1 n y i y ci 2 n 28 r i 1 n y ci y ave ci y i y ave i i 1 n y ci y ave ci 2 i 1 n y i y ave i 2 where y i is the observed value for the ith output y ci is the computed simulated value for the ith output y ave i is the average of the observed values of the outputs y ave ci is the average of computed simulated values of the outputs and n is the number of the data sets used at each stage to create the ann structure the best network may have been created upon achieving rmse 0 and r 1 3 4 zoning the study area and crop pattern distributions investigating the drought indices calculated in the forms of the standardized precipitation index spi method over a long term 2007 2012 time period in the study area the water year 2009 2010 was considered as the indicator of a wet year moreover the water year 2007 2008 was identified as the indicator of a dry year and the water year 2008 2009 was recognized as the indicator of a normal year investigating the groundwater level variations map during 2007 2012 reveals that the groundwater level within the western boundary of the qazvin irrigation network is declined by 0 17 m the graph of the monthly groundwater level variations in the two zones is shown in fig 3 according to the iso drop map 5 year iso drop lines depicted for the whole study area in fig 4 two zones are selected as the zones having unique characteristics to be focused on in the simulation optimization model calculations these two zones are mainly characterized as follows zone 1 area with lower groundwater drawdown annual average cumulative drawdown to be less than 2 2 m included in the northwestern part of the network zone 2 area with higher groundwater drawdown annual average cumulative drawdown to be more than 2 2 m included in the southwestern part of the network each zone is independently handled by the simulation optimization model there are also three crop patterns defined for each zone as shown in detail in table 3 considering three climatic conditions including wet normal and dry climates for each crop pattern there would be 2 3 3 namely 18 different scenarios defined for the whole study area to be handled in the optimal conjunctive water use problem solved in this paper decision variables include 28 items 12 monthly surface water allocated volumes 12 monthly groundwater extraction volumes and 4 cultivated areas for the existing crop pattern and include 29 items 12 monthly surface water allocated volumes 12 groundwater extraction volumes and 5 cultivation area for the crop pattern i and includes 31 items 12 monthly surface water allocated volumes 12 groundwater extraction volumes and 7 cultivation area for the crop pattern ii the water demand of the selected crops included in these three crop patterns is also calculated separately for each climatic year potential evapotranspiration is calculated from qazvin synoptic station data using the modified fao penman monteith method calculated by the cropwat 8 0 is one of its default methods to evaluate the crop water requirements the composition of the gardens in the area is preserved and their water demands are assumed to be fully met by the water resources the components of the crop patterns studied in the area are shown in table 4 in the crop patterns i and ii a range of 45 50 of the area is allocated to the fall crops a range of 15 20 of the area is assigned to the summer crops and 35 of the total area remains as fallow the existing crop pattern is delineated based upon the current preferences of the agricultural authorities implemented in the study area the range of the areas assigned to the wheat barley alfalfa and tomato is assumed to be 50 100 of the existing area of the relevant crops the existing area assigned to the other crops is low thus their existing areas are assumed to be the same as the existing amounts in the newly proposed crop patterns i and ii 3 5 simulation models preparation the results of the ann simulation model are summarized in table 5 the ann is simulating the existing data sets over a 17 year long term period that covers all climatic conditions including wet normal and dry years the regression charts for ann simulation models are shown in figs 5 and 6 3 6 optimization models preparation the gsa model was used to optimize maximize the net benefits through which the optimal areas of the dominant crops as well as the optimal monthly volumes of the surface and ground water resources allocation could be determined the gsa algorithm was performed considering 100 search agents and 1000 iterations in each run as mentioned before nine scenarios were defined for each of the two regions including a low gwl drawdown zone and a high gwl drawdown zone totally forming 18 scenarios for each water year and in all scenarios a maximum groundwater level drawdown was considered and imposed on the model as the substantial constraints to sustain the aquifer these upper bound values are set to be equal for all crop patterns and decided to only be dependent on the zones of study as well as the climatic conditions of a certain planning period water year these upper bounds can be seen in table 6 it is worthwhile mentioning that all codes were run in the matlab environment on a core i5 computer with 2 8 3 1 ghz cpu and 8 gb of memory also the running of the linked simulation optimization model coded for each scenario took about 150 min in every single run 4 results 4 1 optimal crop patterns the details of the crop patterns in two zones are shown in tables 7 and 8 the results are discussed in detail in the following sections for all scenarios 65 of the area is assumed to be cultivated and 35 is deemed to remain fallow furthermore in both crop patterns i and ii 45 50 of the total cultivated area is assigned to fall crops while 15 20 is allocated to summer crops due to the high cultivation portion of wheat in the current crop pattern of the region for all crop patterns and in all scenarios implemented on the zone 1 and zone 2 the interval defined for the cultivation percentage of this crop is set to be higher than those of other crops in the existing crop pattern the area cultivated by each crop is bounded based upon the current climatic conditions the prevailing crop supply and demand situations and the long term farmers experiences in the agricultural activities in the region whereas the economic advantages and disadvantages and or water requirement play a lesser role in crop selection accordingly alfalfa has the largest area among other summer crops in the scenarios of the existing crops while in the scenarios of crop patterns i and ii the area intervals are larger and the economic problems are more addressed in the crop selection the largest ranges of cultivated areas are owing to the scenarios defined for the crop pattern ii and the smallest ones are assigned to the scenarios of the existing crop pattern among the different climatic scenarios the cultivated area bounds are the largest in wet year mainly because of the intrinsic decrease of the net water demands in such a climatic condition with higher precipitation and lower temperature contributing the evapotranspiration to decrease in addition to the demands decrease the increase of the available surface water resources could also another factor allowing the cultivated area to increase in the wet year furthermore the total upper bound of the cultivated area in zone 2 is more than that in zone 1 mainly as a result of much more groundwater resources allowed to be extracted in this region 4 2 net benefit to investigate the capability of each scenario to make the net benefits to be maximum two criteria are defined in this study 1 net benefit nb in million iranian rials and 2 net benefit per unit water consumption volume nbpd in iranian rials per cubic meters the prices are calculated based on the water year 2009 2010 the prices for the water year 2007 2008 the water year 2008 2009 and the water year 2009 2010 are modified and transferred to the prices set at the water year 2009 2010 by considering the average inflation rate during these years in the price calculation and adjustment 4 2 1 results on net benefit in zone 1 increasing the net income of the farmers seems to be a major motivation to convince them to change the crop pattern consequently the nb and nbpd of the different scenarios were calculated and compared with each other the comparison between nb and nbpd is shown in fig 7 as the results suggest the crop pattern ii gives the highest nb in the wet and dry years followed by the crop pattern i and finally the existing crop pattern moreover the crop pattern i is of the highest value of nb in the normal year followed by the crop pattern ii and the existing crop pattern since the groundwater drawdown is among the main criteria to take the policy explaining the amount of the water allocation in the region the water resources allowed to be allocated to the crops in the wet and dry years are indeed the restricted allowable surface water and groundwater respectively hence the crop pattern ii that is excluding alfalfa as high water demanding crop is more adapted with the wet and dry years in contrast the normal year is of the high potential of supplying the water demands and thus the crop pattern i as the higher water demanding crop pattern could be more proper to be cultivated this year furthermore as a result of the reduction of demands in a wet year these demands could be more met this year and therefore the nb is highest in the wet year as compared to the normal and dry years when applying all crop patterns the details of the nb and nbpd in zone 1 are shown in fig 7 by defining the nbpd the net benefit per unit water consumption volume we aim at delineating the economic efficiency of water use in the region generally as mentioned before the water supplied in the wet and dry years is less than that in the normal year and thus the water consumption by the crop patterns mostly adapted with these water years is lower than that in the normal year leading the nbpd value in the wet and dry years to be higher than that obtained in the normal year just like the same trend observed for the nb values 4 2 2 results on net benefit in zone 2 in this area the surface water has fewer portions of water resources meeting the demands of the crops the trend of nb and nbpd of the water years compared with each other is very similar to that in zone 1 consequently the values of nb and nbpd for the crop pattern ii is the highest compared with other crop patterns mainly as a result of having fewer water demands and less water consumption contributing the water resources to much better supplying these demands which is in turn could raise the net benefit in terms of both nb and nbpd moreover the nb values of zone 2 are higher than that in zone 1 as a result of more groundwater allowed to be exploited in zone 2 to supply the demands the pairwise comparisons between the scenarios in zones 1 and zone 2 indicate that the zone 1 has slightly more values of nbpd than that calculated for zone 2 chiefly because of the less total cultivated areas the zone 1 covers which in turn could diminish the water consumption in zone 1 as compared to that in zone 2 the details of the nb and nbpd in zone 2 are shown in fig 8 4 3 water consumption in different scenarios under deficit irrigation 4 3 1 results on water consumption in zone 1 to supply the water demands in the study area the water is allocated from both surface water and groundwater resources in a conjunctive manner subject to several constraints to restrict the water consumption in the irrigation procedure 1 constraints on the upper and lower bounds of the monthly surface water allocation and groundwater extraction and 2 constraints on the control of cumulative drawdown of the groundwater table level over a full period of each scenario examined in this study most models show the highest water stress appearing in march to june of each water year the main reasons why the water stress occurs in these months are rainfall decrease temperature increase leading to the crop water requirement increase high percentage of fall crops in the crop patterns during this period as well as the concurrency of the early months of irrigation for summer crops with late months of irrigation of fall crops to meet the crop water demands the priority is with the allocation of the surface water resources and filling the water shortages through the extraction of the groundwater resources the amounts of conjunctively using the surface and groundwater resources in normal water year are more than that in the dry and wet water years as a result of the appropriate climatic conditions of the normal years in which the precipitation is not as low as that in the dry year on the one hand and also the groundwater level drawdown related restrictions are not as tight as those in the wet year the crop pattern ii also consumes more water than other crop patterns because of the increase of the cultivated area assigned to the high water demanding but highly profitable crops such as tomato in all scenarios of this zone the most of the water consumed by the crops is belonging to the crop pattern ii in the dry year and the lowest water consumption is due to the existing crop pattern in the wet year in general modifying the existing crop pattern to the crop patterns i and ii could contribute the nb and nbpd to increase with increasing the cultivated area of the more profitable crops investigating the sufficiency of the annual water supply reveals that in almost all scenarios a ratio of 78 93 of the demands are met and on a monthly scale at least 50 of the demands are met although over 70 of the demands are met in the majority of the months of a water year the detailed results are shown in table 9 among the crop patterns the crop pattern ii scenarios experience the highest monthly stresses mainly because of involving five summer crops with high water requirements especially in the dry year in all scenarios most of the water is supplied by groundwater resources 56 64 of the total supply and the rest is supplied by surface water resources 36 44 of the total supply 4 3 2 results on water consumption in zone 2 all the constraints applied to the water resources in zone 1 are also imposed on the surface and ground water in zone 2 the detailed discussions over the water used in this zone is similar to those of zone 1 however the percentage of groundwater requirements is higher lying between 74 and 81 of the full water resources allocated to the crops the detailed results are shown in table 10 4 4 groundwater level gwl variations 4 4 1 results on gwl variations in zone 1 building and implementing the simulation optimization model aiming to maximize net benefits the annual cumulative groundwater level gwl variations are decreased in each of the nine scenarios in zone 1 for all crop patterns the cumulative gwl variations are improved in such a way that the gwl at the end of the year obtained by the model is always higher than that in the actual operation by 1 18 m in the dry year 0 77 m in the wet year and 1 84 m in the normal year properly allocating the surface and ground water to each month while consistently holding a low ratio of the groundwater extraction to the surface water allocation are among the key factors contributing gwl to reach a desirable level in an annual operation of the water resources in the region the monthly graphs of the cumulative gwl variations in the scenarios of crop pattern i as an example in both actual and optimal operations are shown in fig 9 4 4 2 results on gwl variations in zone 2 building and implementing the simulation optimization model aiming to achieve the maximum net benefits the annual cumulative gwl variations are descending however the variations are alleviated through performing the optimization process in each of the nine scenarios in the zone 2 for all crop patterns the gwl at the end of the period is improved rising by 1 4 m in the dry year 1 28 m in the wet year and 1 97 m in the normal year as compared to those in the actual operation the monthly graphs of the cumulative gwl variations in the scenarios of crop pattern i as an example in both actual and optimal operations are shown in fig 10 5 discussion 5 1 discussion on optimal crop patterns low economic net benefit and high water consumption of some crops such as sugar beet corn maize and fodder maize are among the reasons why the percentages of the cultivated areas of these crops are reduced in the optimization models on the other hand the high economic benefits of some other crops such as wheat tomato and alfalfa are among the reasons leading the percentages of cultivated areas to be increased in the cultivated model newly proposed by the agricultural organization crop pattern ii it is suggested to remove the alfalfa from the existing crop pattern and to replace it by rapeseed in this pattern the optimum percentage of rapeseed is determined to be between 5 and 8 as shown in fig 11 in both zones and all climatic conditions the percentages of cultivated areas set for the crop patterns i and ii are increased as compared with those in the existing crop pattern because of removing and adding several crops to be applied to the optimization models the increase of the areas cultivated by some crops in the crop pattern ii is mostly because of removing alfalfa in this pattern also in wet year in zone 2 changing the existing crop pattern to the crop patterns i and ii could not significantly increase the cultivated area of the low water demanding and or highly profitable crops as a result of the restriction being imposed on the developing areas so that these areas do not violate the total available cultivable areas 5 2 discussion on water resources allocation planning in this sub section we discuss the total surface water and groundwater allocation to each zone as compared to those allocated in the actual operation with the existing crop pattern in tables 9 and 10 the total water volumes allocated to each zone for the proposed scenarios are shown in all scenarios the water allocation volumes in wet year are at minimum mainly as a result of restricting the groundwater extraction as well as water demands reduction resulting from high precipitation and low temperature this year as shown in fig 12 changing crop patterns from the current form to the new ones the water supply is increased by at most 18 in the scenarios of zone 1 and is enhanced by at most 14 6 in the scenarios of zone 2 the water supply is inevitably increased by the models to cover the developed cultivated areas especially for the summer crops this enhancement in the water supply could hold the demand percentages met at a desirable level leading more net benefits to be fulfilled excepting for the scenarios of the dry year in zone 1 water consumed by the crops in the crop pattern i is more than that in the crop pattern ii as a result of the high water requirement of the alfalfa in the crop pattern i 5 3 discussion on economic net benefit in this sub section the economic efficiency of implementing all of the scenarios is analyzed based on two criteria 1 nb and 2 nbpd because of the decrease in water demands in the wet year with abundant rain the amounts of nb and nbpd in the wet year are the highest on the contrary to those in the dry year which is the smallest figs 7 and 8 the more economic efficiency of the wet year as compared to the other years may be explained by two main factors 1 more properly meeting the reduced water demands in the wet year resulting in more nb values and 2 reduction of the water consumption caused by the water demand decrease contributing to more nbpd values it is noteworthy that the amount of increase of nb and nbpd in wet year in crop patterns i and ii compared to the existing pattern is less than the amount of increase in dry year the main reason for this event is that the nb and nbpd in the wet year are already so high in the existing crop pattern that cannot be increased as much as the amount of increase in nb and nbpd in the dry year as shown in figs 13 and 14 in both zones 1 and 2 and all climatic conditions the percentages of nb and nbpd in the crop patterns i and ii are increased as compared to those in the existing crop pattern because of increasing the cultivated areas for more profitable crops in the zone 1 the highest increase in nb is belonging to the crop pattern i in the normal year and the highest increase in nbpd is seen in the case of implementing the crop pattern ii in the wet year in zone 2 the highest increases in nb and nbpd are both belonging to the crop pattern i in the dry year these results reveal that changing the existing crop pattern is very advantageous in the dry year especially in zone 2 in this region more groundwater resources are allowed to be extracted to meet the high water demands helping the net benefits more increase when compared to that in zone 1 in summary in all scenarios except for the normal year in zone 1 the improvement of nb and nbpd for crop pattern ii is better than crop pattern i because of removing alfalfa and replacing it with less water demanding crops which in turn could provide more water and land for the profitable crops in this crop pattern thus the crop pattern ii could offer the best choice to replace the existing inefficient crop pattern in almost all scenarios examined in this study 5 4 discussion on water demand portion met in zone 1 as a region with tougher restrictions to extract the groundwater resources 56 64 of the agricultural water demands and in the zone 2 74 81 of these demands are supplied from groundwater resources therefore the aquifer included in zone 2 is under more pressure than that included in zone 1 the ratios of the water demands supplied in all scenarios in the dry year are smaller than those in the wet and the normal years because of the high water the crops demand in the dry year in march to june supplying the demands in the years with low rainfall is a difficult task while in the same months in wet year the water shortage has been significantly reduced due to the effective precipitation provided the reduction of water stress in summer is due to diminishing the cultivated area of the summer crops as well as increasing the exploitation of the surface and ground water resources additionally in october and november due to having better climatic conditions yielding more precipitation in these months the net demands decrease and thus the water shortages are better covered 6 conclusion in this paper we attempted to make a balance between the environmental aspects and the economic aspects of the use of the water resources in an agricultural area to somehow meet both aspects with an integrated insight into the problems facing us in this complex and hard to handle engineering problem for this purpose an optimal crop pattern was designed to reduce the areas of the crops with more sensitivity to the deficit irrigation and with high water requirement while increasing the areas of the crops with less sensitivity to the deficit irrigation and with low water requirement on the other hand the more profitable crops should be assigned larger areas and the less profitable crops should be assigned fewer areas as mentioned before these measures not only could boost the net agricultural benefits but also helps the vital water resources especially the groundwater be sustainable to use in the future to perform the abovementioned remediation strategies an optimization approach was utilized for this purpose a gravitational search algorithm gsa as the optimizer was linked to an artificial neural network ann simulation model this linked model could satisfy the net benefit maximization objective and improve groundwater sustainability at the same time the secondary objective was to optimally design a crop pattern for the study area the transition from the existing crop pattern to the new crop patterns crop patterns i and ii leads to an increase in the net benefit nb by 24 9 53 7 and to increase the net benefit per unit water consumption volume nbpd by 9 52 6 it is noteworthy that the study area was divided to two zones and the improvement of nb and nbpd in similar conditions in zone 1 is greater than zone 2 mainly because of assigning less cultivated areas to the zone 1 which in turn could reduce the water demands and water consumption and thus cause the water demands to better be met increasing the area percentage covered by the crops such as wheat and tomatoes and decreasing the area percentage covered by the crops such as sugar beet fodder maize and corn maize in the optimal crop pattern could increase net benefits in the models employed in this study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
10229,holding proper ratio between groundwater extraction and surface water allocation in conjunctive use of water resources may be a desirable way for simultaneously controlling the aquifer sustainability and meeting the increasing agricultural water demands this paper focuses on maximizing the agricultural net benefits nb while avoiding the vital groundwater resources to excessively withdraw when utilized to supply the water demands and provide desirable net benefits for this purpose the gravitational search algorithm gsa is employed as the optimizer and linked to the artificial neural network ann as the simulator of the groundwater level gwl variations the study area is the west of the irrigation network of qazvin plain in iran this area is divided into two zones low gwl drawdown zone zone 1 and high gwl drawdown zone zone 2 for each zone nine scenarios are defined considering three climatic years each of which is assigned three different crop patterns totally resulting in 18 scenarios the results show that the simulation optimization models can decrease the groundwater drawdown in all scenarios by 0 77 1 84 m in zone 1 and by 1 28 1 97 m in zone 2

irrigation conjunctive use 1 introduction conjunctive management of surface and ground water resources in agriculture requires revisiting strategies implemented in water resources allocation spatial and temporal management of water supply and demand and annual water delivery planning furthermore defining a suitable crop pattern to simultaneously be in accordance with the interests of the farmers and the sustainability of the environment may cause the conjunctive use goals to be fulfilled this kind of management may have a great role in reducing water consumption improving the aquifer conditions and controlling the costs of extraction regulation and transfer of the water in this field extensive studies have been done some of which are briefly referred here for solving the conjunctive water use optimization problem several techniques have been suggested generally the techniques offering proper solutions include linear programming lp nonlinear programming nlp dynamic programming dp as well as the meta heuristic algorithms using linear and nonlinear methods in complex problems may bring about several problems the disadvantages of these methods include the dependency of them on the gradient search techniques in which the simplicity of the gradient calculations causes major errors in complex projects increased number of combinations creating computational problems and the curse of dimensionality are among the weaknesses the dynamic programming models suffer from meta heuristic algorithms are nature inspired algorithms not easily trapped in local optima and do not require the objective functions to be continuous and smooth in their domain also these algorithms can solve a variety of nonlinear and non convex problems exposing these methods as very flexible easy to implement and computationally efficient techniques to solve a wide range of optimization problems 1 1 optimization models studies montazar et al 2010 used a linear programming model for allocating surface and groundwater aiming at increasing benefits and groundwater extraction control in ten scenarios considering the deficit irrigation in qazvin plain in iran their results showed that deficit irrigation can improve aquifer sustainability and increase the benefits from the agricultural activities karamouz et al 2010 utilized a genetic algorithm for optimizing the conjunctive use in varamin plain in iran in addition to providing a suitable crop pattern this model estimated 15 year monthly time series demands and surface and ground water allocation volumes delavar et al 2012 applied a real time modeling approach for water allocation in an irrigation system this model employed the neural networks and the optimization modules to determine the surface water allocations considering the growing stages and sensitivity to water stress at different stages this model was able to reduce the water losses from 42 to 12 lalehzari et al 2016 employed a multi objective non dominated storing genetic algorithm type ii nsga ii to maximize net benefits and the water use efficiency regulwar and pradhan 2013 used a linear membership function to fuzzify the objective function and the decision variables including the cultivated area surface and ground water volumes to maximize the benefits wu et al 2016 used an integrated coupled groundwater and surface water flow model gsflow as the optimizer of the conjunctive water use and a surrogate based simulation model named dycors dynamic coordinate search using responses surface models li et al 2016 developed a bi objective model under fuzzy uncertainty for determining the irrigation water allocation with different flow levels in china results showed the feasibility and applicability of this model for implementation in agriculture with high efficiency in water saving safavi and falsafioun 2017 used the ga algorithm for conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources under deficit irrigation for a 5 year irrigation plan and compared the results of the employed model with those observed in the actual operation results indicated that water consumption could be reduced by 24 million cubic meters while the net benefits return could be decreased by 22 yousefi et al 2018 solved a tri objective optimization problem aiming at maximizing net benefits reducing nitrogen leaching and improving the aquifer sustainability using multi objective particle swarm optimization mopso in varamin network irrigation 1 2 simulation optimization models studies in recent years some studies are conducted to solve the conjunctive use problems utilizing the linked simulation optimization models karamouz et al 2004 suggested a method combining the genetic algorithm ga with the artificial neural networks ann to maximize the water supply and control the variations of the groundwater level in the south of tehran iran safavi et al 2010 linked ga with ann to minimize shortages of irrigation water in dry periods for three irrigation scenarios concerning the limitation in groundwater extraction safavi and esmikhani 2013 used the support vector machines svms as the simulation model for estimating the groundwater level variations in koohpayeh plain in isfahan iran thereafter they linked the simulator with ga as the optimization model heydari et al 2016 employed a simulation optimization model for minimizing the groundwater quality variations amid considering the economic goals safavi and enteshari 2016 applied a simulation optimization model based on ann as the simulator and the ant system as optimizer their results showed that the developed model can determine water exploitation volumes which not only decrease the water deficits but also improve aquifer conditions rezaei et al 2017a introduced a new algorithm named fuzzy multi objective particle swarm optimization f mopso they linked this model with a simulation model and applied the resulting model to a 10 year long term period in the zayanderoud network in isfahan iran the outcomes of this study were revealed to be better than a couple of other well known mopsos rezaei et al 2017b developed the tri objective version of the f mopso to design an optimal multi crop pattern plan over a long term simulation period considering economic environmental issues necessary to be addressed in any water resources management scheme milan et al 2018 used modflow code as the simulation model and a linear fuzzy programming model as the optimizer sepahvand et al 2019 used a genetic programming gp method for simulating the surface water groundwater interactions they linked this simulation model to a multi objective genetic algorithm moga as the optimization model they conclude that using this linked model the net agricultural benefits increase in different climatic conditions the gravitational search algorithm gsa was first introduced as a physics based meta heuristic algorithm by rashedi et al 2009 it is based on newton s law of gravity the main unique contributions of the gsa to the field of the optimization may be listed below 1 in the gsa each search agent observes the performance of a variety of other agents and tends to move towards them with different accelerations 2 in the gsa the best search agents attract the other ones with the accelerations directly proportional to the best agents fitness and inversely proportional to the distance from them in this way the more the fitness of a certain agent the more the attractive power of that agent moreover the more the distance between a certain agent and the other agents the less the attractive power of that certain agent these regulations could accelerate the less diversified agents movements towards the fitted agents and speeding up the convergence on the one hand and de accelerate the more diversified agents movements towards the fitted ones on the other hand since the diversified search agents should maintain their position in the search space to enhance their exploration capability these settings are quite justified as a result the exploration capability of the gsa is much stronger and more efficient than a series of the other meta heuristics mainly due to retarding the diversified search agents movements toward the guide agents to enforce the diversity to be toughly preserved in the search space this strength point of the gsa may however make the algorithm be trapped in local optima especially when the optimization problem is so large scale and high dimensional nevertheless for a moderate dimensional problem the exploration capability of this algorithm may be taken into account as a competitive and completely advantageous feature the gsa offers as compared to the other meta heuristics 3 selecting the best fitted elite agents at each of the iterations to lead the other agents could activate the elitism mechanism in the gsa furthermore the number of these elite agents is decreasing by lapse of iterations to hold a proper balance between the exploration and the exploitation 4 the gsa is a memory less meta heuristic algorithm helping mitigate the computational cost of the algorithm as compared to the similar competitive meta heuristics 5 the gsa gives a random number to each dimension of the search agents when being updated making this algorithm an entirely stochastic search algorithm here a number of gsa applications in the field of the water resources management are highlighted moeini et al 2017 used the constrained gsa for optimizing the hydropower operation of dez reservoir iran the other studies of gsa applied this algorithm in other fields of science asmadi et al 2014 attempted to validate the performance of the gsa algorithm for the optimization of the water releases from a reservoir in malaysia asmadi et al 2016 compared artificial bee algorithm with the gsa algorithm when applying them to optimally solve a reservoir operation problem aimed to minimize the deficit in the releases for irrigation purposes fallah et al 2019 used the gsa algorithm for the optimal design of water distribution networks to achieve an optimal size of pipes karami et al 2019 applied a hybrid algorithm linking gsa to particle swarm optimization pso algorithm for minimizing irrigation deficits in a multi reservoir system the results revealed that the performance of the hybrid algorithm is promising 1 3 the present study and the organization of the paper in the water resources management problems there is always a contradiction between the economic benefits and the environmental benefits this contrast could show itself both in how to allocate the water resources and how to set the water demands especially in an agricultural area holding a nice balance between these two aspects of the water resources to gain the maximum benefits from the management practices could provide the sustainability for the environmental resources while not disrupting the livelihood of the people involved in the operation of the water resources this paper focuses on presenting an optimal water allocation policy to irrigate an agricultural area this policy is on the one hand set with regard to the crop sensitivity to the deficit irrigation such that less water is allocated to the more sensitive periods and the more water is allocated to the less sensitive periods on the other hand the crop pattern is also modified based on this policy to diminish the water demands of the crops as much as possible to be adjusted to the deficit water allocated to the crops in this way not only the water demands are better met contributing the water productivity and thus the net benefits to be maximized but also the water resources especially the groundwater are saved to hold the aquifer sustainability for the exploitation at the future among the innovations of the approach followed in this paper some points may be mentioned as follows 1 there are three different types for the crop patterns studied in this paper which differ not only in the area assigned to the crops but also in the crop combination 2 considering three climatic conditions and dividing the aquifer covered by the study area into two low drawdown and high drawdown zones and setting the bounds defined for the groundwater level variations as adjusted to the nature of these two zones 3 defining 18 different management scenarios to enable the model to offer the best operating policy for each of these scenarios and 4 utilizing the gsa as its first application to optimize the conjunctive water use in practice these innovations are all the new practices in the field of conjunctive water use management not conducted in the previous studies some of which are reviewed in this paper in section 2 the characteristics of the study area are presented in section 3 the methodology is described in different steps including introducing the gravitational search algorithm defining the formulae of the optimization model defining a trained artificial neural network as a surface water groundwater simulation model defining the three crop pattern distributions and the simulation and optimization model preparations in section 4 the results of the groundwater level variations crop patterns achieved net benefits and the water allocation policy as a result of running 18 different scenarios are presented section 5 provides some discussions over the results and finally section 6 concludes the paper 2 case study the west of irrigation network of qazvin winq plain in iran is adopted as the study area this network consists of one reservoir dam taleghan a conveying tunnel and an extensive irrigation system including the main canal and 13 secondary canals canal ii the system also has lateral canals iii and canals iv this network was located between 35 24 n to 36 48 n latitude and 48 45 e to 50 51 e longitude the climate of the region is arid and semi arid with average annual precipitation equal to 312 mm the mean annual temperature is 14 4 c the precipitation distribution is severely non uniform in time and space resulting in water shortage in arid seasons the whole area is estimated to cover 35 000 ha of which net irrigated area is 23 000 ha consisting of 8200 ha of fallow and 14 800 ha of cultivated area the area of orchards is about 700 ha the area located at the west of the irrigation network includes the main canal and 5 secondary canals canal ii the characteristics of the network designed for the qazvin irrigation command area are presented in table 1 according to the common network operation regulations the average efficiency of the water transmission from the head of the main canal to the beginning of the canal iii is 75 and in the corresponding efficiency for the canals of types iii and iv is 80 furthermore the efficiency of water use on farms is 50 thus the total efficiency from the head of canal iii to its ending is 40 surface water resources are not sufficient to meet the irrigation demands of crops and the water shortages are covered by the groundwater extraction included in the governmental integrated wells and the private agricultural wells the main reason for choosing this area as the case study is the large withdrawal of the groundwater level in the recent years resulting from less surface water allocation in the west of the network compared to its east there are 116 wells owned by the network and 30 wells that are consolidated in the region the efficiency for the transmission of the groundwater from each well is 80 and the efficiency of the water use in the farms is 50 thus the total efficiency for each well is adopted as 40 a scheme of the groundwater level lines and their annual variations from october 2002 to october 2019 show that the groundwater level in the study area has drastically declined by 35 7 m in just 17 years the existing crop pattern includes the fall crops such as wheat and barley and summer crops such as sugar beet tomato corn maize fodder maize beans peas potato and alfalfa there are also grapes apples and several other fruits growing in the orchards fig 1 shows the position of the study area including the main canals and secondary canals and their branches fig 2 describes a typical crop calendar including the main crops cultivated in the qazvin irrigation network 3 methodology 3 1 gravitational search algorithm in the gravitational search algorithm the concepts of mass newton s gravitational force and newton s gravitational law are utilized in this algorithm candidate solutions are a set of objects being affected by the gravitational force and are frequently changing their positions based on their masses and the distances to other objects solutions generally the better the fitness of an object the greater the mass of that object will be the gsa does the optimization process in two major steps first step the formation of the system defining the laws and setting the parameters involved in this algorithm the space of the system encompasses a set of n objects each of which has a mass each object also has a position in the search space the position of the mass i in the dimension d is denoted by x i d considering all m dimensions of the search space the position vector of the object i can be represented by x i as shown in eq 1 1 x i x i 1 x i d x i m for i 1 2 3 n in this system of masses at a specific time t a force acts from mass j to mass i in the dimension d denoted by f i j d t in eq 2 2 f i j d t g t m p i t m a j t r i j t p ε x j d t x i d t 3 r i j t x i t x j t 2 m a j and m p i are respectively the active gravitational mass related to agent j and the passive gravitational mass related to mass i r i j is the euclidean distance between the objects i and j ε is a small number hindering the denominator of the eq 2 to get a zero value p is the power of the distance recommended to be set to 1 in the original version of the gsa algorithm g t is a decreasing gravitational constant at time t and is calculated using the eq 4 4 g t g 0 e t t in this equation g 0 is an initial constant α is a positive constant and t is the maximum number of the iterations which can be assumed as the system lifetime the resultant force acting on the agent i in the dimension d at the time of t is denoted by f i d t as a randomly weighted summation of the forces imposed from other agents at the dth dimension 5 f i d t j kbest j i rand j d f ij d t where rand j d is a random number generated in the interval 0 1 kbest is the number of the elite solutions which is as large as the population size at the first iteration and is gradually decreased by lapse of the iterations to reach the 2 of the population size at the final iteration the acceleration the agent i finds at time t is denoted by a i d t calculated using eq 6 6 a i d t f i d t m ii t m ii is the inertial mass of the ith agent the velocity of each object is updated via eq 7 7 v i d t 1 rand i v i d t a i d t v i d t is the velocity of the agent i in the dth dimension at time t rand i is a uniformly distributed random number generated in the interval 0 1 it is used to randomly make the search agents stagnant at the final iterations to ease the transition from the exploration to the exploitation phases in this algorithm the position of the agent i at the dimension of d can be updated using eq 8 8 x i d t 1 x i d t v i d t 1 in this algorithm the gravitational and inertia masses are assumed to be equal as shown in eq 9 9 m a i m p i m i i m i i 1 2 n the masses are all calculated based on the fitness value of each agent the fitness of the agents is normalized through eq 10 the normalized fitness is then doubly normalized to define a mass for a given search agent as shown in eq 11 10 q i t fit i t worst t best t worst t 11 m i t q i t j 1 n q i t where fit i t is defined as the fitness value of the agent i at time t for minimization problems the following equations can be used for calculating the best and worst fitness values playing the role of the attractive power of each agent 12 b e s t t min j 1 n f i t j t 13 w o r s t t max j 1 n f i t j t and for maximization problems the eqs 12 and 13 can be turned into eqs 14 and 15 14 b e s t t max j 1 n f i t j t 15 w o r s t t min j 1 n f i t j t second step moving each agent to be randomly located at a point in the space representing a candidate solution to the problem the dual steps are going on until reaching a stopping criterion already defined for the algorithm the detailed different steps to be taken to perform the gsa are as follows 1 generate initial population 2 evaluate the fitness of each agent 3 update the g best and worst of the population 4 calculate m and a for each agent 5 update velocity and position 6 meeting the stopping criterion yes go to step 7 else go to step 2 7 return the best solution at the final iteration 3 2 optimization model mathematical formulation the main objective of the model developed in this paper is to maximize the agricultural net benefits in the conjunctive use of surface and ground water resources this objective is subject to several constraints depicted as follows 1 to meet the market requirements and also the farmers own needs for the food products they grow within their agricultural activities the cultivated area assigned to each crop is assumed to be greater than the half of the existing area of that crop as the minimum area assigned to that crop furthermore the total cultivated area is set not to exceed the total existing cultivated area as the potential cultivable area in the agricultural region 16 a jk t 0 5 a jk 17 j 1 j a jk t a k a jk t is the cultivated area assigned to the crop j in zone k in water year t normal wet or dry year a jk is the existing area of the crop j in zone k a k is the total existing cultivated area in zone k 2 the surface water allocation and the groundwater extraction volumes are in turn bounded to the historical monthly minimum and maximum volume exploited and allocated to each region as the eqs 18 and 19 suggest 18 min sw ik sw ik max sw i k 19 min gw ik gw ik max gw ik where min sw ik and max sw ik are respectively the minimum and maximum of the surface water allocated to zone k in the month i in the head in a long term 17 year period moreover min gw ik and max gw ik are respectively the minimum and maximum volume of the groundwater extracted from zone k in the month i in a long term 17 year period sw ik and gw ik are respectively the volume of surface water and groundwater allocated to zone k in the month i 3 the annual total surface water allocation volume is also assumed not to exceed the existing total annual allocation in the respective water year this constraint could meet the special climatic conditions of each water year when dealt with in a separate scenario 20 i 1 12 sw ik sw k sw ik is the surface water allocated in the month i and zone k and sw k is the annual total surface water allocated in a given water year in zone k 4 the annual cumulative groundwater level drawdown is assumed not to exceed a maximum allowable bound being set depending on the given water year and a given region and based on the availability of the surface water and groundwater in that water year and that region 21 i 1 12 drop ik drop k drop ik is the groundwater level drawdown in the month i in zone k and drop k is the upper bound assumed for the annual total groundwater level drawdown in zone k in a given year and a given region 5 as recommended by the agricultural organization for this network the portion of the area out of the total cultivable area for the fall crops should be 50 this portion should also be 15 for the summer crops and should be 35 for the fallow however we aim at spanning a widened range for the crops cultivated area to impart the model flexibility to set the optimal areas for the crops these ranges are set to be 45 50 for the fall crops and 15 20 for the summer crops in this way the total cultivated area is set to 65 while 35 of the total area is left as the fallow area this constraint is met via eq 22 22 p 1 p a pk 0 30 q 1 q a qk i 1 2 3 p j 1 2 3 q where a pk is the area of fall crops a qk is the area of the summer crop p is the number of fall crops and q is the number of summer crops 6 the annual total demands of the crops should be greater than or equal to the water supplied by the surface and ground water resources in the study area 23 i 1 12 j 1 n d ijk a z b z i 1 12 sup ik 24 sup ik sw ik gw ik where i is the indicator of the month j is the indicator of the crop n is the number of crops sup ik is the gross water volume supplying zone k in month i d ijk is the water demand of crop j in the month i and zone k a z is farm water use efficiency set to be 0 50 here b z is water use efficiency in the channels set to be 0 80 here sw ik is the net surface water allocated to zone k in month i gw ik is the net groundwater allocated to zone k in the month i the main goal of the optimization model could be formulated as follows 25 maximize z i 1 n p i y a i c i a i n is the number of main crops in the region z is the net benefit p i is the selling price of each crop in rial kg c i is the cost of crop production in rial ha a i is the area of each crop and y a i is the actual yield of the crop i per unit cultivated area in kg ha over the whole planning period or the given water year tafteh et al 2013 proposed the following formula to calculate the relative yield of crops in qazvin plain as the case study of this paper as follows 26 y a y m i 1 n 1 k yi 1 et a i et m i k yi i 1 n k yi where y a is the actual yield of a given crop per unit cultivated area calculated for all the crops included in the crop patterns adopted in this study kg ha y m is the maximum yield of a given crop per unit cultivated area achieved upon its water requirement is fully met kg ha et a i is the actual evapotranspiration in the growth stage i mm et m i is the potential evapotranspiration in the growth stage i mm k yi is the yield response factor in the growth stage i and n is the number of growth stages of a given crop the amounts of the yield response factors for the main crops involved in the crop patterns existing in the qazvin plain is shown in table 2 tafteh et al 2014 deficit irrigation means that the water resources mobilized to supply the water demands are reduced while the crop water demands are also decreased as long as the demand percentage met would be at a desirable level to help enhance the crop yields and thus the net benefits thereafter the crop yield response factor which is also known as the crop sensitivity to the deficit irrigation should be addressed to better maximize the yields and the benefits as the main goal of the agricultural activities such that the more the yield response factor in a period the more water demands should be reduced in that period and the less the yield response factor in a period the less water demands should be decreased in that period furthermore the process of reduction of the water demands is carried out through well setting the crops in an optimal crop pattern such that the more area is assigned to the less water demanding crops and the less area is allocated to the more water demanding crops this procedure is going well when the total cultivated area of the crops remains at a constant range otherwise it is clear that by increasing the total area the total water demands are also increased and degrade the quality of the optimal crop pattern this is why we considered an upper bound for the total cultivated area in a water year underpinned by the explanations here we aim at performing the deficit irrigation in this study and optimally designing a crop pattern to be most adapted to the deficit irrigation in this way not only the net benefit is reached at a desirable level but also the allocation of the water resources especially the groundwater is reduced to cause the aquifer to be more sustainable 3 3 artificial neural network ann in this paper an artificial neural network ann is used to simulate the groundwater level variations as the state variables included in the objective function evaluations of the optimization model the ann code is derived and implemented in the matlab environment several monthly available data sets each of which is consisting of the time series of input data in a 17 year historical period are collected and inserted into the ann model in the training process the total number of input data is equal to 204 the input data encompasses a set of affecting parameters on the groundwater level variations including evapotranspiration temperature precipitation surface water allocation with different time lags up to 2 months groundwater extraction the difference between the discharge in the inflow and outflow points of the river running in the study area recharging the aquifer with different time lags up to 1 month and finally the initial depth to the groundwater table level at each month furthermore output of the ann is the groundwater level variations whose value is positive in the case of water rise and is negative in the case of water drawdown an amount of 70 of the data sets is used for training 20 is allocated to test and 10 is put aside for validation the ann is a 17 5 1 network including 5 neurons in the hidden layer to evaluate the performance of each network two statistical criteria are used 1 the root mean square error rmse and 2 the coefficient of correlation r these criteria can be mathematically formulated as follows 27 rmse i 1 n y i y ci 2 n 28 r i 1 n y ci y ave ci y i y ave i i 1 n y ci y ave ci 2 i 1 n y i y ave i 2 where y i is the observed value for the ith output y ci is the computed simulated value for the ith output y ave i is the average of the observed values of the outputs y ave ci is the average of computed simulated values of the outputs and n is the number of the data sets used at each stage to create the ann structure the best network may have been created upon achieving rmse 0 and r 1 3 4 zoning the study area and crop pattern distributions investigating the drought indices calculated in the forms of the standardized precipitation index spi method over a long term 2007 2012 time period in the study area the water year 2009 2010 was considered as the indicator of a wet year moreover the water year 2007 2008 was identified as the indicator of a dry year and the water year 2008 2009 was recognized as the indicator of a normal year investigating the groundwater level variations map during 2007 2012 reveals that the groundwater level within the western boundary of the qazvin irrigation network is declined by 0 17 m the graph of the monthly groundwater level variations in the two zones is shown in fig 3 according to the iso drop map 5 year iso drop lines depicted for the whole study area in fig 4 two zones are selected as the zones having unique characteristics to be focused on in the simulation optimization model calculations these two zones are mainly characterized as follows zone 1 area with lower groundwater drawdown annual average cumulative drawdown to be less than 2 2 m included in the northwestern part of the network zone 2 area with higher groundwater drawdown annual average cumulative drawdown to be more than 2 2 m included in the southwestern part of the network each zone is independently handled by the simulation optimization model there are also three crop patterns defined for each zone as shown in detail in table 3 considering three climatic conditions including wet normal and dry climates for each crop pattern there would be 2 3 3 namely 18 different scenarios defined for the whole study area to be handled in the optimal conjunctive water use problem solved in this paper decision variables include 28 items 12 monthly surface water allocated volumes 12 monthly groundwater extraction volumes and 4 cultivated areas for the existing crop pattern and include 29 items 12 monthly surface water allocated volumes 12 groundwater extraction volumes and 5 cultivation area for the crop pattern i and includes 31 items 12 monthly surface water allocated volumes 12 groundwater extraction volumes and 7 cultivation area for the crop pattern ii the water demand of the selected crops included in these three crop patterns is also calculated separately for each climatic year potential evapotranspiration is calculated from qazvin synoptic station data using the modified fao penman monteith method calculated by the cropwat 8 0 is one of its default methods to evaluate the crop water requirements the composition of the gardens in the area is preserved and their water demands are assumed to be fully met by the water resources the components of the crop patterns studied in the area are shown in table 4 in the crop patterns i and ii a range of 45 50 of the area is allocated to the fall crops a range of 15 20 of the area is assigned to the summer crops and 35 of the total area remains as fallow the existing crop pattern is delineated based upon the current preferences of the agricultural authorities implemented in the study area the range of the areas assigned to the wheat barley alfalfa and tomato is assumed to be 50 100 of the existing area of the relevant crops the existing area assigned to the other crops is low thus their existing areas are assumed to be the same as the existing amounts in the newly proposed crop patterns i and ii 3 5 simulation models preparation the results of the ann simulation model are summarized in table 5 the ann is simulating the existing data sets over a 17 year long term period that covers all climatic conditions including wet normal and dry years the regression charts for ann simulation models are shown in figs 5 and 6 3 6 optimization models preparation the gsa model was used to optimize maximize the net benefits through which the optimal areas of the dominant crops as well as the optimal monthly volumes of the surface and ground water resources allocation could be determined the gsa algorithm was performed considering 100 search agents and 1000 iterations in each run as mentioned before nine scenarios were defined for each of the two regions including a low gwl drawdown zone and a high gwl drawdown zone totally forming 18 scenarios for each water year and in all scenarios a maximum groundwater level drawdown was considered and imposed on the model as the substantial constraints to sustain the aquifer these upper bound values are set to be equal for all crop patterns and decided to only be dependent on the zones of study as well as the climatic conditions of a certain planning period water year these upper bounds can be seen in table 6 it is worthwhile mentioning that all codes were run in the matlab environment on a core i5 computer with 2 8 3 1 ghz cpu and 8 gb of memory also the running of the linked simulation optimization model coded for each scenario took about 150 min in every single run 4 results 4 1 optimal crop patterns the details of the crop patterns in two zones are shown in tables 7 and 8 the results are discussed in detail in the following sections for all scenarios 65 of the area is assumed to be cultivated and 35 is deemed to remain fallow furthermore in both crop patterns i and ii 45 50 of the total cultivated area is assigned to fall crops while 15 20 is allocated to summer crops due to the high cultivation portion of wheat in the current crop pattern of the region for all crop patterns and in all scenarios implemented on the zone 1 and zone 2 the interval defined for the cultivation percentage of this crop is set to be higher than those of other crops in the existing crop pattern the area cultivated by each crop is bounded based upon the current climatic conditions the prevailing crop supply and demand situations and the long term farmers experiences in the agricultural activities in the region whereas the economic advantages and disadvantages and or water requirement play a lesser role in crop selection accordingly alfalfa has the largest area among other summer crops in the scenarios of the existing crops while in the scenarios of crop patterns i and ii the area intervals are larger and the economic problems are more addressed in the crop selection the largest ranges of cultivated areas are owing to the scenarios defined for the crop pattern ii and the smallest ones are assigned to the scenarios of the existing crop pattern among the different climatic scenarios the cultivated area bounds are the largest in wet year mainly because of the intrinsic decrease of the net water demands in such a climatic condition with higher precipitation and lower temperature contributing the evapotranspiration to decrease in addition to the demands decrease the increase of the available surface water resources could also another factor allowing the cultivated area to increase in the wet year furthermore the total upper bound of the cultivated area in zone 2 is more than that in zone 1 mainly as a result of much more groundwater resources allowed to be extracted in this region 4 2 net benefit to investigate the capability of each scenario to make the net benefits to be maximum two criteria are defined in this study 1 net benefit nb in million iranian rials and 2 net benefit per unit water consumption volume nbpd in iranian rials per cubic meters the prices are calculated based on the water year 2009 2010 the prices for the water year 2007 2008 the water year 2008 2009 and the water year 2009 2010 are modified and transferred to the prices set at the water year 2009 2010 by considering the average inflation rate during these years in the price calculation and adjustment 4 2 1 results on net benefit in zone 1 increasing the net income of the farmers seems to be a major motivation to convince them to change the crop pattern consequently the nb and nbpd of the different scenarios were calculated and compared with each other the comparison between nb and nbpd is shown in fig 7 as the results suggest the crop pattern ii gives the highest nb in the wet and dry years followed by the crop pattern i and finally the existing crop pattern moreover the crop pattern i is of the highest value of nb in the normal year followed by the crop pattern ii and the existing crop pattern since the groundwater drawdown is among the main criteria to take the policy explaining the amount of the water allocation in the region the water resources allowed to be allocated to the crops in the wet and dry years are indeed the restricted allowable surface water and groundwater respectively hence the crop pattern ii that is excluding alfalfa as high water demanding crop is more adapted with the wet and dry years in contrast the normal year is of the high potential of supplying the water demands and thus the crop pattern i as the higher water demanding crop pattern could be more proper to be cultivated this year furthermore as a result of the reduction of demands in a wet year these demands could be more met this year and therefore the nb is highest in the wet year as compared to the normal and dry years when applying all crop patterns the details of the nb and nbpd in zone 1 are shown in fig 7 by defining the nbpd the net benefit per unit water consumption volume we aim at delineating the economic efficiency of water use in the region generally as mentioned before the water supplied in the wet and dry years is less than that in the normal year and thus the water consumption by the crop patterns mostly adapted with these water years is lower than that in the normal year leading the nbpd value in the wet and dry years to be higher than that obtained in the normal year just like the same trend observed for the nb values 4 2 2 results on net benefit in zone 2 in this area the surface water has fewer portions of water resources meeting the demands of the crops the trend of nb and nbpd of the water years compared with each other is very similar to that in zone 1 consequently the values of nb and nbpd for the crop pattern ii is the highest compared with other crop patterns mainly as a result of having fewer water demands and less water consumption contributing the water resources to much better supplying these demands which is in turn could raise the net benefit in terms of both nb and nbpd moreover the nb values of zone 2 are higher than that in zone 1 as a result of more groundwater allowed to be exploited in zone 2 to supply the demands the pairwise comparisons between the scenarios in zones 1 and zone 2 indicate that the zone 1 has slightly more values of nbpd than that calculated for zone 2 chiefly because of the less total cultivated areas the zone 1 covers which in turn could diminish the water consumption in zone 1 as compared to that in zone 2 the details of the nb and nbpd in zone 2 are shown in fig 8 4 3 water consumption in different scenarios under deficit irrigation 4 3 1 results on water consumption in zone 1 to supply the water demands in the study area the water is allocated from both surface water and groundwater resources in a conjunctive manner subject to several constraints to restrict the water consumption in the irrigation procedure 1 constraints on the upper and lower bounds of the monthly surface water allocation and groundwater extraction and 2 constraints on the control of cumulative drawdown of the groundwater table level over a full period of each scenario examined in this study most models show the highest water stress appearing in march to june of each water year the main reasons why the water stress occurs in these months are rainfall decrease temperature increase leading to the crop water requirement increase high percentage of fall crops in the crop patterns during this period as well as the concurrency of the early months of irrigation for summer crops with late months of irrigation of fall crops to meet the crop water demands the priority is with the allocation of the surface water resources and filling the water shortages through the extraction of the groundwater resources the amounts of conjunctively using the surface and groundwater resources in normal water year are more than that in the dry and wet water years as a result of the appropriate climatic conditions of the normal years in which the precipitation is not as low as that in the dry year on the one hand and also the groundwater level drawdown related restrictions are not as tight as those in the wet year the crop pattern ii also consumes more water than other crop patterns because of the increase of the cultivated area assigned to the high water demanding but highly profitable crops such as tomato in all scenarios of this zone the most of the water consumed by the crops is belonging to the crop pattern ii in the dry year and the lowest water consumption is due to the existing crop pattern in the wet year in general modifying the existing crop pattern to the crop patterns i and ii could contribute the nb and nbpd to increase with increasing the cultivated area of the more profitable crops investigating the sufficiency of the annual water supply reveals that in almost all scenarios a ratio of 78 93 of the demands are met and on a monthly scale at least 50 of the demands are met although over 70 of the demands are met in the majority of the months of a water year the detailed results are shown in table 9 among the crop patterns the crop pattern ii scenarios experience the highest monthly stresses mainly because of involving five summer crops with high water requirements especially in the dry year in all scenarios most of the water is supplied by groundwater resources 56 64 of the total supply and the rest is supplied by surface water resources 36 44 of the total supply 4 3 2 results on water consumption in zone 2 all the constraints applied to the water resources in zone 1 are also imposed on the surface and ground water in zone 2 the detailed discussions over the water used in this zone is similar to those of zone 1 however the percentage of groundwater requirements is higher lying between 74 and 81 of the full water resources allocated to the crops the detailed results are shown in table 10 4 4 groundwater level gwl variations 4 4 1 results on gwl variations in zone 1 building and implementing the simulation optimization model aiming to maximize net benefits the annual cumulative groundwater level gwl variations are decreased in each of the nine scenarios in zone 1 for all crop patterns the cumulative gwl variations are improved in such a way that the gwl at the end of the year obtained by the model is always higher than that in the actual operation by 1 18 m in the dry year 0 77 m in the wet year and 1 84 m in the normal year properly allocating the surface and ground water to each month while consistently holding a low ratio of the groundwater extraction to the surface water allocation are among the key factors contributing gwl to reach a desirable level in an annual operation of the water resources in the region the monthly graphs of the cumulative gwl variations in the scenarios of crop pattern i as an example in both actual and optimal operations are shown in fig 9 4 4 2 results on gwl variations in zone 2 building and implementing the simulation optimization model aiming to achieve the maximum net benefits the annual cumulative gwl variations are descending however the variations are alleviated through performing the optimization process in each of the nine scenarios in the zone 2 for all crop patterns the gwl at the end of the period is improved rising by 1 4 m in the dry year 1 28 m in the wet year and 1 97 m in the normal year as compared to those in the actual operation the monthly graphs of the cumulative gwl variations in the scenarios of crop pattern i as an example in both actual and optimal operations are shown in fig 10 5 discussion 5 1 discussion on optimal crop patterns low economic net benefit and high water consumption of some crops such as sugar beet corn maize and fodder maize are among the reasons why the percentages of the cultivated areas of these crops are reduced in the optimization models on the other hand the high economic benefits of some other crops such as wheat tomato and alfalfa are among the reasons leading the percentages of cultivated areas to be increased in the cultivated model newly proposed by the agricultural organization crop pattern ii it is suggested to remove the alfalfa from the existing crop pattern and to replace it by rapeseed in this pattern the optimum percentage of rapeseed is determined to be between 5 and 8 as shown in fig 11 in both zones and all climatic conditions the percentages of cultivated areas set for the crop patterns i and ii are increased as compared with those in the existing crop pattern because of removing and adding several crops to be applied to the optimization models the increase of the areas cultivated by some crops in the crop pattern ii is mostly because of removing alfalfa in this pattern also in wet year in zone 2 changing the existing crop pattern to the crop patterns i and ii could not significantly increase the cultivated area of the low water demanding and or highly profitable crops as a result of the restriction being imposed on the developing areas so that these areas do not violate the total available cultivable areas 5 2 discussion on water resources allocation planning in this sub section we discuss the total surface water and groundwater allocation to each zone as compared to those allocated in the actual operation with the existing crop pattern in tables 9 and 10 the total water volumes allocated to each zone for the proposed scenarios are shown in all scenarios the water allocation volumes in wet year are at minimum mainly as a result of restricting the groundwater extraction as well as water demands reduction resulting from high precipitation and low temperature this year as shown in fig 12 changing crop patterns from the current form to the new ones the water supply is increased by at most 18 in the scenarios of zone 1 and is enhanced by at most 14 6 in the scenarios of zone 2 the water supply is inevitably increased by the models to cover the developed cultivated areas especially for the summer crops this enhancement in the water supply could hold the demand percentages met at a desirable level leading more net benefits to be fulfilled excepting for the scenarios of the dry year in zone 1 water consumed by the crops in the crop pattern i is more than that in the crop pattern ii as a result of the high water requirement of the alfalfa in the crop pattern i 5 3 discussion on economic net benefit in this sub section the economic efficiency of implementing all of the scenarios is analyzed based on two criteria 1 nb and 2 nbpd because of the decrease in water demands in the wet year with abundant rain the amounts of nb and nbpd in the wet year are the highest on the contrary to those in the dry year which is the smallest figs 7 and 8 the more economic efficiency of the wet year as compared to the other years may be explained by two main factors 1 more properly meeting the reduced water demands in the wet year resulting in more nb values and 2 reduction of the water consumption caused by the water demand decrease contributing to more nbpd values it is noteworthy that the amount of increase of nb and nbpd in wet year in crop patterns i and ii compared to the existing pattern is less than the amount of increase in dry year the main reason for this event is that the nb and nbpd in the wet year are already so high in the existing crop pattern that cannot be increased as much as the amount of increase in nb and nbpd in the dry year as shown in figs 13 and 14 in both zones 1 and 2 and all climatic conditions the percentages of nb and nbpd in the crop patterns i and ii are increased as compared to those in the existing crop pattern because of increasing the cultivated areas for more profitable crops in the zone 1 the highest increase in nb is belonging to the crop pattern i in the normal year and the highest increase in nbpd is seen in the case of implementing the crop pattern ii in the wet year in zone 2 the highest increases in nb and nbpd are both belonging to the crop pattern i in the dry year these results reveal that changing the existing crop pattern is very advantageous in the dry year especially in zone 2 in this region more groundwater resources are allowed to be extracted to meet the high water demands helping the net benefits more increase when compared to that in zone 1 in summary in all scenarios except for the normal year in zone 1 the improvement of nb and nbpd for crop pattern ii is better than crop pattern i because of removing alfalfa and replacing it with less water demanding crops which in turn could provide more water and land for the profitable crops in this crop pattern thus the crop pattern ii could offer the best choice to replace the existing inefficient crop pattern in almost all scenarios examined in this study 5 4 discussion on water demand portion met in zone 1 as a region with tougher restrictions to extract the groundwater resources 56 64 of the agricultural water demands and in the zone 2 74 81 of these demands are supplied from groundwater resources therefore the aquifer included in zone 2 is under more pressure than that included in zone 1 the ratios of the water demands supplied in all scenarios in the dry year are smaller than those in the wet and the normal years because of the high water the crops demand in the dry year in march to june supplying the demands in the years with low rainfall is a difficult task while in the same months in wet year the water shortage has been significantly reduced due to the effective precipitation provided the reduction of water stress in summer is due to diminishing the cultivated area of the summer crops as well as increasing the exploitation of the surface and ground water resources additionally in october and november due to having better climatic conditions yielding more precipitation in these months the net demands decrease and thus the water shortages are better covered 6 conclusion in this paper we attempted to make a balance between the environmental aspects and the economic aspects of the use of the water resources in an agricultural area to somehow meet both aspects with an integrated insight into the problems facing us in this complex and hard to handle engineering problem for this purpose an optimal crop pattern was designed to reduce the areas of the crops with more sensitivity to the deficit irrigation and with high water requirement while increasing the areas of the crops with less sensitivity to the deficit irrigation and with low water requirement on the other hand the more profitable crops should be assigned larger areas and the less profitable crops should be assigned fewer areas as mentioned before these measures not only could boost the net agricultural benefits but also helps the vital water resources especially the groundwater be sustainable to use in the future to perform the abovementioned remediation strategies an optimization approach was utilized for this purpose a gravitational search algorithm gsa as the optimizer was linked to an artificial neural network ann simulation model this linked model could satisfy the net benefit maximization objective and improve groundwater sustainability at the same time the secondary objective was to optimally design a crop pattern for the study area the transition from the existing crop pattern to the new crop patterns crop patterns i and ii leads to an increase in the net benefit nb by 24 9 53 7 and to increase the net benefit per unit water consumption volume nbpd by 9 52 6 it is noteworthy that the study area was divided to two zones and the improvement of nb and nbpd in similar conditions in zone 1 is greater than zone 2 mainly because of assigning less cultivated areas to the zone 1 which in turn could reduce the water demands and water consumption and thus cause the water demands to better be met increasing the area percentage covered by the crops such as wheat and tomatoes and decreasing the area percentage covered by the crops such as sugar beet fodder maize and corn maize in the optimal crop pattern could increase net benefits in the models employed in this study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
