17890,electrodialysis ed is a well established brackish water bw desalination technology that has been commercially applied for decades however the energy efficiency of bwed cannot approach optimization because of the low salt concentration of bw in this study a novel two hydraulic stage ed desalination system was presented to enhance mass transfer and reduce energy consumption in terms of energy efficient strategies it involved not only innovative membrane stack configurations resin filled electrode cells and asymmetric cell pairs design but also optimizing inflow modes electrolytes parallel flow and dilute concentrate counter flow results showed that thin resin filled 1 mm electrode cells asymmetric cell pair design cell pairs ratio of 1st and 2nd hydraulic stages 1 2 and optimizations of general inflow mode were beneficial for savings 10 30 of energy consumption at the same salt removal ratio sr the synergistic effects of these strategies indicated that this novel ed system could save 40 of the energy consumption at the same sr compared with conventional two hydraulic stage ed system ced three stage continuous bwed performance tests compared with a ced showed that a 36 9 total energy saving could be achieved using the novel ed system when the bw concentration decreased from 3500 mg l to the quality requirement of drinking water 450 mg l it was therefore possible to open the way for saving energy in bwed systems graphical abstract energy saving effect based on the novel ed system image 1 keywords electrodialysis ed brackish water desalination energy efficient stack configuration inflow mode 1 introduction with the continuous development of world s economy and society as well as the growth of global population the world is facing severe freshwater scarcity the gulf between the supply and demand for freshwater will continue to deteriorate in the coming years mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 rodell et al 2018 the united nations world water development report 2017 indicates that two thirds of the global population currently live in areas that experience water scarcity for at least one month a year wwap 2017 this report also illustrates that about 500 million people live in the areas where water consumption exceeds the locally renewable water resources by a factor of two in this context nontraditional water sources including brackish water seawater and mine water can be treated and substituted for potable water to meet demands hightower and pierce 2008 potable water can be produced from these salty waters using many innovative advanced separation technologies which can effectively alleviate this global challenge as a typical example of nontraditional water resources brackish water bw i e moderate salt content tds usually 10000 mg l provides an important resource for the development of new freshwater sources bw desalination has become a major potable water supplement technology in many water deficient inland countries and regions anderson et al 2010 aparicio et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 thus increasing the total useable water in these regions and providing alternative water supplies to meet growing water needs with regard to desalination methods there are two major directions thermal and membrane separation thermal type desalination technologies such as multistage flash msf tubular solar still tss and solar distillation sd use direct heating for evaporation diaf et al 2016 hou et al 2018 khoshrou et al 2017 membrane based systems belong to the category of physical separation processes such as reverse osmosis ro electrodialysis ed electrodeionization edi shock electrodialysis and capacitive deionization cdi alkhadra et al 2020 greenlee et al 2009 ma et al 2018 ortiz et al 2005 pan et al 2018 van der bruggen et al 2003 xu et al 2018 the efficiency of each type depends on the total energy required for salt removal and the method of operation thus the selection of an appropriate desalination process depends upon the energy efficiency bw salinity pure water productivity and cost effectiveness in desalination technologies not involving phase changes ed technology has been recommended for desalting bw when the tds value is 10000 mg l ortiz et al 2008 qasem et al 2018 tanaka 2003 this suggests two regimes in which the ideal separation process can be determined by feed concentration conditions meanwhile the production of dilute water is another important aspect in bw desalination edi exhibits limited purity water production while ed shows high pure water production with slightly higher energy consumption lopez et al 2017 thus ed systems are usually used for bw desalination at the plant scale based on the flexibility and cost effective advantages of ed equipment ed plants by 2014 have been installed worldwide with a capacity of 2 59 million m3 per day ida 2015 in theory ed desalination is a process that uses ion exchange membranes iems to move ions from a dilute compartment to a concentrate compartment under the effects of a voltage potential the specific principle can be interpreted as follows anion and cation exchange membranes aems and cems respectively are arranged alternately when an electric current passes through the stack cations move toward the cathode through the cem but would be trapped by an adjoining aem analogously anions move toward the anode through the aem but would be prevented by a neighboring cem then alternating compartments of dilute and concentrate solutions are formed and desalted water obtained from the dilute compartment after a certain process in practical scale ed brackish water desalination bwed the ed desalting system is usually divided into three categories continuous batch and feed and bleed processes tanaka 2011 among these processes the most fundamental mode is a continuous process also known as one pass flow mode because it could be applied in a large scale ed plant moon et al 2004 tanaka 2012 one of typical continuous bwed stacks consist of two hydraulic stages to develop the desalting path in the ed stack and save electrode area fig 1 the configuration of the two hydraulic stages enables the effluent from each dilute or concentrate compartment in the 1st hydraulic stage to mix again and then redistribute before entering the 2nd hydraulic stage thus an ed stack with two hydraulic stages is helpful for improving the separation effect and the resulting water quality compared with a single hydraulic stage ed stack however energy consumption still needs to be further reduced although it has currently been a focus of attention generally a common energy saving method has been to improve the electrochemical properties of iems which includes the development of new iems and modification of existing iems in practical engineering this also includes the comparison and selection of appropriate iems actually homogeneous iems generally exhibit more favorable electrochemical properties while heterogeneous iems are more robust and cheaper to produce also considering the huge price difference 10 fold between homogeneous and heterogeneous iems it is significant to seek energy efficient strategies based on some technological developments such as the innovation of membrane stack configuration and improvement of inflow technology to date little research has taken into account the impacts of energy saving methods based on technological innovations in the existing literature thus these aspects need further investigation in this study a novel energy efficient bwed system was designed and presented by considering an innovation of a typical bwed stack configuration and optimization of inflow modes the improvement strategies mainly involved enhancement of the electrical conductivity of electrode cells and weakening of concentration polarization compared with a conventional bwed system the desalination performance and energy saving effects of the novel bwed system were systematically analyzed then a multistage operation in a continuous novel bwed system was investigated for desalination performance and energy consumption the results were benchmarked by comparison with the performances of conventional bwed systems the goal of this study was to provide prospects and guidance for technical improvements and energy saving in the bwed process 2 energy efficient mechanisms in ed desalination 2 1 equivalent circuit of resistors to reflect the energy consumption distribution in an ed stack more intuitively the analysis of resistance r is based on a description of ion movement in the stack shown in fig 2 when the anode and cathode plates are connected with a direct current dc stabilized voltage supply oxidation reduction reactions occurred at the interface between the anode cathode plate and the electrolyte and then a direct current electric field formed in the ed stack to promote the directional ion migration the paths that the electric current can take mainly included the electrodes solutions electrolyte dilute and concentrate membranes cems and aems and relevant boundary layers herein we classified the solutions and boundary layers into relevant compartments meanwhile the electrode resistances of both anode and cathode plates were considered as a part of the resistance of their relevant electrode cell correspondingly the total system resistance was simplified to the anode cell resistance r an cell cem resistance r cem concentrate cell resistance r ci cell aem resistance r aem dilute cell resistance r di cell and cathode cell resistance r ca cell the total resistance of an ed stack was then calculated using the expression n is the number of repeating units 1 r s t a c k ω r a n c e l l n r c e m r c i c e l l r a e m r d i c e l l r c a c e l l thus for reducing energy consumption of a bwed desalination process the focus was not only on improving the electrochemical performance of iems materials but also on reducing the resistances of the dilute concentrate and electrode cells considering the perspective of innovative ed stack configuration and optimal inflow mode to date the performance of continuous bwed desalination processes has been the focus of many studies concentrating on the development and selection of iems materials and the optimization of operation parameters feed water concentration flow rate applied voltage etc which have accomplished many advances chakrabarty et al 2011 nayar et al 2016 pismenskaya et al 2018 shah et al 2018 tong et al 2016 however it was also meaningful to seek energy efficient strategies based on the innovation of membrane stack configuration and inflow technology for reducing the resistances of electrode and dilute concentrate cells 2 2 challenge and energy efficient strategies for bwed 2 2 1 reduction of voltage drop in electrode cells in an ed stack the electrodes cathode and anode can be regarded as a bridge between the first and second type conductors electronic and ionic conductors respectively that is in the external circuit of ed the current is caused by electron movement and the current of the internal circuit caused entirely by ion movement this change in electrical conduction occurs on the electrode surface and depends on the corresponding oxidation and reduction reactions the main steps of the electrode reaction in electrode cells are as follows 1 by means of electro migration and diffusion in which ions are transferred from the electrolyte body to boundary layer near the electrode surface and 2 electron transfer the process of gaining and losing electrons on electrode surfaces to generate corresponding reaction products in essence there is an inevitable relationship between the r an ca cell and the voltage drop in electrode cells therefore on the one hand the proportion of the voltage drop in the total voltage drop should be reduced as much as possible to improve the current efficiency and reduce the electrode energy consumption filling with ion exchange resin instead of spacer should facilitate ionic transfer in electrode cells and thus be beneficial for reducing the voltage drop compared to the conventional spacer iers are incorporated into the electrode cells to provide a well pathway for enhanced ion migration thus iers increase conductivity across the process channel although the strategy of resin filled in electrode cell has been partly used in industrial edi stack to our knowledge the use of this strategy in ed stack has not been reported this could therefore be seen as a worthwhile attempt to save energy on the other hand it was significant that gas was produced by the electrode reaction in a conventional bwed system the anolyte and catholyte are usually supplied in a series flow in a series inflow mode the electrolyte flows through the cathode cell to the anode cell thus the gases produced by the cathode reaction mix in the anode cell which might lead to a problem as the gases residence time produced by electrode reactions in the cell was extended then the electrode reactions of the cathode cell were negatively affected by the retained gas and the electrode cell resistance increased furthermore the uniformity of current distribution in ed stack could be affected for example it has been reported that the bubble resistance has a significant effect on the performance of a large scale reverse electrodialysis red system han et al 2019 therefore a parallel inflow mode for the electrolyte should be employed 2 2 2 retardation of concentration polarization there are two main reasons for concentration polarization in the ed process first is the decreased ionic concentration in the dilute boundary layer and differences in the counter ion transport numbers between the membrane phase and solution body tanaka 1991 bouhidel and oulmi 2000 one noteworthy fact was that reducing the boundary layer thickness was beneficial for delaying concentration polarization tanaka 2004 has further indicated that the boundary layer thickness in a dilute cell δ is a function of the flow rate that is δ has been plotted against the surface linear velocity u in a dilute cell with δ decreased with increased u thus a moderate increase in the flow rate was conducive for reducing the concentration polarization between the membrane and bulk flow as mentioned before one of the conventional ed stack configuration for continuous desalination usually consists of two hydraulic stages it is possible to reduce the use of electrodes and external pipelines and improve the resulting dilute quality the use of a reversing spacer inside a two hydraulic ed stack can change the flow direction traditionally both the 1st and 2nd hydraulic stages have an equal number of repeating cell pairs thus the surface linear velocity and operating current of each hydraulic stage are the same but the dilute concentration decreases and the concentration multiple expands step by step when the reversing spacer in ed stack moves moderately towards the 2nd hydraulic stage the number of cell pairs in the 1st hydraulic stage increased and the number of cell pairs of the second hydraulic stage decreased however the total cell pairs of the ed stack with two hydraulic stages and the inflow rate were constant as shown in fig 3 thus the surface linear velocity inside the cells of the 2nd hydraulic stage increases and then the boundary layer thickness starts to shrink this positive role consequently retards concentration polarization and thus reduces the ionic resistance of the dilute compartments also the velocity inside the 1st hydraulic cells decreases and consequently the ionic resistance of the 1st hydraulic cells increases however this negative influence is very small on the total internal stack resistance because the average salinity of the dilute outflow in 1st hydraulic stage is relatively high besides several studies have shown that lcd is positively correlated to dilute concentration barragán and ruı z bauzá 1998 fu et al 2005 thus the phenomenon involving lcd changes was mainly affected by the 2nd hydraulic stage because the dilute stream concentration of 2nd hydraulic stage was lower this asymmetric design can therefore improve the limiting current density lcd of the 2nd hydraulic stage such that the lcds of the two hydraulic stages are basically the same thus preventing concentration polarization of the 2nd hydraulic stage from occurring thereby reducing the overall internal stack resistance and achieving the purpose of energy saving during bwed in addition this design allows reduced stack resistance by decreasing the 2nd hydraulic cells boundary layer thickness without increasing pumping energy 2 2 3 improvement of the concentration difference distribution the inflow mode co current flow or counter flow of the dilute concentrate streams might have also played a valuable role for reducing the resistance of dilute concentrate cells in a conventional co current flow ed system the maximum concentrations are similar at the inlet and then gradually diverge as ions are transported from the dilute to concentrate cells thus the phenomena of concentration difference diffusion and water leakage are serious near the outlet because of the increasing salinity difference this could be limits the current efficiency and salt removal ratio of dilute compartments thereby increasing desalination energy consumption near the outlet this is mainly because of the nonideal selectivity of iems in particular for an ed stack with two hydraulic stage features the phenomenon of concentration diffusion becomes increasingly serious due to the extension of the flow channel in short in a two hydraulic stage ed desalination system the ionic diffusion from the concentrate to the dilute cell back diffusion becomes a considerable source of more energy loss especially in the 2nd hydraulic stage however when operating in a counter flow mode the concentrations of the dilute and concentrate are high on one end and low at the other which could lead to a better distribution of concentration profiles over the system length and thereby reduce the energy consumption of an ed desalination system chehayeb et al 2018 this is mainly because that a better distribution of chemical potential difference could be achieved in a counter flow mode compared with the co current flow mode fig 4 admittedly the advantage of the co current flow mode was that a hydraulic pressure balance between the dilute and concentrate streams was easier to maintain and the hydraulic pressure directly related to the dilute and concentrate inflow rates in a continuous bwed process the surface velocity is usually set to a lower level because it is limited by the ionic residence time in the channel and iem ion exchange capacity that is to say the hydraulic pressure could also be maintained at a lower value in a continuous bwed process especially when heterogeneous ion exchange membranes were applied this appeared to suggest that operating in counter flow mode can be expected to improve the desalination performance of bwed with two hydraulic stages 2 2 4 energy efficient strategies in this study with the goal of reducing the resistances of electrode and dilute concentrate cells and thus save desalination energy the influence of stack configurations and inflow modes were considered for improving the energy efficiency of a typical bwed process table 1 compared to the conventional bwed system fig 1 energy saving strategies mainly include four plans the resin filled electrode cells configuration asymmetric cell pair design parallel inflow mode of electrolytes and counter inflow mode of dilute and concentrate thus a novel two hydraulic stage ed system for bw desalination was formed the analysis of this novel ed system was based on several performance parameters including ionic migration rate mr salt removal ratio sr energy consumption ec and energy saving ratio esr 3 experimental setup and methods 3 1 experimental apparatus different laboratory scale ed systems were manufactured in house in the section regarding the examination of energy efficient strategies the ed membrane stack was designed as a single electrical stage and two hydraulic stage with 20 cell pairs the cell pairs were conventionally arranged in 10 10 for two hydraulic stages i e ten each for the 1st and 2nd hydraulic stages specifically the ed stack was composed of two electrodes cationic exchange membranes cems anionic exchange membranes aems and electrodialysis spacers both cathodes and anodes were platinum plated titanium electrodes twenty one pairs cems and twenty pairs aems were installed alternately in the stack an additional cem was placed adjacent to the electrodes every membrane in ed stack was separated by a polypropylene pp spacer 10 30 cm with a thickness of 0 90 mm and an effective area of 158 cm2 based on the ed stack system above a continuous ed desalination process was used to investigate the feasibility of the proposed energy efficient strategies and for comparative analysis of the conventional and novel ed systems performances during a multistage bwed process a schematic diagram of the single stage and multistage ed experimental apparatus is shown in fig 5 artificial bw was prepared using sodium chloride bohua chemical technology co ltd tianjin china and deionized water in house ro edi pure water device resistance 15 mω cm each electrode was rinsed by circulation in an electrolyte containing 0 3 wt na2so4 using a flow rate of 5 l h the artificial bw was pumped into dilute and concentrate compartments using a diaphragm pump fig 5a at the same time the conductivities and flow rates of the feed water dilute and concentrate waters were all monitored using online conductivity meters and rotating flow meters after ed desalination the dilute and concentrate were mixed and returned to the bw tank samples at specific times were collected for chloride ion determination all ed stacks used consisted of twenty cell pairs with two hydraulic stages as a multistage ed desalination process fig 5b in particular the dilute concentrate outlet from the 1st stage of the ed system was used as the dilute concentrate inlet of the 2nd stage of the ed system and progressed in a similar fashion 3 2 materials the ion exchange membranes iems used in this study were provided by lanran environmental technology co ltd hangzhou china the ion exchange resins iers including gel type 001 7 cation resins and gel type 201 7 anion resins were purchased from dow chemical co midland mi usa the performance parameters of iems and iers are listed in table 2 and the main instruments used for this study shown in table 3 the preparation of resin filled electrode cell is schematically shown in fig 6 firstly we designed and made an electrode plate frame with concave style the concave down depth of electrode plate was set as two sizes 1 mm and 2 mm for the comparative study of resin filled thickness the specification of the fame was 300 mm 100 mm 20 mm length width height and the effective area of electrode plate was 158 cm2 specially a structure of water distribution slots was designed and fixed on the electrode plate at the outlet of electrolyte the functions of slots are to provide a flow path for the electrolyte to flow in and out of the electrode cell and meanwhile to prevent leakage of the resin from the electrode cell secondly the mixed bed ion exchange resins were filled in both anode and cathode cells and the volume ratio of cation and anion exchange resins was set to 1 1 at the same time the filled resins were compacted and scraped flat with a plastic ruler then the electrode fame in which ion exchange resins were filled together with its adjacent cation exchange membrane formed a cell so called resin filled electrode cell 3 3 experimental design this study focused on developing a novel energy efficient ed system for bw desalination thus feasible energy saving strategies mentioned in section 2 were first investigated and then a multistage novel ed system for continuous bw desalination evaluated and compared with a conventional ed system the ed systems were fed with a 3500 mg l nacl solution representing bw all measurements in the first part of this study were performed at a flow rate of 20 l h in both the dilute and concentrate streams the specific operating conditions for optimization of the ed process parameters are illustrated in table 4 otherwise the operating conditions of continuous multistage ed desalination experiments based on optimized parameters were included in the discussion 3 4 analytical methods the conductivity of samples was measured using an online conductivity meter chloride was analyzed by the silver nitrate titration method astm d512 89 1999 usa chen et al 2018 and then sodium determined by electrically balancing solution ions liu et al 2016 3 5 data analysis 3 5 1 ionic migration rate the ionic migration rate mr represented the rate of ions transported across iems by a given current it was calculated using equation 2 2 mr mmol m 2 s c 0 c t q n a where c 0 and c t mmol l are the initial and final concentration of sodium of dilute outlet respectively q is the inlet flow rate of dilute l h n and a are the number of membrane pairs in ed stack and the effective area of an individual ion exchange membrane m2 respectively 3 5 2 salt removal ratio within a select range the ionic concentration of the salt solution was proportional to its conductivity therefore solution conductivity was used to calculate the salt removal ratio sr instead of the solution s ionic concentration zhao et al 2019 this was accomplished using the equation 3 sr 1 c t c 0 100 where c 0 ms cm and c t ms cm are the initial and final conductivity of the dilute solutions respectively 3 5 3 energy consumption the energy consumption ec to produce one cubic meter of dilute water is an indispensable parameter for the economic evaluation of an ed process this value was obtained using the equation 4 ec kwh m 3 u i q where u i and q are the operating voltage v corresponding current a and the output flow rate l h of dilute in the ed process respectively 3 5 4 energy saving ratio esr the energy saving ratio esr during the optimization process was an important parameter used to assess energy saving performance this value was calculated using 5 esr 1 e c 2 e c 1 100 where ec 1 and ec 2 are the energy consumption kw h m3 in the conventional ed process and the energy consumption kw h m3 in the optimized ed process respectively 4 results and discussion this study mainly focused on developing a novel energy efficient ed system for bw desalination based on an innovation of the ed stack configuration and optimization of inflow pattern first the feasibility of energy saving strategies mentioned in section 2 were compared with the conventional ed system changes in stack resistance sodium migration rate relative dilute outlet concentrations and the relationship between salt removal ratio and energy consumption were compared by varying the operating voltage otherwise the energy saving ratio esr was evaluated for synergistic effects of the energy saving strategies second the effects of inflow rate on limited current density and energy consumption were examined at the optimal inflow rate a three stage desalination process in a novel ed system and ced system were compared and analyzed the lcd relationship to the inflow rate and ed stage was investigated and the maximum salt removal ratio assessed operating at 95 lcd value in each stage 4 1 examination of energy saving strategies 4 1 1 effects of electrode cell configuration in this section the desalination performances of different systems were compared experimentally focusing on different electrode cell configurations conventional spacer filled and resin filled electrode cells the resin filling strategy was also examined the effects of electrode cell configuration on the resistance of an ed stack and na migration rate were evaluated at the same inflow rate of 20 l h surface flow velocity of 0 8 cm s the correlative curves are shown in fig 7 a in which error bars were added to represent standard deviation of the stack resistance ionic migration rate dilute outlet and energy consumption to verify experiment repeatability the stack resistance was calculated using ohm s law from the stack voltage and current the resistance of the stack was observed to decrease with increased applied voltage in the low voltage stage and then ran smoothly moreover compared with the conventional electrode cell configuration spacer filled with the thickness of 1 mm the resin filled electrode cells effectively reduced the stack resistance because the addition of ion exchange resins facilitates ions transfer in electrode cell the na migration rate in the resin filled electrode cell configuration was also seen to be better than that of conventional electrode cells this confirmed that the introduction of ion exchange resins into electrode cells effectively reduced the stack resistance and enhanced ion transport based on the research of ganzi et al 1987 the electric conductivity of resin is about two or three orders of magnitude larger than that of water phase under the condition of lower salinity then the filled resin could be providing a better pathway for ionic transfer in electrode cells thus electrode cell resistance was effectively reduced and more current used for the directional migration of target ions to further illustrate the energy saving effects of the new type electrode cell configuration the relative dilute outlet concentrations to feed concentration c t c 0 and salt removal ratio energy consumption relationship sr ec curve for electrode cell configurations with different resin filled strategies are shown in fig 7b the trends of the c t c 0 curves with applied voltage were the same i e they decreased with applied voltage at the same applied voltage lower outlet values in the dilute stream were obtained using a resin filled electrode cell configuration in contrast energy consumption values increased gradually with increasing salt removal ratio it was clearly seen that energy consumption was relatively low at the condition of resin filled electrode cells and the thin resin filled strategy filling thickness 1 mm could further reduce energy consumption at the same salt removal ratio therefore these results indicated that the thin resin filled electrode cell configuration could reduce the energy consumption in the bwed process 4 1 2 effects of asymmetric cell pair design as described in section 2 2 2 through an asymmetric cell pair design between the 1st and 2nd hydraulic stages namely the proper backward shift of the commutator plate a self increase of the 2nd stage flow rate in the ed stack was realized thus improvement of the entire concentration difference distribution in the ed system was achieved in this section different degrees of asymmetric cell pair design were applied for evaluating the effectiveness of this energy saving strategy specific experimental conditions are shown in table 4 examination of the variations in running resistance and ionic migration rate with various applied voltages to various asymmetric cell pair design showed that the running resistance curves decreased drastically and then became nearly steady with increased cell pair voltage fig 8 a in particular when the same cell pair voltage was applied the order of resistance was r 11 9 r 12 8 r 13 7 r 10 10 this indicated that an asymmetric cell pair design reduced the ed stack resistance to some extent and greater current used for counter ion transport in terms of improvements in the ionic migration rate mr mr enhancement reached a maximum under the condition of 1st 2nd hydraulic stage cell pairs being 11 9 and exhibited a minimum at 13 7 to evaluate the energy efficient effects of the asymmetric cell pair design described above a comparative study was performed and presented in this section described in terms of the relative dilute outlet concentrations to feed concentration c t c 0 and the dependence of energy consumption on the salt removal ratio comparison of the results clearly showed that relatively low values of c t c 0 were obtained under the conditions of the present asymmetric cell pair design fig 8b however the value of c t c 0 increased with decreased cell pairs in the 2nd hydraulic stage and increased cell pairs of the 1st hydraulic stage this asymmetric cell pair design strategy appeared to present almost no energy savings when the design of 1st 2nd hydraulic stage cell pairs was 13 7 this result was mainly because that the asymmetric design resulted in a decrease in the surface linear velocity of the 1st hydraulic stage and a rise in the surface linear velocity of the 2nd hydraulic stage at the same inlet flow rate the concentration diffusion distribution in the 2nd hydraulic stage was improved while the concentration diffusion distribution of 1st hydraulic stage became unfavorable in other words an asymmetric design should be carried out in moderation according to the above discussion it was concluded that lower energy consumption at a same salt removal ratio could be obtained at the design of 1st 2nd hydraulic stage cell pairs at 11 9 i e the ratio of the cell pairs of the two hydraulic stages should be 1 2 4 1 3 effects of inflow modes of electrolyte and feed water in this section an initial comparative study was performed firstly concerning electrolyte flow modes then the improved effects of the counter flow mode were evaluated in addition there was no significant hydraulic pressure difference 0 03 mpa in this study between the dilute and concentrate cells when the inflow mode operated in counter flow desalination characteristics of an ed stack with electrolyte parallel flow mode as well as counter flow mode for the dilute concentrate streams showed that changes in these two inflow modes reduced the running resistance and somewhat promoted ion transport fig 9 a the influence of electrolytes connected in parallel mode was relatively minor concerning the running resistance and ionic migration rate compared with the counter flow mode of dilute concentrate streams for electrolytes operated in parallel mode the useful work by voltage between two electrode plates that was used to convert electric energy was enhanced this was mainly attributed to the gas produced by the relevant electrode reaction being discharged in time the enhancement of ionic migration in electrode cells promoted the transition from electronic to ionic conduction the driving force of ion migration was then increased under the same electric field condition which meant that the electric energy conversion rate was suitably increased using electrolyte inflow in parallel mode otherwise in the case of dilute concentrate streams operating in counter flow the cell voltage required to overcome the back diffusion of concentration difference was reduced as is known the lcd was caused by a concentration polarization in a boundary layer formed at the surface between the dilute and ion exchange membrane and the concentration polarization degree enhanced with increases concentration differences between dilute and concentrate cells with regard to the feed streams counter flow operations resulted in a visibly lower concentration difference between the dilute and concentrate outlets although it increased the concentration difference between the dilute and concentrate inlets for further evaluation of which inflow mode was more appropriate the evolution of the dilute outlet stream was examined as a function of the applied voltage and the relationship between the salt removal ratio and energy consumption fig 9b both electrolyte inflows in parallel mode and dilute concentrate streams operating in counter flow mode were observed to improve the dilute stream compared with conventional inflow mode the resulting curves also highlighted the dependence of energy consumption on the salt removal ratio for a bwed system using different inflow modes a certain energy saving effect was clearly observed to be achieved through optimization of the inflow mode according to which a lower ionic transfer resistance as well as a better distribution of the chemical potential difference fostered energy consumption reduction in addition the energy efficient strategy of the counter flow was more effective than that of electrolyte inflows with parallel mode 4 1 4 synergistic effects of energy efficient strategies based on the above discussion a novel ed system was obtained with two hydraulic stages involving energy saving designs in ed stack configuration resin filled electrode cells and asymmetric cell pair design and inflow mode electrolytes with parallel inflow mode and feed streams with counter flow mode fig 10 a then the synergistic effects of energy efficient strategies were further investigated at 20 l h of inflow rate for the dilute concentrate the energy consumption salt removal ratio relationship for the two ed systems and the energy saving ratio of the novel ed system showed that this novel ed system with two hydraulic stages exhibited notably lower energy consumption than the conventional ed system with two hydraulic stages at a same salt removal ratio fig 10b this also indicated that the novel ed system achieved a higher salt removal ratio than the conventional ed system at the same energy output compared to the conventional ed system this new system reflected convenient operating for identifying an optimal ed desalination system the energy saving effects of the novel ed system for bw desalination were further illustrated in a more intuitive manner with the energy saving ratio of the novel ed system also calculated it was clear that at the same salt removal ratio this novel ed system could save 40 of energy consumption compared with the conventional ed system by converting bw into potable water this novel ed system appeared to be a feasible technology for further saving energy in bwed systems 4 2 examination of multistage novel ed systems for continuous bw desalination in all cases discussed in section 4 1 the dilute had not yet reached the who guideline for drinking water quality tds 500 mg l this was mainly limited by the length of the experimental ed channel to further illustrate the energy saving effects of the present novel ed system in the whole bwed process tds of bw reduced from 3500 to 500 mg l multistage operations were carried out in this section the inflow rate was first optimized based on the novel ed system and then the desalination performances of the conventional and the novel ed systems were compared at the optimized flow rate to reach full desalination the lcd value per ed stage investigated when operated at 95 lcd in each stage to assess the maximum salt removal ratio and total energy consumption 4 2 1 determination of inlet flow the determination of the proper flow rate is crucial in a continuous bwed process because the surface linear velocity directly determines the ionic residence time and affects the concentration boundary layer thickness with the electrolyte both anolyte and catholyte flow rate was kept at 5 l h four different dilute concentrate flow rates 10 15 20 and 25 l h were studied at room temperature in terms of parameters the stack resistance the na migration rate the dilute outlet and the dependence of energy consumption on salt removal ratio were evaluated fig 11 a and b through analysis of the r v characteristic curves at different flow rate conditions it was clearly seen that the stack resistance decreased with increased flow rate which was mainly because the residence time decreased at higher flow rate and therefore the average conductivity within the stack was higher another cause was that the turbulent extent as well as uniform distribution of the solution in the dilute and concentrate cells was improved with rising flow rate these hydrodynamic factors showed a positive effect on reducing the boundary layer thickness of membrane surfaces and speeding up the counter ion migration rate fig 11b however the degree of decline in the stack resistance was also observed to gradually decrease with increased flow rate this was mainly because beyond a certain range the feed flow rate did not clearly contribute to the ion fluxes which has been confirmed by demircioǧ lu et al 2001 a similar conclusion was drawn here from changes in ion migration rates in addition increased flow rates led directly to reduced ionic residence times and a larger operating voltage or current was required to produce the same desalination effect in other words the inflow rate was positively correlated with the desalted water yield at the same salt removal ratio for the same ed equipment although increased flow rate increased the ionic migration rate to a certain extent the volumetric amount of feed water i e bw in this study needed to achieve the same salt removal ratio per unit time also increased thus excessive increase in flow rate had an adverse impact on fresh water quality and energy consumption in a continuous bwed process although the pumping energy was not considered fig 11b in addition the lcd was measured at various inflow rates following a commonly used procedure isaacson and sonin 1976 wright et al 2018 and the lcd values shown in part a of the supplementary material the results from these lcd tests for the novel ed system with different feed flow rates showed that the lcd as a function of feed flow rate ranged from 10 to 25 l h namely the lcd value increased with increased flow rate figs s1 and 11c furthermore to select the feed flow more reasonably the corresponding salt removal ratio and energy consumption at 95 operating condition of the corresponding lcd were examined and it clearly seen that the salt removal ratio was basically the same 50 at all inflow rate conditions fig 11d however the energy consumption at 15 l h was the lowest at 0 164 kwh m3 which was lower than that at 25 l h as a result it was beneficial for the desalination process flow rate to be set at 15 l h 4 2 2 comparison of desalting performance between the novel and conventional ed systems based on the optimized flow rate in section 4 2 1 15 l h of dilute as well as a concentrate stream was selected for comparing with the desalting performance of the novel and conventional ed systems for the two ed systems lcd was first measured for each stage and then the working current density for each stage adjusted to 95 of this value to achieve the maximum desalination degree in the multistage ed system the detailed measurement process of each lcd values listed in fig s2 and fig s3 of supplementary material a the comparisons of desalination performance of the different ed systems are depicted in fig 12 and the details discussed below the 95 lcd value for each electrical stage of the two ed systems were basically similar and the lcd value decreased with increased electrical stage in the multistage ed process fig 12a this was mainly due to the continued decrease of the ionic concentration in the dilute stream nevertheless the cell pair voltage corresponding to the lcd value was significantly different with the cell pair voltage corresponding to the lcd value of the novel ed system being significantly lower than that of the conventional ed system this meant that improvements in this novel ed system could be attributed to a decrease in the required voltage for reaching a same level of limited current density this conclusion was verified from another perspective i e the running resistance was reduced for each electrical stage of the ed stack when the novel ed system was adapted fig 12b also the salt removal ratio per electrical stage of the two ed systems were basically similar because of the approximate operating current densities and the salt removal ratio of the two systems reached 89 specifically the dilute as well as concentrate outlet concentrations changed according to the applied current density per ed stage fig 12c clearly the outlet concentration changed per stage of the novel system corresponded mostly to that of the conventional system this also indicated that the novel system had little effect on the produced water quality in each electrical stage compared with the ced system that is to say the produced fresh water qualities of the two ed systems were basically the same in this context the energy consumption of each electrical stage and the total energy consumption of each multistage ed system were fully investigated fig 12d this illustrated that the energy consumption of each stage of the novel system was lower than that of corresponding stage of the conventional system also the total energy consumption of multistage operation was reduced from 1 937 to 1 223 kwh m3 by replacing the conventional system with the novel system i e the energy saved was up to 0 714 kwh m3 the energy efficient effects of the novel ed system were clearly demonstrated by examining the energy saving ratio esr for the novel system relative to the conventional system fig 13 the esr value of the 1st stage was observed to reach 43 6 but the esr values of the 2nd and 3rd stage were decreased to 22 5 and 18 8 respectively however a 36 9 for the total esr was achieved using the novel system when desalting bw from 3500 mg l to drinking water quality 450 mg l in this study compared with the conventional system this fully demonstrated the effectiveness of the energy saving strategies proposed in this study in order to reflect the desalination performance of the novel ed system more intuitively table 5 also compares the performance of different electro driven membrane processes for brackish water desalination in the case of edi processes for brackish water desalination with similar feed concentrations the energy consumption was obviously higher than that of the novel ed system with regard to ed assembled by homogeneous membrane the energy consumptions were close to that of the novel ed system with heterogeneous membrane these results show that the novel ed system can be considered as an energy efficient technology among various desalination processes the present findings indicated that these energy saving strategies provided a new perspective and scientific guidance for saving energy in ed processes 5 conclusions in this study a novel two hydraulic stage ed system was presented that was designed to reduce energy consumption many feasible innovations of stack configurations and inflow modes were selected for improving energy efficiency in the bwed process feed concentration with 3500 mg l which were then systematically examined to assess their energy saving properties in the bwed process first by innovating membrane stack configurations resin filled electrode cells and antisymmetric cell pairs design an obvious energy saving effect was achieved through using thin resin filled 1 mm electrode cells and an asymmetric cell pair design velocity ratio of 1st and 2nd hydraulic stages 1 2 at various salt removal efficiencies general inflow mode optimizations such as electrolyte parallel flows and dilute concentrate counter flow were also beneficial in saving energy it was confirmed that these strategies reduced 10 30 of energy consumption at a same salt removal ratio second this novel ed system based on synergistic effects of these strategies was demonstrated and the results indicated that it could save 40 of energy consumption at the same salt removal ratio compared with conventional 2 hydraulic ed system ced with regard to three stage continuous bwed performance tests compared with ced this new system exhibited an obvious decrease in the voltage required for reaching the same level of lcd thus the running resistance in each stage was reduced and the energy saving in the bwed process realized specifically a 36 9 energy consumption saving was achieved using the novel ed system with bw desalting from 3500 mg l to drinking water quality 450 mg l this also indicated that this novel ed system did not remarkably change the dilute or concentrate concentration at all stages but only improved desalination efficiency it was therefore possible to open the way for overcoming the energy intensive aspect of state of the art

17890,electrodialysis ed is a well established brackish water bw desalination technology that has been commercially applied for decades however the energy efficiency of bwed cannot approach optimization because of the low salt concentration of bw in this study a novel two hydraulic stage ed desalination system was presented to enhance mass transfer and reduce energy consumption in terms of energy efficient strategies it involved not only innovative membrane stack configurations resin filled electrode cells and asymmetric cell pairs design but also optimizing inflow modes electrolytes parallel flow and dilute concentrate counter flow results showed that thin resin filled 1 mm electrode cells asymmetric cell pair design cell pairs ratio of 1st and 2nd hydraulic stages 1 2 and

efficient stack configuration inflow mode 1 introduction with the continuous development of world s economy and society as well as the growth of global population the world is facing severe freshwater scarcity the gulf between the supply and demand for freshwater will continue to deteriorate in the coming years mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 rodell et al 2018 the united nations world water development report 2017 indicates that two thirds of the global population currently live in areas that experience water scarcity for at least one month a year wwap 2017 this report also illustrates that about 500 million people live in the areas where water consumption exceeds the locally renewable water resources by a factor of two in this context nontraditional water sources including brackish water seawater and mine water can be treated and substituted for potable water to meet demands hightower and pierce 2008 potable water can be produced from these salty waters using many innovative advanced separation technologies which can effectively alleviate this global challenge as a typical example of nontraditional water resources brackish water bw i e moderate salt content tds usually 10000 mg l provides an important resource for the development of new freshwater sources bw desalination has become a major potable water supplement technology in many water deficient inland countries and regions anderson et al 2010 aparicio et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 thus increasing the total useable water in these regions and providing alternative water supplies to meet growing water needs with regard to desalination methods there are two major directions thermal and membrane separation thermal type desalination technologies such as multistage flash msf tubular solar still tss and solar distillation sd use direct heating for evaporation diaf et al 2016 hou et al 2018 khoshrou et al 2017 membrane based systems belong to the category of physical separation processes such as reverse osmosis ro electrodialysis ed electrodeionization edi shock electrodialysis and capacitive deionization cdi alkhadra et al 2020 greenlee et al 2009 ma et al 2018 ortiz et al 2005 pan et al 2018 van der bruggen et al 2003 xu et al 2018 the efficiency of each type depends on the total energy required for salt removal and the method of operation thus the selection of an appropriate desalination process depends upon the energy efficiency bw salinity pure water productivity and cost effectiveness in desalination technologies not involving phase changes ed technology has been recommended for desalting bw when the tds value is 10000 mg l ortiz et al 2008 qasem et al 2018 tanaka 2003 this suggests two regimes in which the ideal separation process can be determined by feed concentration conditions meanwhile the production of dilute water is another important aspect in bw desalination edi exhibits limited purity water production while ed shows high pure water production with slightly higher energy consumption lopez et al 2017 thus ed systems are usually used for bw desalination at the plant scale based on the flexibility and cost effective advantages of ed equipment ed plants by 2014 have been installed worldwide with a capacity of 2 59 million m3 per day ida 2015 in theory ed desalination is a process that uses ion exchange membranes iems to move ions from a dilute compartment to a concentrate compartment under the effects of a voltage potential the specific principle can be interpreted as follows anion and cation exchange membranes aems and cems respectively are arranged alternately when an electric current passes through the stack cations move toward the cathode through the cem but would be trapped by an adjoining aem analogously anions move toward the anode through the aem but would be prevented by a neighboring cem then alternating compartments of dilute and concentrate solutions are formed and desalted water obtained from the dilute compartment after a certain process in practical scale ed brackish water desalination bwed the ed desalting system is usually divided into three categories continuous batch and feed and bleed processes tanaka 2011 among these processes the most fundamental mode is a continuous process also known as one pass flow mode because it could be applied in a large scale ed plant moon et al 2004 tanaka 2012 one of typical continuous bwed stacks consist of two hydraulic stages to develop the desalting path in the ed stack and save electrode area fig 1 the configuration of the two hydraulic stages enables the effluent from each dilute or concentrate compartment in the 1st hydraulic stage to mix again and then redistribute before entering the 2nd hydraulic stage thus an ed stack with two hydraulic stages is helpful for improving the separation effect and the resulting water quality compared with a single hydraulic stage ed stack however energy consumption still needs to be further reduced although it has currently been a focus of attention generally a common energy saving method has been to improve the electrochemical properties of iems which includes the development of new iems and modification of existing iems in practical engineering this also includes the comparison and selection of appropriate iems actually homogeneous iems generally exhibit more favorable electrochemical properties while heterogeneous iems are more robust and cheaper to produce also considering the huge price difference 10 fold between homogeneous and heterogeneous iems it is significant to seek energy efficient strategies based on some technological developments such as the innovation of membrane stack configuration and improvement of inflow technology to date little research has taken into account the impacts of energy saving methods based on technological innovations in the existing literature thus these aspects need further investigation in this study a novel energy efficient bwed system was designed and presented by considering an innovation of a typical bwed stack configuration and optimization of inflow modes the improvement strategies mainly involved enhancement of the electrical conductivity of electrode cells and weakening of concentration polarization compared with a conventional bwed system the desalination performance and energy saving effects of the novel bwed system were systematically analyzed then a multistage operation in a continuous novel bwed system was investigated for desalination performance and energy consumption the results were benchmarked by comparison with the performances of conventional bwed systems the goal of this study was to provide prospects and guidance for technical improvements and energy saving in the bwed process 2 energy efficient mechanisms in ed desalination 2 1 equivalent circuit of resistors to reflect the energy consumption distribution in an ed stack more intuitively the analysis of resistance r is based on a description of ion movement in the stack shown in fig 2 when the anode and cathode plates are connected with a direct current dc stabilized voltage supply oxidation reduction reactions occurred at the interface between the anode cathode plate and the electrolyte and then a direct current electric field formed in the ed stack to promote the directional ion migration the paths that the electric current can take mainly included the electrodes solutions electrolyte dilute and concentrate membranes cems and aems and relevant boundary layers herein we classified the solutions and boundary layers into relevant compartments meanwhile the electrode resistances of both anode and cathode plates were considered as a part of the resistance of their relevant electrode cell correspondingly the total system resistance was simplified to the anode cell resistance r an cell cem resistance r cem concentrate cell resistance r ci cell aem resistance r aem dilute cell resistance r di cell and cathode cell resistance r ca cell the total resistance of an ed stack was then calculated using the expression n is the number of repeating units 1 r s t a c k ω r a n c e l l n r c e m r c i c e l l r a e m r d i c e l l r c a c e l l thus for reducing energy consumption of a bwed desalination process the focus was not only on improving the electrochemical performance of iems materials but also on reducing the resistances of the dilute concentrate and electrode cells considering the perspective of innovative ed stack configuration and optimal inflow mode to date the performance of continuous bwed desalination processes has been the focus of many studies concentrating on the development and selection of iems materials and the optimization of operation parameters feed water concentration flow rate applied voltage etc which have accomplished many advances chakrabarty et al 2011 nayar et al 2016 pismenskaya et al 2018 shah et al 2018 tong et al 2016 however it was also meaningful to seek energy efficient strategies based on the innovation of membrane stack configuration and inflow technology for reducing the resistances of electrode and dilute concentrate cells 2 2 challenge and energy efficient strategies for bwed 2 2 1 reduction of voltage drop in electrode cells in an ed stack the electrodes cathode and anode can be regarded as a bridge between the first and second type conductors electronic and ionic conductors respectively that is in the external circuit of ed the current is caused by electron movement and the current of the internal circuit caused entirely by ion movement this change in electrical conduction occurs on the electrode surface and depends on the corresponding oxidation and reduction reactions the main steps of the electrode reaction in electrode cells are as follows 1 by means of electro migration and diffusion in which ions are transferred from the electrolyte body to boundary layer near the electrode surface and 2 electron transfer the process of gaining and losing electrons on electrode surfaces to generate corresponding reaction products in essence there is an inevitable relationship between the r an ca cell and the voltage drop in electrode cells therefore on the one hand the proportion of the voltage drop in the total voltage drop should be reduced as much as possible to improve the current efficiency and reduce the electrode energy consumption filling with ion exchange resin instead of spacer should facilitate ionic transfer in electrode cells and thus be beneficial for reducing the voltage drop compared to the conventional spacer iers are incorporated into the electrode cells to provide a well pathway for enhanced ion migration thus iers increase conductivity across the process channel although the strategy of resin filled in electrode cell has been partly used in industrial edi stack to our knowledge the use of this strategy in ed stack has not been reported this could therefore be seen as a worthwhile attempt to save energy on the other hand it was significant that gas was produced by the electrode reaction in a conventional bwed system the anolyte and catholyte are usually supplied in a series flow in a series inflow mode the electrolyte flows through the cathode cell to the anode cell thus the gases produced by the cathode reaction mix in the anode cell which might lead to a problem as the gases residence time produced by electrode reactions in the cell was extended then the electrode reactions of the cathode cell were negatively affected by the retained gas and the electrode cell resistance increased furthermore the uniformity of current distribution in ed stack could be affected for example it has been reported that the bubble resistance has a significant effect on the performance of a large scale reverse electrodialysis red system han et al 2019 therefore a parallel inflow mode for the electrolyte should be employed 2 2 2 retardation of concentration polarization there are two main reasons for concentration polarization in the ed process first is the decreased ionic concentration in the dilute boundary layer and differences in the counter ion transport numbers between the membrane phase and solution body tanaka 1991 bouhidel and oulmi 2000 one noteworthy fact was that reducing the boundary layer thickness was beneficial for delaying concentration polarization tanaka 2004 has further indicated that the boundary layer thickness in a dilute cell δ is a function of the flow rate that is δ has been plotted against the surface linear velocity u in a dilute cell with δ decreased with increased u thus a moderate increase in the flow rate was conducive for reducing the concentration polarization between the membrane and bulk flow as mentioned before one of the conventional ed stack configuration for continuous desalination usually consists of two hydraulic stages it is possible to reduce the use of electrodes and external pipelines and improve the resulting dilute quality the use of a reversing spacer inside a two hydraulic ed stack can change the flow direction traditionally both the 1st and 2nd hydraulic stages have an equal number of repeating cell pairs thus the surface linear velocity and operating current of each hydraulic stage are the same but the dilute concentration decreases and the concentration multiple expands step by step when the reversing spacer in ed stack moves moderately towards the 2nd hydraulic stage the number of cell pairs in the 1st hydraulic stage increased and the number of cell pairs of the second hydraulic stage decreased however the total cell pairs of the ed stack with two hydraulic stages and the inflow rate were constant as shown in fig 3 thus the surface linear velocity inside the cells of the 2nd hydraulic stage increases and then the boundary layer thickness starts to shrink this positive role consequently retards concentration polarization and thus reduces the ionic resistance of the dilute compartments also the velocity inside the 1st hydraulic cells decreases and consequently the ionic resistance of the 1st hydraulic cells increases however this negative influence is very small on the total internal stack resistance because the average salinity of the dilute outflow in 1st hydraulic stage is relatively high besides several studies have shown that lcd is positively correlated to dilute concentration barragán and ruı z bauzá 1998 fu et al 2005 thus the phenomenon involving lcd changes was mainly affected by the 2nd hydraulic stage because the dilute stream concentration of 2nd hydraulic stage was lower this asymmetric design can therefore improve the limiting current density lcd of the 2nd hydraulic stage such that the lcds of the two hydraulic stages are basically the same thus preventing concentration polarization of the 2nd hydraulic stage from occurring thereby reducing the overall internal stack resistance and achieving the purpose of energy saving during bwed in addition this design allows reduced stack resistance by decreasing the 2nd hydraulic cells boundary layer thickness without increasing pumping energy 2 2 3 improvement of the concentration difference distribution the inflow mode co current flow or counter flow of the dilute concentrate streams might have also played a valuable role for reducing the resistance of dilute concentrate cells in a conventional co current flow ed system the maximum concentrations are similar at the inlet and then gradually diverge as ions are transported from the dilute to concentrate cells thus the phenomena of concentration difference diffusion and water leakage are serious near the outlet because of the increasing salinity difference this could be limits the current efficiency and salt removal ratio of dilute compartments thereby increasing desalination energy consumption near the outlet this is mainly because of the nonideal selectivity of iems in particular for an ed stack with two hydraulic stage features the phenomenon of concentration diffusion becomes increasingly serious due to the extension of the flow channel in short in a two hydraulic stage ed desalination system the ionic diffusion from the concentrate to the dilute cell back diffusion becomes a considerable source of more energy loss especially in the 2nd hydraulic stage however when operating in a counter flow mode the concentrations of the dilute and concentrate are high on one end and low at the other which could lead to a better distribution of concentration profiles over the system length and thereby reduce the energy consumption of an ed desalination system chehayeb et al 2018 this is mainly because that a better distribution of chemical potential difference could be achieved in a counter flow mode compared with the co current flow mode fig 4 admittedly the advantage of the co current flow mode was that a hydraulic pressure balance between the dilute and concentrate streams was easier to maintain and the hydraulic pressure directly related to the dilute and concentrate inflow rates in a continuous bwed process the surface velocity is usually set to a lower level because it is limited by the ionic residence time in the channel and iem ion exchange capacity that is to say the hydraulic pressure could also be maintained at a lower value in a continuous bwed process especially when heterogeneous ion exchange membranes were applied this appeared to suggest that operating in counter flow mode can be expected to improve the desalination performance of bwed with two hydraulic stages 2 2 4 energy efficient strategies in this study with the goal of reducing the resistances of electrode and dilute concentrate cells and thus save desalination energy the influence of stack configurations and inflow modes were considered for improving the energy efficiency of a typical bwed process table 1 compared to the conventional bwed system fig 1 energy saving strategies mainly include four plans the resin filled electrode cells configuration asymmetric cell pair design parallel inflow mode of electrolytes and counter inflow mode of dilute and concentrate thus a novel two hydraulic stage ed system for bw desalination was formed the analysis of this novel ed system was based on several performance parameters including ionic migration rate mr salt removal ratio sr energy consumption ec and energy saving ratio esr 3 experimental setup and methods 3 1 experimental apparatus different laboratory scale ed systems were manufactured in house in the section regarding the examination of energy efficient strategies the ed membrane stack was designed as a single electrical stage and two hydraulic stage with 20 cell pairs the cell pairs were conventionally arranged in 10 10 for two hydraulic stages i e ten each for the 1st and 2nd hydraulic stages specifically the ed stack was composed of two electrodes cationic exchange membranes cems anionic exchange membranes aems and electrodialysis spacers both cathodes and anodes were platinum plated titanium electrodes twenty one pairs cems and twenty pairs aems were installed alternately in the stack an additional cem was placed adjacent to the electrodes every membrane in ed stack was separated by a polypropylene pp spacer 10 30 cm with a thickness of 0 90 mm and an effective area of 158 cm2 based on the ed stack system above a continuous ed desalination process was used to investigate the feasibility of the proposed energy efficient strategies and for comparative analysis of the conventional and novel ed systems performances during a multistage bwed process a schematic diagram of the single stage and multistage ed experimental apparatus is shown in fig 5 artificial bw was prepared using sodium chloride bohua chemical technology co ltd tianjin china and deionized water in house ro edi pure water device resistance 15 mω cm each electrode was rinsed by circulation in an electrolyte containing 0 3 wt na2so4 using a flow rate of 5 l h the artificial bw was pumped into dilute and concentrate compartments using a diaphragm pump fig 5a at the same time the conductivities and flow rates of the feed water dilute and concentrate waters were all monitored using online conductivity meters and rotating flow meters after ed desalination the dilute and concentrate were mixed and returned to the bw tank samples at specific times were collected for chloride ion determination all ed stacks used consisted of twenty cell pairs with two hydraulic stages as a multistage ed desalination process fig 5b in particular the dilute concentrate outlet from the 1st stage of the ed system was used as the dilute concentrate inlet of the 2nd stage of the ed system and progressed in a similar fashion 3 2 materials the ion exchange membranes iems used in this study were provided by lanran environmental technology co ltd hangzhou china the ion exchange resins iers including gel type 001 7 cation resins and gel type 201 7 anion resins were purchased from dow chemical co midland mi usa the performance parameters of iems and iers are listed in table 2 and the main instruments used for this study shown in table 3 the preparation of resin filled electrode cell is schematically shown in fig 6 firstly we designed and made an electrode plate frame with concave style the concave down depth of electrode plate was set as two sizes 1 mm and 2 mm for the comparative study of resin filled thickness the specification of the fame was 300 mm 100 mm 20 mm length width height and the effective area of electrode plate was 158 cm2 specially a structure of water distribution slots was designed and fixed on the electrode plate at the outlet of electrolyte the functions of slots are to provide a flow path for the electrolyte to flow in and out of the electrode cell and meanwhile to prevent leakage of the resin from the electrode cell secondly the mixed bed ion exchange resins were filled in both anode and cathode cells and the volume ratio of cation and anion exchange resins was set to 1 1 at the same time the filled resins were compacted and scraped flat with a plastic ruler then the electrode fame in which ion exchange resins were filled together with its adjacent cation exchange membrane formed a cell so called resin filled electrode cell 3 3 experimental design this study focused on developing a novel energy efficient ed system for bw desalination thus feasible energy saving strategies mentioned in section 2 were first investigated and then a multistage novel ed system for continuous bw desalination evaluated and compared with a conventional ed system the ed systems were fed with a 3500 mg l nacl solution representing bw all measurements in the first part of this study were performed at a flow rate of 20 l h in both the dilute and concentrate streams the specific operating conditions for optimization of the ed process parameters are illustrated in table 4 otherwise the operating conditions of continuous multistage ed desalination experiments based on optimized parameters were included in the discussion 3 4 analytical methods the conductivity of samples was measured using an online conductivity meter chloride was analyzed by the silver nitrate titration method astm d512 89 1999 usa chen et al 2018 and then sodium determined by electrically balancing solution ions liu et al 2016 3 5 data analysis 3 5 1 ionic migration rate the ionic migration rate mr represented the rate of ions transported across iems by a given current it was calculated using equation 2 2 mr mmol m 2 s c 0 c t q n a where c 0 and c t mmol l are the initial and final concentration of sodium of dilute outlet respectively q is the inlet flow rate of dilute l h n and a are the number of membrane pairs in ed stack and the effective area of an individual ion exchange membrane m2 respectively 3 5 2 salt removal ratio within a select range the ionic concentration of the salt solution was proportional to its conductivity therefore solution conductivity was used to calculate the salt removal ratio sr instead of the solution s ionic concentration zhao et al 2019 this was accomplished using the equation 3 sr 1 c t c 0 100 where c 0 ms cm and c t ms cm are the initial and final conductivity of the dilute solutions respectively 3 5 3 energy consumption the energy consumption ec to produce one cubic meter of dilute water is an indispensable parameter for the economic evaluation of an ed process this value was obtained using the equation 4 ec kwh m 3 u i q where u i and q are the operating voltage v corresponding current a and the output flow rate l h of dilute in the ed process respectively 3 5 4 energy saving ratio esr the energy saving ratio esr during the optimization process was an important parameter used to assess energy saving performance this value was calculated using 5 esr 1 e c 2 e c 1 100 where ec 1 and ec 2 are the energy consumption kw h m3 in the conventional ed process and the energy consumption kw h m3 in the optimized ed process respectively 4 results and discussion this study mainly focused on developing a novel energy efficient ed system for bw desalination based on an innovation of the ed stack configuration and optimization of inflow pattern first the feasibility of energy saving strategies mentioned in section 2 were compared with the conventional ed system changes in stack resistance sodium migration rate relative dilute outlet concentrations and the relationship between salt removal ratio and energy consumption were compared by varying the operating voltage otherwise the energy saving ratio esr was evaluated for synergistic effects of the energy saving strategies second the effects of inflow rate on limited current density and energy consumption were examined at the optimal inflow rate a three stage desalination process in a novel ed system and ced system were compared and analyzed the lcd relationship to the inflow rate and ed stage was investigated and the maximum salt removal ratio assessed operating at 95 lcd value in each stage 4 1 examination of energy saving strategies 4 1 1 effects of electrode cell configuration in this section the desalination performances of different systems were compared experimentally focusing on different electrode cell configurations conventional spacer filled and resin filled electrode cells the resin filling strategy was also examined the effects of electrode cell configuration on the resistance of an ed stack and na migration rate were evaluated at the same inflow rate of 20 l h surface flow velocity of 0 8 cm s the correlative curves are shown in fig 7 a in which error bars were added to represent standard deviation of the stack resistance ionic migration rate dilute outlet and energy consumption to verify experiment repeatability the stack resistance was calculated using ohm s law from the stack voltage and current the resistance of the stack was observed to decrease with increased applied voltage in the low voltage stage and then ran smoothly moreover compared with the conventional electrode cell configuration spacer filled with the thickness of 1 mm the resin filled electrode cells effectively reduced the stack resistance because the addition of ion exchange resins facilitates ions transfer in electrode cell the na migration rate in the resin filled electrode cell configuration was also seen to be better than that of conventional electrode cells this confirmed that the introduction of ion exchange resins into electrode cells effectively reduced the stack resistance and enhanced ion transport based on the research of ganzi et al 1987 the electric conductivity of resin is about two or three orders of magnitude larger than that of water phase under the condition of lower salinity then the filled resin could be providing a better pathway for ionic transfer in electrode cells thus electrode cell resistance was effectively reduced and more current used for the directional migration of target ions to further illustrate the energy saving effects of the new type electrode cell configuration the relative dilute outlet concentrations to feed concentration c t c 0 and salt removal ratio energy consumption relationship sr ec curve for electrode cell configurations with different resin filled strategies are shown in fig 7b the trends of the c t c 0 curves with applied voltage were the same i e they decreased with applied voltage at the same applied voltage lower outlet values in the dilute stream were obtained using a resin filled electrode cell configuration in contrast energy consumption values increased gradually with increasing salt removal ratio it was clearly seen that energy consumption was relatively low at the condition of resin filled electrode cells and the thin resin filled strategy filling thickness 1 mm could further reduce energy consumption at the same salt removal ratio therefore these results indicated that the thin resin filled electrode cell configuration could reduce the energy consumption in the bwed process 4 1 2 effects of asymmetric cell pair design as described in section 2 2 2 through an asymmetric cell pair design between the 1st and 2nd hydraulic stages namely the proper backward shift of the commutator plate a self increase of the 2nd stage flow rate in the ed stack was realized thus improvement of the entire concentration difference distribution in the ed system was achieved in this section different degrees of asymmetric cell pair design were applied for evaluating the effectiveness of this energy saving strategy specific experimental conditions are shown in table 4 examination of the variations in running resistance and ionic migration rate with various applied voltages to various asymmetric cell pair design showed that the running resistance curves decreased drastically and then became nearly steady with increased cell pair voltage fig 8 a in particular when the same cell pair voltage was applied the order of resistance was r 11 9 r 12 8 r 13 7 r 10 10 this indicated that an asymmetric cell pair design reduced the ed stack resistance to some extent and greater current used for counter ion transport in terms of improvements in the ionic migration rate mr mr enhancement reached a maximum under the condition of 1st 2nd hydraulic stage cell pairs being 11 9 and exhibited a minimum at 13 7 to evaluate the energy efficient effects of the asymmetric cell pair design described above a comparative study was performed and presented in this section described in terms of the relative dilute outlet concentrations to feed concentration c t c 0 and the dependence of energy consumption on the salt removal ratio comparison of the results clearly showed that relatively low values of c t c 0 were obtained under the conditions of the present asymmetric cell pair design fig 8b however the value of c t c 0 increased with decreased cell pairs in the 2nd hydraulic stage and increased cell pairs of the 1st hydraulic stage this asymmetric cell pair design strategy appeared to present almost no energy savings when the design of 1st 2nd hydraulic stage cell pairs was 13 7 this result was mainly because that the asymmetric design resulted in a decrease in the surface linear velocity of the 1st hydraulic stage and a rise in the surface linear velocity of the 2nd hydraulic stage at the same inlet flow rate the concentration diffusion distribution in the 2nd hydraulic stage was improved while the concentration diffusion distribution of 1st hydraulic stage became unfavorable in other words an asymmetric design should be carried out in moderation according to the above discussion it was concluded that lower energy consumption at a same salt removal ratio could be obtained at the design of 1st 2nd hydraulic stage cell pairs at 11 9 i e the ratio of the cell pairs of the two hydraulic stages should be 1 2 4 1 3 effects of inflow modes of electrolyte and feed water in this section an initial comparative study was performed firstly concerning electrolyte flow modes then the improved effects of the counter flow mode were evaluated in addition there was no significant hydraulic pressure difference 0 03 mpa in this study between the dilute and concentrate cells when the inflow mode operated in counter flow desalination characteristics of an ed stack with electrolyte parallel flow mode as well as counter flow mode for the dilute concentrate streams showed that changes in these two inflow modes reduced the running resistance and somewhat promoted ion transport fig 9 a the influence of electrolytes connected in parallel mode was relatively minor concerning the running resistance and ionic migration rate compared with the counter flow mode of dilute concentrate streams for electrolytes operated in parallel mode the useful work by voltage between two electrode plates that was used to convert electric energy was enhanced this was mainly attributed to the gas produced by the relevant electrode reaction being discharged in time the enhancement of ionic migration in electrode cells promoted the transition from electronic to ionic conduction the driving force of ion migration was then increased under the same electric field condition which meant that the electric energy conversion rate was suitably increased using electrolyte inflow in parallel mode otherwise in the case of dilute concentrate streams operating in counter flow the cell voltage required to overcome the back diffusion of concentration difference was reduced as is known the lcd was caused by a concentration polarization in a boundary layer formed at the surface between the dilute and ion exchange membrane and the concentration polarization degree enhanced with increases concentration differences between dilute and concentrate cells with regard to the feed streams counter flow operations resulted in a visibly lower concentration difference between the dilute and concentrate outlets although it increased the concentration difference between the dilute and concentrate inlets for further evaluation of which inflow mode was more appropriate the evolution of the dilute outlet stream was examined as a function of the applied voltage and the relationship between the salt removal ratio and energy consumption fig 9b both electrolyte inflows in parallel mode and dilute concentrate streams operating in counter flow mode were observed to improve the dilute stream compared with conventional inflow mode the resulting curves also highlighted the dependence of energy consumption on the salt removal ratio for a bwed system using different inflow modes a certain energy saving effect was clearly observed to be achieved through optimization of the inflow mode according to which a lower ionic transfer resistance as well as a better distribution of the chemical potential difference fostered energy consumption reduction in addition the energy efficient strategy of the counter flow was more effective than that of electrolyte inflows with parallel mode 4 1 4 synergistic effects of energy efficient strategies based on the above discussion a novel ed system was obtained with two hydraulic stages involving energy saving designs in ed stack configuration resin filled electrode cells and asymmetric cell pair design and inflow mode electrolytes with parallel inflow mode and feed streams with counter flow mode fig 10 a then the synergistic effects of energy efficient strategies were further investigated at 20 l h of inflow rate for the dilute concentrate the energy consumption salt removal ratio relationship for the two ed systems and the energy saving ratio of the novel ed system showed that this novel ed system with two hydraulic stages exhibited notably lower energy consumption than the conventional ed system with two hydraulic stages at a same salt removal ratio fig 10b this also indicated that the novel ed system achieved a higher salt removal ratio than the conventional ed system at the same energy output compared to the conventional ed system this new system reflected convenient operating for identifying an optimal ed desalination system the energy saving effects of the novel ed system for bw desalination were further illustrated in a more intuitive manner with the energy saving ratio of the novel ed system also calculated it was clear that at the same salt removal ratio this novel ed system could save 40 of energy consumption compared with the conventional ed system by converting bw into potable water this novel ed system appeared to be a feasible technology for further saving energy in bwed systems 4 2 examination of multistage novel ed systems for continuous bw desalination in all cases discussed in section 4 1 the dilute had not yet reached the who guideline for drinking water quality tds 500 mg l this was mainly limited by the length of the experimental ed channel to further illustrate the energy saving effects of the present novel ed system in the whole bwed process tds of bw reduced from 3500 to 500 mg l multistage operations were carried out in this section the inflow rate was first optimized based on the novel ed system and then the desalination performances of the conventional and the novel ed systems were compared at the optimized flow rate to reach full desalination the lcd value per ed stage investigated when operated at 95 lcd in each stage to assess the maximum salt removal ratio and total energy consumption 4 2 1 determination of inlet flow the determination of the proper flow rate is crucial in a continuous bwed process because the surface linear velocity directly determines the ionic residence time and affects the concentration boundary layer thickness with the electrolyte both anolyte and catholyte flow rate was kept at 5 l h four different dilute concentrate flow rates 10 15 20 and 25 l h were studied at room temperature in terms of parameters the stack resistance the na migration rate the dilute outlet and the dependence of energy consumption on salt removal ratio were evaluated fig 11 a and b through analysis of the r v characteristic curves at different flow rate conditions it was clearly seen that the stack resistance decreased with increased flow rate which was mainly because the residence time decreased at higher flow rate and therefore the average conductivity within the stack was higher another cause was that the turbulent extent as well as uniform distribution of the solution in the dilute and concentrate cells was improved with rising flow rate these hydrodynamic factors showed a positive effect on reducing the boundary layer thickness of membrane surfaces and speeding up the counter ion migration rate fig 11b however the degree of decline in the stack resistance was also observed to gradually decrease with increased flow rate this was mainly because beyond a certain range the feed flow rate did not clearly contribute to the ion fluxes which has been confirmed by demircioǧ lu et al 2001 a similar conclusion was drawn here from changes in ion migration rates in addition increased flow rates led directly to reduced ionic residence times and a larger operating voltage or current was required to produce the same desalination effect in other words the inflow rate was positively correlated with the desalted water yield at the same salt removal ratio for the same ed equipment although increased flow rate increased the ionic migration rate to a certain extent the volumetric amount of feed water i e bw in this study needed to achieve the same salt removal ratio per unit time also increased thus excessive increase in flow rate had an adverse impact on fresh water quality and energy consumption in a continuous bwed process although the pumping energy was not considered fig 11b in addition the lcd was measured at various inflow rates following a commonly used procedure isaacson and sonin 1976 wright et al 2018 and the lcd values shown in part a of the supplementary material the results from these lcd tests for the novel ed system with different feed flow rates showed that the lcd as a function of feed flow rate ranged from 10 to 25 l h namely the lcd value increased with increased flow rate figs s1 and 11c furthermore to select the feed flow more reasonably the corresponding salt removal ratio and energy consumption at 95 operating condition of the corresponding lcd were examined and it clearly seen that the salt removal ratio was basically the same 50 at all inflow rate conditions fig 11d however the energy consumption at 15 l h was the lowest at 0 164 kwh m3 which was lower than that at 25 l h as a result it was beneficial for the desalination process flow rate to be set at 15 l h 4 2 2 comparison of desalting performance between the novel and conventional ed systems based on the optimized flow rate in section 4 2 1 15 l h of dilute as well as a concentrate stream was selected for comparing with the desalting performance of the novel and conventional ed systems for the two ed systems lcd was first measured for each stage and then the working current density for each stage adjusted to 95 of this value to achieve the maximum desalination degree in the multistage ed system the detailed measurement process of each lcd values listed in fig s2 and fig s3 of supplementary material a the comparisons of desalination performance of the different ed systems are depicted in fig 12 and the details discussed below the 95 lcd value for each electrical stage of the two ed systems were basically similar and the lcd value decreased with increased electrical stage in the multistage ed process fig 12a this was mainly due to the continued decrease of the ionic concentration in the dilute stream nevertheless the cell pair voltage corresponding to the lcd value was significantly different with the cell pair voltage corresponding to the lcd value of the novel ed system being significantly lower than that of the conventional ed system this meant that improvements in this novel ed system could be attributed to a decrease in the required voltage for reaching a same level of limited current density this conclusion was verified from another perspective i e the running resistance was reduced for each electrical stage of the ed stack when the novel ed system was adapted fig 12b also the salt removal ratio per electrical stage of the two ed systems were basically similar because of the approximate operating current densities and the salt removal ratio of the two systems reached 89 specifically the dilute as well as concentrate outlet concentrations changed according to the applied current density per ed stage fig 12c clearly the outlet concentration changed per stage of the novel system corresponded mostly to that of the conventional system this also indicated that the novel system had little effect on the produced water quality in each electrical stage compared with the ced system that is to say the produced fresh water qualities of the two ed systems were basically the same in this context the energy consumption of each electrical stage and the total energy consumption of each multistage ed system were fully investigated fig 12d this illustrated that the energy consumption of each stage of the novel system was lower than that of corresponding stage of the conventional system also the total energy consumption of multistage operation was reduced from 1 937 to 1 223 kwh m3 by replacing the conventional system with the novel system i e the energy saved was up to 0 714 kwh m3 the energy efficient effects of the novel ed system were clearly demonstrated by examining the energy saving ratio esr for the novel system relative to the conventional system fig 13 the esr value of the 1st stage was observed to reach 43 6 but the esr values of the 2nd and 3rd stage were decreased to 22 5 and 18 8 respectively however a 36 9 for the total esr was achieved using the novel system when desalting bw from 3500 mg l to drinking water quality 450 mg l in this study compared with the conventional system this fully demonstrated the effectiveness of the energy saving strategies proposed in this study in order to reflect the desalination performance of the novel ed system more intuitively table 5 also compares the performance of different electro driven membrane processes for brackish water desalination in the case of edi processes for brackish water desalination with similar feed concentrations the energy consumption was obviously higher than that of the novel ed system with regard to ed assembled by homogeneous membrane the energy consumptions were close to that of the novel ed system with heterogeneous membrane these results show that the novel ed system can be considered as an energy efficient technology among various desalination processes the present findings indicated that these energy saving strategies provided a new perspective and scientific guidance for saving energy in ed processes 5 conclusions in this study a novel two hydraulic stage ed system was presented that was designed to reduce energy consumption many feasible innovations of stack configurations and inflow modes were selected for improving energy efficiency in the bwed process feed concentration with 3500 mg l which were then systematically examined to assess their energy saving properties in the bwed process first by innovating membrane stack configurations resin filled electrode cells and antisymmetric cell pairs design an obvious energy saving effect was achieved through using thin resin filled 1 mm electrode cells and an asymmetric cell pair design velocity ratio of 1st and 2nd hydraulic stages 1 2 at various salt removal efficiencies general inflow mode optimizations such as electrolyte parallel flows and dilute concentrate counter flow were also beneficial in saving energy it was confirmed that these strategies reduced 10 30 of energy consumption at a same salt removal ratio second this novel ed system based on synergistic effects of these strategies was demonstrated and the results indicated that it could save 40 of energy consumption at the same salt removal ratio compared with conventional 2 hydraulic ed system ced with regard to three stage continuous bwed performance tests compared with ced this new system exhibited an obvious decrease in the voltage required for reaching the same level of lcd thus the running resistance in each stage was reduced and the energy saving in the bwed process realized specifically a 36 9 energy consumption saving was achieved using the novel ed system with bw desalting from 3500 mg l to drinking water quality 450 mg l this also indicated that this novel ed system did not remarkably change the dilute or concentrate concentration at all stages but only improved desalination efficiency it was therefore possible to open the way for overcoming the energy intensive aspect of state of the art bwed further studies will be devoted to investigating the desalination performance of this novel ed system at different feed concentrations and with different commercial iems declaration of competing

17891,involvements of quorum sensing qs in the formation of aerobic granules for wastewater treatment have been well recognized in previous studies the evolution of the qs related activities and communities during bioreactor start up period has been extensively studied while the variation of qs in long term reactor operation remains unrevealed furthermore information about the roles of quorum quenching qq in bioreactors is very limited in this work both qs and qq during the start up and successive long term operation period of an aerobic granule bioreactor were explored the qs activity and communities increased in the start up but gradually decreased in the long term operation while the qq activity and communities remained stable these results indicate the longer persistence of qq than qs in the granules and the minor contribution of qs in the long term operation this work provides a new insight into the roles of qq and qs in wastewater treatment bioreactors graphical abstract image 1 keywords quorum quenching qq quorum sensing qs aerobic granules acyl homoserine lactones ahl startup long term operation 1 introduction aerobic granules have a great potential in wastewater treatment because of their outstanding features e g high biomass retention excellent settling ability resilience to shocks and toxins de sousa rollemberg et al 2018 kent et al 2019 aerobic granules are a specific form of biofilm wherein large microbial populations are residents liu et al 2009 roles of many environmental factors e g temperature ph electron acceptors and hydraulic shear force in the lifespan of aerobic granules have been well studied liu et al 2009 recently the roles of acyl homoserine lactones ahl mediated quorum sensing qs in aerobic granules for wastewater treatment have aroused intense interests qs is a phenomenon that microbes regulate their gene expression by producing accumulating and sensing signaling molecules miller and bassler 2001 ahls are the most well studied signaling molecules and found to play an important role in microbial granulation tan et al 2015 wang et al 2017 there is an antagonistic process which is coexistent with qs called quorum quenching qq whereby ahls are hydrolyzed by enzymes huang et al 2016 uroz et al 2009 in a complex microbial consortium such as activated sludge qs is reported to be necessary for the formation of microbial aggregates ma et al 2018 qs is also a strategy adopted by some microbes to gain competitive advantages over other non qs ones mukherjee and bassler 2019 however the non qs communities also thrive in aerobic granules thus it is reasonable to expect a corresponding evolution of qq activity when qs changes however in previous studies qq has received less attention compared with qs although the co existence of qs and qq communities in bioreactors during their start up period has been reported tan et al 2015 their existence and evolution especially the qq communities and their activities in a long term operated bioreactor remain largely unknown the lack of knowledge on the qq would hinder the development of qs based manipulating strategies for wastewater treatment bioreactors in some cases e g when cultivating aerobic granules depressing qq is desired to improve the granulation efficiency in other cases e g anti fouling in membrane reactors qq level should be intensified lee et al 2018 ma et al 2018 however until recently much less information on qq in aerobic granules is available than that on qs sarma et al 2017 a deep insight into the qs and qq in the start up and successive long term operation of bioreactors would be helpful for developing aerobic granules and other biological wastewater treatment processes for example a sophisticated ahl dosage based on the variation of qs and qq could be designed which would be a more cost effective and practical way in enhancing the performance of aerobic granules than the continuous dosage li et al 2015 on the other hand revealing the changes of qq in the long term operation could be beneficial to elucidate the granulation and disintegration mechanisms of aerobic granules furthermore with more understanding about qq the enhancement of ahl mediated qs in aerobic granules might be realized by depressing qq rather than adding exogenous ahl exploring the whole lifespan of ahl mediated qs in activated sludge especially qq on a long term operation scenario is essential for improving the qs based manipulation methods therefore in this work the co existences and evolutions of both qs and qq in a sequencing batch reactor sbr used for cultivating aerobic granules were explored not only during its start up but also in its subsequent long term stable operation the variations of the qs and qq related communities were examined using high throughput sequencing accordingly the evolution and roles of qs and qq during long term reactor operation period could be uncovered and compared the results would help to enhance the understanding about the roles of ahl mediated qs and qq in aerobic granules 2 materials and methods 2 1 cultivation and characterization of aerobic granules in the sbr a lab scale sbr was used to cultivate aerobic granules the reactor had a working volume of 4 0 l and height diameter ratio of 12 it was operated in successive cycles of 240 min 10 min of influent filling and 5 min of effluent discharge the total time for aeration and settling was 225 min during the start up the settling time was initially set at 30 min and gradually shortened to 3 min in the long term operation the settling time was maintained at 3 min the superficial gas velocity was set at 2 0 cm s 1 and the reactor was equipped with thermostats with the temperature set at 30 c the reactor was feed by a synthetic wastewater with the following compositions mg l as glucose 188 sodium acetate 256 sodium propionate 233 nh4 2so4 283 kh2po4 13 2 k2hpo4 3h2o 22 1 cacl2 2h2o 25 feso4 7h2o 20 mgso4 7h2o 20

d in the end of an operation cycle 50 ml mixed liquor was collected from the sbr and centrifuged at 4 c 8000 rpm to extract the extracellular polymeric substances eps from the sludge samples the cation exchange resin method was used as described previously sheng and yu 2006 the eps were quantified by total organic carbon analyzer n c 2100 analytik jena ag germany proteins were determined using modified lowry method liu and fang 2002 and polysaccharides were quantified by the anthrone colorimetry method dubois et al 1956 2 2 determination of qs level in the sbr the ahl in the sbr was detected by thin layer chromatography tlc based bioassay zhu et al 2003 in the end of the operation cycle mix liquor was collected from the reactor and centrifuged at 6000 rpm a volume of 100 ml supernatant was transferred into a separating funnel followed by acidification with acetate 0 1 v v the ahl was extracted with ethyl acetate by shaking the separating funnel vigorously for 10 min the extraction was performed for three times with 50 ml ethyl acetate applied each time after separated by a separating funnel the organic phase was further dehydrated with magnesium sulfate and then condensed in rotatory evaporator fray et al 1999 when the condensate was less than 1 ml it was transferred into a 1 5 ml centrifuge tube and dried under nitrogen atmosphere all ahl samples were stored at 20 c and the samples were re dissolved in 100 μl ethyl acetate before analysis the bioassay was based on reporting strain and thin layer chromatography tlc ravn et al 2001 the re dissolved samples were loaded onto the tlc plate tlc silica gel 60 rp 18 f254s no 115683 merck co germany the plate was then developed with 60 methanol v v at 30 c the reporting strain agrobacterium tumefaciens jza1 was constructed by zhu et al 2003 which could detect 32 types of ahls with various chain lengths saturation levels and oxidation states it was grown in at medium supplied with spectinomycin 100 μg ml gentamicin 100 μg ml and tetracycline 2 μg ml solid fresh at medium containing 2 0 agar was melted in a microwave oven when the at agar was cooled down to about 40 c it was mixed with the overnight culture of jza1 at a ratio of 3 1 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl β d galacto pyranoside x gal was also added to a final concentration of 20 mg l after dried at 30 c the tlc plate was poured with jza1 agar 20 ml agar per plate after 8 h incubation at 30 c the diameter of the blue spot was measured to determine the residual c8 hsl 2 3 qs and qq related activities tests the qs activity was estimated by the amount of ahl generated by the sludge in 4 h equal to one operating cycle of the reactor the sludge collected from the reactor was washed with pbs phosphate buffered saline buffer for three times then a wet mass of 3 0 g sludge was weighted and re suspended in an erlenmeyer flask containing 100 ml of the synthetic wastewater the flask was incubated for 4 h in a thermostat shaker at 30 c and 200 rpm the ahl producing activity was determined by measuring the ahl concentration in the supernatant after the 4 h incubation the ahls extraction follows the same steps as described in section 2 2 the reporting strain based agar plate assay was used to determine the ahl producing activity mcclean et al 1997 the jza1 agar was prepared as described in section 2 2 the agar was promptly distributed in 6 cm culture dishes with 5 0 ml per dish when completely solidified the agar plate was punctured in the center with the bottom of 1 0 ml pipette tip then the re dissolved ahl samples were loaded in the central hole after 8 h incubation at 30 c the diameter was measured and used to determine the ahl content the qq activity was determined by measuring the degradation of exogenous ahl standard i e octanoyl l homoserine lactone c8 hsl the c8 hsl was used because it could be separated by tlc from the endogenous ahls fig 2 the sludge collection and preparation steps were the same as those for the ahl producing activity before 4 h incubation c8 hsl was added into the flask to make a final concentration of 200 nm the ahl quenching activity was determined by measuring the degradation of c8 hsl within the 4 h incubation the degradation of c8 hsl followed with the first order kinetics hmelo and van mooy 2009 thus the results were fitted using the following equation 2 c t c 0 e k t where c t and c 0 are the measured concentration of c8 hsl nm at t min and initially added c8 hsl nm respectively t is the sampling time during the batch tests min and k is the quenching rate min 1 2 4 dna extraction and high throughput sequencing analysis the sludge samples were collected from the sbr by settling the mixed liquor in a 100 ml graduated cylinder the settled sludge was collected in 50 ml centrifuge tubes after centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 5 min the supernatant was decanted the pellet at the bottom of centrifuge tube was re suspended by adding 20 ml pbs buffer and then centrifuged at

prinseq software was used control the quality threshold value was set at 40 to filter low complexity sequences and sequences shorter than 50 bp were filtered schmieder and edwards 2011 the error sequences and chimeric sequences were removed by mothur respectively by using the pre cluster and chimera uchime commands respectively schloss et al 2009 the subsequent operational taxonomic unit otu was clustered using uclust similarity value set at 0 97 edgar 2010 effective sequences were assigned into different taxa levels from genus to phylum by using rdp classifier cole et al 2009 complete high throughput sequencing data for all the sludge samples were deposited in the national center for biotechnology information accession no prjna627799 2 5 statistic analysis all batch tests were conducted in triplicates and error bars in the plots represent the standard deviation sd the batch tests data were analyzed using one way anova and the differences were considered to be significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall performance of the sbr as shown in fig 1 after a typical start up phase the reactor achieved a stable performance in terms of cod and nh4 n removals during the stable operation period the cod removal efficiencies exceeded 95 and nh4 n was effectively converted to nitrite or nitrate significant nitrite accumulation was only observed during the start up the denitrification readily occurred as the size of the granules grew de kreuk et al 2005 due to the lack of aerobic anaerobic cycles the phosphate removal fluctuated during the whole operation period bassin et al 2012 the biomass in the reactor decreased during the start up period which could be attributed to the wash out of the sludge with a low settling velocity as the granulation proceeded the biomass gradually increased fig 1d the sludge size increased as the settling time was shortened fig 2a the simulation of granule growth was performed using equation 1 the growth in granular size could be well fitted as evidenced by a high correlation coefficient of 0 961 fig s1 the growth rate k was calculated to be 0 023 d 1 and the lag time t 0 was 97 1 d the d max was estimated to be 608 3 μm which is in good agreement with the observation the overall performance of the reactor was stable indicating that aerobic granules with a high activity were successfully cultured and maintained 3 2 ahl detection and eps production the ahl producing activity was observed after a short period of accommodation as shown in fig 2 four types of ahls were detected however as the aerobic granules were further developed the ahls gradually decreased only one type of ahl was detected on day 360 this phenomenon might be directly resulted from the decline in the population of the ahl producers or caused by the increase in qq bacteria song et al 2014 tan et al 2015 to explain this observation combining the batch tests for ahl related activities and high throughput sequencing results is required the eps production is reported to affect the granulation of aerobic sludge and be strongly related to ahl mediated qs guo et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the total eps and its protein content gradually increased with the granulation fig 3 the co occurrence of the decline in ahl production and the slow down in eps accumulation was observed to further explore the correlation between the eps production and the ahl level in the aerobic granules more direct analyses e g transcriptomic should be applied in future studies the ratio of protein polysaccharides drastically increased during the start up phase aerobic granules contained a higher level of proteins than floccules zhu et al 2015 thus this observation could be explained by the increasing proportion of the aerobic granules in total biomass in the successive operation the ratio of proteins polysaccharides remained stable considering the role of proteins in maintaining the stable structure of aerobic granules the stable proteins polysaccharides ratio indicated the stability of the aerobic granules xiong and liu 2013 3 3 evolutions of qs and qq activities fig 4 a further shows that the newly formed granules produced more types of ahls at a higher level however the detected ahl were those that had been produced but not been degraded yet song et al 2014 thus to fully estimate the ahl production the variations of the ahl quenching activity should also be taken into account by adding and measuring the degradation of heterogeneous ahl i e c8 hsl a more accurate quenching activity could be obtained as shown in fig 4b the seeding sludge had the second strongest ahl quenching activity with a rate of 0 030 min 1 while the newly formed granules possessed the highest ahl quenching activity 0 035 min 1 as the granulation proceeded the ahl quenching rate decreased and later remained stable which were 0 022 0 023 and 0 021 min 1 on days 100 220 and 360 respectively the stable quenching activities after the start up suggest that the decrease in ahl might not be attributed to the enhancement of qq in the long term operation one possible reason was the decline of the ahl producing communities which could be revealed by the high throughput sequencing results 3 4 evolutions of qs and qq communities to further reveal the changing profiles of the ahl related bacterial populations in the sbr high throughput sequencing analysis was performed as revealed in fig 5 the phylum proteobacteria dominated in the seeding sludge and its abundance gradually increased during the aerobic granulation however the population of the most other phyla such as bacteroidetes chloroflexi nitrospirae planctomycetes acidobacteria and firmicutes dropped down as the aerobic granules grew the class betaproteobacteria dominated in the matured granules while some classes like alphaproteobacteria bacterioidetes and verrucomicrobiae only thrived in the newly formed granules similar large shifts were observed at order and family level as shown in fig s2 and table s1 the genera with the qs or qq related activities were less abundant than those without the qs related activities the qs related genera such as nitrospira and nitrosospira decreased after the start up and long term operation opposite trends were observed for the main qq related genera only the abundances of terrimonas and comamonas declined the other qq related genera including chryseobacterium flavobacterium brevundimonas and pseudoxanthomonas became greatly enriched after the start up and long term operation fig 6 these results show that the ahl related communities continued during the stable operation period and the sbr took a longer time to reach a stable operation and achieved a balance between qs and qq li et al 2015 it is worth noting that these qs and qq related genera were of relatively lower abundances when compared with other genera such as thauera lysobacter and zoogloea the most dominant genus in the matured aerobic granules were thauera which has been reported to be closely associated with the eps excretion zhao et al 2013 the genus zoogloea is also well known for its great eps production an et al 2016 these two main eps contributors have not been reported to be qs related genera while the qs and qq related genera that are likely to response to ahl were of a relatively lower level in the total biomass expressing orphan ahl receptor might be one possible mechanism by which the genera in high abundance such as thauera and lysobacter are involved in qs jiang et al 2012 qian et al 2014 this warrants further investigations 3 5 longer persistence of qq than qs in the granules the observations throughout the reactor start up and the successive stable operation period show an initial increase followed by a gradually decrease in qs level fig 4 the reduced ahl did not severely affect the sludge granulation eps production and pollutant removals compared with the qs activities the qq activities were more persistent in the long term operation though the qq related genera became enriched in the long term operation the change of qq activity was limited such an inconsistence might be due to the relatively slower mass transferring within the larger aerobic granules than the smaller ones liu and tay 2012 this observation could also be the result of the changes in the qq enzyme production which can be revealed by a transcriptomic study mamani et al 2016 the decrease in the ahl production in the aerobic granules could be partially explained by the decline of the qs communities however the qq activities after the reactor start up remained stable indicating that some other reasons should be responsible for the hindered ahl production one possible reason might be the limited availability of the substrate for the qs communities when the biomass became accumulated lazazzera 2000 in addition since the layered structure of granules directly affected mass transfer pan et al 2016 the spatial distribution of the ahl related communities might be another reason gao et al 2016 the variations of qs and qq related communities and their activities imply the complexity of qs in activated sludge many factors such as substrate availability sludge structure and gene expression as well as the abundance of qs and qq related communities should be taken into consideration by investigating the sludge samples at key time points seeding end of acclimation granulation beginning of the mature phase and end of the experiment for their qs and qq related features the variation trends of the qs and qq could be revealed however more intensive sampling would be useful to fully illustrate the accurate changes in the qs and qq in the long term operation of bioreactors in addition though the value of bacterial abundance in the sludge sampled from a well mixed bioreactor could be viewed as the mean value of biological replicates the bias that might be introduced by high throughput sequencing could not be substantially eliminated therefore more replicates both biological and technical should be carried out in future studies to obtain more reliable information on the

17891,involvements of quorum sensing qs in the formation of aerobic granules for wastewater treatment have been well recognized in previous studies the evolution of the qs related activities and communities during bioreactor start up period has been extensively studied while the variation of qs in long term reactor operation remains unrevealed furthermore information about the roles of quorum quenching qq in bioreactors is very limited in this work both qs and qq during the start up and successive long term operation period of an aerobic granule bioreactor were explored the qs activity and communities increased in the start up but gradually decreased in the long term operation while the qq activity and communities remained stable these results indicate the longer persistence of qq than qs in the granules and the minor contribution of qs in the long term operation this work provides a new insight into the roles of qq and qs in wastewater treatment bioreactors graphical abstract image 1 keywords quorum quenching qq quorum sensing qs aerobic granules acyl homoserine lactones ahl startup long term operation 1 introduction aerobic granules have a great potential in wastewater treatment because of their outstanding features e g high biomass retention excellent settling ability resilience to shocks and toxins de sousa rollemberg et al 2018 kent et al 2019 aerobic granules are a specific form of biofilm wherein large microbial populations are residents liu et al 2009 roles of many environmental factors e g temperature ph electron acceptors and hydraulic shear force in the lifespan of aerobic granules have been well studied liu et al 2009 recently the roles of acyl homoserine lactones ahl mediated quorum sensing qs in aerobic granules for wastewater treatment have aroused intense interests qs is a phenomenon that microbes regulate their gene expression by producing accumulating and sensing signaling molecules miller and bassler 2001 ahls are the most well studied signaling molecules and found to play an important role in microbial granulation tan et al 2015 wang et al 2017 there is an antagonistic process which is coexistent with qs called quorum quenching qq whereby ahls are hydrolyzed by enzymes huang et al 2016 uroz et al 2009 in a complex microbial consortium such as activated sludge qs is reported to be necessary for the formation of microbial aggregates ma et al 2018 qs is also a strategy adopted by some microbes to gain competitive advantages over other non qs ones mukherjee and bassler 2019 however the non qs communities also thrive in aerobic granules thus it is reasonable to expect a corresponding evolution of qq activity when qs changes however in previous studies qq has received less attention compared with qs although the co existence of qs and qq communities in bioreactors during their start up period has been reported tan et al 2015 their existence and evolution especially the qq communities and their activities in a long term operated bioreactor remain largely unknown the lack of knowledge on the qq would hinder the development of qs based manipulating strategies for wastewater treatment bioreactors in some cases e g when cultivating aerobic granules depressing qq is desired to improve the granulation efficiency in other cases e g anti fouling in membrane reactors qq level should be intensified lee et al 2018 ma et al 2018 however until recently much less information on qq in aerobic granules is available than that on qs sarma et al 2017 a deep insight into the qs and qq in the start up and successive long term operation of bioreactors would be helpful for developing aerobic granules and other biological wastewater treatment processes for example a sophisticated ahl dosage based on the variation of qs and qq could be designed which would be a more cost effective and practical way in enhancing the performance of aerobic granules than the continuous dosage li et al 2015 on the other hand revealing the changes of qq in the long term operation could be beneficial to elucidate the granulation and disintegration mechanisms of aerobic granules furthermore with more understanding about qq the enhancement of ahl mediated qs in aerobic granules might be realized by depressing qq rather than adding exogenous ahl exploring the whole lifespan of ahl mediated qs in activated sludge especially qq on a long term operation scenario is essential for improving the qs based manipulation methods therefore in this work the co existences and evolutions of both qs and qq in a sequencing batch reactor sbr used for cultivating aerobic granules were explored not only during its start up but also in its subsequent long term stable operation the variations of the qs and qq related communities were examined using high throughput sequencing accordingly the evolution and roles of qs and qq during long term reactor operation period could be uncovered and compared the results would help to enhance the understanding about the roles of ahl mediated qs and qq in aerobic granules 2 materials and methods 2 1 cultivation and characterization of aerobic granules in the sbr a lab scale sbr was used to cultivate aerobic granules the reactor had a working volume of 4 0 l and height diameter ratio of 12 it was operated in successive cycles of 240 min 10 min of influent filling and 5 min of effluent discharge the total time for aeration and settling was 225 min during the start up the settling time was initially set at 30 min and gradually shortened to 3 min in the long term operation the settling time was maintained at 3 min the superficial gas velocity was set at 2 0 cm s 1 and the reactor was equipped with thermostats with the temperature set at 30 c the reactor was feed by a synthetic wastewater with the following compositions mg l as glucose 188 sodium acetate 256 sodium propionate 233 nh4 2so4 283 kh2po4 13 2 k2hpo4 3h2o 22 1 cacl2 2h2o 25 feso4 7h2o 20 mgso4 7h2o 20

operated over 360 days water quality and mixed liquor suspended solids mlss of the sbr were measured according to the standard method apha 2005 sludge morphologies were imaged using a digital camera and analyzed using software image pro plus 6 0 media cybernetics inc usa the growth of the aerobic granules was evaluated by using a modified logistic model su and yu 2005 1 d t d max 1 e k t t0 where t is the operation time d d t and d max are the mean granular diameter on day t and the maximum granular diameter mm respectively k is the specific growth rate by diameter d 1 and t 0 is the lag time d in the end of an operation cycle 50 ml mixed liquor was collected from the sbr and centrifuged at 4 c 8000 rpm to extract the extracellular polymeric substances eps from the sludge samples the cation exchange resin method was used as described previously sheng and yu 2006 the eps were quantified by total organic carbon analyzer n c 2100 analytik jena ag germany proteins were determined using modified lowry method liu and fang 2002 and polysaccharides were quantified by the anthrone colorimetry method dubois et al 1956 2 2 determination of qs level in the sbr the ahl in the sbr was detected by thin layer chromatography tlc based bioassay zhu et al 2003 in the end of the operation cycle mix liquor was collected from the reactor and centrifuged at 6000 rpm a volume of 100 ml supernatant was transferred into a separating funnel followed by acidification with acetate 0 1 v v the ahl was extracted with ethyl acetate by shaking the separating funnel vigorously for 10 min the extraction was performed for three times with 50 ml ethyl acetate applied each time after separated by a separating funnel the organic phase was further dehydrated with magnesium sulfate and then condensed in rotatory evaporator fray et al 1999 when the condensate was less than 1 ml it was transferred into a 1 5 ml centrifuge tube and dried under nitrogen atmosphere all ahl samples were stored at 20 c and the samples were re dissolved in 100 μl ethyl acetate before analysis the bioassay was based on reporting strain and thin layer chromatography tlc ravn et al 2001 the re dissolved samples were loaded onto the tlc plate tlc silica gel 60 rp 18 f254s no 115683 merck co germany the plate was then developed with 60 methanol v v at 30 c the reporting strain agrobacterium tumefaciens jza1 was constructed by zhu et al 2003 which could detect 32 types of ahls with various chain lengths saturation levels and oxidation states it was grown in at medium supplied with spectinomycin 100 μg ml gentamicin 100 μg ml and tetracycline 2 μg ml solid fresh at medium containing 2 0 agar was melted in a microwave oven when the at agar was cooled down to about 40 c it was mixed with the overnight culture of jza1 at a ratio of 3 1 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl β d galacto pyranoside x gal was also added to a final concentration of 20 mg l after dried at 30 c the tlc plate was poured with jza1 agar 20 ml agar per plate after 8 h incubation at 30 c the diameter of the blue spot was measured to determine the residual c8 hsl 2 3 qs and qq related activities tests the qs activity was estimated by the amount of ahl generated by the sludge in 4 h equal to one operating cycle of the reactor the sludge collected from the reactor was washed with pbs phosphate buffered saline buffer for three times then a wet mass of 3 0 g sludge was weighted and re suspended in an erlenmeyer flask containing 100 ml of the synthetic wastewater the flask was incubated for 4 h in a thermostat shaker at 30 c and 200 rpm the ahl producing activity was determined by measuring the ahl concentration in the supernatant after the 4 h incubation the ahls extraction follows the same steps as described in section 2 2 the reporting strain based agar plate assay was used to determine the ahl producing activity mcclean et al 1997 the jza1 agar was prepared as described in section 2 2 the agar was promptly distributed in 6 cm culture dishes with 5 0 ml per dish when completely solidified the agar plate was punctured in the center with the bottom of 1 0 ml pipette tip then the re dissolved ahl samples were loaded in the central hole after 8 h incubation at 30 c the diameter was measured and used to determine the ahl content the qq activity was determined by measuring the degradation of exogenous ahl standard i e octanoyl l homoserine lactone c8 hsl the c8 hsl was used because it could be separated by tlc from the endogenous ahls fig 2 the sludge collection and preparation steps were the same as those for the ahl producing activity before 4 h incubation c8 hsl was added into the flask to make a final concentration of 200 nm the ahl quenching activity was determined by measuring the degradation of c8 hsl within the 4 h incubation the degradation of c8 hsl followed with the first order kinetics hmelo and van mooy 2009 thus the results were fitted using the following equation 2 c t c 0 e k t where c t and c 0 are the measured concentration of c8 hsl nm at t min and initially added c8 hsl nm respectively t is the sampling time during the batch tests min and k is the quenching rate min 1 2 4 dna extraction and high throughput sequencing analysis the sludge samples were collected from the sbr by settling the mixed liquor in a 100 ml graduated cylinder the settled sludge was collected in 50 ml centrifuge tubes after centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 5 min the supernatant was decanted the pellet at the bottom of centrifuge tube was re suspended by adding 20 ml pbs buffer and then centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min after the washing step was repeated for three times dna extraction was conducted by using the powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc usa raw dna was quantified by qubit2 0 dna kits thermo fisher scientific inc usa the dna samples were then amplified targeting v3 v4 hypervariable region of 16s rrna amplicons were sequenced by miseq platform illumina usa raw data were processed to obtain high quality reads the sequences from miseq platform were merged with software flash when the false positive ratio was controlled below 0 1 magoč and salzberg 2011 then the prinseq software was used control the quality threshold value was set at 40 to filter low complexity sequences and sequences shorter than 50 bp were filtered schmieder and edwards 2011 the error sequences and chimeric sequences were removed by mothur respectively by using the pre cluster and chimera uchime commands respectively schloss et al 2009 the subsequent operational taxonomic unit otu was clustered using uclust similarity value set at 0 97 edgar 2010 effective sequences were assigned into different taxa levels from genus to phylum by using rdp classifier cole et al 2009 complete high throughput sequencing data for all the sludge samples were deposited in the national center for biotechnology information accession no prjna627799 2 5 statistic analysis all batch tests were conducted in triplicates and error bars in the plots represent the standard deviation sd the batch tests data were analyzed using one way anova and the differences were considered to be significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall performance of the sbr as shown in fig 1 after a typical start up phase the reactor achieved a stable performance in terms of cod and nh4 n removals during the stable operation period the cod removal efficiencies exceeded 95 and nh4 n was effectively converted to nitrite or nitrate significant nitrite accumulation was only observed during the start up the denitrification readily occurred as the size of the granules grew de kreuk et al 2005 due to the lack of aerobic anaerobic cycles the phosphate removal fluctuated during the whole operation period bassin et al 2012 the biomass in the reactor decreased during the start up period which could be attributed to the wash out of the sludge with a low settling velocity as the granulation proceeded the biomass gradually increased fig 1d the sludge size increased as the settling time was shortened fig 2a the simulation of granule growth was performed using equation 1 the growth in granular size could be well fitted as evidenced by a high correlation coefficient of 0 961 fig s1 the growth rate k was calculated to be 0 023 d 1 and the lag time t 0 was 97 1 d the d max was estimated to be 608 3 μm which is in good agreement with the observation the overall performance of the reactor was stable indicating that aerobic granules with a high activity were successfully cultured and maintained 3 2 ahl detection and eps production the ahl producing activity was observed after a short period of accommodation as shown in fig 2 four types of ahls were detected however as the aerobic granules were further developed the ahls gradually decreased only one type of ahl was detected on day 360 this phenomenon might be directly resulted from the decline in the population of the ahl producers or caused by the increase in qq bacteria song et al 2014 tan et al 2015 to explain this observation combining the batch tests for ahl related activities and high throughput sequencing results is required the eps production is reported to affect the granulation of aerobic sludge and be strongly related to ahl mediated qs guo et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the total eps and its protein content gradually increased with the granulation fig 3 the co occurrence of the decline in ahl production and the slow down in eps accumulation was observed to further explore the correlation between the eps production and the ahl level in the aerobic granules more direct analyses e g transcriptomic should be applied in future studies the ratio of protein polysaccharides drastically increased during the start up phase aerobic granules contained a higher level of proteins than floccules zhu et al 2015 thus this observation could be explained by the increasing proportion of the aerobic granules in total biomass in the successive operation the ratio of proteins polysaccharides remained stable considering the role of proteins in maintaining the stable structure of aerobic granules the stable proteins polysaccharides ratio indicated the stability of the aerobic granules xiong and liu 2013 3 3 evolutions of qs and qq activities fig 4 a further shows that the newly formed granules produced more types of ahls at a higher level however the detected ahl were those that had been produced but not been degraded yet song et al 2014 thus to fully estimate the ahl production the variations of the ahl quenching activity should also be taken into account by adding and measuring the degradation of heterogeneous ahl i e c8 hsl a more accurate quenching activity could be obtained as shown in fig 4b the seeding sludge had the second strongest ahl quenching activity with a rate of 0 030 min 1 while the newly formed granules possessed the highest ahl quenching activity 0 035 min 1 as the granulation proceeded the ahl quenching rate decreased and later remained stable which were 0 022 0 023 and 0 021 min 1 on days 100 220 and 360 respectively the stable quenching activities after the start up suggest that the decrease in ahl might not be attributed to the enhancement of qq in the long term operation one possible reason was the decline of the ahl producing communities which could be revealed by the high throughput sequencing results 3 4 evolutions of qs and qq communities to further reveal the changing profiles of the ahl related bacterial populations in the sbr high throughput sequencing analysis was performed as revealed in fig 5 the phylum proteobacteria dominated in the seeding sludge and its abundance gradually increased during the aerobic granulation however the population of the most other phyla such as bacteroidetes chloroflexi nitrospirae planctomycetes acidobacteria and firmicutes dropped down as the aerobic granules grew the class betaproteobacteria dominated in the matured granules while some classes like alphaproteobacteria bacterioidetes and verrucomicrobiae only thrived in the newly formed granules similar large shifts were observed at order and family level as shown in fig s2 and table s1 the genera with the qs or qq related activities were less abundant than those without the qs related activities the qs related genera such as nitrospira and nitrosospira decreased after the start up and long term operation opposite trends were observed for the main qq related genera only the abundances of terrimonas and comamonas declined the other qq related genera including chryseobacterium flavobacterium brevundimonas and pseudoxanthomonas became greatly enriched after the start up and long term operation fig 6 these results show that the ahl related communities continued during the stable operation period and the sbr took a longer time to reach a stable operation and achieved a balance between qs and qq li et al 2015 it is worth noting that these qs and qq related genera were of relatively lower abundances when compared with other genera such as thauera lysobacter and zoogloea the most dominant genus in the matured aerobic granules were thauera which has been reported to be closely associated with the eps excretion zhao et al 2013 the genus zoogloea is also well known for its great eps production an et al 2016 these two main eps contributors have not been reported to be qs related genera while the qs and qq related genera that are likely to response to ahl were of a relatively lower level in the total biomass expressing orphan ahl receptor might be one possible mechanism by which the genera in high abundance such as thauera and lysobacter are involved in qs jiang et al 2012 qian et al 2014 this warrants further investigations 3 5 longer persistence of qq than qs in the granules the observations throughout the reactor start up and the successive stable operation period show an initial increase followed by a gradually decrease in qs level fig 4 the reduced ahl did not severely affect the sludge granulation eps production and pollutant removals compared with the qs activities the qq activities were more persistent in the long term operation though the qq related genera became enriched in the long term operation the change of qq activity was limited such an inconsistence might be due to the relatively slower mass transferring within the larger aerobic granules than the smaller ones liu and tay 2012 this observation could also be the result of the changes in the qq enzyme production which can be revealed by a transcriptomic study mamani et al 2016 the decrease in the ahl production in the aerobic granules could be partially explained by the decline of the qs communities however the qq activities after the reactor start up remained stable indicating that some other reasons should be responsible for the hindered ahl production one possible reason might be the limited availability of the substrate for the qs communities when the biomass became accumulated lazazzera 2000 in addition since the layered structure of granules directly affected mass transfer pan et al 2016 the spatial distribution of the ahl related communities might be another reason gao et al 2016 the variations of qs and qq related communities and their activities imply the complexity of qs in activated sludge many factors such as substrate availability sludge structure and gene expression as well as the abundance of qs and qq related communities should be taken into consideration by investigating the sludge samples at key time points seeding end of acclimation granulation beginning of the mature phase and end of the experiment for their qs and qq related features the variation trends of the qs and qq could be revealed however more intensive sampling would be useful to fully illustrate the accurate changes in the qs and qq in the long term operation of bioreactors in addition though the value of bacterial abundance in the sludge sampled from a well mixed bioreactor could be viewed as the mean value of biological replicates the bias that might be introduced by high throughput sequencing could not be substantially eliminated therefore more replicates both biological and technical should be carried out in future studies to obtain more reliable information on the community structure especially the low abundant qs and qq genera the roles of qs in aerobic granulation were widely recognized nancharaiah and reddy 2018 tan et al 2015 wang et al 2017 and the enhancement in ahls was reported to accelerate sludge granulation zhang et al 2020 however these results were mainly obtained in the initial phase of sludge granulation and the changing profiles of

nancharaiah and reddy 2018 yang and alvarez 2015 the exact contributions of the ahl mediated qs and other environmental factors to the formation of aerobic granules in different granulation phases also need future investigations 4 conclusions after tracking the qs and qq profiles of an aerobic granule reactor during its start up and over 300 day operation period the qs activities and communities were found to increase in the start up but gradually decrease in the long term operation while the qq activities and communities remained stable this result reveals the longer persistence

17892,antibiotic resistance has been recognized as a major threat to public health worldwide inactivation of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and degradation of antibiotic resistance genes args are critical to prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment conventional disinfection processes are effective to inactivate water borne pathogens yet they are unable to completely eliminate the antibiotic resistance risk this study explored the potential of the photo fenton process to inactivate arb and to degrade both extracellular and intracellular args e args and i args respectively using escherichia coli dh5α with two plasmid encoded args teta and bla tem 1 as a model arb a 6 17 log arb removal was achieved within 30 min of applying photo fenton under visible led and neutral ph conditions in addition no arb regrowth occurred after 48 h demonstrating that this process is very effective to induce permanent disinfection on arb the photo fenton process was validated under various water matrices including ultrapure water upw simulated wastewater sww and phosphate buffer pbs the higher inactivation efficiency was observed in sww as compared to other matrices the photo fenton process also caused a 6 75 to 8 56 log reduction in eargs based on quantitative real time pcr of both short and long amplicons atomic force microscopy afm further confirmed that the extracellular dna was sheared into short dna fragments thus eliminating the risk of the transmission of antibiotic resistance as compared with e args a higher dosage of fenton reagent was required to damage i args in addition the teta gene was more easily degraded than the bla tem 1 gene collectively our results demonstrate the photo fenton process is a promising technology for disinfecting water to prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotic resistant bacteria arb antibiotic resistance genes args advanced oxidation processes

escalating healthcare costs it is predicted that 10 million deaths will be caused by infections associated with amr by 2050 if no action is taken now o neill et al 2014 there are increasing studies reporting the transmission of antibiotic resistance from the environment to humans and animals davis and price 2016 huijbers et al 2015 marshall and levy 2011 singer et al 2016 thus it is critical to develop an efficient control strategy to mitigate the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in the environment water disinfection is critical in water and wastewater treatment systems to supply safe water by inactivating and destroying water borne pathogens backer 2017 common disinfection techniques include chlorination ultraviolet radiation uv and ozonation o3 however these techniques can be less effective for highly resistant waterborne bacteria this necessitates the use of higher disinfectant doses in addition chlorination and ozonation could increase the potential for development of carcinogenic disinfection by products dbp le roux et al 2017 park et al 2016 watson et al 2012 more seriously the disinfection may result in incomplete removal of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args in treated water or wastewater consequently these residual arb or args may pose environmental and public health risks evidence has shown that args can transfer to humans through drinking water sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 or food polluted by args chang et al 2015 founou et al 2016 furthermore disinfection agents can cause bacteria to release dna into the environment if this extracellular dna carries args horizontal transfer of args into other bacteria may occur wang et al 2016 in particular extracellular args e args may be components of genetic mobile elements such as plasmids or integrons which are gaining increasing attention for how their robustness and mobility contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance mao et al 2014 yu et al 2017 recent evidence suggests that natural bacterial transformations with short dna fragments are frequent in the environment overballe petersen et al 2013 suggesting that free dna in water could pose a serious threat to human health and ecosystems therefore there is an urgent need to develop water disinfection processes which are safe environmentally friendly low cost and highly efficient for removing both arb and args advanced oxidation processes aop such as the fenton reaction h2o2 tio2 sunlight and uv h2o2 have been proposed as alternatives to commonly used disinfection processes e g uv

based photocatalysis process has a relatively high energy consumption require cooling system or have a relatively short life span of uv light izadifard et al 2013 jo and tayade 2014 to address these barriers leds has been used as an environmentally friendly and alternative irradiation source to achieve water disinfection to date very few studies have applied led active photocatalyst for inactivation of arb and degradation of args the photo fenton process has been proposed as one of promising photo driven aops han et al 2020 giannakis et al 2018 the classical photo fenton process is more efficient at acidic ph which is one of the most demerits of this process since water must be previously acidified and then neutralized after treatment for reuse thus increasing operational costs recently many efforts have been made to alleviate this drawback esteban garcía et al 2018 giannakis et al 2016b for example iron containing complexing agents have been used to offer higher photo absorption as compared to aquo complexes miralles cuevas et al 2014 ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds is one of such complexing agents which is an environmentally friendly metal chelate highly biodegradable and nontoxic under environmental conditions cuervo lumbaque et al 2019 however there are very limited studies on the degradation of args by photo fenton process in particular no specific study on the degradation of e args in addition previous studies mainly used the short amplicons based qpcr method ferro et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 pecson et al 2011 yoon et al 2017 yuan et al 2015 zhuang et al 2015 to assess the arg removal efficiency however qpcr with short amplicon primers might overestimate arg removal efficiency since the length of args is usually larger than 860 1200 bp chang et al 2017 mckinney and pruden 2012 more accurate results may be obtained through using qpcr with long amplicon primers to evaluate arg degradation performance the main purpose of this study was

field was selected for observation in each sample and the dominant images were used to represent the final condition of dna 2 9 reactive oxygen species ros identification during aops various reactive species are generated in the presence of reactant to determine which ros contribute to inactivation of arb during photo fenton process scavengers including isopropanol 1 mm sodium azide 1 mm triethanolamine 1 mm potassium dichromate 0 5 mm and catalase 3000u were used for quenching hydroxyl radicals oh singlet oxygen o 2 1 hole h electron e and h2o2 respectively in addition thiourea 1 mm was also applied to quench to h2o2 oh and o 2 1 moreover the efficiency of the scavengers was determined using viable cell count 2 10 inactivation kinetics analysis and model selection the inactivation kinetics of e coli is represented by two different phases namely the linear inactivation in log scale and the lag period shoulder the lag period represents the time needed by bacteria to accumulate damage before reaching inactivation and thereafter their inactivation follows a consistent linear trend the model was developed by geeraerd et al 2000 for the comparison of inactivation kinetics the curves were modelled using the ginafit add on for excel geeraerd et al 2005 and the shoulder log linear decay model was fit to the curves the model mainly follow the chick model chick 1908 which is simplified as follows 3 n n 0 n res e k m a x t e k m a x s l 1 e k m a x s l 1 e k m a x t n res for identification purposes it can be presented as 4 log 10 n log 10 10 log 10 n 0 10

concentration cfu ml t is inactivation time min sl is the length of the lag phase period also known as shoulder length k max 1 time unit is the specific inactivation rate or first order inactivation constant i e the maximum slope n res is the residual population density cfu ml the degrees of freedom used during parameter estimation by ginafit are log 10 n 0 log 10 n res k max and s l the model used to describe the degradation of extracellular arg e arg was as following zhang et al 2019 5 ln n n 0 k t the simplified model is as follows 6 n n o e k m a x t for identification purposes it can be presented as 7 log 10 n log 10 n o k m a x t l n 10 where n represents gene copy number of the specific gene after treatment copies μl 1 n0 is the initial gene copy number of the specific gene j

transformed before statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was conducted to analyse the data and expressed as mean values standard deviation sd graphpad prism 8 1 4 was used to compare the respective linear regression slopes of the logarithmic concentration to study the inactivation of arb and args 3 results and discussion 3 1 inactivation efficiency of arb to get the optimal photo fenton doses various fe2 concentrations 0 05 0 1 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 mm which are equivalent to 0 3 0 6 1 4 2 8 and 4 2 mg l respectively and h2o2 concentrations 2 5 5 0 7 5 10 0 and 12 5 mm which are equivalent to 85 0 170 1 255 1 340 2 and 408 2 mg l respectively and light irradiation doses at 3 6 4 8 9 6 and 19 2 mw cm2 were initially tested and the results are shown in fig s4 in fenton process it is well known that higher h2o2 to contaminant ratios result in more extensive contaminant degradation while higher concentrations of fe2 yield higher degradation lopez et al 2004 according to the results increasing concentrations of fe2 and h2o2 could not increase the bacterial disinfection efficiency in fact increasing iron concentration might impact the water quality and increase the sediment concentration which may scatter the radiation eventually protecting bacteria against solar photons bianco et al 2017 garcía fernández et al 2019 in addition excessive h2o2 also could result in undesired scavenging reactions of oh radicals tang and huang 1997 zhang et al 2016 it can be observed that 0 5 mm of fe2 2 8 mg l 10 mm of h2o2 340 2 mg l and 19 2 mw cm2 of visible led light irradiation doses led to the highest inactivation efficiency 6 17 log reduction of arb during 30 min treatment when fe2 dose was enlarged to 0 75 mm 4 2 mg l the inactivation efficiency was declined to 4 08 log reduction and the increasing of h2o2 doses from 10 mm 340 2 mg l to 12 5 mm i e 408 2 mg l remaining fe2 at 2 8 mg l did not provide a significant enhancement in arb inactivation 4 16 log reduction higher the dose of these reagents could limit the disinfection efficiency due to scavenging effects on radicals h2o2 oh h2o hoo fe2 oh fe3 oh giannakis et al 2016a serna galvis et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 to compare with the inactivation capability of the photo fenton process arb were exposed to various treatments such as visible light fe2 h2o2 light h2o2 and fenton alone fig 1 the arb concentration did not significantly change in absence of light for 30 min p 0 05 under visible led illumination the inactivation of arb was also negligible as evidenced with 0 10 log reduction the inactivation efficiency of fe2 0 5 mm or 2 8 mg l in the presence of light was 0 35 log reduction slightly higher than that of visible light alone at 0 10 log reduction in the presence of light it seems that fe2 may play a minor role to inactivate arb the intracellular fenton reactions may generate radicals which can kill bacteria feng et al 2003 moncayo lasso et al 2008 however at neutral ph the iron species present in the solution is fe oh 0 2 aq which can form complexes with the net negatively charged e coli cell pignatello et al 2006 the inactivation of arb could occur due to the precipitation of fe3 generated through oxidation of fe2 to fe3 in presence of dissolved oxygen pignatello et al 2006 in this study the addition of 10 mm h2o2 340 2 mg l resulted in 1 71 log reduction of arb at 1 2 1 4 å the h2o2 molecule is much smaller than bacterial porins 10 11 å aguayo et al 2015 in addition h2o2 has a similar polarity to water which allows diffusion into the bacterial cell potentially causing damage by oxidative stress accumulation of h2o2 inside the cell may cause oxidation of protein cysteinyl and methionine residues as well as lipids thus inactivating the cell garcía fernández et al 2012 the inactivation efficiency of arb by h2o2 combined with light was significantly higher than that of h2o2 alone with 6 17 log reduction within 60 min without light the depletion rate is lower and results in lower inactivation efficiency 1 71 log reduction of arb during 60 min treatment the synergy between h2o2 and visible light is clear and maximum bacterial cell are unable to repair the damage produced by visible radiation in presence of h2o2 some of the primary endogenous photosensitizers such as porphyrins coproporphyrin ii protorphyrin ix and uroporphyrin iii are responsible to absorb visible light inside the cell and enhance the inactivation of bacteria hessling et al 2017 in fact the generation of more ros and penetrate into the cells seemed to be enhanced under illumination in presence of h2o2 leading to oxidation of more intracellular fe2 to fe3 the ferric ion fe3 may be subject to photoreduction by ligand to metal charge transfer lmct regenerating fe2 with simultaneous oxidative species production in addition h2o2 can also cause the oxidation of iron sulfur clusters releasing fe3 imlay 2003 more recently giannakis et al 2018a b c reported complete inactivation of streptomycin resistant e coli with 20 mg l h2o2 0 55 mm after 90 min exposure to artificial sunlight arb inactivation was also observed for 1 mg l giannakis et al 2017 and 10 mg l giannakis et al 2018 porras et al 2018 h2o2 respectively these studies showed that the inactivation of arb increased with an increase in fe2 h2o2 molar ratio determining the optimum molar ratio to be 1 20 in the current study the addition of 0 5 mm fe2 i e 2 8 mg l in combination with 10 mm h2o2 i e 340 2 mg l caused a 1 77 log reduction within 60 min similar to the results observed when h2o2 alone was added the left and right gates indicated an sgi stained e coli cell the sgi stained all cells by binding to dna irrespective of viability as long as the integrity of cells or dna remains unaffected the fluorescence fingerprint remains unchanged if the integrity of cells or dna is severely damaged e g cell lysis or double strand breaks the sgi binding is weakened and the green fluorescence intensity is diminished yoon et al 2017 fcm results further suggested that the studied dose changed the fluorescence intensity indicating that the integrity of the cells and dna was changed the percentage of intact cells dropped dramatically to less than 10 after 15 min treatment and this proportion almost the same during the 30 min treatment fig 2 the cell membrane damage data showed that around 92 of membrane integrity was lost after 15 min treatment and it increased to 93 after 30 min photo fenton treatment fig 3 it is interesting to note that at disinfection after 30 min of treatment no bacterial regrowth was detected in this system due to the less dominant intact cell on the fcm plots fig 3 3 2 regrowth analysis the regrowth potential of arb after photo fenton treatment at various contact times was assessed to investigate if the bacterial cells are still viable during the storage or distribution of the treated effluent fig 4 it was observed that the contact time played a significant role in completely inactivating bacteria the regrowth of arb decreased with increasing contacting time specifically with 15 min of contact time arb were still viable after 24 h incubation and the regrowth was more obvious after 48 h incubation however after 30 min of photo fenton treatment no regrowth was observed indicating complete inactivation of arb it was found that a contact time of 30 min was adequate to prevent the regrowth of arb even after 7 day incubation data not shown inactivation and regrowth results of this study are consistent with previous the solar photo fenton process fiorentino et al 2015 giannakis et al 2018 giannakis et al 2018 and uv h2o2 fiorentino et al 2015 giannakis et al 2018 serna galvis et al 2020 they investigated the inactivation and reactivation of several arb in ultrapure water giannakis et al 2018 giannakis et al 2018 or real wastewater fiorentino et al 2019 moreira et al 2018 serna galvis et al 2019 giannakis et al 2018a b c observed the solar h2o2 and the photo fenton process 1 mg l of fe2 and 20 mg l of h2o2 were able to control the regrowth of streptomycin resistant strain e coli w1485 in presence of streptomycin but the process required 3 and 3 5 h or even longer treatment time 5 and 6 h in absence of antibiotic respectively giannakis et al 2018 in solar photo fenton regrowth experiments they examined two storage conditions with or without catalysts to assess the effects of residual h2o2 at room temperature the complete inactivation of both e coli and mrsa could be achieved after 120 and 90 min with or without catalysts respectively giannakis et al 2018 fiorentino et al 2015 compared the inactivation and regrowth potential for h2o2 sunlight and the conventional chlorination process they observed 1 0 mg l of cl2 was more effective to inactivate the mdr e coli than the sunlight h2o2 50 mg l to achieve a complete inactivation 15 min vs 90 min but it was less effective in controlling their regrowth 24 h vs 48h although our photo fenton process required higher concentration of h2o2 10 mm or 340 2 mg l it can prevent the regrowth of e coli until 7 days 3 3 the dominant ros identification the ros consisting of hydroxyl radical oh singlet oxygen o 2 1 hole h electron e and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 play an important role in photo driven aops for inactivating arb in order to identify the key ros related to the photo fenton process several ros scavengers including thiourea 1 mm sodium azide 1 mm triethanolamine 1 mm potassium dichromate 0 5 mm isopropanol 1 mm and catalase 3000u were used to quench the respective radicals in absence of any of these scavengers arb could be inactivated with more than 6 log reduction after 30 min treatment however in the presence of triethanolamine to quench h and sodium azide to quench o 2 1 the inactivation efficiency did not change significantly compared with no scavenger system indicating that both h and o 2 1 played very a minor role in this process fig 5 in fenton process o 2 1 radical also generates zhichao et al 2019 which further react with each other s and finally forming h2o2 rather than o 2 1 imlay 2003 in this case this radical have less effect in bacterial inactivation process as an electron scavenger k2cr2o7 inactivated 2 25 log arb suggesting that e play a moderate role in the photo fenton process in addition cr vi could remove not only e but also part of h2o2 by combining o2 with conduction band e chen et al 2011 shi et al 2014 therefore the inactivation efficiency of cr vi was slightly higher than the triethanolamine and sodium azide after adding the scavenger of h2o2 bovine catalase into the system the bacterial cell density only decreased around 0 25 log the catalase scavenges most of h2o2 and only fe ion without h2o2 was unable to inactivate arb in photo fenton process thiourea is known to be a powerful scavenger of o 2 1 oh and h2o2 farmer et al 2006 prasad and mishra 2017 after adding 1 mm of thiourea a lower inactivation efficiency 0 45 log reduction was observed which is nearly 93 decline in the disinfection efficiency in comparison to the results without scavenger isopropanol is also known as an oh radical scavenger for further confirmation of the efficiency of this ros isopropanol was used as an alternative scavenger which could scavenge most of the oh radicals thus resulting in an obvious decrease of arb inactivation efficiency collectively oh radical was identified as the dominant ros in the photo fenton process to inactivate arb enhanced inactivation 6 17 log reduction was observed in the photo fenton process within 30 min while the traditional fenton process in the absence of light was only able to achieve 1 77 log reduction within 60 min this is likely due to the higher ros generation in presence of light in the photo fenton system higher production of oh occurred inside or close to the bacterial cell through the reaction of fe ions with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of light energy more specifically the presence of extracellular h2o2 and iron may enhance the generation of extracellular oh that comes into contact with the bacterial membrane leading to lipid peroxidation and cell death 3 4 validation of arb inactivation under different water matrices this study further examined arb inactivation under different water matrices including upw sww and pbs fig 6 a the photo fenton process achieved 6 17 2 31 and 3 32 log arb reduction in the first 15 min treatment in upw sww and pbs respectively while the complete disinfection of e coli could be obtained after 30 min treatment under three matrix conditions a lower disinfection efficiency 2 31 log in sww suggested delayed disinfection compared to the other two matrices the reason is associated with that synthetic wastewater contains readily metabolizable and recalcitrant organic matter which delay the inactivation efficiency dissolved organic matter dom in sww may have a dual role acting as a sensitizer and a quencher in the photooxidation process janssen et al 2014 a faster inactivation was also observed in upw in which arb inactivation reached the lower detection limit after 15 min treatment it was observed that ph dramatically changed from ph 7 4 to 3 24 under the upw matrix conditions such the fast inactivation rate may be due to the high acidity of the reaction medium which would negatively affect the viability of the microorganisms karaolia et al 2014 under an acidic environment fe h2o 5 oh 2 is the predominant form of iron gallard et al 1999 which allows fe2 regeneration under the light radiation and it further reacts with h2o2 and generating sufficient oh radicals thus enabling to inactivate the bacteria fast papoutsakis et al 2015 in the pbs the inactivation efficiency was comparatively higher as compared to sww but it was lower than that in the upw due to the reduction of generated oh during the treatment process by the coordinating phosphate buffer chen 2019 yoshimura et al 1992 therefore the inactivation efficiency is higher in upw as compared to other water matrices a similar behaviour reported for clarithromycin and sulfamethoxazole resistant enterococcus in sww under solar driven fenton process 100 ppb substrate fe3 5 mg l h2o2 50 mg l ph 4 which achieved 5 log removal efficiency after 150 min and 240 min treatment for deionized water dw and sww respectively karaolia et al 2014 yoon et al 2017 reported a higher degradation efficiency for args in the pbs solution as compared to real wastewater matrix but required a higher chlorine dose or uv fluence or uv h2o2 doses due to oxidant demands or uv screening effect yoon et al 2017 the slower bacterial k pneumoniae inactivation was observed in the complex water than the distilled water by serna galvis et al 2019 and they observed the generated oh radicals were not selective and the radicals could also react with the organic compounds and inorganic anions in the matrix during the photo fenton process fe2 5 mg l h2o2 50 mg l and intensity of uva light 3 9 w m2 serna galvis et al 2019 our results showed that using the photo fenton process a 6 17 log reduction was achieved within 30 min which is significantly faster than the traditional fenton process demonstrating the synergistic effects of combining a suitable light source with fenton reagents it should be highlighted that our experiments were carried out at neutral ph 6 85 7 4 using a low energy and low cost visible led light 196 10 w m2 which is more practical as compared with low ph 4 and solar light uv used in previous studies ferro et al 2015 karaolia et al 2014 although the fenton process is effective at acidic ph urban wastewater ph is typically in the range of 7 0 8 0 zhang et al 2016 therefore creating acidic conditions for the fenton process would increase chemical dosage costs for urban wastewater disinfection recently mosteo et al 2020 reported that the driving force of bacterial inactivation is the intracellular photo fenton process rather than the light itself the effectiveness of the intracellular process relies on the transport of reagents into the cell which is mainly dependent on the amount of reagents added to the bulk mosteo et al 2020 although uva vis mediated disinfection is effective even at very low irradiance values the mechanisms initiated by visible light are not enough to inflict inactivation before a certain energy threshold therefore the inactivation can be enhanced by increasing the radiation intensities or adding higher doses of h2o2 and iron which facilities intracellular photo fenton reaction as a compromise the current study used a comparatively higher concentration of h2o2 but previous studies used a higher amount of iron 5 20 mg l de la obra jiménez et al 2019 esteban garcía et al 2018 fiorentino et al 2019 garcía fernández et al 2019 garcía fernández et al 2012 karaolia et al 2014 klamerth et al 2013 serna galvis et al 2019 this study used visible led light and its irradiance was comparatively lower which might not result in cell damage or alternatively the self defence cellular mechanisms are enough to cope with the generated stresses in this system mosteo et al 2020 visible light alone initiates the reaction pathways which are enhanced by the addition of h2o2 and fe2 therefore higher doses of h2o2 and fe2 required in our treatment system could facilitate both the extracellular oxidation and intracellular photo fenton reaction under low irradiance eventually causing cellular damage by oxidative stress under neutral conditions ruales lonfat et al 2014 to improve the inactivation efficiency in wastewater and reduce the concentration of h2o2 the fe edds complex was tested as an alternative system in the modified fenton process 1 2 fe edds ratio was used with the same fe2 dosage 0 5 mm but the h2o2 dosage was reduced from 10 to 5 mm fig 6b shows inactivation efficiency of arb in three water matrices upw sww and pbs the bacterial disinfection efficiency was comparatively lower in upw than sww matrix it may be due to some of organic compounds cooh and oh groups which can form complexes with iron in the presence of edds thus promoting the fenton like oxidation processes such dosage and contacting time condition in sww was also sufficient to prevent its regrowth as shown in fig s5 in contrast the same condition was not sufficient to prevent the regrowth in phosphate buffer which may compete with microbial cells for generated oh further investigations about the competitive roles of organic and inorganic matter present in different water matrices should be conducted to determine their influences on the disinfection efficiency of the edds complex modified photo fenton process 3 5 degradation of extracellular antibiotic resistance genes e args 3 5 1 effects of photo fenton process on an abundance of e args qpcr analysis under stressful conditions e g when water is chlorinated arb lose membrane integrity thereby releasing cytoplasmic contents and causing dna to leak out of the cell the args released can be uptaken by other bacteria thus resulting in further spread of args in the environment wang et al 2016 previous aops or disinfection studies mainly focused on arb inactivation yet the persistence of args has been overlooked so far ferro et al 2015 fiorentino et al 2015 giannakis et al 2018 giannakis et al 2018 karaolia et al 2014 mackuľak et al 2015 rizzo et al 2014a 2014b xiong and hu 2013 therefore the qpcr analysis was carried out to quantify the degradation of e args under various photo fenton dosages as shown in fig 7 the degradation of two e args teta and bla tem 1 exhibited increased degradation under different photo fenton dosages over time under the conditions of 0 5 mm of fe2 2 8 mg l with 10 mm of h2o2 170 7 mg l a 7 6 log reduction of teta and 8 6 log reduction of bla tem 1 genes was achieved after 10 min visible light irradiation these results were 2 5 3 5 log higher than the lower photo fenton dose of 0 178 mm of fe2 1 0 mg l and 0 55 mm of h2o2 18 71 mg l at the same contact time 10 min a contact time of 20 min was required to reach the detection limit of e args compared with the arg abundance based on the short amplicon qpcr a higher log reduction of e args was achieved based on the long amplicon qpcr for example bla tem 1 gene was degraded with 7 49 and 8 56 log reduction while teta gene was removed with 6 75 and 7 62 log reduction based on the short and long amplicon respectively it should be noted that the e args degradation rates achieved in this study are much higher than that in previous studies employing various aops or disinfection processes for example zhang et al 2016 reported that maximum 4 5 5 3 log reduction of sul1 tetx and inti1 as well as 2 8 3 4 log reduction of tetg and 16s rrna genes were achieved at the fe2 h2o2 molar ratio of 0 5 and h2o2 concentration of 2 mm with a ph of 3 0 after 2 h treatment time yoon et al 2017 reported that uv fluence of 61 92 mj cm2 would result in 4 0 log of e args at ph of 8 0 while the same removal efficiency was observed at lower uv fluence 44 77 mj cm2 but with 10 mg l h2o2 however the degradation rate of e args were 1 5 fold higher in uv h2o2 as compared to the only uv treatment this may be associate with that the structural integrity of extracellular plasmid are changed more rapidly in uv h2o2 but the initial plasmid concentration remained unchanged in the presence of h2o2 without uv yoon et al 2017 in terms of e arg removal efficiency our study suggests that the photo fenton is more promising for e arg inactivation compared to uv irradiation and uv h2o2 a higher degradation rate of e args might be due to the generation of ros mainly oh radicals a lower photo fenton dosage requires a longer contact time to generate the required ross for complete degradation of e args 3 5 2 effects of photo fenton process on the destruction of e args afm analysis the afm imaging was further performed to evaluate the destruction extent of plasmid dna before and after the photo fenton treatment fig 8 before the treatment the naked dna i e extracellular dna shows large patches of dna molecules with the size ranging from 1600 to 2000 nm fig 8a the changing topography were observed with the addition of photo fenton under different treatment time a bright band of dna persisted throughout the treatment process and slight aggregated migration was observed due to the formation of larger scale higher molecular weight dna jiang et al 2017 as shown in fig 8b the aggregated dna formed lumps with an average diameter of 100 400 nm however the dna was eventually degraded into tiny pieces with higher doses of fe2 and h2o2 0 5 mm or 2 8 mg l and 10 mm or 340 2 mg l as observed in fig 8c collectively the afm images confirmed that the treatment process can damage extracellular dna under visible light moreover the plasmid dna is directly exposed to the ros and there was no bacterial cell wall a shorter treatment time 10 min was sufficient to damage the naked dna as compared to the contact time for arb inactivation 30 min at the default fenton dosage 0 5 mm of fe2 2 8 mg l and 10 mm of h2o2 340 2 mg l 3 6 degradation of intracellular antibiotic resistance genes i args 3 6 1 effects of photo fenton process on i args qpcr analysis to determine whether the photo fenton process can effectively damage i args the abundances of i args before and after treatment were also determined based on both short and long amplicon qpcr the abundance of i args did not change significantly p 0 05 at the default photo fenton condition 0 5 mm of fe2 and 10 mm of h2o2 in phosphate buffer the i arg degradation was observed at 10 times higher doses 5 mm of fe2 and 100 mm of h2o2 than the default photo fenton doses in pbs matrix fig 9 at this dose approximate 0 52 log of the short amplicon and 1 02 log reduction of long amplicon i args degradation were achieved the highest 7 85 8 67 log reduction of teta and 8 12 8 86 log reduction of bla tem 1 were observed at 20 mm of fe2 and 400 mm of h2o2 with 60 min light irradiation zhang et al 2016 observed the photo fenton process was slightly more efficient in reducing i args than the uv h2o2 process they achieved approximately 2 58 3 79 logs of i args removal efficiency as compare to uv h2o2 process 2 63 3 48 log at the optimum conditions moreira et al 2018 analyzed the degradation efficiency of various i args genes such as 16s rrna inti1 qnrs blactx m sul1 blatem and vana by p25 h2o2 photocatalysis and solar h2o2 process they observed the only vana was below the limit of detection after treatment and other genes showed 1 0 log reduction or 3 0 log reduction for blactx m after treatment they suggest some bacteria could recover after the treatment serna galvis et al 2019 evaluated the fate of carbapenem resistance gene bla kpc in k pneumoniae during and after the bacteria elimination by the photo fenton process they observed arb was completely inactivated after 120 min but the encoding gene remained at such time indeed the gene was not degraded even after 240 min treatment and suggests that resistance transference was still plausible serna galvis et al 2019 together with these previous studies this study suggests that the photo fenton process with 0 5 mm of fe2 and 10 mm of h2o2 were prominent to inactivate arb and e args but had limited potential to destruct i args since i args could be protected by the cell wall 3 6 2 effects of photo fenton process on i args afm analysis afm was also used to reflect the structural damage of intracellular dna molecule which is often circular structure clowes 1972 del solar et al 1998 when dna comes in contact with ros the circular dna is converted to an open circle form by a single strand break and to linear dna by a double strand break burrows and muller 1998 srinivasan et al 2001 zhang et al 2019 thus extensive double strand breaks would be necessary to confirm the complete degradation of dna the afm images show the different conformations of intracellular dna samples treated under different doses of photo fenton processes different topographical images such as twisted wind cross linked polymer aggregated and tiny linear like topograph were observed in fig 10 a to d respectively after applying the photo fenton process under the default dose condition 0 5 mm of fe2 2 8 mg l and 10 mm of h2o2 340 2 mg l after 1 h treatment the dna was observed as a cross linked polymer fig 10b and no args inactivation was achieved which was consistent with the qpcr data if the photo fenton doses were increased by 10 folds 5 mm of fe2 28 mg l and 100 mm of h2o2 3 4 g l 0 5 0 8 log reduction was observed for i args correspondingly the afm image shows the aggregated morphology at this dose fig 10c the completed degradation of the args was observed at higher doses of photo fenton process 20 mm of fe2 112 mg l and 400 mm of h2o2 13 6 g l and dna become smaller dispersed fine grain structures fig 10d the tiny linear pieces were unable to be amplified and determined by either the short or long amplicon qpcr collectively higher fenton agent dosages are required to completely degrade the i args compared to e args 3 7 the inactivation kinetics of arb and args the chick watson model was applied to elucidate the arb inactivation and determine the model parameters sl and k max table s2 the fitting of the experimental data to equation 2 was very good in terms of adj r2 97 in the light control the inactivation rate of arb was very low k max 0 02 min 1 under the condition of 2 8 mg l fe2 0 5 mm with light the reaction rate and the lag period were kept to be same but the shoulder length sl was decreased from 99 55 to 24 88 which was evidenced with a bit inactivation efficiency 0 40 log reduction the same pattern was observed at 10 mm of h2o2 340 2 mg l alone which is not strong enough to inactivate arb completely in the absence of light and the obtained k max is 0 06 min 1 however both the combination of the chemicals 0 5 mm of fe2 2 8 mg l and 10 mm of h2o2 340 2 mg l in fenton process slightly increases the k max value to be 0 07 min 1 this indicates that the participation of the external fenton action by the production of oh radicals is limited mainly by the kinetics of fe3 regeneration back to fe2 for restarting the catalytic chain giannakis et al 2018 finally the photo fenton process dramatically increases the inactivation rate with the addition of light the inactivation rate was increased from k max 0 07 min 1 to k max 0 91 min 1 which can also reduce the lag period from 60 to 30 min this photo fenton process also fits the first order kinetics very well r2 99 the results also suggest that the visible light is driven force for the arb inactivation by the photo fenton process the reaction kinetics of args were comparatively lower than the inactivation kinetics of arb with considering the treatment time we observed the reaction kinetics for e args at lower photo fenton doses 0 178 mm fe2 1 mg l 0 55 mm h2o2 18 71 mg l however the model eq 6 and eq 7 was not suitable for higher photo fenton doses 0 5 mm of fe2 2 8 mg l and 10 mm of h2o2 340 2 mg l due to the complete degradation of plasmid after 10 min treatment at lower photo fenton doses the inactivation rate of bla tem 1 k max 0 87 min 1 was faster than that of the teta gene k max 0 98 min 1 due to the adjacent t t bases the bla tem 1 gene contains 1 5 times higher t t bases than teta which is 72 of teta length therefore higher t t base containing long amplicon results in faster degradation than the long amplicon of teta moreover the degradation rate teta gene 1200 bp is larger than the bla tem 1 gene 861 bp as shown in table s3 the rate constants of long amplicon genes were higher than the short amplicon genes table s3 for example the inactivation rate of bla tem 1 long amplicon is 0 98 min 1 which is a higher 0 88 min 1 of bla tem 1 short amplicon this was expected due to the larger number of targets in the long amplicon sequence compared to the short amplicon sequence larger amplicon genes could change the plasmid dna structure from initial supercoiled to nicked circular or linear form with a subsequent increase in qpcr amplification efficiency lin et al 2011 4 conclusions in order to mitigate the spread of antibiotic resistance in urban water systems an efficient water disinfection process is required to inactivate arb and also destroy args in this study the potential for the photo fenton process to inactivate arb and degrade both the e args and i args was evaluated the highest 6 17 log arb inactivation was achieved at photo fenton dose 0 5 mm of fe2 and 10 mm of h2o2 under led irradiation and neutral ph within 30 min no bacterial regrowth was observed after 2 days even in the absence of residual h2o2 half of h2o2 concentration was required to achieve the higher inactivation efficiency in sww by employing the edds as a complexing agent more importantly the photo fenton process also destroyed e args 6 75 8 56 log based on qpcr measurement and afm analysis the high inactivation efficiency is due to the photo fenton process where extracellular h2o2 and iron enhance the generation of extracellular oh that damages the cell membrane and causes dna degradation overall this study demonstrated that the photo fenton process is effective to achieve arb inactivation and e arg degradation however the photo fenton dose 0 5 mm of fe2 and 10 mm of h2o2 are relatively high which will limit its application in water or wastewater disinfection in practice further studies are required to reduce iron and h2o2 doses by using solar

17892,antibiotic resistance has been recognized as a major threat to public health worldwide inactivation of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and degradation of antibiotic resistance genes args are critical to prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment conventional disinfection processes are effective to inactivate water borne pathogens yet they are unable to completely eliminate the antibiotic resistance risk this study explored the potential of the photo fenton process to inactivate arb and to degrade both extracellular and intracellular args e args and i args respectively using escherichia coli dh5α with two plasmid encoded args teta and bla tem 1 as a model arb a 6 17 log arb removal was achieved within 30 min of applying photo fenton under visible led and neutral ph conditions in addition no arb regrowth occurred after 48 h demonstrating that this process is very effective to induce permanent disinfection on arb the photo fenton process was validated under various water matrices including ultrapure water upw simulated wastewater sww and phosphate buffer pbs the higher inactivation efficiency was observed in sww as compared to other matrices the photo fenton process also caused a 6 75 to 8 56 log reduction in eargs based on quantitative real time pcr of both short and long amplicons atomic force microscopy afm further confirmed that the extracellular dna was sheared into short dna fragments thus eliminating the risk of the transmission of antibiotic resistance as compared with e args a higher dosage of fenton reagent was required to damage i args in addition the teta gene was more easily degraded than the bla tem 1 gene collectively our results demonstrate the photo fenton process is a promising technology for disinfecting water to prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotic resistant bacteria arb antibiotic resistance genes args advanced oxidation processes aops extracellular args e args intracellular args i args photo fenton 1 introduction antimicrobial resistance amr is one of the biggest threats for public health due to untreatable infections and escalating healthcare costs it is predicted that 10 million deaths will be caused by infections associated with amr by 2050 if no action is taken now o neill et al 2014 there are increasing studies reporting the transmission of antibiotic resistance from the environment to humans and animals davis and price 2016 huijbers et al 2015 marshall and levy 2011 singer et al 2016 thus it is critical to develop an efficient control strategy to mitigate the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in the environment water disinfection is critical in water and wastewater treatment systems to supply safe water by inactivating and destroying water borne pathogens backer 2017 common disinfection techniques include chlorination ultraviolet radiation uv and ozonation o3 however these techniques can be less effective for highly resistant waterborne bacteria this necessitates the use of higher disinfectant doses in addition chlorination and ozonation could increase the potential for development of carcinogenic disinfection by products dbp le roux et al 2017 park et al 2016 watson et al 2012 more seriously the disinfection may result in incomplete removal of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args in treated water or wastewater consequently these residual arb or args may pose environmental and public health risks evidence has shown that args can transfer to humans through drinking water sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 or food polluted by args chang et al 2015 founou et al 2016 furthermore disinfection agents can cause bacteria to release dna into the environment if this extracellular dna carries args horizontal transfer of args into other bacteria may occur wang et al 2016 in particular extracellular args e args may be components of genetic mobile elements such as plasmids or integrons which are gaining increasing attention for how their robustness and mobility contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance mao et al 2014 yu et al 2017 recent evidence suggests that natural bacterial transformations with short dna fragments are frequent in the environment overballe petersen et al 2013 suggesting that free dna in water could pose a serious threat to human health and ecosystems therefore there is an urgent need to develop water disinfection processes which are safe environmentally friendly low cost and highly efficient for removing both arb and args advanced oxidation processes aop such as the fenton reaction h2o2 tio2 sunlight and uv h2o2 have been proposed as alternatives to commonly used disinfection processes e g uv chlorine and ozone aops typically involve chemical agents metals ozone or hydrogen peroxide and an assistive energy source such as uv or visible light current ultrasound or γ irradiation oppenländer 2007 to in situ generate various reactive oxygen species ros for the inactivation of microorganisms regmi et al 2018 although photo driven aops can significantly remove various contaminants few studies have determined the removal efficiency of arb and args for example previous studies reported that complete arb inactivation and 0 83 to 5 59 log reduction in args could be obtained with uv h2o2 ferro et al 2015 2017 guo et al 2017 he et al 2019 moreira et al 2018 serna galvis et al 2020 yoon et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 uv tio2 ferro et al 2015 guo et al 2017 karaolia et al 2018 moreira et al 2018 rizzo et al 2014a photo catalysis treatment jiang et al 2017 karaolia et al 2018 yu et al 2020 and photo fenton process esteban garcía et al 2018 fiorentino et al 2019 garcía fernández et al 2019 giannakis et al 2018 giannakis et al 2018 serna galvis et al 2019 however it should be noted that most of previous studies employed energy intensive uv light for the photo drive aops reactions de la obra jiménez et al 2019 ferreira et al 2020 giannakis et al 2018 giannakis et al 2018 han et al 2020 huang et al 2020 li et al 2015 which might suffer a few disadvantages for example the uv based photocatalysis process has a relatively high energy consumption require cooling system or have a relatively short life span of uv light izadifard et al 2013 jo and tayade 2014 to address these barriers leds has been used as an environmentally friendly and alternative irradiation source to achieve water disinfection to date very few studies have applied led active photocatalyst for inactivation of arb and degradation of args the photo fenton process has been proposed as one of promising photo driven aops han et al 2020 giannakis et al 2018 the classical photo fenton process is more efficient at acidic ph which is one of the most demerits of this process since water must be previously acidified and then neutralized after treatment for reuse thus increasing operational costs recently many efforts have been made to alleviate this drawback esteban garcía et al 2018 giannakis et al 2016b for example iron containing complexing agents have been used to offer higher photo absorption as compared to aquo complexes miralles cuevas et al 2014 ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds is one of such complexing agents which is an environmentally friendly metal chelate highly biodegradable and nontoxic under environmental conditions cuervo lumbaque et al 2019 however there are very limited studies on the degradation of args by photo fenton process in particular no specific study on the degradation of e args in addition previous studies mainly used the short amplicons based qpcr method ferro et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 pecson et al 2011 yoon et al 2017 yuan et al 2015 zhuang et al 2015 to assess the arg removal efficiency however qpcr with short amplicon primers might overestimate arg removal efficiency since the length of args is usually larger than 860 1200 bp chang et al 2017 mckinney and pruden 2012 more accurate results may be obtained through using qpcr with long amplicon primers to evaluate arg degradation performance the main purpose of this study was to explore the potential of the photo fenton process to inactivate arb and destroy args e coli dh5α was selected as an antibiotic resistant bacterium in which β lactam resistance gene bla tem 1 and tetracycline resistance teta are carried by plasmid pwh1266 the effects of visible light alone and visible light in presence of fe2 and or h2o2 photo fenton were studied control experiments were also carried out without illumination to assess the inactivation capability of the photo fenton process both culture based and the regrowth of resistant strains were monitored moreover to study the mechanism of the photo fenton process chemical scavengers were used to interact with different active radical species in testing the efficiency of arg degradation qpcr with both short and long amplicons were used to quantify the copy numbers of e args and i args before and after treatment afm was used to confirm the presence of dissociative dna our findings will inform the design of an efficient disinfection solution to mitigate the spread of antibiotic resistance 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all chemicals and kits 95 purity were purchased from commercial

photo fenton experiments to around ph 6 85 6 96 due to the addition of iron and h2o2 the reaction solution was kept at room temperature 22 2 c and stirred at a constant speed 250 rpm with 60 9 5 mm

was also applied to quench to h2o2 oh and o 2 1 moreover the efficiency of the scavengers was determined using viable cell count 2 10 inactivation kinetics analysis and model selection the inactivation kinetics of e coli is represented by two different phases namely the linear inactivation in log scale and the lag period shoulder the lag period represents the time needed by bacteria to accumulate damage before reaching inactivation and thereafter their inactivation follows a consistent linear trend the model was developed by geeraerd et al 2000 for the comparison of inactivation kinetics the curves were modelled using the ginafit add on for excel geeraerd et al 2005 and the shoulder log linear decay model was fit to the curves the model mainly follow the chick model chick 1908 which is simplified as follows 3 n n 0 n res e k m a x t e k m a x s l 1 e k m a x s l 1 e k m a x t n res for identification purposes it can be presented as 4 log 10 n log 10 10 log 10 n 0 10

constant i e the maximum slope n res is the residual population density cfu ml the degrees of freedom used during parameter estimation by ginafit are log 10 n 0 log 10 n res k max and s l the model used to describe the degradation of extracellular arg e arg was as following zhang et al 2019 5 ln n n 0 k t the simplified model is as follows 6 n n o e k m a x t for identification purposes it can

transformed before statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was conducted to analyse the data and expressed as mean values standard deviation sd graphpad prism 8 1 4 was used to compare the respective linear regression slopes of the logarithmic concentration to study the inactivation of arb and args 3 results and discussion 3 1 inactivation efficiency of arb to get the optimal photo fenton doses various fe2 concentrations 0 05 0 1 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 mm which are equivalent to 0 3 0 6 1 4 2 8 and 4 2 mg l respectively and h2o2 concentrations 2 5 5 0 7 5 10 0 and 12 5 mm which are equivalent to 85 0 170 1 255 1 340 2 and 408 2 mg l respectively and light irradiation doses at 3 6 4 8 9 6 and 19 2 mw cm2 were initially tested and the results are shown in fig s4 in fenton process it is well known that higher h2o2 to contaminant ratios result in more extensive contaminant degradation while higher concentrations of fe2 yield higher degradation lopez et al 2004 according to the results increasing concentrations of fe2 and h2o2 could not increase the bacterial disinfection efficiency in fact increasing iron concentration might impact the water quality and increase the sediment concentration which may scatter the radiation eventually protecting bacteria against solar photons bianco et al 2017 garcía fernández et al 2019 in addition excessive h2o2 also could result in undesired scavenging reactions of oh radicals tang and huang 1997 zhang et al 2016 it can be observed that 0 5 mm of fe2 2 8 mg l 10 mm of h2o2 340 2 mg l and 19 2 mw cm2 of visible led light irradiation doses led to the highest inactivation efficiency 6 17 log reduction of arb during 30 min treatment when fe2 dose was enlarged to 0 75 mm 4 2 mg l the inactivation efficiency was declined to 4 08 log reduction and the increasing of h2o2 doses from 10 mm 340 2 mg l to 12 5 mm i e 408 2 mg l remaining fe2 at 2 8 mg l did not provide a significant enhancement in arb inactivation 4 16 log reduction higher the dose of these reagents could limit the disinfection efficiency due to scavenging effects on radicals h2o2 oh h2o hoo fe2 oh fe3 oh giannakis et al 2016a serna galvis et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 to compare with the inactivation capability of the photo fenton process arb were exposed to various treatments such as visible light fe2 h2o2 light h2o2 and fenton alone fig 1 the arb concentration did not significantly change in absence of light for 30 min p 0 05 under visible led illumination the inactivation of arb was also negligible as evidenced with 0 10 log reduction the inactivation efficiency of fe2 0 5 mm or 2 8 mg l in the presence of light was 0 35 log reduction slightly higher than that of visible light alone at 0 10 log reduction in the presence of light it seems that fe2 may play a minor role to inactivate arb the intracellular fenton reactions may generate radicals which can kill bacteria feng et al 2003 moncayo lasso et al 2008 however at neutral ph the iron species present in the solution is fe oh 0 2 aq which can form complexes with the net negatively charged e coli cell pignatello et al 2006 the inactivation of arb could occur due to the precipitation of fe3 generated through oxidation of fe2 to fe3 in presence of dissolved oxygen pignatello et al 2006 in this study the addition of 10 mm h2o2 340 2 mg l resulted in 1 71 log reduction of arb at 1 2 1 4 å the h2o2 molecule is much smaller than bacterial porins 10 11 å aguayo et al 2015 in addition h2o2 has a similar polarity to water which allows diffusion into the bacterial cell potentially causing damage by oxidative stress accumulation of h2o2 inside the cell may cause oxidation of protein cysteinyl and methionine residues as well as lipids thus inactivating the cell garcía fernández et al 2012 the inactivation efficiency of arb by h2o2 combined with light was significantly higher than that of h2o2 alone with 6 17 log reduction within 60 min without light the depletion rate is lower and results in lower inactivation efficiency 1 71 log reduction of arb during 60 min treatment the synergy between h2o2 and visible light is clear and maximum bacterial cell are unable to repair the damage produced by visible radiation in presence of h2o2 some of the primary endogenous photosensitizers such as porphyrins coproporphyrin ii protorphyrin ix and uroporphyrin iii are responsible to absorb visible light inside the cell and enhance the inactivation of bacteria hessling et al 2017 in fact the generation of more ros and penetrate into the cells seemed to be enhanced under illumination in presence of h2o2 leading to oxidation of more intracellular fe2 to fe3 the ferric ion fe3 may be subject to photoreduction by ligand to metal charge transfer lmct regenerating fe2 with simultaneous oxidative species production in addition h2o2 can also cause the oxidation of iron sulfur clusters releasing fe3 imlay 2003 more recently giannakis et al 2018a b c reported complete inactivation of streptomycin resistant e coli with 20 mg l h2o2 0 55 mm after 90 min exposure to artificial sunlight arb inactivation was also observed for 1 mg l giannakis et al 2017 and 10 mg l giannakis et al 2018 porras et al 2018 h2o2 respectively these studies showed that the inactivation of arb increased with an increase in fe2 h2o2 molar ratio determining the optimum molar ratio to be 1 20 in the current study the addition of 0 5 mm fe2 i e 2 8 mg l in combination with 10 mm h2o2 i e 340 2 mg l caused a 1 77 log reduction within 60 min similar to the results observed when h2o2 alone was added the left and right gates indicated an sgi stained e coli cell the sgi stained all cells by binding to dna irrespective of viability as long as the integrity of cells or dna remains unaffected the fluorescence fingerprint remains unchanged if the integrity of cells or dna is severely damaged e g cell lysis or double strand breaks the sgi binding is weakened and the green fluorescence intensity is diminished yoon et al 2017 fcm results further suggested that the studied dose changed the fluorescence intensity indicating that the integrity of the cells and dna was changed the percentage of intact cells dropped dramatically to less than 10 after 15 min treatment and this proportion almost the same during the 30 min treatment fig 2 the cell membrane damage data showed that around 92 of membrane integrity was lost after 15 min treatment and it increased to 93 after 30 min photo fenton treatment fig 3 it is interesting to note that at disinfection after 30 min of treatment no bacterial regrowth was detected in this system due to the less dominant intact cell on the fcm plots fig 3 3 2 regrowth analysis the regrowth potential of arb after photo fenton treatment at various contact times was assessed to investigate if the bacterial cells are still viable during the storage or distribution of the treated effluent fig 4 it was observed that the contact time played a significant role in completely inactivating bacteria the regrowth of arb decreased with increasing contacting time specifically with 15 min of contact time arb were still viable after 24 h incubation and the regrowth was more obvious after 48 h incubation however after 30 min of photo fenton treatment no regrowth was observed indicating complete inactivation of arb it was found that a contact time of 30 min was adequate to prevent the regrowth of arb even after 7 day incubation data not shown inactivation and regrowth results of this study are consistent with previous the solar photo fenton process fiorentino et al 2015 giannakis et al 2018 giannakis et al 2018 and uv h2o2 fiorentino et al 2015 giannakis et al 2018 serna galvis et al 2020 they investigated the inactivation and reactivation of several arb in ultrapure water giannakis et al 2018 giannakis et al 2018 or real wastewater fiorentino et al 2019 moreira et al 2018 serna galvis et al 2019 giannakis et al 2018a b c observed the solar h2o2 and the photo fenton process 1 mg l of fe2 and 20 mg l of h2o2 were able to control the regrowth of streptomycin resistant strain e coli w1485 in presence of streptomycin but the process required 3 and 3 5 h or even longer treatment time 5 and 6 h in absence of antibiotic respectively giannakis et al 2018 in solar photo fenton regrowth experiments they examined two storage conditions with or without catalysts to assess the effects of residual h2o2 at room temperature the complete inactivation of both e coli and mrsa could be achieved after 120 and 90 min with or without catalysts respectively giannakis et al 2018 fiorentino et al 2015 compared the inactivation and regrowth potential for h2o2 sunlight and the conventional chlorination process they observed 1 0 mg l of cl2 was more effective to inactivate the mdr e coli than the sunlight h2o2 50 mg l to achieve a complete inactivation 15 min vs 90 min but it was less effective in controlling their regrowth 24 h vs 48h although our photo fenton process required higher concentration of h2o2 10 mm or 340 2 mg l it can prevent the regrowth of e coli until 7 days 3 3 the dominant ros identification the ros consisting of hydroxyl radical oh singlet oxygen o 2 1 hole h electron e and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 play an important role in photo driven aops for inactivating arb in order to identify the key ros related to the photo fenton process several ros scavengers including thiourea 1 mm sodium azide 1 mm triethanolamine 1 mm potassium dichromate 0 5 mm isopropanol 1 mm and catalase 3000u were used to quench the respective radicals in absence of any of these scavengers arb could be inactivated with more than 6 log reduction after 30 min treatment however in the presence of triethanolamine to quench h and sodium azide to quench o 2 1 the inactivation efficiency did not change significantly compared with no scavenger system indicating that both h and o 2 1 played very a minor role in this process fig 5 in fenton process o 2 1 radical also generates zhichao et al 2019 which further react with each other s and finally forming h2o2 rather than o 2 1 imlay 2003 in this case this radical have less effect in bacterial inactivation process as an electron scavenger k2cr2o7 inactivated 2 25 log arb suggesting that e play a moderate role in the photo fenton process in addition cr vi could remove not only e but also part of h2o2 by combining o2 with conduction band e chen et al 2011 shi et al 2014 therefore the inactivation efficiency of cr vi was slightly higher than the triethanolamine and sodium azide after adding the scavenger of h2o2 bovine catalase into the system the bacterial cell density only decreased around 0 25 log the catalase scavenges most of h2o2 and only fe ion without h2o2 was unable to inactivate arb in photo fenton process thiourea is known to be a powerful scavenger of o 2 1 oh and h2o2 farmer et al 2006 prasad and mishra 2017 after adding 1 mm of thiourea a lower inactivation efficiency 0 45 log reduction was observed which is nearly 93 decline in the disinfection efficiency in comparison to the results without scavenger isopropanol is also known as an oh radical scavenger for further confirmation of the efficiency of this ros isopropanol was used as an alternative scavenger which could scavenge most of the oh radicals thus resulting in an obvious decrease of arb inactivation efficiency collectively oh radical was identified as the dominant ros in the photo fenton process to inactivate arb enhanced inactivation 6 17 log reduction was observed in the photo fenton process within 30 min while the traditional fenton process in the absence of light was only able to achieve 1 77 log reduction within 60 min this is likely due to the higher ros generation in presence of light in the photo fenton system higher production of oh occurred inside or close to the bacterial cell through the reaction of fe ions with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of light energy more specifically the presence of extracellular h2o2 and iron may enhance the generation of extracellular oh that comes into contact with the bacterial membrane leading to lipid peroxidation and cell death 3 4 validation of arb inactivation under different water matrices this study further examined arb inactivation under different water matrices including upw sww and pbs fig 6 a the photo fenton process achieved 6 17 2 31 and 3 32 log arb reduction in the first 15 min treatment in upw sww and pbs respectively while the complete disinfection of e coli could be obtained after 30 min treatment under three matrix conditions a lower disinfection efficiency 2 31 log in sww suggested delayed disinfection compared to the other two matrices the reason is associated with that synthetic wastewater contains readily metabolizable and recalcitrant organic matter which delay the inactivation efficiency dissolved organic matter dom in sww may have a dual role acting as a sensitizer and a quencher in the photooxidation process janssen et al 2014 a faster inactivation was also observed in upw in which arb inactivation reached the lower detection limit after 15 min treatment it was observed that ph dramatically changed from ph 7 4 to 3 24 under the upw matrix conditions such the fast inactivation rate may be due to the high acidity of the reaction medium which would negatively affect the viability of the microorganisms karaolia et al 2014 under an acidic environment fe h2o 5 oh 2 is the predominant form of iron gallard et al 1999 which allows fe2 regeneration under the light radiation and it further reacts with h2o2 and generating sufficient oh radicals thus enabling to inactivate the bacteria fast papoutsakis et al 2015 in the pbs the inactivation efficiency was comparatively higher as compared to sww but it was lower than that in the upw due to the reduction of generated oh during the treatment process by the coordinating phosphate buffer chen 2019 yoshimura et al 1992 therefore the inactivation efficiency is higher in upw as compared to other water matrices a similar behaviour reported for clarithromycin and sulfamethoxazole resistant enterococcus in sww under solar driven fenton process 100 ppb substrate fe3 5 mg l h2o2 50 mg l ph 4 which achieved 5 log removal efficiency after 150 min and 240 min treatment for deionized water dw and sww respectively karaolia et al 2014 yoon et al 2017 reported a higher degradation efficiency for args in the pbs solution as compared to real wastewater matrix but required a higher chlorine dose or uv fluence or uv h2o2 doses due to oxidant demands or uv screening effect yoon et al 2017 the slower bacterial k pneumoniae inactivation was observed in the complex water than the distilled water by serna galvis et al 2019 and they observed the generated oh radicals were not selective and the radicals could also react with the organic compounds and inorganic anions in the matrix during the photo fenton process fe2 5 mg l h2o2 50 mg l and intensity of uva light 3 9 w m2 serna galvis et al 2019 our results showed that using the photo fenton process a 6 17 log reduction was achieved within 30 min which is significantly faster than the traditional fenton process demonstrating the synergistic effects of combining a suitable light source with fenton reagents it should be highlighted that our experiments were carried out at neutral ph 6 85 7 4 using a low energy and low cost visible led light 196 10 w m2 which is more practical as compared with low ph 4 and solar light uv used in previous studies ferro et al 2015 karaolia et al 2014 although the fenton process is effective at acidic ph urban wastewater ph is typically in the range of 7 0 8 0 zhang et al 2016 therefore creating acidic conditions for the fenton process would increase chemical dosage costs for urban wastewater disinfection recently mosteo et al 2020 reported that the driving force of bacterial inactivation is the intracellular photo fenton process rather than the light itself the effectiveness of the intracellular process relies on the transport of reagents into the cell which is mainly dependent on the amount of reagents added to the bulk mosteo et al 2020 although uva vis mediated disinfection is effective even at very low irradiance values the mechanisms initiated by visible light are not enough to inflict inactivation before a certain energy threshold therefore the inactivation can be enhanced by increasing the radiation intensities or adding higher doses of h2o2 and iron which facilities intracellular photo fenton reaction as a compromise the current study used a comparatively higher concentration of h2o2 but previous studies used a higher amount of iron 5 20 mg l de la obra jiménez et al 2019 esteban garcía et al 2018 fiorentino et al 2019 garcía fernández et al 2019 garcía fernández et al 2012 karaolia et al 2014 klamerth et al 2013 serna galvis et al 2019 this study used visible led light and its irradiance was comparatively lower which might not result in cell damage or alternatively the self defence cellular mechanisms are enough to cope with the generated stresses in this system mosteo et al 2020 visible light alone initiates the reaction pathways which are enhanced by the addition of h2o2 and fe2 therefore higher doses of h2o2 and fe2 required in our treatment system could facilitate both the extracellular oxidation and intracellular photo fenton reaction under low irradiance eventually causing cellular damage by oxidative stress under neutral conditions ruales lonfat et al 2014 to improve the inactivation efficiency in wastewater and reduce the concentration of h2o2 the fe edds complex was tested as an alternative system in the modified fenton process 1 2 fe edds ratio was used with the same fe2 dosage 0 5 mm but the h2o2 dosage was reduced from 10 to 5 mm fig 6b shows inactivation efficiency of arb in three water matrices upw sww and pbs the bacterial disinfection efficiency was comparatively lower in upw than sww matrix it may be due to some of organic compounds cooh and oh groups which can form complexes with iron in the presence of edds thus promoting the fenton like oxidation processes such dosage and contacting time condition in sww was also sufficient to prevent its regrowth as shown in fig s5 in contrast the same condition was not sufficient to prevent the regrowth in phosphate buffer which may compete with microbial cells for generated oh further investigations about the competitive roles of organic and inorganic matter present in different water matrices should be conducted to determine their influences on the disinfection efficiency of the edds complex modified photo fenton process 3 5 degradation of extracellular antibiotic resistance genes e args 3 5 1 effects of photo fenton process on an abundance of e args qpcr analysis under stressful conditions e g when water is chlorinated arb lose membrane integrity thereby releasing cytoplasmic contents and causing dna to leak out of the cell the args released can be uptaken by other bacteria thus resulting in further spread of args in the environment wang et al 2016 previous aops or disinfection studies mainly focused on arb inactivation yet the persistence of args has been overlooked so far ferro et al 2015 fiorentino et al 2015 giannakis et al 2018 giannakis et al 2018 karaolia et al 2014 mackuľak et al 2015 rizzo et al 2014a 2014b xiong and hu 2013 therefore the qpcr analysis was carried out to quantify the degradation of e args under various photo fenton dosages as shown in fig 7 the degradation of two e args teta and bla tem 1 exhibited increased degradation under different photo fenton dosages over time under the conditions of 0 5 mm of fe2 2 8 mg l with 10 mm of h2o2 170 7 mg l a 7 6 log reduction of teta and 8 6 log reduction of bla tem 1 genes was achieved after 10 min visible light irradiation these results were 2 5 3 5 log higher than the lower photo fenton dose of 0 178 mm of fe2 1 0 mg l and 0 55 mm of h2o2 18 71 mg l at the same contact time 10 min a contact time of 20 min was required to reach the detection limit of e args compared with the arg abundance based on the short amplicon qpcr a higher log reduction of e args was achieved based on the long amplicon qpcr for example bla tem 1 gene was degraded with 7 49 and 8 56 log reduction while teta gene was removed with 6 75 and 7 62 log reduction based on the short and long amplicon respectively it should be noted that the e args degradation rates achieved in this study are much higher than that in previous studies employing various aops or disinfection processes for example zhang et al 2016 reported that maximum 4 5 5 3 log reduction of sul1 tetx and inti1 as well as 2 8 3 4 log reduction of tetg and 16s rrna genes were achieved at the fe2 h2o2 molar ratio of 0 5 and h2o2 concentration of 2 mm with a ph of 3 0 after 2 h treatment time yoon et al 2017 reported that uv fluence of 61 92 mj cm2 would result in 4 0 log of e args at ph of 8 0 while the same removal efficiency was observed at lower uv fluence 44 77 mj cm2 but with 10 mg l h2o2 however the degradation rate of e args were 1 5 fold higher in uv h2o2 as compared to the only uv treatment this may be associate with that the structural integrity of extracellular plasmid are changed more rapidly in uv h2o2 but the initial plasmid concentration remained unchanged in the presence of h2o2 without uv yoon et al 2017 in terms of e arg removal efficiency our study suggests that the photo fenton is more promising for e arg inactivation compared to uv irradiation and uv h2o2 a higher degradation rate of e args might be due to the generation of ros mainly oh radicals a lower photo fenton dosage requires a longer contact time to generate the required ross for complete degradation of e args 3 5 2 effects of photo fenton process on the destruction of e args afm analysis the afm imaging was further performed to evaluate the destruction extent of plasmid dna before and after the photo fenton treatment fig 8 before the treatment the naked dna i e extracellular dna shows large patches of dna molecules with the size ranging from 1600 to 2000 nm fig 8a the changing topography were observed with the addition of photo fenton under different treatment time a bright band of dna persisted throughout the treatment process and slight aggregated migration was observed due to the formation of larger scale higher molecular weight dna jiang et al 2017 as shown in fig 8b the aggregated dna formed lumps with an average diameter of 100 400 nm however the dna was eventually degraded into tiny pieces with higher doses of fe2 and h2o2 0 5 mm or 2 8 mg l and 10 mm or 340 2 mg l as observed in fig 8c collectively the afm images confirmed that the treatment process can damage extracellular dna under visible light moreover the plasmid dna is directly exposed to the ros and there was no bacterial cell wall a shorter treatment time 10 min was sufficient to damage the naked dna as compared to the contact time for arb inactivation 30 min at the default fenton dosage 0 5 mm of fe2 2 8 mg l and 10 mm of h2o2 340 2 mg l 3 6 degradation of intracellular antibiotic resistance genes i args 3 6 1 effects of photo fenton process on i args qpcr analysis to determine whether the photo fenton process can effectively damage i args the abundances of i args before and after treatment were also determined based on both short and long amplicon qpcr the abundance of i args did not change significantly p 0 05 at the default photo fenton condition 0 5 mm of fe2 and 10 mm of h2o2 in phosphate buffer the i arg degradation was observed at 10 times higher doses 5 mm of fe2 and 100 mm of h2o2 than the default photo fenton doses in pbs matrix fig 9 at this dose approximate 0 52 log of the short amplicon and 1 02 log reduction of long amplicon i args degradation were achieved the highest 7 85 8 67 log reduction of teta and 8 12 8 86 log reduction of bla tem 1 were observed at 20 mm of fe2 and 400 mm of h2o2 with 60 min light irradiation zhang et al 2016 observed the photo fenton process was slightly more efficient in reducing i args than the uv h2o2 process they achieved approximately 2 58 3 79 logs of i args removal efficiency as compare to uv h2o2 process 2 63 3 48 log at the optimum conditions moreira et al 2018 analyzed the degradation efficiency of various i args genes such as 16s rrna inti1 qnrs blactx m sul1 blatem and vana by p25 h2o2 photocatalysis and solar h2o2 process they observed the only vana was below the limit of detection after treatment and other genes showed 1 0 log reduction or 3 0 log reduction for blactx m after treatment they suggest some bacteria could recover after the treatment serna galvis et al 2019 evaluated the fate of carbapenem resistance gene bla kpc in k pneumoniae during and after the bacteria elimination by the photo fenton process they observed arb was completely inactivated after 120 min but the encoding gene remained at such time indeed the gene was not degraded even after 240 min treatment and suggests that resistance transference was still plausible serna galvis et al 2019 together with these previous studies this study suggests that the photo fenton process with 0 5 mm of fe2 and 10 mm of h2o2 were prominent to inactivate arb and e args but had limited potential to destruct i args since i args could be protected by the cell wall 3 6 2 effects of photo fenton process on i args afm analysis afm was also used to reflect the structural damage of intracellular dna molecule which is often circular structure clowes 1972 del solar et al 1998 when dna comes in contact with ros the circular dna is converted to an open circle form by a single strand break and to linear dna by a double strand break burrows and muller 1998 srinivasan et al 2001 zhang et al 2019 thus extensive double strand breaks would be necessary to confirm the complete degradation of dna the afm images show the different conformations of intracellular dna samples treated under different doses of photo fenton processes different topographical images such as twisted wind cross linked polymer aggregated and tiny linear like topograph were observed in fig 10 a to d respectively after applying the photo fenton process under the default dose condition 0 5 mm of fe2 2 8 mg l and 10 mm of h2o2 340 2 mg l after 1 h treatment the dna was observed as a cross linked polymer fig 10b and no args inactivation was achieved which was consistent with the qpcr data if the photo fenton doses were increased by 10 folds 5 mm of fe2 28 mg l and 100 mm of h2o2 3 4 g l 0 5 0 8 log reduction was observed for i args correspondingly the afm image shows the aggregated morphology at this dose fig 10c the completed degradation of the args was observed at higher doses of photo fenton process 20 mm of fe2 112 mg l and 400 mm of h2o2 13 6 g l and dna become smaller dispersed fine grain structures fig 10d the tiny linear pieces were unable to be amplified and determined by either the short or long amplicon qpcr collectively higher fenton agent dosages are required to completely degrade the i args compared to e args 3 7 the inactivation kinetics of arb and args the chick watson model was applied to elucidate the arb inactivation and determine the model parameters sl and k max table s2 the fitting of the experimental data to equation 2 was very good in terms of adj r2 97 in the light control the inactivation rate of arb was very low k max 0 02 min 1 under the condition of 2 8 mg l fe2 0 5 mm with light the reaction rate and the lag period were kept to be same but the shoulder length sl was decreased from 99 55 to 24 88 which was evidenced with a bit inactivation efficiency 0 40 log reduction the same pattern was observed at 10 mm of h2o2 340 2 mg l alone which is not strong enough to inactivate arb completely in the absence of light and the obtained k max is 0 06 min 1 however both the combination of the chemicals 0 5 mm of fe2 2 8 mg l and 10 mm of h2o2 340 2 mg l in fenton process slightly increases the k max value to be 0 07 min 1 this indicates that the participation of the external fenton action by the production of oh radicals is limited mainly by the kinetics of fe3 regeneration back to fe2 for restarting the catalytic chain giannakis et al 2018 finally the photo fenton process dramatically increases the inactivation rate with the addition of light the inactivation rate was increased from k max 0 07 min 1 to k max 0 91 min 1 which can also reduce the lag period from 60 to 30 min this photo fenton process also fits the first order kinetics very well r2 99 the results also suggest that the visible light is driven force for the arb inactivation by the photo fenton process the reaction kinetics of args were comparatively lower than the inactivation kinetics of arb with considering the treatment time we observed the reaction kinetics for e args at lower photo fenton doses 0 178 mm fe2 1 mg l 0 55 mm h2o2 18 71 mg l however the model eq 6 and eq 7 was not suitable for higher photo fenton doses 0 5 mm of fe2 2 8 mg l and 10 mm of h2o2 340 2 mg l due to the complete degradation of plasmid after 10 min treatment at lower photo fenton doses the inactivation rate of bla tem 1 k max 0 87 min 1 was faster than that of the teta gene k max 0 98 min 1 due to the adjacent t t bases the bla tem 1 gene contains 1 5 times higher t t bases than teta which is 72 of teta length therefore higher t t base containing long amplicon results in faster degradation than the long amplicon of teta moreover the degradation rate teta gene 1200 bp is larger than the bla tem 1 gene 861 bp as shown in table s3 the rate constants of long amplicon genes were higher than the short amplicon genes table s3 for example the inactivation rate of bla tem 1 long amplicon is 0 98 min 1 which is a higher 0 88 min 1 of bla tem 1 short amplicon this was expected due to the larger number of targets in the long amplicon sequence compared to the short amplicon sequence larger amplicon genes could change the plasmid dna structure from initial supercoiled to nicked circular or linear form with a subsequent increase in qpcr amplification efficiency lin et al 2011 4 conclusions in order to mitigate the spread of antibiotic resistance in urban water systems an efficient water disinfection process is required to inactivate arb and also destroy args in this study the potential for the photo fenton process to inactivate arb and degrade both the e args and i args was evaluated the highest 6 17 log arb inactivation was achieved at photo fenton dose 0 5 mm of fe2 and 10 mm of h2o2 under led irradiation and neutral ph within 30 min no bacterial regrowth was observed after 2 days even in the absence of residual h2o2 half of h2o2 concentration was required to achieve the higher inactivation efficiency in sww by employing the edds as a complexing agent more importantly the photo fenton process also destroyed e args 6 75 8 56 log based on qpcr measurement and afm analysis the high inactivation efficiency is due to the photo fenton process where extracellular h2o2 and iron enhance the generation of extracellular oh that damages the cell membrane and causes dna degradation overall this study demonstrated that the photo fenton process is effective to achieve arb inactivation and e arg degradation however the photo fenton dose 0 5 mm of fe2 and 10 mm of h2o2 are relatively high which will limit its application in water or wastewater disinfection in practice further studies are required to reduce iron and h2o2 doses by using solar simulated light or heterogeneous catalytic system to test the inactivation efficiency in real drinking water or secondary wastewater effluent declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

17893,this study investigated the acute impact of heavy metals on activated sludge with respect to the amount properties of biopolymers and other solvable microbiological products smps released from the sludge ten heavy metals were selected for the evaluation under the experimental conditions exposing activated sludge to different metals led to an increase in smps with a more significant increase in nitrogenous organics than in carbonaceous ones where hg2 ag cu2 and cr6 led to the highest increase in smp species while cd2 ni2 mn2 pb2 and co2 caused limited increase in the middle and small smp molecules and zn2 and cr3 resulted in a decrease in smp content to probe the molecular impact of heavy metals and the association between cellular stress and smp formation the toxicity of heavy metals was evaluated using a toxicogenomics assay based on a correlation analysis between the increase in smp and the molecular toxicity index transcriptional effect level index teli of different genes under corresponding stress conditions eight genes demonstrated a strong correlation with smp properties and were pre assumed to have the most significant influence on the increment in smps we further validated the correlation equation established to predict smp production based on the molecular disturbance of the eight key biomarkers using arsenic as3 and vanadium v5 as tests and by quantifying the amount of smps released from the activated sludge under the influence of these metals using a teli derived equation in addition the heavy metals that generated greater amounts of reactive oxygen species also caused larger increases in smps graphical abstract image 1 keywords heavy metal stress activated sludge solvable microbiological products biopolymers reactive oxygen species 1 introduction the illegal and irregular discharge of wastewater containing high heavy metal contents such as that from the machinery electroplating mining and battery industries guo et al 2014 into wastewater biological treatment plants wwtps leads to metal accumulation in and a severe shock on the microbiology of activated sludge thus deteriorating effluent quality and destabilizing the

while 30 70 of municipal wastewater is affected by industrial wastewater luo 2016 additionally secretive industry discharge has also appeared frequently in the local or state media heavy metals have an adverse impact on the bacteria related to the removal of nutrients and contaminants vaiopoulou and gikas 2012 secretion of solvable microbiological products smps wang and zhang 2010 transfer of antibiotic genes zhang et al 2018 and alteration of microbial structures and their functions vaiopoulou and gikas 2012 wang et al 2019 investigation into smp secretions has attracted more attention in recent years as their level and composition significantly affect the final effluent quality regarding its bioavailable organic nutrients hu et al 2019 qin et al 2015 membrane fouling meng et al 2017 zheng et al 2014 disinfection efficiency disinfection by products dbps production gao et al 2015 zhu et al 2018 and distribution of antibiotic resistance kumar and pal 2018 slipko et al 2019 the impacts of heavy metals on smps has been presented in many studies for example cu2 enhanced the secretion of smps which was quantified by their proteins and polysaccharides huang et al 2018 wang et al 2015 while activated sludge shocked by cr3 led to a significant reduction in the smps wang and zhang 2010 zhang et al 2015 vaiopoulou and gikas 2012 reported an increase in smp which they deemed as the chemical oxygen demand cod in the effluent when the wastewater treatment process was affected by cr6 these results clearly demonstrate that heavy metals affect the formation of smps however detailed information regarding the formation removal of smp fractions and their properties is lacking as the measurements were mainly based on either chemical methods for bulk parameters e g the quantification of the protein and polysaccharide contents cod wang et al 2015 or fluorescence ultraviolet uv light methods e g the intensity of certain organics such as tryptophan for specific organics huang et al 2018 a comprehensive picture of various smp fractions and their corresponding characteristics and with a more concrete application to wastewater treatment is rare leenheer and croué 2003 zheng et al 2009 such gaps can be filled using methods such as liquid chromatography with online detectors huber et al 2011 zheng et al 2014 the variation in smp fractions affected by different heavy metals may be related to various toxic effects on microbial cells via diverse mechanisms hg2 and ag are bind strongly to sulfhydryl groups interfering with their function of enzymes and even leading to deoxyribonucleic acid dna conformation and cell membrane breakage giari et al 2008 mcshan et al 2014 wood et al 2011 a detailed analysis regarding cr6 and cr3 vaiopoulou and gikas 2012 demonstrates that dna and protein damage induced by highly reactive species due to the reduction in cr6 to cr3 is the primary mechanism this process induces the alteration of gene expressions krishnaraj et al 2017 the negative effects caused by cu2 are mainly attributable to the disturbance of the acid base balance which inhibits antioxidant enzymes and leads to the fenton reaction wood et al 2011 in addition to their direct interaction with organics heavy metals cr3 ag cu2 etc vaiopoulou and gikas 2012 wood et al 2011 2012 indirectly provoke oxidative stress in cells and thus initiate an antioxidant defense involving detoxifying enzymes to protect against these stresses according to the mechanism analyses although the pathway of the heavy metals disturbing the cells are clear a concrete relationship between the metal toxic mechanisms and secretion of smp remains uncertain kültz 2005 ni et al 2011 to quantify toxicity and simultaneously analyze toxic mechanisms recently developed quantitative toxicogenomic methods have demonstrated an advantage gao et al 2015 gou et al 2010 2014 toxicogenomic based toxicity assessments with quantified magnitudes of the altered gene expression levels upon toxicant exposure gou and gu 2011 lan et al 2016 such as exposure to heavy metals deliver prompt informative mechanistic and quantitative toxicity evaluations of contaminants they detect the overall toxicity level revealing potential toxicity profiles and mechanisms with one single assay within hours 2 4 h this method serves as a cost effect yet informative technology platform for screening and comparing the effects of different heavy metals on the formation of smps in activated sludge in this study we selected ten heavy metals according to zhang et al 2019 raheem et al 2018 and systematically evaluated their acute impacts on the levels and characteristics of smps specifically on the fractions of biopolymers and nitrogenous organics which are the key parameters for membrane fouling and precursors of dbp in wastewater reclamation respectively the parameters investigated included the biopolymer carbon mgc l and nitrogen mgn l contents and the smp matrix hydrophobicity huber et al 2011 zheng et al 2014 the organic nitrogen content and its size distribution are relevant to nitrogenous dbp precursors ding and chu 2017 in addition a high throughout toxicogenomic method was applied to improve the current transcriptomic level understanding of the molecular toxic mechanisms of various metals and how their toxic fingerprints correlate to their smp production the findings will further our understanding of the impact of heavy metals on the formation of smps in wastewater treatment systems and have implications for the effluent quality control 2 material and methods 2 1 operating sequencing batch reactors sbrs for cultivating matured sludge four 4 l sbrs were operated for three years to simulate the activated sludge process with synthetic wastewater and produce the sludge for batch metal exposure stress tests activated sludge collected from a local municipal wwtp number 3 in xi an was used as the seeding sludge for the sbrs details on the synthetic wastewater composition were adapted from another study xie et al 2012 the reactors were operated in 6 h cycles that included filling aeration settling withdrawal and idle phases for 50 min 240 min 50 min 10 min and 10 min respectively each reactor was aerated using an air diffuser connected to an air pump the airflow rate was controlled to maintain the concentration of dissolved oxygen do in the sbrs above 2 0 mg l during the aeration phase the sludge retention time was maintained at approximately 10 d by periodically manually discharging excess sludge from the reactor during the testing period the four reactors were operated at 25 c in two water baths 2 2 batch wise stress test in beakers simulating sbr operation stress tests were conducted in 2 l beakers using matured sludge from the sbrs according to the procedure presented by liu 2018 after removing sludge from the reactors during the idle period the sludge was washed three times using tap water and three times using synthetic wastewater without any organics nor nutrients to maintain the ion strength of the sludge afterwards the sludge experienced the same cyclic procedures to those of the sbrs with a complete test time of 6 h in the beakers heavy metals were blended into the beakers with the synthetic wastewater during the filling period information about the heavy metals can be found in table s1 the concentration of the heavy metals was up to 0 39 mmol l according to the results from pre test variations in smps the metals were selected because they were frequently reported to significantly accumulate in activated sludge raheem et al 2018 or because they were tested in other studies e g vaiopoulou and gikas 2012 2 3 smp sampling and analysis smps were obtained from the supernatant of the activated sludge domínguez et al 2010 after a stress test 50 ml of activated sludge was withdrawn from each beaker the sludge was first centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min at 4 c using a hc 3018r centrifuge zonkia hc 3018r china the supernatant was sampled and then analyzed for smps after filtration with nylon filters pore size 0 45 μm jin nong ni nong66 china 2 4 smp quantification the lc ocd uvd ond system doc labor dr huber germany was equipped with series size exclusion columns hw50s and 60s grom analytik hplc gmbh germany dissolved organic carbon detection ocd uv254 detection uvd and dissolved organic nitrogen detection ond columns in the series were used to improve the separation of both large molecules mw 10000 da such as a biopolymer using hw60s and middle and small organics mw 10 000 da using hw50s the liquid chromatogram lc unit separated dissolved smps according to their molecular size the separated compounds were then detected by the online detectors larger molecular sizes were typically indicated by a shorter elution time using the software chromcalc the corresponding fractions were quantified as organic carbon in mg c l nitrogen in mg n l and uva254 absorbance as 1 m the elution time of typical nitrogenous inorganic and organic species was calibrated using ammonia and nitrate for inorganics and certain amine acids for small nitrogenous organics fig s1 to avoid any overestimation of organic nitrogen only elution times shorter than 80 min was calculated as dissolved organic nitrogen don in this study the hydrophobicity of a water sample was quantified using the ratio of the retained and bypass doc zheng et al 2014 2 5 heavy metals toxicity mechanism fingerprints using quantitative toxicogenomics method a high throughput mechanistic toxicity assay method called the transcriptional effect level index teli profiling analysis that uses a green fluorescent protein gfp fused whole cell array of escherichia coli k12 mg1655 was employed in the study gou et al 2010 the selected assay library monitors the promoter activities of genes involved in known cellular stress response pathways including oxidative stress dna stress protein stress and membrane stress our biomarker ensemble based library was based on a selection of cellular stress response pathways and biomarkers that are conserved across species stress response pathways are characteristic of all cells to restore macromolecule integrity and redox potential which is present and highly conserved in most metazoan cell types and they are activated at significantly lower toxicant concentrations than those causing overt cellular injury kültz 2005 simmons et al 2009 high conservation levels were observed for the tested cell lines bacteria yeast and human cells in terms of the activation of certain stress responses i e oxidative stress and dna damage and the comparative ranks of molecular perturbation magnitudes of different chemicals for the selected pathways were tested hu et al 2014 the detailed protocol for the toxicogenomic assay was presented in previous studies gao et al 2015 gou and gu 2011 gou et al 2014 e coli was cultivated in 384 well plates costar in the dark to prevent gfp photobleaching until the early exponential growth stage was reached od600 0 2 the water samples were resuspended in a minimal medium m9 containing e coli culture strains at various concentrations the plate was then placed into a microplate reader synergy multi mode biotek to measure cell growth absorbance 600 nm and fluorescence excitation at 485 nm emission at 528 nm every 5 min over a period of 2 h all tests were conducted in triplicate the alteration of a gene expression also called the induction factor i i pe pc for a given gene at each sample time due to sample exposure was represented by the ratio of the cell normalized gene expression gfp level normalized based on cell concentration under the experimental condition with water sample exposure pe to that under the control condition without any chemical exposure pc then the natural log of i ln i at every sample time point was compiled for further analysis all data were corrected for various controls including blanks with medium control with and without water samples and promoterless bacterial controls with and without water samples the teli value was employed to quantify the magnitude of the altered gene expression levels upon toxicant exposure the teli value was calculated by integrating the induction factor values over time and it indicates the cumulative transcriptional effect of a given gene over a certain exposure period 2 6 analysis of water quality sludge and enzymes water samples were analyzed based on the doc nh4 n no2 n no3 n tn tp and po4 3 p using standard methods hj501

volatile suspended solids mlvss in the reactor were also measured according to standard methods rand et al 1976 the ph and dissolved oxygen were tested using a ph probe wtw germany and do analyzer wtw germany respectively the analysis of intracellular reactive oxygen species ros was quantified using the same process as that presented in a previous work wu et al 2013 with test kits from the beyotime institute of biotechnology china the ros is considered one of the best developed paradigms for explaining the toxic effects of certain toxicants generating oxidative stress nel et al 2006 xia et al 2015 2 7 scanning electron microscopy sem the visual characterization of the surface and interior morphologies of heavy metal bearing activated sludge was conducted using sem vegaiixmu with an energy dispersive x ray edx oxford 7718 element analysis the activated sludge withdrawn randomly from each beaker was washed three times with a 0 1 m phosphate buffer ph 7 4 fixed with 2 5 glutaraldehyde overnight at 4 c and then washed three times using a 0 1 m phosphate buffer ph 7 4 the samples were dehydrated in an ethanol serials 30 50 70 90 and 100 and were replaced with tert butyl alcohol 50 and 100 which was diluted with ethanol after centrifuging the samples were freeze dried for 2 h prior to the sem analysis mu et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation and characterization of biopolymers and nitrogenous smps under reference condition during the aeration time substrates and ammonia in the feedwater were quickly adsorbed by the bacteria and the correspondingly formed size fractioned smps were released into the treated wastewater the nitrogenous organic content is extremely limited compared to that of organic carbon table s2 shows that during the test period the four sbrs operated properly and fig s2 confirms that the treatment performance achieved in the sbrs can be reproduced in the beaker tests fig 1 a displays the change in size fractioned doc during the beaker test under the reference condition blank condition with no heavy metals exposure the original synthetic wastewater presented one peak at an elution time of 87 min confirming the presence of glucose as the only carbon source in comparison approximately 50 min after being mixed with pre washed sludge to simulate the idle phase in sbr operation termed as 50 0 min in fig 1 an extremely limited amount of organics not glucose in the water appeared implying that the sludge was washed well and that the production of smp was minor after 50 min of idle operation after aerating for 30 min 50 30 min most of the glucose appeared to be adsorbed and or utilized by the organisms and a minor oc signal was detected fig 1a blue line correspondingly the doc was reduced from 13 8 mg l to 1 7 mg l table 1 from then until the end of the aeration cycle three main peaks at elution times of 40 60 min biopolymers 60 100 min humic like and building blocks and 100 120 min small molecular acids and neutrals were more apparent the time dependent change of the size fractional contents implied the release of smps from the sludge during this period doc increased to 3 3 mg l table 1 it is clear that under the reference condition the carbon source was rapidly adsorbed by the bacteria and the dissolved extracellular polymeric substances eps fraction and natural metabolites from cells form smps which leads to the increase in doc in the supernatant the change in nitrogen demonstrated a similar developing pattern to that of organic carbon as shown in fig 1 a2 during aeration the ammonia content elution time 110 130 min fig s1 decreased while nitrogenous substances with larger sizes e g nitrate elution time 90 110 min fig s1 and organic nitrogen in the biopolymer fractions increased interestingly the organic nitrogen was not abundant under this operational condition and the signal in the lc ond at elution time 80 min was insignificant fig 1 a2 the insignificant formation of organic nitrogen was confirmed by the low to zero concentration of proteins that were analyzed using a modified lowry method data not shown observations regarding the formation of size fractioned nitrogenous organics in the biological wastewater treatment processes has rarely been reported on which is primarily due to the difficulties in separating small sized organics from nitrate nitrite and ammonia chon et al 2013 in this study although there were overlaps between small sized nitrogenous organic and inorganic species the formation of larger sized organic nitrogen molecules elution time 80 min was unaffected and identified the content of these organics was particularly limited which is unsurprising while under normal conditions protein like substances are predominately tightly bound to bacteria and zooglea wang et al 2014 and are thus reluctant to be released into water the formation of size fractioned carbonous organics was consistent with that reported by jarusutthirak and amy 2006 although the pattern of the chromatograms was different it is clear that during the aeration process both medium and small sized biopolymer fractions were formed and released into the water phase 3 2 different heavy metals lead to distinct effects on the formation of biopolymers and nitrogenous smp in this section the formation of smps under different heavy metals and dosages was demonstrated for the first time the impact of heavy metals can be grouped into three levels based on the quantity and quality of the smps formed in the case of adding cu2 0 16 mmol l into the beaker the biopolymer content was 0 89 mg c l after 30 min of aeration 50 30 min in fig 1 b1 this is nearly double that under the reference condition table 1 the don concentration increased to 0 4 mgn l which is three times higher than that formed without dosing cu2 table 1 extending the aeration time induced a more significant increase in the biopolymer and don contents as shown in table 1 after an aeration time of 240 min the biopolymer biopolymer doc and don concentrations increased to 1 9 mg l and 0 7 mg l respectively they are two to three times higher than that under the reference condition table 1 the doc of the effluent reached 8 8 mg l which is much higher than that without the stress 3 3 mg l indicating the water quality deterioration of the secondary effluent the don achieved a 3 4 times increase while the doc increased by only 1 7 times implying that the released organics were nitrogen abundant e g proteins than that produced under the reference condition the average hydrophobicity of the correspondingly formed smps was nearly 40 which is significantly higher than the 31 on average measured under the reference condition the effects of ten different heavy metals on the smp formation was tested and the results are summarized in table s3 and fig 2 the results demonstrate that up to a dosage of 0 39 mmol l hg2 ag and cu2 demonstrated the most significant impact on smp formation and the doc of the effluent increased to 10 50 times than that formed under the reference condition followed by cr6 cd2 mn2 ni2 pb2 and co2 with an increase of up to 4 5 times at the same dosage cr3 and zn2 however demonstrated a decrease in doc or the biopolymers which was possibly due to their low solubility and highly sorptive characteristics under slightly acidic to alkaline ph conditions kantar et al 2011 paulson et al 1989 regarding smp size distribution hg2 ag cu2 and cr6 increased the number of organics for all molecular sizes fig 2 while cd 2 mn2 ni2 pb2 and co2 raised only the fraction of molecules with smaller sizes elution time 60 min and even decreased the number of biopolymers with few exceptions such as mn2 at 0 16 mmol l zn2 and cr3 resulted in a decrement in smps by reducing the contents of both large and small molecules with respect to the biopolymer and don contents the most severe effect resulted from adding hg2 ag cu2 and cr6 table s3 while the biopolymer content increased by 2 6 times compared to that under the reference condition the increase in the don was 2 14 fold with the sharp increase in smps the hydrophobicity of the correspondingly formed organics was also significantly raised table s3 shows that adding 0 39 mmol l of hg2 increased the hydrophobicity from 26 to 77 this means that more than three forth of the dissolved organics were retained by the liquid chromatogram material in the lc ocd which was primarily due to the hydrophobic interaction with the filling material xie et al 2012 zheng et al 2014 a similar effect was observed to different extents by adding ag cu2 cr6 cd2 mn2 and ni2 table s3 these results suggest that smp properties can be substantially altered under severe stress conditions induced by heavy metals and that the effects varied among the metals in previous studies shock tests were conducted that were mainly based on one or limited types of heavy metals thus failing to reveal the varying impacts of different heavy metals on different smp fractions according to the results of this study some heavy metals require more attention and regulation than others due to their more severe effects on the release of smps the catalogue containing the quantity and quality of smps induced under heavy metal exposure may be indicative of the selection of stress conditions for future studies in wastewater treatment 3 3 variation in molecular toxicity transcriptomic fingerprints induced by different heavy metals and the quantitative correlation with smp formation the quantitative results presented in this section demonstrated that due to the varied levels of gene triggering the formation of smps under various heavy metal stresses is distinct using a toxicogenomic assay with conserved cellular stress response pathway relevant genes the correlations between the molecular toxicity endpoint teli and the quantities of smps produced were investigated and confirmed using as3 and v5 stress tests to probe the potential correlations between molecular toxicity and key biomarkers with the formation of smps as an adverse outcome of activated sludge under heavy metal stress a transcriptomic analysis of the toxic effects of heavy metals was performed using a quantitative toxicogenomic assay figs 3 and s3 the pathway based averaged quantifier teli pathway for the grouped stress pathways namely dna oxidative protein membrane and general stresses did not correlate with the variation of any smp component all of the 110 genes included in the toxicogenomic assay were further correlated using a linear regression based on their gene specific teli values and smp formation regarding from varying concentration of doc biopolymer doc and don under heavy metal stress conditions although in the stress tests the concentrations of heavy metals 0 08 0 39 mmol l were higher than those in the teli test 0 02 mmol l due to required sub cytotoxic levels in the molecular assays the stress response profiling patterns were considered consistent under this concentration range reynders et al 2006 gou 2015 the results show that genes related to dna stress ykfg recn and sula redoxic stress yeae membrane stress yedw and flgm protein stress clpb and general stress yfjg are the most relevant ones for the increase in smp with an r2 greater than 0 6 and p value less than 0 05 for each gene except for one yfjg p 0 56 tables s4 and s5 as the formation of smp is a comprehensive process and involves multiple biological processes and genes yildiz et al 2001 the selected eight genes that demonstrated significant correlations were further integrated using multiple linear regression as a function of the correspondingly produced organic content the overall regression coefficient r2 of the multiple linear function was above 0 8 for all the concentrations tested the regression coefficient r2 of most fittings was above 0 95 eqs s1 s3 with a significance at the 0 05 level representing a satisfactory fitting according to these functions and corresponding parameter standardization analyses genes significantly contributing to the increase in smps can be identified sula and yeae are the most important genes regulating the overall increase in smps while flgm yeae and clpb are the key genes controlling the secretion of large molecules such as biopolymers for the increase in organic nitrogen yedw and slua are relevant the increase in smps is mostly related to their reactions against the suppressing effect sula and subsequently redox stress yeae the increase in biopolymers is also related to the membrane structure related stress flgm and protein stress clpb as3 and v5 were used to confirm the constructed correlation equation based on the teli test results fig 3 as3 leads to significant toxicity under dna protein and general stresses which are also related to previous heavy metal stress nevertheless based on the calculation using eqs s1 s3 the variation in the doc and don of the supernatant under as3 stress should be limited table s6 the lc ocd ond results demonstrated that under a dosage of 0 08 mmol l of as3 the chromatogram of the smp was nearly unchanged fig s4 confirming that the selection of those key genes is reasonable and their corresponding teli index can represent the toxicity of the substance to a great extent when determining the smp formation however the prediction of biopolymer doc was unsatisfied in this case table s6 there may be other genes regulating biopolymers under as3 stress that are not included in the present investigation the calculated smp content under v5 stress is close to the concentration measured in the test indicating a superior prediction to that under as3 stress fig 4 shows the genes activated in teli test heavy metal 0 02 mmol l under hg2 stress all eight genes were significantly up regulated demonstrating a severe stress response which correlates with the significant secretion release of smps for substances of all sizes this is consistent with the high toxicity of hg2 which induces direct toxic very high affinity to sulpholils on organics and indirect oxidative damage to membranes and proteins by inducing ros oxidation shown in the following section cu2 and cr6 also lead to a significant increase in gene expression except for ag which otherwise created a clear variation in protein oxidative and general stresses cd2 ni2 mn2 pb2 and co2 induced substantially less gene activation than the former four heavy metals did this weaker effect on the dna membrane and oxidative stresses is consistent with the insignificant impact on smp formation cr3 and zn2 result in little change or even a reduction in smps although they quantitatively affect genes like yfjg clpb and yedw under general membrane and protein stresses implying that the consequence of these heavy metal stresses is less apparent in other studies triggering specific genes e g vpsr or algt and secreting alginate like materials and proteins to form eps is a phenomenon that is commonly linked to microbiological systems under varying living conditions yildiz et al 2001 zhou et al 2015 the contribution is not due to one specific gene alone instead the effect can be determined by analyzing a number of separate effector genes wood et al 2011 3 4 heavy metal induced ros and corresponding impact on the integrity of bacteria the induction of ros by heavy metals is another major effect of heavy metal toxicity wood et al 2011 2012 fig 5 demonstrates the level of ros and overall smp content compared to that under the reference condition when the ten heavy metals were tested under various concentrations it is clear that hg2 ag and cu2 lead to the most significant increases in ros fig 5a under a dosage of 0 08 mmol l the ros content increased to 2 1 8 and 1 5 times that under the reference condition respectively they also led to the highest smp contents in the supernatant the release of smps is significantly impacted by the ros level under extreme conditions such as those caused by hg2 and cu2 0 39 mmol l the don content in the smp was 8 10 times higher than that under the reference situation table s3 the high concentration of n containing organics implies a significant release of protein like substances that are more susceptible to attack by the ros additionally the ros can also lead to the damage of cell membranes leakage of intracellular substances and even cell death mota et al 2015 the shape and integrity of the cells during the test was analyzed using sem images as fig 6 shows under a dosage of 0 39 mmol l cu2 and ag lead to minor changes in the shape of the cells and no breakage appeared while blending in hg2 resulted in clear signs of breakage fig 6d implying that the leakage of intracellular substances was unavoidable this was confirmed by the sharp increase in doc which was much higher five to nine times higher under the acute stress caused by hg2 than that caused by the other two metals table s3 and the significant increase in the hydrophobicity of correspondingly formed doc fig s5 redox active metals like cu2 cr6 hg2 and other heavy metals gomes et al 2013 jomova and valko 2011 undergo redox cycling reactions and can produce reactive radicals such as the superoxide anion radical in biological systems they can also stimulate or impair the production of antioxidant enzymes that protect against ros the disruption of this ion homeostasis can lead to oxidative stress a state where the increased formation of ros overwhelms cell antioxidant protection and subsequently induces dna damage lipid peroxidation protein disruption membrane breakage and even cell death hg2 ag and cu2 demonstrated the highest ros levels which may be due to their strong diplex effects on the induction of ros species and simultaneous prohibition of antioxidant enzymes fig 5 this work clearly demonstrates that there is a link between ros level and smp increment implying that a higher ros level affects the secretion of intracellular organics into the water phase mota et al 2015 especially under higher heavy metal exposure concentrations these organics appear to present high hydrophobicity are in the medium and small molecular weight sizes and contain a higher organic nitrogen content fig 2 table s3 such consequences must be paid attention to in the selection of further treatment processes 3 5 understanding the mechanisms relevant to smp production induced by heavy metals in activated sludge the mechanisms involved in the formation and release of smps especially with respect to the different fractions of these organics under various heavy metal stresses can be associated with the multiple cellular stress responses and the latter are simultaneously affected by oxidative stress and enzyme activities table s7 provides a comprehensive overview of the relevant major mechanisms and consequences of the heavy metals studied based on the present results and relevant literature as presented in the literature table s7 during acute exposure the heavy metals pass through the cellular membrane after internalization the heavy metals are distributed into all cellular compartments and are sequestered by a number of intracellular substances such as low molecular weight organics and binding proteins they can modify the toxicity by altering the rates of metal uptake and elimination and through the chelation of metal ions immediately upon entering the cell wood et al 2011 under heavy metal shock the up down regulation of the expression of genes involved in protein biosynthesis transport degradation pathways and the secretion exertion of polysaccharides or other organics can occur quickly koskinen et al 2004 wood et al 2011 in this study the up regulation of eight genes that are more relevant to the formation of smps was determined furthermore they were divided into groups with respect to their effect on the molecular sizes and properties of the smps for example the ni induced smps were primarily detected in the elution time of 65 80 min in the lc ocd chromatogram fig 1 representing a molecular weight of approximately several kda zheng et al 2014 which is consistent with the elevated exertion of metallothioneins with low molecular weights under ni2 stress 6 10 kda takumi et al 2010 co2 was indicted to elevate the synthesis secretion of small molecular fatty acids which is in accordance with the result from lc ocd that the material released into the smps was small organic acids with an elution time of 110 120 min figs 1 and 2 representing a molecular weight of several hundred da huber et al 2007 although the high toxicity impact of hg2 ag and cu2 on the size distributions of smps was not previously reported our results clearly show that under such severe stresses organics of large moderate and small molecular sizes in smps are all significantly increased the severity of releasing smps is also relevant to the level of ros considering the effect of ros mota et al 2015 demonstrated that heavy metal induced oxidative stress can lead to algae membrane breakage and the release of intracellular substances in this study the severity of oxidative stress was reflected by the teli results fig 4 and confirmed by an ros analysis fig 5 as summarized in table s7 the heavy metals leading to a strong ros appear to significantly increase the number of smp species and break the cell membranes fig 6 this means that although the half life of ros is typically extremely short it is highly reactive and has the potential to damage biological molecules degrade lipid bilayer integrity wood et al 2011 and thus affect the release of organics 4 conclusion according to the study results the main conclusions are as follows 1 heavy metals demonstrated an acute impact on smp secretions including biopolymers and nitrogenous solvable microbiological products the severity and nature of the impact varied based on the metal 2 under heavy metal stress certain stress response related genes were quantitatively identified as being more closely related to the formation of smps the potential predictive power of these selected genes for smp production was further confirmed by testing the stress caused by as3 and v5 3 a comprehensive metal toxicity screening and evaluation via a quantitative toxicogenic method provided insights into the molecular impact of heavy metals on microbial cells and their associations with smp production 4 the release of smps is also associated with the elevation of ros in general the higher the ros value under the heavy metal stress the more biopolymers and smps were measured a higher ros level led to apparent cell membrane damage declaration of

17893,this study investigated the acute impact of heavy metals on activated sludge with respect to the amount properties of biopolymers and other solvable microbiological products smps released from the sludge ten heavy metals were selected for the evaluation under the experimental conditions exposing activated sludge to different metals led to an increase in smps with a more significant increase in nitrogenous organics than in carbonaceous ones where hg2 ag cu2 and cr6 led to the highest increase in smp species while cd2 ni2 mn2 pb2 and co2 caused limited increase in the middle and small smp molecules and zn2 and cr3 resulted in a decrease in smp content to probe the molecular impact of heavy metals and the association between cellular stress and smp formation the toxicity of heavy metals was evaluated using a toxicogenomics assay based on a correlation analysis between the increase in smp and the molecular toxicity index transcriptional effect level index teli of different genes under corresponding stress conditions eight genes demonstrated a strong correlation with smp properties and were pre assumed to have the most significant influence on the increment in smps we further validated the correlation equation established to predict smp production based on the molecular disturbance of the eight key biomarkers using arsenic as3 and vanadium v5 as tests and by quantifying the amount of smps released from the activated sludge under the influence of these metals using a teli derived equation in addition the heavy metals that generated greater amounts of reactive oxygen species also caused larger increases in smps graphical abstract image 1 keywords heavy metal stress activated sludge solvable microbiological products biopolymers reactive oxygen species 1 introduction the illegal and irregular discharge of wastewater containing high heavy metal contents such as that from the machinery electroplating mining and battery industries guo et al 2014 into

antibiotic genes zhang et al 2018 and alteration of microbial structures and their functions vaiopoulou and gikas 2012 wang et al 2019 investigation into smp secretions has attracted more attention in

zheng et al 2014 disinfection efficiency disinfection by products dbps production gao et al 2015 zhu et al 2018 and distribution of antibiotic resistance kumar and pal 2018 slipko et al 2019 the impacts of heavy metals on smps has been presented in many studies for example cu2 enhanced the secretion of smps which was quantified by their proteins and polysaccharides huang et al 2018 wang et al 2015 while activated sludge shocked by cr3 led to a significant reduction in the smps wang and zhang 2010 zhang et al 2015 vaiopoulou and gikas 2012 reported an increase in smp which they deemed as the chemical oxygen demand cod in the effluent when the wastewater treatment process was affected by cr6 these results clearly demonstrate that heavy metals affect the formation of smps however detailed information regarding the formation removal of smp fractions and their properties is lacking as the measurements were mainly based on either chemical methods for bulk parameters e g the quantification of the protein and polysaccharide contents cod wang et al 2015 or fluorescence ultraviolet uv light methods e g the intensity of certain organics such as tryptophan for specific organics huang et al 2018 a comprehensive picture of various smp fractions and their corresponding characteristics and with a more concrete application to wastewater treatment is rare leenheer and croué 2003 zheng et al 2009 such gaps can be filled using methods such as liquid chromatography with online detectors huber et al 2011 zheng et al 2014 the variation in smp fractions affected by different heavy metals may be related to various toxic effects on microbial cells via diverse mechanisms hg2 and ag are bind strongly to sulfhydryl groups interfering with their function of enzymes and even leading to deoxyribonucleic acid dna conformation and cell membrane breakage giari et al 2008 mcshan et al 2014 wood et al 2011 a detailed analysis regarding cr6 and cr3 vaiopoulou and gikas 2012 demonstrates that dna and protein damage induced by highly reactive species due to the reduction in cr6 to cr3 is the primary mechanism this process induces the alteration of gene expressions krishnaraj et al 2017 the negative effects caused by cu2 are mainly attributable to the disturbance of the acid base balance which inhibits antioxidant enzymes and leads to the fenton reaction wood et al 2011 in addition to their direct interaction with organics heavy metals cr3 ag cu2 etc vaiopoulou and gikas 2012 wood et al 2011 2012 indirectly provoke oxidative stress in cells and thus initiate an antioxidant defense involving detoxifying enzymes to protect against these stresses according to the mechanism analyses although the pathway of the heavy metals disturbing the cells are clear a concrete relationship between the metal toxic mechanisms and secretion of smp remains uncertain kültz 2005 ni et al 2011 to quantify toxicity and simultaneously analyze toxic mechanisms recently developed quantitative toxicogenomic methods have demonstrated an advantage gao et al 2015 gou et al 2010 2014 toxicogenomic based toxicity assessments with quantified magnitudes of the altered gene expression levels upon toxicant exposure gou and gu 2011 lan et al 2016 such as exposure to heavy metals deliver prompt informative mechanistic and quantitative toxicity evaluations of contaminants they detect the overall toxicity level revealing potential toxicity profiles and mechanisms with one single assay within hours 2 4 h this method serves as a cost effect yet informative technology platform for screening and comparing the effects of different heavy metals on the formation of smps in activated sludge in this study we selected ten heavy metals according to zhang et al 2019 raheem et al 2018 and systematically evaluated their acute impacts on the levels and characteristics of smps specifically on the fractions of biopolymers and nitrogenous organics which are the key parameters for membrane fouling and precursors of dbp in wastewater reclamation respectively the parameters investigated included the biopolymer carbon mgc l and nitrogen mgn l contents and the smp matrix hydrophobicity huber et al 2011 zheng et al 2014 the organic nitrogen content and its size distribution are relevant to nitrogenous dbp precursors ding and chu 2017 in addition a high throughout toxicogenomic method was applied to improve the current transcriptomic level understanding of the molecular toxic mechanisms of various metals and how their toxic fingerprints correlate to their smp production the findings will further our understanding of the impact of heavy metals on the formation of smps in wastewater treatment systems and have implications for the effluent quality control 2 material and methods 2 1 operating sequencing batch reactors sbrs for cultivating matured sludge four 4 l sbrs were operated for three years to simulate the activated sludge process with synthetic wastewater and produce the sludge for batch metal exposure stress tests activated sludge collected from a local municipal wwtp number 3 in xi an was used as the seeding sludge for the sbrs details on the synthetic wastewater composition were adapted from another study xie et al 2012 the reactors were operated in 6 h cycles that included filling aeration settling withdrawal and idle phases for 50 min 240 min 50 min 10 min and 10 min respectively each reactor was aerated using an air diffuser connected to an air pump the airflow rate was controlled to maintain the concentration of dissolved oxygen do in the sbrs above 2 0 mg l during the aeration phase the sludge retention time was maintained at approximately 10 d by periodically manually discharging excess sludge from the reactor during the testing period the four reactors were operated at 25 c in two water baths 2 2 batch wise stress test in beakers simulating sbr operation stress tests were conducted in 2 l beakers using matured sludge from the sbrs according to the procedure presented by liu 2018 after removing sludge from the reactors during the idle period the sludge was washed three times using tap water and three times using synthetic wastewater without any organics nor nutrients to maintain the ion strength of the sludge afterwards the sludge experienced the same cyclic procedures to those of the sbrs with a complete test time of 6 h in the beakers heavy metals were blended into the beakers with the synthetic wastewater during the filling period information about the heavy metals can be found in table s1 the concentration of the heavy metals was up to 0 39 mmol l according to the results from pre test variations in smps the metals were selected because they were frequently reported to significantly accumulate in activated sludge raheem et al 2018 or because they were tested in other studies e g vaiopoulou and gikas 2012 2 3 smp sampling and analysis smps were obtained from the supernatant of the activated sludge domínguez et al 2010 after a stress test 50 ml of activated sludge was withdrawn from each beaker the sludge was first centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min at 4 c using a hc 3018r centrifuge zonkia hc 3018r china the supernatant was sampled and then analyzed for smps after filtration with nylon filters pore size 0 45 μm jin nong ni nong66 china 2 4 smp quantification the lc ocd uvd ond system doc labor dr huber germany was equipped with series size exclusion columns hw50s and 60s grom analytik hplc gmbh germany dissolved organic carbon detection ocd uv254 detection uvd and dissolved organic nitrogen detection ond columns in the series were used to improve the separation of both large molecules mw 10000 da such as a biopolymer using hw60s and middle and small organics mw 10 000 da using hw50s the liquid chromatogram lc unit separated dissolved smps according to their molecular size the separated compounds were then detected by the online detectors larger molecular sizes were typically indicated by a shorter elution time using the software chromcalc the corresponding fractions were quantified as organic carbon in mg c l nitrogen in mg n l and uva254 absorbance as 1 m the elution time of typical nitrogenous inorganic and organic species was calibrated using ammonia and nitrate for inorganics and certain amine acids for small nitrogenous organics fig s1 to avoid any overestimation of organic nitrogen only elution times shorter than 80 min was calculated as dissolved organic nitrogen don in this study the hydrophobicity of a water sample was quantified using the ratio of the retained and bypass doc zheng et al 2014 2 5 heavy metals toxicity mechanism fingerprints using quantitative toxicogenomics method a high throughput mechanistic toxicity assay method called the transcriptional effect level index teli profiling analysis that uses a green fluorescent protein gfp fused whole cell array of escherichia coli k12 mg1655 was employed in the study gou et al 2010 the selected assay library monitors the promoter activities of genes involved in known cellular stress response pathways including oxidative stress dna stress protein stress and membrane stress our biomarker ensemble based library was based on a selection of cellular stress response pathways and biomarkers that are conserved across species stress response pathways are characteristic of all cells to restore macromolecule integrity and redox potential which is present and highly conserved in most metazoan cell types and they are activated at significantly lower toxicant concentrations than those causing overt cellular injury kültz 2005 simmons et al 2009 high conservation levels were observed for the tested cell lines bacteria yeast and human cells in terms of the activation of certain stress responses i e oxidative stress and dna damage and the comparative ranks of molecular perturbation magnitudes of different chemicals for the selected pathways were tested hu et al 2014 the detailed protocol for the toxicogenomic assay was presented in previous studies gao et al 2015 gou and gu 2011 gou et al 2014 e coli was cultivated in 384 well plates costar in the dark to prevent gfp photobleaching until the early exponential growth stage was reached od600 0 2 the water samples were resuspended in a minimal medium m9 containing e coli culture strains at various concentrations the plate was then placed into a microplate reader synergy multi mode biotek to measure cell growth absorbance 600 nm and fluorescence excitation at 485 nm emission at 528 nm every 5 min over a period of 2 h all tests were conducted in triplicate the alteration of a gene expression also called the induction factor i i pe pc for a given gene at each sample time due to sample exposure was represented by the ratio of the cell normalized gene expression gfp level normalized based on cell concentration under the experimental condition with water sample exposure pe to that under the control condition without any chemical exposure pc then the natural log of i ln i at every sample time point was compiled for further analysis all data were corrected for various controls including blanks with medium control with and without water samples and promoterless bacterial controls with and without water samples the teli value was employed to quantify the magnitude of the altered gene expression levels upon toxicant exposure the teli value was calculated by integrating the induction factor values over time and it indicates the cumulative transcriptional effect of a given gene over a certain exposure period 2 6 analysis of water quality sludge and enzymes water samples were analyzed based on the doc nh4 n no2 n no3 n tn tp and po4 3 p using standard methods hj501

volatile suspended solids mlvss in the reactor were also measured according to standard methods rand et al 1976 the ph and dissolved oxygen were tested using a ph probe wtw germany and do analyzer wtw germany respectively the analysis of intracellular reactive oxygen species ros was quantified using the same process as that presented in a previous work wu et al 2013 with test kits from the beyotime institute of biotechnology china the ros is considered one of the best developed paradigms for explaining the toxic effects of certain toxicants generating oxidative stress nel et al 2006 xia et al 2015 2 7 scanning electron microscopy sem the visual characterization of the surface and interior morphologies of heavy metal bearing activated sludge was conducted using sem vegaiixmu with an energy dispersive x ray edx oxford 7718 element analysis the activated sludge withdrawn randomly from each beaker was washed three times with a 0 1 m phosphate buffer ph 7 4 fixed with 2 5 glutaraldehyde overnight at 4 c and then washed three times using a 0 1 m phosphate buffer ph 7 4 the samples were dehydrated in an ethanol serials 30 50 70 90 and 100 and were replaced with tert butyl alcohol 50 and 100 which was diluted with ethanol after centrifuging the samples were freeze dried for 2 h prior to the sem analysis mu et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation and characterization of biopolymers and nitrogenous smps under reference condition during the aeration time substrates and ammonia in the feedwater were quickly adsorbed by the bacteria and the correspondingly formed size fractioned smps were released into the treated wastewater the nitrogenous organic content is extremely limited compared to that of organic carbon table s2 shows that during the test period the four sbrs operated properly and fig s2 confirms that the treatment performance achieved in the sbrs can be reproduced in the beaker tests fig 1 a displays the change in size fractioned doc during the beaker test under the reference condition blank condition with no heavy metals exposure the original synthetic wastewater presented one peak at an elution time of 87 min confirming the presence of glucose as the only carbon source in comparison approximately 50 min after being mixed with pre washed sludge to simulate the idle phase in sbr operation termed as 50 0 min in fig 1 an extremely limited amount of organics not glucose in the water appeared implying that the sludge was washed well and that the production of smp was minor after 50 min of idle operation after aerating for 30 min 50 30 min most of the glucose appeared to be adsorbed and or utilized by the organisms and a minor oc signal was detected fig 1a blue line correspondingly the doc was reduced from 13 8 mg l to 1 7 mg l table 1 from then until the end of the aeration cycle three main peaks at elution times of 40 60 min biopolymers 60 100 min humic like and building blocks and 100 120 min small molecular acids and neutrals were more apparent the time dependent change of the size fractional contents implied the release of smps from the sludge during this period doc increased to 3 3 mg l table 1 it is clear that under the reference condition the carbon source was rapidly adsorbed by the bacteria and the dissolved extracellular polymeric substances eps fraction and natural metabolites from cells form smps which leads to the increase in doc in the supernatant the change in nitrogen demonstrated a similar developing pattern to that of organic carbon as shown in fig 1 a2 during aeration the ammonia content elution time 110 130 min fig s1 decreased while nitrogenous substances with larger sizes e g nitrate elution time 90 110 min fig s1 and organic nitrogen in the biopolymer fractions increased interestingly the organic nitrogen was not abundant under this operational condition and the signal in the lc ond at elution time 80 min was insignificant fig 1 a2 the insignificant formation of organic nitrogen was confirmed by the low to zero concentration of proteins that were analyzed using a modified lowry method data not shown observations regarding the formation of size fractioned nitrogenous organics in the biological wastewater treatment processes has rarely been reported on which is primarily due to the difficulties in separating small sized organics from nitrate nitrite and ammonia chon et al 2013 in this study although there were overlaps between small sized nitrogenous organic and inorganic species the formation of larger sized organic nitrogen molecules elution time 80 min was unaffected and identified the content of these organics was particularly limited which is unsurprising while under normal conditions protein like substances are predominately tightly bound to bacteria and zooglea wang et al 2014 and are thus reluctant to be released into water the formation of size fractioned carbonous organics was consistent with that reported by jarusutthirak and amy 2006 although the pattern of the chromatograms was different it is clear that during the aeration process both medium and small sized biopolymer fractions were formed and released into the water phase 3 2 different heavy metals lead to distinct effects on the formation of biopolymers and nitrogenous smp in this section the formation of smps under different heavy metals and dosages was demonstrated for the first time the impact of heavy metals can be grouped into three levels based on the quantity and quality of the smps formed in the case of adding cu2 0 16 mmol l into the beaker the biopolymer content was 0 89 mg c l after 30 min of aeration 50 30 min in fig 1 b1 this is nearly double that under the reference condition table 1 the don concentration increased to 0 4 mgn l which is three times higher than that formed without dosing cu2 table 1 extending the aeration time induced a more significant increase in the biopolymer and don contents as shown in table 1 after an aeration time of 240 min the biopolymer biopolymer doc and don concentrations increased to 1 9 mg l and 0 7 mg l respectively they are two to three times higher than that under the reference condition table 1 the doc of the effluent reached 8 8 mg l which is much higher than that without the stress 3 3 mg l indicating the water quality deterioration of the secondary effluent the don achieved a 3 4 times increase while the doc increased by only 1 7 times implying that the released organics were nitrogen abundant e g proteins than that produced under the reference condition the average hydrophobicity of the correspondingly formed smps was nearly 40 which is significantly higher than the 31 on average measured under the reference condition the effects of ten different heavy metals on the smp formation was tested and the results are summarized in table s3 and fig 2 the results demonstrate that up to a dosage of 0 39 mmol l hg2 ag and cu2 demonstrated the most significant impact on smp formation and the doc of the effluent increased to 10 50 times than that formed under the reference condition followed by cr6 cd2 mn2 ni2 pb2 and co2 with an increase of up to 4 5 times at the same dosage cr3 and zn2 however demonstrated a decrease in doc or the biopolymers which was possibly due to their low solubility and highly sorptive characteristics under slightly acidic to alkaline ph conditions kantar et al 2011 paulson et al 1989 regarding smp size distribution hg2 ag cu2 and cr6 increased the number of organics for all molecular sizes fig 2 while cd 2 mn2 ni2 pb2 and co2 raised only the fraction of molecules with smaller sizes elution time 60 min and even decreased the number of biopolymers with few exceptions such as mn2 at 0 16 mmol l zn2 and cr3 resulted in a decrement in smps by reducing the contents of both large and small molecules with respect to the biopolymer and don contents the most severe effect resulted from adding hg2 ag cu2 and cr6 table s3 while the biopolymer content increased by 2 6 times compared to that under the reference condition the increase in the don was 2 14 fold with the sharp increase in smps the hydrophobicity of the correspondingly formed organics was also significantly raised table s3 shows that adding 0 39 mmol l of hg2 increased the hydrophobicity from 26 to 77 this means that more than three forth of the dissolved organics were retained by the liquid chromatogram material in the lc ocd which was primarily due to the hydrophobic interaction with the filling material xie et al 2012 zheng et al 2014 a similar effect was observed to different extents by adding ag cu2 cr6 cd2 mn2 and ni2 table s3 these results suggest that smp properties can be substantially altered under severe stress conditions induced by heavy metals and that the effects varied among the metals in previous studies shock tests were conducted that were mainly based on one or limited types of heavy metals thus failing to reveal the varying impacts of different heavy metals on different smp fractions according to the results of this study some heavy metals require more attention and regulation than others due to their more severe effects on the release of smps the catalogue containing the quantity and quality of smps induced under heavy metal exposure may be indicative of the selection of stress conditions for future studies in wastewater treatment 3 3 variation in molecular toxicity transcriptomic fingerprints induced by different heavy metals and the quantitative correlation with smp formation the quantitative results presented in this section demonstrated that due to the varied levels of gene triggering the formation of smps under various heavy metal stresses is distinct using a toxicogenomic assay with conserved cellular stress response pathway relevant genes the correlations between the molecular toxicity endpoint teli and the quantities of smps produced were investigated and confirmed using as3 and v5 stress tests to probe the potential correlations between molecular toxicity and key biomarkers with the formation of smps as an adverse outcome of activated sludge under heavy metal stress a transcriptomic analysis of the toxic effects of heavy metals was performed using a quantitative toxicogenomic assay figs 3 and s3 the pathway based averaged quantifier teli pathway for the grouped stress pathways namely dna oxidative protein membrane and general stresses did not correlate with the variation of any smp component all of the 110 genes included in the toxicogenomic assay were further correlated using a linear regression based on their gene specific teli values and smp formation regarding from varying concentration of doc biopolymer doc and don under heavy metal stress conditions although in the stress tests the concentrations of heavy metals 0 08 0 39 mmol l were higher than those in the teli test 0 02 mmol l due to required sub cytotoxic levels in the molecular assays the stress response profiling patterns were considered consistent under this concentration range reynders et al 2006 gou 2015 the results show that genes related to dna stress ykfg recn and sula redoxic stress yeae membrane stress yedw and flgm protein stress clpb and general stress yfjg are the most relevant ones for the increase in smp with an r2 greater than 0 6 and p value less than 0 05 for each gene except for one yfjg p 0 56 tables s4 and s5 as the formation of smp is a comprehensive process and involves multiple biological processes and genes yildiz et al 2001 the selected eight genes that demonstrated significant correlations were further integrated using multiple linear regression as a function of the correspondingly produced organic content the overall regression coefficient r2 of the multiple linear function was above 0 8 for all the concentrations tested the regression coefficient r2 of most fittings was above 0 95 eqs s1 s3 with a significance at the 0 05 level representing a satisfactory fitting according to these functions and corresponding parameter standardization analyses genes significantly contributing to the increase in smps can be identified sula and yeae are the most important genes regulating the overall increase in smps while flgm yeae and clpb are the key genes controlling the secretion of large molecules such as biopolymers for the increase in organic nitrogen yedw and slua are relevant the increase in smps is mostly related to their reactions against the suppressing effect sula and subsequently redox stress yeae the increase in biopolymers is also related to the membrane structure related stress flgm and protein stress clpb as3 and v5 were used to confirm the constructed correlation equation based on the teli test results fig 3 as3 leads to significant toxicity under dna protein and general stresses which are also related to previous heavy metal stress nevertheless based on the calculation using eqs s1 s3 the variation in the doc and don of the supernatant under as3 stress should be limited table s6 the lc ocd ond results demonstrated that under a dosage of 0 08 mmol l of as3 the chromatogram of the smp was nearly unchanged fig s4 confirming that the selection of those key genes is reasonable and their corresponding teli index can represent the toxicity of the substance to a great extent when determining the smp formation however the prediction of biopolymer doc was unsatisfied in this case table s6 there may be other genes regulating biopolymers under as3 stress that are not included in the present investigation the calculated smp content under v5 stress is close to the concentration measured in the test indicating a superior prediction to that under as3 stress fig 4 shows the genes activated in teli test heavy metal 0 02 mmol l under hg2 stress all eight genes were significantly up regulated demonstrating a severe stress response which correlates with the significant secretion release of smps for substances of all sizes this is consistent with the high toxicity of hg2 which induces direct toxic very high affinity to sulpholils on organics and indirect oxidative damage to membranes and proteins by inducing ros oxidation shown in the following section cu2 and cr6 also lead to a significant increase in gene expression except for ag which otherwise created a clear variation in protein oxidative and general stresses cd2 ni2 mn2 pb2 and co2 induced substantially less gene activation than the former four heavy metals did this weaker effect on the dna membrane and oxidative stresses is consistent with the insignificant impact on smp formation cr3 and zn2 result in little change or even a reduction in smps although they quantitatively affect genes like yfjg clpb and yedw under general membrane and protein stresses implying that the consequence of these heavy metal stresses is less apparent in other studies triggering specific genes e g vpsr or algt and secreting alginate like materials and proteins to form eps is a phenomenon that is commonly linked to microbiological systems under varying living conditions yildiz et al 2001 zhou et al 2015 the contribution is not due to one specific gene alone instead the effect can be determined by analyzing a number of separate effector genes wood et al 2011 3 4 heavy metal induced ros and corresponding impact on the integrity of bacteria the induction of ros by heavy metals is another major effect of heavy metal toxicity wood et al 2011 2012 fig 5 demonstrates the level of ros and overall smp content compared to that under the reference condition when the ten heavy metals were tested under various concentrations it is clear that hg2 ag and cu2 lead to the most significant increases in ros fig 5a under a dosage of 0 08 mmol l the ros content increased to 2 1 8 and 1 5 times that under the reference condition respectively they also led to the highest smp contents in the supernatant the release of smps is significantly impacted by the ros level under extreme conditions such as those caused by hg2 and cu2 0 39 mmol l the don content in the smp was 8 10 times higher than that under the reference situation table s3 the high concentration of n containing organics implies a significant release of protein like substances that are more susceptible to attack by the ros additionally the ros can also lead to the damage of cell membranes leakage of intracellular substances and even cell death mota et al 2015 the shape and integrity of the cells during the test was analyzed using sem images as fig 6 shows under a dosage of 0 39 mmol l cu2 and ag lead to minor changes in the shape of the cells and no breakage appeared while blending in hg2 resulted in clear signs of breakage fig 6d implying that the leakage of intracellular substances was unavoidable this was confirmed by the sharp increase in doc which was much higher five to nine times higher under the acute stress caused by hg2 than that caused by the other two metals table s3 and the significant increase in the hydrophobicity of correspondingly formed doc fig s5 redox active metals like cu2 cr6 hg2 and other heavy metals gomes et al 2013 jomova and valko 2011 undergo redox cycling reactions and can produce reactive radicals such as the superoxide anion radical in biological systems they can also stimulate or impair the production of antioxidant enzymes that protect against ros the disruption of this ion homeostasis can lead to oxidative stress a state where the increased formation of ros overwhelms cell antioxidant protection and subsequently induces dna damage lipid peroxidation protein disruption membrane breakage and even cell death hg2 ag and cu2 demonstrated the highest ros levels which may be due to their strong diplex effects on the induction of ros species and simultaneous prohibition of antioxidant enzymes fig 5 this work clearly demonstrates that there is a link between ros level and smp increment implying that a higher ros level affects the secretion of intracellular organics into the water phase mota et al 2015 especially under higher heavy metal exposure concentrations these organics appear to present high hydrophobicity are in the medium and small molecular weight sizes and contain a higher organic nitrogen content fig 2 table s3 such consequences must be paid attention to in the selection of further treatment processes 3 5 understanding the mechanisms relevant to smp production induced by heavy metals in activated sludge the mechanisms involved in the formation and release of smps especially with respect to the different fractions of these organics under various heavy metal stresses can be associated with the multiple cellular stress responses and the latter are simultaneously affected by oxidative stress and enzyme activities table s7 provides a comprehensive overview of the relevant major mechanisms and consequences of the heavy metals studied based on the present results and relevant literature as presented in the literature table s7 during acute exposure the heavy metals pass through the cellular membrane after internalization the heavy metals are distributed into all cellular compartments and are sequestered by a number of intracellular substances such as low molecular weight organics and binding proteins they can modify the toxicity by altering the rates of metal uptake and elimination and through the chelation of metal ions immediately upon entering the cell wood et al 2011 under heavy metal shock the up down regulation of the expression of genes involved in protein biosynthesis transport degradation pathways and the secretion exertion of polysaccharides or other organics can occur quickly koskinen et al 2004 wood et al 2011 in this study the up regulation of eight genes that are more relevant to the formation of smps was determined furthermore they were divided into groups with respect to their effect on the molecular sizes and properties of the smps for example the ni induced smps were primarily detected in the elution time of 65 80 min in the lc ocd chromatogram fig 1 representing a molecular weight of approximately several kda zheng et al 2014 which is consistent with the elevated exertion of metallothioneins with low molecular weights under ni2 stress 6 10 kda takumi et al 2010 co2 was indicted to elevate the synthesis secretion of small molecular fatty acids which is in accordance with the result from lc ocd that the material released into the smps was small organic acids with an elution time of 110 120 min figs 1 and 2 representing a molecular weight of several hundred da huber et al 2007 although the high toxicity impact of hg2 ag and cu2 on the size distributions of smps was not previously reported our results clearly show that under such severe stresses organics of large moderate and small molecular sizes in smps are all significantly increased the severity of releasing smps is also relevant to the level of ros considering the effect of ros mota et al 2015 demonstrated that heavy metal induced oxidative stress can lead to algae membrane breakage and the release of intracellular substances in this study the severity of oxidative stress was reflected by the teli results fig 4 and confirmed by an ros analysis fig 5 as summarized in table s7 the heavy metals leading to a strong ros appear to significantly increase the number of smp species and break the cell membranes fig 6 this means that although the half life of ros is typically extremely short it is highly reactive and has the potential to damage biological molecules degrade lipid bilayer integrity wood et al 2011 and thus affect the release of organics 4 conclusion according to the study results the main conclusions are as follows 1 heavy metals demonstrated an acute impact on smp secretions including biopolymers and nitrogenous solvable microbiological products the severity and nature of the impact varied based on the metal 2 under heavy metal stress certain stress response related genes were quantitatively identified as being more closely related to the formation of smps the potential predictive power of these selected genes for smp production was further confirmed by testing the stress caused by as3 and v5 3 a comprehensive metal toxicity screening and evaluation via a quantitative toxicogenic method provided insights into the molecular impact of heavy metals on microbial cells and their associations with smp production 4 the release of smps is also associated with the elevation of ros in general the higher the ros value under the heavy metal stress the more biopolymers and smps were measured a higher ros level led to apparent cell membrane damage declaration of

17894,as carcinogenic and pervasive pollutants polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in surface water are crucial to environmental policies and the understanding of their trends and influencing factors is critical for achieving a good chemical and ecological status of water bodies based on long term monitoring data from 1998 to 2017 this study systematically evaluated the spatiotemporal distribution multimedia transport fate and source apportionment of pahs adsorbed on suspended particulate matter spm in rhine and elbe rivers the results of the mann kendall test indicated that pollution levels of pahs decreased from 2 81 10 5 μg s 1 to 9 80 10 4 μg s 1 on average in the rhine and from 1 60 10 5 μg s 1 to 5 21 10 4 μg s 1 in the elbe in the last 20 years spatially spm near urban areas had higher pah mass fluxes rhine 3 07 10 5 μg s 1 elbe 1 73 10 5 μg s 1 and greater rates of decrease slopes for rhine and elbe 409 323 than those near rural areas rhine 1 41 10 5 μg s 1 elbe 9 35 10 4 μg s 1 slopes for rhine and elbe 128 89 indicating the significant influence of anthropogenic activities wavelet analysis showed that the pollution level of pah had significant periodic oscillations for the rhine and elbe and revealed several abrupt change points for the two rivers a multimedia fugacity model demonstrated that impervious surfaces had the highest concentration rhine 1 84 g m 3 elbe 0 15 g m 3 while soil rhine 8 33 10 7 g elbe 2 53 10 6 g and sediments rhine 4 85 10 6 g elbe 1 31 10 6 g had higher masses of pahs furthermore source apportionment computed using a self organizing map and positive matrix factorization model suggested that the major sources of pahs were vehicular emissions and coal combustion which accounted for 51 86 of the total mass in the rhine and 62 92 in the elbe the data revealed that the long term trends of pah variation were associated with changes in energy consumption and the implementation of vehicular emission standards therefore the substitution of coal and petroleum with renewable energies could assist strategies of pah mitigation in the environment and gradual reduction of pollution levels graphical abstract image 1 keywords polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons surface water quality anthropogenic activities rhine and elbe rivers 1 introduction owing to their highly lipophilic carcinogenic mutagenic and teratogenic characteristics polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs contaminating the environment is a global concern in terms of ecological safety and human health achten and hofmann 2009 naudin et al 2019 the worldwide occurrence of pahs can be attributed to both natural processes and anthropogenic activities zhang et al 2015 the natural budget of the pah inventory is mainly contributed by forest fires and volcanic eruptions gan et al 2009 however in the urban environment pahs and their derivatives predominantly originate from diverse anthropogenic sources including the burning of fuels grimmer et al 1983 industrial processing zhang and tao 2009 coal powered generation grimmer et al 1983 and vehicular emissions liu et al 2017 peng et al 2011 therefore anthropogenic activities have a significant influence on the occurrence of pahs in the environment more recently with the optimization of the structure of energy consumption more renewable energies have been utilized instead of traditional energies coal and petroleum this might affect the environmental levels of pahs in addition with scientific and technological development emission standards have been improved over the past few decades however the influence of the changes in energy consumption and vehicular emissions on the pollution levels of pahs is not well understood in addition because of their stable chemical structure pahs are pervasive environmental pollutants that have been found in different environmental media including air oleagoitia et al 2019 shrivastava et al 2017 soil masto et al 2019 syed et al 2017 and water bansal and kim 2015 regarding the aquatic environment pahs enter the water through surface runoff and atmospheric deposition therefore the receiving waters act as an environmental sink for pahs gan et al 2009 furthermore owing to their low solubility and high resistivity to anoxic bacterial degradation guo et al 2007 karlsson and viklander 2008 patrolecco et al 2010 a significant amount of pahs are adsorbed onto suspended particulate matter spm in receiving waters sun et al 2009 many previous studies focused on the concentrations of pahs ng g 1 in spm mostafa et al 2003 oen et al 2006 but rarely investigated the influences of energy consumption and vehicular emissions on the loads μg m 3 and mass fluxes μg s 1 of pahs over the long term therefore it is essential to gain a deep understanding of the spatiotemporal distributions and source apportionment of pahs by investigating the concentrations loads and mass fluxes of pahs in spm to reduce the exposure risks to the public and environment the rhine and elbe have the third and fourth largest river basins in central europe respectively many large cities frankfurt am main cologne dusseldorf and rotterdam are located along rhine river with a total population of approximately 58 million people ruff et al 2015 in addition 10 of the world s chemical industry is located in this area and more than 2800 municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants discharge wastewater into rhine river mani et al 2015 most of the energy in the region is generated from coal combustion and hydroelectric power emissions from anthropogenic activities of the large population contaminate the aquatic environment while people consume fish from the river and use river water for recreational swimming and drinking approximately 18 5 million people live in the catchment area of the elbe which has a smaller urban area and lower energy consumption therefore the impact of anthropogenic activities on the environmental behaviors of pahs can be assessed by comparing the structure of energy usage and pollution levels of pahs between the two rivers accordingly the primary aim of this study was to examine the influence of anthropogenic activities on the occurrence of pahs in the aquatic environment and guide policymakers in the creation of mitigation strategies in detail the objectives were to 1 investigate the potential impact of energy consumption and vehicular emissions on temporal and spatial variations in the concentrations loads and mass fluxes of pahs along the rhine and elbe based on data covering 20 years 2 identify the primary sources of pahs using an artificial neural network and receptor model and 3 estimate the transport and fate of pahs in multimedia using a level iii fugacity model 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area and sample analysis as shown in fig 1 eight and eleven monitoring stations along the rhine and elbe respectively are operated by the international commission for the protection of the rhine and the river basin community elbe flussgebietsgemeinschaft elbe to measure general parameters inorganic compounds and organic micropollutants www had bafg de www fgg elbe de accessed feb 2019 the stations along the rhine covered the area from the upstream at the junction of switzerland france and germany to the downstream in the netherlands meanwhile the stations along the elbe covered the main watercourse of the river in germany from the state of saxony to the city of hamburg following the european water framework directive the measured organic micropollutants included 16 pahs namely naphthalene nap acenaphthylene acy acenaphthene ace fluorene flu phenanthrene phe anthracene fluoranthene fluh pyrene pyr benzo a anthracene baa chrysene chr benzo b fluoranthene bbf benzo k fluoranthene bkf benzo a pyrene bap indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene idp dibenzo a h anthracene and benzo g h i perylene bgp directive 2000 the selected samples were collected over 20 years from january 1998 to december 2017 the frequency of sampling ranged from every 14 d to every 28 d the total number of samples the rhine and elbe were 2676 and 2005 respectively water samples were first obtained using a continuous centrifuge at 0 3 8 0 m below the water surface and stored in a tank after settling the aqueous phase and coarse sand fraction were filtered to recover the residue suspended sediments 2 mm were subsequently collected and tested at the laboratory of the german federal institute of hydrology bundesanstalt für gewässerkunde for chemical determination the concentrations of pahs were measured using high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography mass spectrometry following us epa method 610 german standard din iso 28540 and din 38407 f 39 epa 1984 2 2 multimedia fugacity model the level iii fugacity model has been widely employed to quantitatively depict the multimedia transport and fate of pahs in complex urban systems under steady state assumptions greenfield and davis 2005 huang and batterman 2014 wang et al 2012 xu et al 2013 in the conceptual framework of the model as shown in fig s1 six bulk compartments contained sub compartments such as the vapor phase and particles in the air three phases of pore water gas and solid in the soil and the dissolved phase and suspended sediments in water furthermore the model includes expressions for transport between multimedia such as wet gas deposition dry gas particle deposition diffusion between air and water runoff from the surface soil to water and degradation in each medium in the fugacity model the fugacity capacity constant z x mol m 3 pa 1 expresses the capacity of pahs in a phase for example z values in the water are calculated as follows 1 z 22 1 h 2 z 23 m 23 ρ 23 k o c h 3 z 2 z 22 1 v 23 z 23 v 23 where z 22 z 23 and z 2 are capacity constants in dissolved suspended particle and total phase m 23 is the content of organic carbon ρ 23 is the density of solids and v 23 is the volume fraction of solids in water the intercompartmental transfer of pahs between the six media and degradation were quantified by d values mol pa 1 h 1 for instance the d values for the transport from air to water were computed as follows 4 w e t g a s d e p o s i t i o n d 2 r z 22 a 2 i r 5 w e t p a r t i c l e d e p o s i t i o n d 2 w z 13 a 2 i r q v 13 6 dry particle deposition d 2 w z

clearance rate v 13 is the volume fraction of solids in air k 1 2 and k 2 1 are the mass transfer coefficients from the air water side over water air according to the environmental and physicochemical parameters obtained from the literature and databases tables s1 4 z x and d values for all transport processes in multimedia were calculated using the equations provided in table s5 and table s6 after substituting the values of d the mass balance equations table s7 were solved to obtain the fugacity f x pa of the compartment x for each pah the model input was pah emissions from various identified sources atmospheric emissions from vehicles were calculated by multiplying the number of vehicles fuel consumption and emission factors the numbers of four kinds of vehicles car truck tractor and motorcycle in the administrative regions along the rhine and elbe from 1998 to 2017 were obtained from germany s regional database www regionalstatistik de accessed jan 2019 the fuel consumption of each kind of vehicle was determined from the literature review the emission factor ef mg pah t fuel consumption of vehicles was calculated for individual pahs using the monovariate regression model equation 8 log ef iy k i g d p c y b i where g d p c y is the gross domestic product per capita of germany in the y th year and k i and b i are the slope factor and interception for the i th pah representing the rate of emission reduction against socio economic development table s1 the average gdpc of each standard for the period was selected considering the eu emission standards the consumption of coal along the rhine and elbe from 1998 to 2017 were obtained from germany s regional database and netherlands statistical office the emissions from coal combustion were calculated as follows 9 e a e f iy m y where ea is the emissions from coal combustion m y is the energy production from coal combustion in the y th year and e f iy is the emission factor for coal combustion the values for coke oven and wood combustion were computed in the same manner the emission factors were adopted from shen et al 2013b the atmospheric emission inputs are presented in table s2 after obtaining fugacity f x pah concentration c mol m 3 was calculated using the following equation huang et al 2019 10 c x z x f x in this study pah concentrations ng g 1 in suspended sediments were obtained as follows 11 c spm c 23 m m 23 z 23 f 2 m ρ 23 v 23 where c 23 mol pahs in spm m 3 water is the molar quantity of pahs in spm per cubic meter of water m g mol 1 is the molecular weight of a

study the simulated and observed annual mass fluxes of pahs in spm in the two rivers were compared to evaluate the accuracy of the model a sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the influence of the environmental parameters on the results of the multimedia model several environmental parameters clearance rate rate of precipitation volume fractions of solids in air volume fractions of solids in water dry deposition velocity sediment deposition rate were adjusted with 10 to obtain different results the sensitivity index can be calculated as follows 12 s y 1 1 y 0 9 0 2 y 1 0 where s is the sensitivity index and y 1 1 y 0 9 y 1 0 are model results with 1 1 0 9 and 1 0 times of environmental parameters the results of the sensitivity analysis are provided in table s17 2 3 data handling and other methods in this study three parameters of pahs concentration load and mass flux were applied to analyze the pollution level the concentrations of pahs ng g 1 were obtained from laboratory analysis moreover as the concentrations of spm significantly affect the pollution levels of pahs most assessments for ecological and health risk considered the loads μg m 3 calculated by multiplying the concentrations of spm and the concentrations of pahs representing the amount of pah contacting organisms and human furthermore to compare the absolute quantity of pahs in the two rivers the mass flux μg s 1 of pahs was employed by considering the loads and discharge the variables concentration load and mass flux of pahs from the rhine and elbe were grouped into three categories 1 annual variables of pahs of the two rivers 2 variables of pahs from different stations and 3 variables of pahs for four seasons descriptive statistics were applied and boxplots were drawn to show the quartiles of the concentrations 25th 50th and 75th percentile of the observations as well as the average values in addition wavelet analysis was conducted to investigate the time frequency variation characteristics of pahs through matlab and surfer 8 0 moreover the self organizing map som and positive matrix factorization pmf receptor model 5 0 were applied for the source apportionment of pahs in addition the abrupt change test was conducted using the mann kendall test and sliding t test for identifying the critical year of the variation of pahs furthermore the anova test was applied to the concentrations of pahs for investigating the difference of data from various stations and seasons at the level of p 0 05 the statistical analyses were performed in origin 9 1 and spss statistics 24 detailed information about methods are provided in part s1 4 3 results 3 1 temporal trends in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon levels according to the 20 year monitoring data the mean concentrations of total pahs in spm were 5729 5 ng g 1 min max 1750 0 34 200 0 ng g 1 in the rhine and 4989 8 ng g 1 min max 49 5 15 100 0 ng g 1 in the elbe the t test results in table s8 p 0 05 show that the concentration was lower in the elbe than in the rhine the overall temporal trends for the concentrations of pahs in spm are shown in fig 2 a b the concentrations of pahs in both rivers were at a comparable level and varied between 5000 ng g 1 and 6000 ng g 1 in the early years 1998 2010 however in recent years 2010 2017 the concentrations decreased to 3000 4000 ng g 1 in the elbe while concentration remained the same in the rhine in addition based on the results of the mann kendall test tables s9 10 the slopes of the decreasing trends of concentration in the elbe and rhine were 1 287 and 0 252 respectively thus it can be concluded that the rate of decrease in pah concentration in recent years was higher in the elbe as shown in fig 2 c d the 20 year average load calculated by multiplying the concentrations of spm and the concentrations of pahs representing the amount of pahs in contact with organisms and humans of pahs in the rhine 115 7 μg m 3 standard deviation 161 13 was 58 3 of the average value in the elbe 200 75 μg m 3 standard deviation 233 77 although pah concentrations were higher in the rhine its pah loads were lower owing to the low concentrations of spm fig s2 the trends of the loads were determined as decreasing with a slope of 0 016 for the rhine and 0 052 for the elbe as shown in fig 2 e f the average mass flux calculated by multiplying the load and discharge representing the absolute quantity of pahs absorbed onto spm was significantly higher in the rhine 2 12 10 5 μg s 1 than in the elbe 1 23 10 5 μg s 1 owing to its higher discharge fig s2 furthermore according to the results of the mann kendall test table s11 the mass flux in the rhine slope 18 256 decreased at a higher rate than that in the elbe slope 13 738 therefore pahs in the rhine had higher concentrations lower loads in spm and higher mass fluxes than those in the elbe while all the variables for both rivers showed decreasing trends during the last 20 years 3 2 periodic variation in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon levels based on the 20 year monthly data wavelet analysis was employed to investigate the periodic variation of pahs fig 3 e shows the morlet wavelet real part of mass flux of pahs in the rhine there were one frequent and severe periodic oscillation at the scale of 10 30 months and two mild oscillations at the scales of 30 60 and 60 120 months as shown in fig s3 e the wavelet energy spectrum of mass flux of pahs had higher coefficients modulus values at the scale of 10 30 months indicating that the periodic oscillation at this scale had higher periodic strength furthermore the wavelet variation of mass flux of pahs had the largest peak at time scales of 20 months fig s4 e implying that the periodic oscillation was clearer at that scale therefore the periodic oscillation at the scale of 10 30 months can be considered the most significant variation according to the wavelet analysis fig 3 c f s3 6 both the loads and mass flux in the rhine and elbe had a significant periodic oscillation at the scale of 10 30 months as well for the pah concentration in two rivers the periodic oscillation at the scale of 60 120 months was more significant than that of 10 30 months however according to the wave power spectrum and global wavelet spectrum figs s7 8 this periodic oscillation of 60 120 months was not in the confidence intervals so that the periodic oscillation at the scale of 10 30 months was determined as reliable variation furthermore the variation of pahs might have been related to the abrupt change in pah pollution in that specific year according to the sliding t test fig s9 a b the values of 2010 for the rhine and 2002 and 2010 for the elbe were outside the confidence intervals suggesting that the mass flux of pahs had an abrupt decrease in these years in addition based on the results of the mann kendall test fig s9 c d the lines of uf and ub crossed at the point of 1999 for the rhine while they crossed at the points of 2001 and 2006 for the elbe however the crossing point of 2001 for the elbe was outside the confidence interval implying this abrupt point was not reliable combining the results of the sliding t test and mann kendall test the abrupt change points were 1999 and 2010 for the rhine and 2002 2006 and 2010 for the elbe 3 3 spatial trend in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon levels the concentrations loads and mass fluxes of total pahs for individual stations are shown in fig 4 1 6 the anova test p 0 05 for both rivers suggested significant spatial variation in the pollution levels of pahs table s12 for the rhine the samples in r4 and r7 had relatively high concentrations 7696 9 ng g 1 and 7480 5 ng g 1 respectively and loads 139 1 μg m 3 and 146 1 μg m 3 respectively of pahs however because the two stations are at the tributary of the rhine their discharges were lower than those of the other stations thereby resulting in lower mass fluxes 1 18 10 5 μg s 1 and 6 03 10 4 μg s 1 for r4 and r7 respectively in addition the pollution levels including concentration load and mass flux upstream r1 4 were significantly lower than those downstream r5 8 for instance the average mass flux of the upstream station 1 30 10 6 μg s 1 was only 50 that of the downstream station 2 61 10 6 μg s 1 this spatial difference might be attributable to the intensive anthropogenic activities in downstream cities cologne duesseldorf and kampen for the elbe the spatial distribution was opposite to that of the rhine the pollution level of pahs decreased from upstream e1 5 to downstream e6 10 the average mass flux of the upstream area 1 54 10 5 μg s 1 was 1 5 times greater than that at the downstream area 1 00 10 5 μg s 1 upstream of the elbe there are urbanized and populated areas such as the cities of dresden and magdeburg the mass flux at the stations e2 e3 e5 and e8 near the cities ranged from 1 36 10 5 μg s 1 to 2 16 10 5 μg s 1 while the mass flux at the stations e1 e4 e6 e7 e9 and e10 near rural areas varied from 8 19 10 4 μg s 1 to 1 14 10 5 μg s 1 in addition the two sample t test also revealed the difference in mass flux between urban and rural areas table s13 thus through the variation in the pollution of pahs from upstream to downstream waterways near urban areas were found to have higher mass fluxes of pahs to compare the decreasing rate of pollution of pahs the slopes of the trends of concentrations loads and mass fluxes for all the stations determined by the mann kendall test tables s14 16 are shown in fig 4 7 12 the specific characteristics of these trends are as follows first the decreasing rates of concentration approximately 1 9 to 16 4 and load approximately 0 049 to 0 811 in the rhine were lower than those of the concentration approximately 4 2 to 30 5 and load approximately 0 134 to 1 428 in the elbe however the mass flux approximately 38 5 to 626 4 in the rhine decreased more rapidly than that in the elbe approximately 87 3 to 472 3 second there was a significant relationship between the decreasing rate of pollution levels and the spatial distribution of urban areas explicitly stations r5 7 near the cities of cologne duesseldorf and kampen and e3 e5 and e8 near the cities of dresden magdeburg and hamburg had the greatest rates of decrease in concentration load and mass flux conversely no significant trend or low rates of decrease were determined at the stations r1 e4 and e6 in rural areas the reason for the greater rate of decrease in the urban areas might have been the reduced emissions of pahs from anthropogenic activities in urban areas through mitigation strategies therefore the stations near urban areas had higher mass fluxes of pahs and a greater rate of decrease than those near rural areas 3 4 seasonal variation in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons the boxplots of mass flux of the total pahs in the four seasons are presented in fig 7 a b the anova test p 0 05 for both rivers indicated that seasons had a significant influence on the mass flux of total pahs table s12 the average mass fluxes in winter 3 56 10 5 μg s 1 and 1 83 10 5 μg s 1 for the rhine and elbe respectively and spring 2 07 10 5 μg s 1 and 1 84 10 5 μg s 1 respectively were significantly higher than those in summer 1 58 10 5 μg s 1 and 6 14 10 4 μg s 1 respectively and autumn 1 61 10 5 μg s 1 and 8 31 10 4 μg s 1 respectively similar seasonal variations have also been observed for pahs in other waters bayowa and agbozu 2016 cetin et al 2018 goudarzi et al 2017 the atmosphere barrado et al 2012 ma et al 2010 and road dust gope et al 2018 kural et al 2018 which might be explained by the variations in anthropogenic activities and climatic conditions throughout the year first pahs are susceptible to photodegradation during summer at high temperatures in particular when pahs accumulate on the road the black asphalt can absorb and reflect solar radiation thereby promoting the photodegradation of pahs gope et al 2018 the meteorological conditions in winter such as shorter daylight hours low temperature low photochemical reactivity and reduced vertical dispersion due to thermal inversion increase the accumulation of pahs in addition more rainfall discharge in spring and winter fig s10 can flush many pahs into rivers thereby resulting in the higher mass flux of pahs furthermore increased consumption of fossil fuels burning of coal biomass and coke in winter for residential heating leads to higher emission of pahs into the environment kural et al 2018 4 discussion 4 1 multimedia transport and fate of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as shown in fig 5 a b the mass fluxes of pahs for both rivers simulated by the multimedia model were consistent with the observed values within one order of magnitude the composition of pahs in the multimedia was similar for both rivers fig 5 c d pahs with two to three rings 72 79 were dominant in the air owing to the volatility of low molecular weight pahs because high molecular weight pahs are hydrophobic they were predominant in all solid phases the composition and mechanisms are consistent with those of other studies choi et al 2012 domínguez morueco et al 2016 huang et al 2019 the average simulated concentration and mass of pahs in the multimedia are presented in fig 5 e and f although the values for the rhine were higher than those for the elbe the distribution of pahs in the multimedia was similar for both rivers the highest concentration was observed in impervious surfaces owing to its large specific surface area and strong adsorption capacity of black carbon csiszar et al 2012 unger and gustafsson 2008 in addition the mass of pahs in soil and sediments was one to two orders of magnitude greater than that in other media thus they can be regarded as the two main reservoirs of pahs this could be attributed to the majority of the pahs in the air and water being transferred to the soil and sediments fig s11 and pahs have high chemical persistence in both media the results agree with those of previous studies conducted in tarragona spain domínguez morueco et al 2016 shanghai china huang et al 2019 and downtown toronto canada priemer and diamond 2002 furthermore according to the simulated transfer flux fig s11 runoff from impervious surfaces was the main route of pah loads 58 0 for the elbe and 78 4 for the rhine entering the aquatic system in addition according to the sensitivity analysis the volume fraction of solids in water had a higher sensitivity index approximately 0 73 to 0 82 for the phases of water spm and sediment table s17 implying that it had a significant impact on the distribution of pahs in these phases moreover the volume fraction of solids in air and dry deposition velocity played an important role in the fate of pahs in the air soil and vegetation while the rate of precipitation and clearance affected the pollution levels on impervious surfaces 4 2 source apportionment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as shown in fig 7 c d high molecular weight pahs four to six rings were dominant in both rivers while the average concentration of three ring pahs in the rhine 1520 6 ng g 1 accounting for 26 54 was two times greater than that in the elbe 771 9 ng g 1 accounting for 15 47 based on the som analysis the relative component distribution of pahs in spm from the two rivers is illustrated in fig 6 component planes with similar topographic patterns were significantly correlated alvarez guerra et al 2008 thus pahs in the rhine were classified into two categories the first pattern contained fluh and pyr which are indicative of coal combustion kong et al 2012 sofowote et al 2008 the second pattern included bbf and idp which are strongly linked to gasoline powered engine emissions harrison et al 1996 ravindra et al 2008 simcik et al 1999 pahs in the elbe could be classified into four categories the first pattern contained ace flu and phe which are linked to coke ovens khalili et al 1995 yunker et al 2002 the second pattern was characterized by fluh and pyr which correspond to coal combustion the third pattern was dominated by chr baa bbf bap and bgp which are mainly derived from gasoline powered engines harrison et al 1996 ravindra et al 2008 simcik et al 1999 the final pattern included bkf and idp which are indicators of diesel powered engine emissions harrison et al 1996 ravindra et al 2008 as shown in fig 6 the application of a k means clustering algorithm to the trained som assisted the organization of the datasets with optimal clusters based on the lowest dbi the diagrams of the index against the number of clusters are presented in fig s12 for the rhine two clusters were determined one cluster which was placed at the top of the map was characterized by low molecular weight pahs such as nap and acy it grouped the upstream stations of r1 4 with relatively low pah pollution another cluster which was placed at the bottom of the map included the downstream stations of r5 8 this region of the map had high concentrations of high molecular weight pahs thereby indicating that this cluster was strongly related to serious pah pollution caused by vehicular emissions and coal combustion three clusters were classified for the elbe the first cluster at the top of the map grouped the downstream stations e9 11 the area of the cluster was a low concentration area thereby implying low pollution levels at the stations the second cluster included the midstream stations of e4 and e6 8 in the middle of the map where most of the high molecular weight pahs had medium concentrations the upstream stations of e1 3 and e5 formed the last cluster at the bottom of the map all the pahs had high concentrations at the bottom of the map thereby indicating high levels of pah pollution at these stations the concentrations of pahs separated by molecular weight for each station along the two rivers are shown in fig s13 which supported the clustering of stations source profiles with fractional concentrations for the two rivers were obtained using the pmf model as given in fig 7 e f the source contributors of pahs were identified by the predominant pahs and detailed identification is provided in the supporting information part s5 the percentage contributions of the sources for both rivers are shown in fig 7 g h for the rhine the pmf model extracted the sources of diesel 7 0 gasoline and coal combustion 44 0 cement plants 15 0 coke ovens 18 0 and wood combustion 14 6 for the elbe the contributors were vehicular emissions and coal combustion 62 9 coke ovens 11 6 surface pavement 8 0 and wood combustion 17 0 through som analysis and the pmf model it could be concluded that vehicular emissions and coal combustion were the dominant sources of pahs in both rivers 4 3 changes in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pollution the concentration of pahs in the elbe was lower than that in the rhine which might have been caused by the difference in the anthropogenic activities and the concentration of spm in the two rivers first more emissions from anthropogenic activities can increase the concentration of pahs in rivers secondly assuming the same emission input to rivers a higher spm concentration 50 g m 3 in the elbe from table s11 could imply more widespread adsorption of pahs on particles thereby resulting in the low concentrations of pahs in specific particles in addition although the concentration of pahs was higher in the rhine the low spm concentration 20 g m 3 resulted in low loads of pahs because aquatic organisms are sensible to loads of pahs most risk assessment methods employ this variable to estimate the ecological and health risks albering et al 1999 li et al 2010 sarria villa et al 2016 usepa 2001 the results indicated that the risks posed by pahs to organisms and human health are more serious in the elbe than in the rhine furthermore because the discharge in the rhine 1474 m3 s 1 was three times greater than that in the elbe 504 m3 s 1 the calculated mass flux in the rhine was higher thereby suggesting that the emissions of pahs along the rhine are higher than those along the elbe according to the abrupt analysis of pahs the abrupt change points were 1999 and 2010 for the rhine and 2002 2006 and 2010 for the elbe as given in fig s9 the causes of the abrupt change in the mass flux of pahs might have been natural events and anthropogenic activities for example a 100 year flood occurred in the elbe in 2002 which caused extremely high discharge moreover cities along the elbe were flooded which resulted in more pollutants being flushed into the river these are the reasons why the mass flux of pahs was extremely high in 2002 thereby causing the abrupt change in 2002 the relatively high discharge and concentration of spm resulted in the abrupt change in 1999 for the rhine excluding natural impacts the abrupt changes in 2006 and 2010 for both rivers might be attributable to the implementation of stricter vehicular emission standards euro 4 in 2007 and euro 5 in 2011 the abrupt change and emission standards might have caused the decrease in the time scale of periodic oscillations of pahs in the two rivers thus the changes in the amount of pahs were linked to the changes in anthropogenic activities 4 4 impact of energy consumption on the variation in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons the rhine crosses southwest germany rs1 4 while the elbe flows through the northeast part of germany and the netherlands es1 4 fig 8 a there are several differences in the social and economic aspects of the two river basins first the population of the rhine river basin is three times greater than that of the elbe river basin the high population represents more urbanized areas and large cities located along the rhine which implies higher energy consumption second the gross domestic product gdp of the rhine river basin is 3 4 times greater than that of the elbe river basin www regionalstatistik de accessed in september 2019 explicitly the contribution of rs3 to the gdp of germany accounts for 21 2 while the sum of that of es1 4 only accounts for 18 1 the higher gdp implies that anthropogenic activities in the rhine river basin are more intensive thereby resulting in the higher levels of pah pollution to investigate the relationship between pah pollution and the structure of energy consumption the energy from coal combustion for different states is presented in fig 8 a for the rhine river basin the highest percentage of energy consumption from coal combustion was observed in rs3 28 96 which was significantly higher than those from rs4 10 96 rs2 1 49 and rs1 3 72 owing to the large amount of coal consumption stations r5 r6 in rs3 had the highest mass flux of pahs as shown in fig 4 5 a similar situation was also observed in the elbe the highest percentage of energy consumption from coal combustion was observed in es2 10 6 where station e5 had the largest mass flux of pahs the average energy consumption from coal combustion in the regions along the rhine in the last 20 years 7 9 10 11 mj was two magnitudes higher than that along the elbe 8 5 10 9 mj thereby leading to more contaminants in the rhine in addition the energy consumption structures of the states along the two rivers are presented in fig 8 b e in the last 20 years the amount and percentage of energy consumption from coal combustion generally decreased over time in contrast the amount and percentage of renewable energies continuously increased as coal combustion has been identified as the main source of pahs the replacement of coal combustion with renewable energies can assist the reduction in pahs in the two rivers therefore the structure of energy consumption has a significant influence on the pah pollution levels 4 5 impact of vehicular emissions on the variation in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons the numbers of vehicles cars trucks tractors and motorcycles for different states are shown in fig 8 a for the rhine rs3 had the largest number of vehicles 1 1 10 7 which corresponds to the highest mass flux at stations r5 r6 for the elbe the number of vehicles in es1 2 5 10 6 was significantly higher than that in the other states although the energy consumption from coal combustion in this region was low 3 the high vehicular emissions resulted in the large mass flux at stations e2 and e3 moreover the average inventory of vehicles in the regions along the rhine from 1998 to 2017 7 7 10 6 was five times greater than that along the elbe 1 5 10 6 in addition the significant decrease in pahs might have been in response to stricter emission standards for example the implementation of the euro 4 emissions standard in 2007 euro 5 in 2011 and euro 6 in 2014 corresponded to the decreases in mass flux in 2007 2011 and 2014 fig 2 e f explicitly the allowable emissions for euro 4 were only half of that for euro 3 and as the strictest standard euro 6 also limited the number of emitted particles thereby reducing the absorption of pahs on particles thus the release of the european emission standards assisted the mitigation of pah pollution overall it can be concluded that the regions with more energy consumption from coal combustion and a greater number of vehicles are highly contaminated by pahs and mitigation strategies for vehicular emissions and energy consumption effectively alleviate pah pollution in comparison coal consumption along the rhine was significantly higher while vehicular inventories along the two rivers were of the same magnitude the results revealed the pah pollution from coal combustion in the rhine is more serious and vehicular emissions play an important role in the contribution of pahs in the elbe and rhine therefore mitigation strategies for the rhine should focus on the energy consumption structure such as substituting coal with clean energies while purifying vehicular emissions will be effective for alleviating the contamination of pahs in both the elbe and rhine 5 conclusion based on 20 year monitoring data this study systematically examined the spatiotemporal distribution multimedia transport fate and source apportionment of pahs in the aquatic spm of the rhine and elbe the main findings are as follows 1 the rhine had higher concentrations and mass fluxes but lower loads of pahs than the elbe this implies that the rhine has a larger amount of pahs but the pahs in the elbe pose greater risks to the environment and human health 2 spm near urban areas had a higher mass flux of pahs and a greater rate of decrease than those near rural areas the mass fluxes of pahs were higher in winter for both rivers which could be attributed to the variations in anthropogenic activities and climatic conditions throughout the year 3 the results of the multimedia model indicated that impervious surfaces had the highest concentration of pahs while soil and sediments were the two main sinks of pahs 4 the source apportionment analysis revealed that coal combustion and vehicular emissions were the main sources of pahs which agrees with the regional energy consumption of coal and the number of vehicles therefore it is necessary for policymakers to focus on the substitution of coal combustion with cleaner energies or purification of exhaust gas to mitigate pah pollution declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

17894,as carcinogenic and pervasive pollutants polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in surface water are crucial to environmental policies and the understanding of their trends and influencing factors is critical for achieving a good chemical and ecological status of water bodies based on long term monitoring data from 1998 to 2017 this study systematically evaluated the spatiotemporal distribution multimedia transport fate and source apportionment of pahs adsorbed on suspended particulate matter spm in rhine and elbe rivers the results of the mann kendall test indicated that pollution levels of pahs decreased from 2 81 10 5 μg s 1 to 9 80 10 4 μg s 1 on average in the rhine and from 1 60 10 5 μg s 1 to 5 21 10 4 μg s 1 in the elbe in the last 20 years spatially spm near urban areas had higher pah mass fluxes rhine 3 07 10 5 μg s 1 elbe 1 73 10 5 μg s 1 and greater rates of decrease slopes for rhine and elbe 409 323 than those near rural areas rhine 1 41 10 5 μg s 1 elbe 9 35 10 4 μg s 1 slopes for rhine and elbe 128 89 indicating the significant influence of anthropogenic activities wavelet analysis showed that the pollution level of pah had significant periodic oscillations for the rhine and elbe and revealed several abrupt change points for the two rivers a multimedia fugacity model demonstrated that impervious surfaces had the highest concentration rhine 1 84 g m 3 elbe 0 15 g m 3 while soil rhine 8 33 10 7 g elbe 2 53 10 6 g and sediments rhine 4 85 10 6 g elbe 1 31 10 6 g had higher masses of pahs furthermore source apportionment computed using a self organizing map and positive matrix factorization model suggested that the major sources of pahs were vehicular emissions and coal combustion which accounted for 51 86 of the total mass in the rhine and 62 92 in the elbe the data revealed that the long term trends of pah variation were associated with changes in energy consumption and the implementation of vehicular emission standards therefore the substitution of coal and petroleum with renewable energies could assist strategies of pah mitigation in the environment and gradual reduction of pollution levels graphical abstract image 1 keywords polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons surface water quality anthropogenic activities rhine and elbe rivers 1 introduction owing to their highly lipophilic carcinogenic mutagenic and teratogenic characteristics polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs contaminating the environment is a global concern in terms of ecological safety and human health achten and hofmann 2009 naudin et al 2019 the worldwide occurrence of pahs can be attributed to both natural processes and anthropogenic activities zhang et al 2015 the natural budget of the pah inventory is mainly contributed by forest fires and volcanic eruptions gan et al 2009 however in the urban environment pahs and their derivatives predominantly originate from diverse anthropogenic sources including the burning of fuels grimmer et al 1983 industrial processing zhang and tao 2009 coal powered generation grimmer et al 1983 and vehicular emissions liu et al 2017 peng et al 2011 therefore anthropogenic activities have a significant influence on the occurrence of pahs in the environment more recently with the optimization of the structure of energy consumption more renewable energies have been utilized instead of traditional energies coal and petroleum this might affect the environmental levels of pahs in addition with scientific and technological development emission standards have been improved over the past few decades however the influence of the changes in energy consumption and vehicular emissions on the pollution levels of pahs is not well understood in addition because of their stable chemical structure pahs are pervasive environmental pollutants that have been found in different environmental media including air oleagoitia et al 2019 shrivastava et al 2017 soil masto et al 2019 syed et al 2017 and water bansal and kim 2015 regarding the aquatic environment pahs enter the water through surface runoff and atmospheric deposition therefore the receiving waters act as an environmental sink for pahs gan et al 2009 furthermore owing to their low solubility and high resistivity to anoxic bacterial degradation guo et al 2007 karlsson and viklander 2008 patrolecco et al 2010 a significant amount of pahs are adsorbed onto suspended particulate matter spm in receiving waters sun et al 2009 many previous studies focused on the concentrations of pahs ng g 1 in spm mostafa et al 2003 oen et al 2006 but rarely investigated the influences of energy consumption and vehicular emissions on the loads μg m 3 and mass fluxes μg s 1 of pahs over the long term therefore it is essential to gain a deep understanding of the spatiotemporal distributions and source apportionment of pahs by investigating the concentrations loads and mass fluxes of pahs in spm to reduce the exposure risks to the public and environment the rhine and elbe have the third and fourth largest river basins in central europe respectively many large cities frankfurt am main cologne dusseldorf and rotterdam are located along rhine river with a total population of approximately 58 million people ruff et al 2015 in addition 10 of the world s chemical industry is located in this area and more than 2800 municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants discharge wastewater into rhine river mani et al 2015 most of the energy in the region is generated from coal combustion and hydroelectric power emissions from anthropogenic activities of the large population contaminate the aquatic environment while people consume fish from the river and use river water for recreational swimming and drinking approximately 18 5 million people live in the catchment area of the elbe which has a smaller urban area and lower energy consumption therefore the impact of anthropogenic activities on the environmental behaviors of pahs can be assessed by comparing the structure of energy usage and pollution levels of pahs between the two rivers accordingly the primary aim of this study was to examine the influence of anthropogenic activities on the occurrence of pahs in the aquatic environment and guide policymakers in the creation of mitigation strategies in detail the objectives were to 1 investigate the potential impact of energy consumption and vehicular emissions on temporal and spatial variations in the concentrations loads and mass fluxes of pahs along the rhine and elbe based on data covering 20 years 2 identify the primary sources of pahs using an artificial neural network and receptor model and 3 estimate the transport and fate of pahs in multimedia using a level iii fugacity model 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area and sample analysis as shown in fig 1 eight and eleven monitoring stations along the rhine and elbe respectively are operated by the international commission for the protection of the rhine and the river basin community elbe flussgebietsgemeinschaft elbe to measure general parameters inorganic compounds and organic micropollutants www had bafg de www fgg elbe de accessed feb 2019 the stations along the rhine covered the area from the upstream at the junction of switzerland france and germany to the downstream in the netherlands meanwhile the stations along the elbe covered the main watercourse of the river in germany from the state of saxony to the city of hamburg following the european water framework directive the measured organic micropollutants included 16 pahs namely naphthalene nap acenaphthylene acy acenaphthene ace fluorene flu phenanthrene phe anthracene fluoranthene fluh pyrene pyr benzo a anthracene baa chrysene chr benzo b fluoranthene bbf benzo k fluoranthene bkf benzo a pyrene bap indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene idp dibenzo a h anthracene and benzo g h i perylene bgp directive 2000 the selected samples were collected over 20 years from january 1998 to december 2017 the frequency of sampling ranged from every 14 d to every 28 d the total number of samples the rhine and elbe were 2676 and 2005 respectively water samples were first obtained using a continuous centrifuge at 0 3 8 0 m below the water surface and stored in a tank after settling the aqueous phase and coarse sand fraction were filtered to recover the residue suspended sediments 2 mm were subsequently collected and tested at the laboratory of the german federal institute of hydrology bundesanstalt für gewässerkunde for chemical determination the concentrations of pahs were measured using high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography mass spectrometry following us epa method 610 german standard din iso 28540 and din 38407 f 39 epa 1984 2 2 multimedia fugacity model the level iii fugacity model has been widely employed to quantitatively depict the multimedia transport and fate of pahs in complex urban systems under steady state assumptions greenfield and davis 2005 huang and batterman 2014 wang et al 2012 xu et al 2013 in the conceptual framework of the model as shown in fig s1 six bulk compartments contained sub compartments such as the vapor phase and particles in the air three phases of pore water gas and solid in the soil and the dissolved phase and suspended sediments in water furthermore the model includes expressions for transport between multimedia such as wet gas deposition dry gas particle deposition diffusion between air and water runoff from the surface soil to water and degradation in each medium in the fugacity model the fugacity capacity constant z x mol m 3 pa 1 expresses the capacity of pahs in a phase for example z values in the water are calculated as follows 1 z 22 1 h 2 z 23 m 23 ρ 23 k o c h 3 z 2 z 22 1 v 23 z 23 v 23 where z 22 z 23 and z 2 are capacity constants in dissolved suspended particle and total phase m 23 is the content of organic carbon ρ 23 is the density of solids and v 23 is the volume fraction of solids in water the intercompartmental transfer of pahs between the six media and degradation were quantified by d values mol pa 1 h 1 for instance the d values for the transport from air to water were computed as follows 4 w e t g a s d e p o s i t i o n d 2 r z 22 a 2 i r 5 w e t p a r t i c l e d e p o s i t i o n d 2 w z 13 a 2 i r q v 13 6 dry particle deposition d 2 w z

clearance rate v 13 is the volume fraction of solids in air k 1 2 and k 2 1 are the mass transfer coefficients from the air water side over water air according to the environmental and physicochemical parameters obtained from the literature and databases tables s1 4 z x and d values for all transport processes in multimedia were calculated using the equations provided in table s5 and table s6 after substituting the values of d the mass balance equations table s7 were solved to obtain the fugacity f x pa of the compartment x for each pah the model input was pah emissions from various identified sources atmospheric emissions from vehicles were calculated by multiplying the number of vehicles fuel consumption and emission factors the numbers of four kinds of vehicles car truck tractor and motorcycle in the administrative regions along the rhine and elbe from 1998 to 2017 were obtained from germany s regional database www regionalstatistik de accessed jan 2019 the fuel consumption of each kind of vehicle was determined from the literature review the emission factor ef mg pah t fuel consumption of vehicles was calculated for individual pahs using the monovariate regression model equation 8 log ef iy k i g d p c y b i where g d p c y is the gross domestic product per capita of germany in the y th year and k i and b i are the slope factor and interception for the i th pah representing the rate of emission reduction against socio economic development table s1 the average gdpc of each standard for the period was selected considering the eu emission standards the consumption of coal along the rhine and elbe from 1998 to 2017 were obtained from germany s regional database and netherlands statistical office the emissions from coal combustion were calculated as follows 9 e a e f iy m y where ea is the emissions from coal combustion m y is the energy production from coal combustion in the y th year and e f iy is the emission factor for coal combustion the values for coke oven and wood combustion were computed in the same manner the emission factors were adopted from shen et al 2013b the atmospheric emission inputs are presented in table s2 after obtaining fugacity f x pah concentration c mol m 3 was calculated using the following equation huang et al 2019 10 c x z x f x in this study pah concentrations ng g 1 in suspended sediments were obtained as follows 11 c spm c 23 m m 23 z 23 f 2 m ρ 23 v 23 where c 23 mol pahs in spm m 3 water is the molar quantity of pahs in spm per cubic meter of water m g mol 1 is the molecular weight of a

study the simulated and observed annual mass fluxes of pahs in spm in the two rivers were compared to evaluate the accuracy of the model a sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the influence of the environmental parameters on the results of the multimedia model several environmental parameters clearance rate rate of precipitation volume fractions of solids in air volume fractions of solids in water dry deposition velocity sediment deposition rate were adjusted with 10 to obtain different results the sensitivity index can be calculated as follows 12 s y 1 1 y 0 9 0 2 y 1 0 where s is the sensitivity index and y 1 1 y 0 9 y 1 0 are model results with 1 1 0 9 and 1 0 times of environmental parameters the results of the sensitivity analysis are provided in table s17 2 3 data handling and other methods in this study three parameters of pahs concentration load and mass flux were applied to analyze the pollution level the concentrations of pahs ng g 1 were obtained from laboratory analysis moreover as the concentrations of spm significantly affect the pollution levels of pahs most assessments for ecological and health risk considered the loads μg m 3 calculated by multiplying the concentrations of spm and the concentrations of pahs representing the amount of pah contacting organisms and human furthermore to compare the absolute quantity of pahs in the two rivers the mass flux μg s 1 of pahs was employed by considering the loads and discharge the variables concentration load and mass flux of pahs from the rhine and elbe were grouped into three categories 1 annual variables of pahs of the two rivers 2 variables of pahs from different stations and 3 variables of pahs for four seasons descriptive statistics were applied and boxplots were drawn to show the quartiles of the concentrations 25th 50th and 75th percentile of the observations as well as the average values in addition wavelet analysis was conducted to investigate the time frequency variation characteristics of pahs through matlab and surfer 8 0 moreover the self organizing map som and positive matrix factorization pmf receptor model 5 0 were applied for the source apportionment of pahs in addition the abrupt change test was conducted using the mann kendall test and sliding t test for identifying the critical year of the variation of pahs furthermore the anova test was applied to the concentrations of pahs for investigating the difference of data from various stations and seasons at the level of p 0 05 the statistical analyses were performed in origin 9 1 and spss statistics 24 detailed information about methods are provided in part s1 4 3 results 3 1 temporal trends in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon levels according to the 20 year monitoring data the mean concentrations of total pahs in spm were 5729 5 ng g 1 min max 1750 0 34 200 0 ng g 1 in the rhine and 4989 8 ng g 1 min max 49 5 15 100 0 ng g 1 in the elbe the t test results in table s8 p 0 05 show that the concentration was lower in the elbe than in the rhine the overall temporal trends for the concentrations of pahs in spm are shown in fig 2 a b the concentrations of pahs in both rivers were at a comparable level and varied between 5000 ng g 1 and 6000 ng g 1 in the early years 1998 2010 however in recent years 2010 2017 the concentrations decreased to 3000 4000 ng g 1 in the elbe while concentration remained the same in the rhine in addition based on the results of the mann kendall test tables s9 10 the slopes of the decreasing trends of concentration in the elbe and rhine were 1 287 and 0 252 respectively thus it can be concluded that the rate of decrease in pah concentration in recent years was higher in the elbe as shown in fig 2 c d the 20 year average load calculated by multiplying the concentrations of spm and the concentrations of pahs representing the amount of pahs in contact with organisms and humans of pahs in the rhine 115 7 μg m 3 standard deviation 161 13 was 58 3 of the average value in the elbe 200 75 μg m 3 standard deviation 233 77 although pah concentrations were higher in the rhine its pah loads were lower owing to the low concentrations of spm fig s2 the trends of the loads were determined as decreasing with a slope of 0 016 for the rhine and 0 052 for the elbe as shown in fig 2 e f the average mass flux calculated by multiplying the load and discharge representing the absolute quantity of pahs absorbed onto spm was significantly higher in the rhine 2 12 10 5 μg s 1 than in the elbe 1 23 10 5 μg s 1 owing to its higher discharge fig s2 furthermore according to the results of the mann kendall test table s11 the mass flux in the rhine slope 18 256 decreased at a higher rate than that in the elbe slope 13 738 therefore pahs in the rhine had higher concentrations lower loads in spm and higher mass fluxes than those in the elbe while all the variables for both rivers showed decreasing trends during the last 20 years 3 2 periodic variation in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon levels based on the 20 year monthly data wavelet analysis was employed to investigate the periodic variation of pahs fig 3 e shows the morlet wavelet real part of mass flux of pahs in the rhine there were one frequent and severe periodic oscillation at the scale of 10 30 months and two mild oscillations at the scales of 30 60 and 60 120 months as shown in fig s3 e the wavelet energy spectrum of mass flux of pahs had higher coefficients modulus values at the scale of 10 30 months indicating that the periodic oscillation at this scale had higher periodic strength furthermore the wavelet variation of mass flux of pahs had the largest peak at time scales of 20 months fig s4 e implying that the periodic oscillation was clearer at that scale therefore the periodic oscillation at the scale of 10 30 months can be considered the most significant variation according to the wavelet analysis fig 3 c f s3 6 both the loads and mass flux in the rhine and elbe had a significant periodic oscillation at the scale of 10 30 months as well for the pah concentration in two rivers the periodic oscillation at the scale of 60 120 months was more significant than that of 10 30 months however according to the wave power spectrum and global wavelet spectrum figs s7 8 this periodic oscillation of 60 120 months was not in the confidence intervals so that the periodic oscillation at the scale of 10 30 months was determined as reliable variation furthermore the variation of pahs might have been related to the abrupt change in pah pollution in that specific year according to the sliding t test fig s9 a b the values of 2010 for the rhine and 2002 and 2010 for the elbe were outside the confidence intervals suggesting that the mass flux of pahs had an abrupt decrease in these years in addition based on the results of the mann kendall test fig s9 c d the lines of uf and ub crossed at the point of 1999 for the rhine while they crossed at the points of 2001 and 2006 for the elbe however the crossing point of 2001 for the elbe was outside the confidence interval implying this abrupt point was not reliable combining the results of the sliding t test and mann kendall test the abrupt change points were 1999 and 2010 for the rhine and 2002 2006 and 2010 for the elbe 3 3 spatial trend in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon levels the concentrations loads and mass fluxes of total pahs for individual stations are shown in fig 4 1 6 the anova test p 0 05 for both rivers suggested significant spatial variation in the pollution levels of pahs table s12 for the rhine the samples in r4 and r7 had relatively high concentrations 7696 9 ng g 1 and 7480 5 ng g 1 respectively and loads 139 1 μg m 3 and 146 1 μg m 3 respectively of pahs however because the two stations are at the tributary of the rhine their discharges were lower than those of the other stations thereby resulting in lower mass fluxes 1 18 10 5 μg s 1 and 6 03 10 4 μg s 1 for r4 and r7 respectively in addition the pollution levels including concentration load and mass flux upstream r1 4 were significantly lower than those downstream r5 8 for instance the average mass flux of the upstream station 1 30 10 6 μg s 1 was only 50 that of the downstream station 2 61 10 6 μg s 1 this spatial difference might be attributable to the intensive anthropogenic activities in downstream cities cologne duesseldorf and kampen for the elbe the spatial distribution was opposite to that of the rhine the pollution level of pahs decreased from upstream e1 5 to downstream e6 10 the average mass flux of the upstream area 1 54 10 5 μg s 1 was 1 5 times greater than that at the downstream area 1 00 10 5 μg s 1 upstream of the elbe there are urbanized and populated areas such as the cities of dresden and magdeburg the mass flux at the stations e2 e3 e5 and e8 near the cities ranged from 1 36 10 5 μg s 1 to 2 16 10 5 μg s 1 while the mass flux at the stations e1 e4 e6 e7 e9 and e10 near rural areas varied from 8 19 10 4 μg s 1 to 1 14 10 5 μg s 1 in addition the two sample t test also revealed the difference in mass flux between urban and rural areas table s13 thus through the variation in the pollution of pahs from upstream to downstream waterways near urban areas were found to have higher mass fluxes of pahs to compare the decreasing rate of pollution of pahs the slopes of the trends of concentrations loads and mass fluxes for all the stations determined by the mann kendall test tables s14 16 are shown in fig 4 7 12 the specific characteristics of these trends are as follows first the decreasing rates of concentration approximately 1 9 to 16 4 and load approximately 0 049 to 0 811 in the rhine were lower than those of the concentration approximately 4 2 to 30 5 and load approximately 0 134 to 1 428 in the elbe however the mass flux approximately 38 5 to 626 4 in the rhine decreased more rapidly than that in the elbe approximately 87 3 to 472 3 second there was a significant relationship between the decreasing rate of pollution levels and the spatial distribution of urban areas explicitly stations r5 7 near the cities of cologne duesseldorf and kampen and e3 e5 and e8 near the cities of dresden magdeburg and hamburg had the greatest rates of decrease in concentration load and mass flux conversely no significant trend or low rates of decrease were determined at the stations r1 e4 and e6 in rural areas the reason for the greater rate of decrease in the urban areas might have been the reduced emissions of pahs from anthropogenic activities in urban areas through mitigation strategies therefore the stations near urban areas had higher mass fluxes of pahs and a greater rate of decrease than those near rural areas 3 4 seasonal variation in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons the boxplots of mass flux of the total pahs in the four seasons are presented in fig 7 a b the anova test p 0 05 for both rivers indicated that seasons had a significant influence on the mass flux of total pahs table s12 the average mass fluxes in winter 3 56 10 5 μg s 1 and 1 83 10 5 μg s 1 for the rhine and elbe respectively and spring 2 07 10 5 μg s 1 and 1 84 10 5 μg s 1 respectively were significantly higher than those in summer 1 58 10 5 μg s 1 and 6 14 10 4 μg s 1 respectively and autumn 1 61 10 5 μg s 1 and 8 31 10 4 μg s 1 respectively similar seasonal variations have also been observed for pahs in other waters bayowa and agbozu 2016 cetin et al 2018 goudarzi et al 2017 the atmosphere barrado et al 2012 ma et al 2010 and road dust gope et al 2018 kural et al 2018 which might be explained by the variations in anthropogenic activities and climatic conditions throughout the year first pahs are susceptible to photodegradation during summer at high temperatures in particular when pahs accumulate on the road the black asphalt can absorb and reflect solar radiation thereby promoting the photodegradation of pahs gope et al 2018 the meteorological conditions in winter such as shorter daylight hours low temperature low photochemical reactivity and reduced vertical dispersion due to thermal inversion increase the accumulation of pahs in addition more rainfall discharge in spring and winter fig s10 can flush many pahs into rivers thereby resulting in the higher mass flux of pahs furthermore increased consumption of fossil fuels burning of coal biomass and coke in winter for residential heating leads to higher emission of pahs into the environment kural et al 2018 4 discussion 4 1 multimedia transport and fate of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as shown in fig 5 a b the mass fluxes of pahs for both rivers simulated by the multimedia model were consistent with the observed values within one order of magnitude the composition of pahs in the multimedia was similar for both rivers fig 5 c d pahs with two to three rings 72 79 were dominant in the air owing to the volatility of low molecular weight pahs because high molecular weight pahs are hydrophobic they were predominant in all solid phases the composition and mechanisms are consistent with those of other studies choi et al 2012 domínguez morueco et al 2016 huang et al 2019 the average simulated concentration and mass of pahs in the multimedia are presented in fig 5 e and f although the values for the rhine were higher than those for the elbe the distribution of pahs in the multimedia was similar for both rivers the highest concentration was observed in impervious surfaces owing to its large specific surface area and strong adsorption capacity of black carbon csiszar et al 2012 unger and gustafsson 2008 in addition the mass of pahs in soil and sediments was one to two orders of magnitude greater than that in other media thus they can be regarded as the two main reservoirs of pahs this could be attributed to the majority of the pahs in the air and water being transferred to the soil and sediments fig s11 and pahs have high chemical persistence in both media the results agree with those of previous studies conducted in tarragona spain domínguez morueco et al 2016 shanghai china huang et al 2019 and downtown toronto canada priemer and diamond 2002 furthermore according to the simulated transfer flux fig s11 runoff from impervious surfaces was the main route of pah loads 58 0 for the elbe and 78 4 for the rhine entering the aquatic system in addition according to the sensitivity analysis the volume fraction of solids in water had a higher sensitivity index approximately 0 73 to 0 82 for the phases of water spm and sediment table s17 implying that it had a significant impact on the distribution of pahs in these phases moreover the volume fraction of solids in air and dry deposition velocity played an important role in the fate of pahs in the air soil and vegetation while the rate of precipitation and clearance affected the pollution levels on impervious surfaces 4 2 source apportionment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as shown in fig 7 c d high molecular weight pahs four to six rings were dominant in both rivers while the average concentration of three ring pahs in the rhine 1520 6 ng g 1 accounting for 26 54 was two times greater than that in the elbe 771 9 ng g 1 accounting for 15 47 based on the som analysis the relative component distribution of pahs in spm from the two rivers is illustrated in fig 6 component planes with similar topographic patterns were significantly correlated alvarez guerra et al 2008 thus pahs in the rhine were classified into two categories the first pattern contained fluh and pyr which are indicative of coal combustion kong et al 2012 sofowote et al 2008 the second pattern included bbf and idp which are strongly linked to gasoline powered engine emissions harrison et al 1996 ravindra et al 2008 simcik et al 1999 pahs in the elbe could be classified into four categories the first pattern contained ace flu and phe which are linked to coke ovens khalili et al 1995 yunker et al 2002 the second pattern was characterized by fluh and pyr which correspond to coal combustion the third pattern was dominated by chr baa bbf bap and bgp which are mainly derived from gasoline powered engines harrison et al 1996 ravindra et al 2008 simcik et al 1999 the final pattern included bkf and idp which are indicators of diesel powered engine emissions harrison et al 1996 ravindra et al 2008 as shown in fig 6 the application of a k means clustering algorithm to the trained som assisted the organization of the datasets with optimal clusters based on the lowest dbi the diagrams of the index against the number of clusters are presented in fig s12 for the rhine two clusters were determined one cluster which was placed at the top of the map was characterized by low molecular weight pahs such as nap and acy it grouped the upstream stations of r1 4 with relatively low pah pollution another cluster which was placed at the bottom of the map included the downstream stations of r5 8 this region of the map had high concentrations of high molecular weight pahs thereby indicating that this cluster was strongly related to serious pah pollution caused by vehicular emissions and coal combustion three clusters were classified for the elbe the first cluster at the top of the map grouped the downstream stations e9 11 the area of the cluster was a low concentration area thereby implying low pollution levels at the stations the second cluster included the midstream stations of e4 and e6 8 in the middle of the map where most of the high molecular weight pahs had medium concentrations the upstream stations of e1 3 and e5 formed the last cluster at the bottom of the map all the pahs had high concentrations at the bottom of the map thereby indicating high levels of pah pollution at these stations the concentrations of pahs separated by molecular weight for each station along the two rivers are shown in fig s13 which supported the clustering of stations source profiles with fractional concentrations for the two rivers were obtained using the pmf model as given in fig 7 e f the source contributors of pahs were identified by the predominant pahs and detailed identification is provided in the supporting information part s5 the percentage contributions of the sources for both rivers are shown in fig 7 g h for the rhine the pmf model extracted the sources of diesel 7 0 gasoline and coal combustion 44 0 cement plants 15 0 coke ovens 18 0 and wood combustion 14 6 for the elbe the contributors were vehicular emissions and coal combustion 62 9 coke ovens 11 6 surface pavement 8 0 and wood combustion 17 0 through som analysis and the pmf model it could be concluded that vehicular emissions and coal combustion were the dominant sources of pahs in both rivers 4 3 changes in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pollution the concentration of pahs in the elbe was lower than that in the rhine which might have been caused by the difference in the anthropogenic activities and the concentration of spm in the two rivers first more emissions from anthropogenic activities can increase the concentration of pahs in rivers secondly assuming the same emission input to rivers a higher spm concentration 50 g m 3 in the elbe from table s11 could imply more widespread adsorption of pahs on particles thereby resulting in the low concentrations of pahs in specific particles in addition although the concentration of pahs was higher in the rhine the low spm concentration 20 g m 3 resulted in low loads of pahs because aquatic organisms are sensible to loads of pahs most risk assessment methods employ this variable to estimate the ecological and health risks albering et al 1999 li et al 2010 sarria villa et al 2016 usepa 2001 the results indicated that the risks posed by pahs to organisms and human health are more serious in the elbe than in the rhine furthermore because the discharge in the rhine 1474 m3 s 1 was three times greater than that in the elbe 504 m3 s 1 the calculated mass flux in the rhine was higher thereby suggesting that the emissions of pahs along the rhine are higher than those along the elbe according to the abrupt analysis of pahs the abrupt change points were 1999 and 2010 for the rhine and 2002 2006 and 2010 for the elbe as given in fig s9 the causes of the abrupt change in the mass flux of pahs might have been natural events and anthropogenic activities for example a 100 year flood occurred in the elbe in 2002 which caused extremely high discharge moreover cities along the elbe were flooded which resulted in more pollutants being flushed into the river these are the reasons why the mass flux of pahs was extremely high in 2002 thereby causing the abrupt change in 2002 the relatively high discharge and concentration of spm resulted in the abrupt change in 1999 for the rhine excluding natural impacts the abrupt changes in 2006 and 2010 for both rivers might be attributable to the implementation of stricter vehicular emission standards euro 4 in 2007 and euro 5 in 2011 the abrupt change and emission standards might have caused the decrease in the time scale of periodic oscillations of pahs in the two rivers thus the changes in the amount of pahs were linked to the changes in anthropogenic activities 4 4 impact of energy consumption on the variation in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons the rhine crosses southwest germany rs1 4 while the elbe flows through the northeast part of germany and the netherlands es1 4 fig 8 a there are several differences in the social and economic aspects of the two river basins first the population of the rhine river basin is three times greater than that of the elbe river basin the high population represents more urbanized areas and large cities located along the rhine which implies higher energy consumption second the gross domestic product gdp of the rhine river basin is 3 4 times greater than that of the elbe river basin www regionalstatistik de accessed in september 2019 explicitly the contribution of rs3 to the gdp of germany accounts for 21 2 while the sum of that of es1 4 only accounts for 18 1 the higher gdp implies that anthropogenic activities in the rhine river basin are more intensive thereby resulting in the higher levels of pah pollution to investigate the relationship between pah pollution and the structure of energy consumption the energy from coal combustion for different states is presented in fig 8 a for the rhine river basin the highest percentage of energy consumption from coal combustion was observed in rs3 28 96 which was significantly higher than those from rs4 10 96 rs2 1 49 and rs1 3 72 owing to the large amount of coal consumption stations r5 r6 in rs3 had the highest mass flux of pahs as shown in fig 4 5 a similar situation was also observed in the elbe the highest percentage of energy consumption from coal combustion was observed in es2 10 6 where station e5 had the largest mass flux of pahs the average energy consumption from coal combustion in the regions along the rhine in the last 20 years 7 9 10 11 mj was two magnitudes higher than that along the elbe 8 5 10 9 mj thereby leading to more contaminants in the rhine in addition the energy consumption structures of the states along the two rivers are presented in fig 8 b e in the last 20 years the amount and percentage of energy consumption from coal combustion generally decreased over time in contrast the amount and percentage of renewable energies continuously increased as coal combustion has been identified as the main source of pahs the replacement of coal combustion with renewable energies can assist the reduction in pahs in the two rivers therefore the structure of energy consumption has a significant influence on the pah pollution levels 4 5 impact of vehicular emissions on the variation in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons the numbers of vehicles cars trucks tractors and motorcycles for different states are shown in fig 8 a for the rhine rs3 had the largest number of vehicles 1 1 10 7 which corresponds to the highest mass flux at stations r5 r6 for the elbe the number of vehicles in es1 2 5 10 6 was significantly higher than that in the other states although the energy consumption from coal combustion in this region was low 3 the high vehicular emissions resulted in the large mass flux at stations e2 and e3 moreover the average inventory of vehicles in the regions along the rhine from 1998 to 2017 7 7 10 6 was five times greater than that along the elbe 1 5 10 6 in addition the significant decrease in pahs might have been in response to stricter emission standards for example the implementation of the euro 4 emissions standard in 2007 euro 5 in 2011 and euro 6 in 2014 corresponded to the decreases in mass flux in 2007 2011 and 2014 fig 2 e f explicitly the allowable emissions for euro 4 were only half of that for euro 3 and as the strictest standard euro 6 also limited the number of emitted particles thereby reducing the absorption of pahs on particles thus the release of the european emission standards assisted the mitigation of pah pollution overall it can be concluded that the regions with more energy consumption from coal combustion and a greater number of vehicles are highly contaminated by pahs and mitigation strategies for vehicular emissions and energy consumption effectively alleviate pah pollution in comparison coal consumption along the rhine was significantly higher while vehicular inventories along the two rivers were of the same magnitude the results revealed the pah pollution from coal combustion in the rhine is more serious and vehicular emissions play an important role in the contribution of pahs in the elbe and rhine therefore mitigation strategies for the rhine should focus on the energy consumption structure such as substituting coal with clean energies while purifying vehicular emissions will be effective for alleviating the contamination of pahs in both the elbe and rhine 5 conclusion based on 20 year monitoring data this study systematically examined the spatiotemporal distribution multimedia transport fate and source apportionment of pahs in the aquatic spm of the rhine and elbe the main findings are as follows 1 the rhine had higher concentrations and mass fluxes but lower loads of pahs than the elbe this implies that the rhine has a larger amount of pahs but the pahs in the elbe pose greater risks to the environment and human health 2 spm near urban areas had a higher mass flux of pahs and a greater rate of decrease than those near rural areas the mass fluxes of pahs were higher in winter for both rivers which could be attributed to the variations in anthropogenic activities and climatic conditions throughout the year 3 the results of the multimedia model indicated that impervious surfaces had the highest concentration of pahs while soil and sediments were the two main sinks of pahs 4 the source apportionment analysis revealed that coal combustion and vehicular emissions were the main sources of pahs which agrees with the regional energy consumption of coal and the number of vehicles therefore it is necessary for policymakers to focus on the substitution of coal combustion with cleaner energies or
