9335,salt stress is major constraint affecting agricultural productivity land degradation and has become a serious threat for global food security the selection and evaluation of barley genotypes that can tolerate salt stress are the main components for rehabilitation of salt degraded marginal soils in arid and semi arid countries including arabian peninsula a field experiment was conducted to evaluate the response of six barley genotypes 62 3 a 76 2 a n2 35 n2 4 badia furat1 at three salinity levels 0 7 and 14 ds m 1 to evaluate the response of genotypes based on morpho physiological characteristics and nutrients uptake the grain yield stability static environmental variance s 2 and dynamic wricke s ecovalence w 2 and harvest index hi was also estimated the higher salinity treatment 14 ds m 1 resulted in devastating reduction in barley yield traits additionally salt treatments 7 ds m 1 14 ds m 1 genotypes and interaction between genotypes salinity levels exhibited significant p 0 001 differences the genotype n2 35 exhibited highest plant biomass grains per spike and grains per plant whereas the genotype 76 2 a resulted in lowest number of grains per spike and grains per plant the highest k was noticed from badia genotype whereas the 62 3 a genotype failed to accumulate k the genotype furat1 showed substantial amount of cl and na contents followed by badia except badia and n2 35 all other genotypes showed higher δ13c values the badia genotype also showed higher iwue compared to all other genotypes contrarily the genotypes n2 4 and 62 3 a exhibited maximum reduction in iwue the δ15n trait increased following salinity treatment genotypes n2 35 and n2 4 showed highest δ15n while 62 3 a and 76 2 a exhibit lowest values for δ15n the study exhibited that the genotype n2 35 was tolerant to salinity stress whereas the response of furat1 genotype suggested salt susceptible behaviour it was concluded that salt tolerant genotype can be cultivated in saline marginal soils for food security and help in rehabilitation of marginal lands keywords carbon isotopes discrimination hordeum vulgare genotypes irrigation isotope ecology salinity water use efficiency yield data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction abiotic stresses are major environmental constraint that halts the plant growth and results in devastating yield losses munns and tester 2008 hussain et al 2016 salinity is one of the main abiotic stress factors that also trigger the impact of secondary stresses drought oxidative additionally agricultural lands are becoming scarce due to several anthropogenic activities and it is predicted that if it will continue at the rapid it will cause threat to food security by 2050 panuccio et al 2022 among all the uae falls in the arid region that is more prone to these environmental hazards it is also facing water scarcity where water resource per capita was 1250 m3 in 1950 and it declined to 76 2 m3 in 2014 the world bank 2017 therefore the water available to support agriculture is saline that is degrading the land and negatively influencing the yield and quality of the crops it is need of the hour to screen out adapt resilient crop for this region by considering the aforementioned stress scenario hussain et al 2016 2018 barley is a valuable grain crop which ranked 4th among the cereal crops faostat 2020 it is generally consumed as food and fodder pour aboughadareh et al 2021 barley exhibits moderate tolerance to salinity however it s morpho physiological and yield attributes have been least studied on degraded marginal lands therefore cultivation of salt tolerant barley genotype has been proposed as an alternative option to retain its yield in hyper arid and saline regions such as dubai united arab emirates in barley extensive genetic diversity exists that provides ease to screen genotypes under marginal growth conditions in contrast it is also essential to expose them to varying salinity levels for the evaluation of their growth yield performance and physiological attributes this kind of study is very important to develop efficient breeding programs and tool kits of salt tolerant crop genotypes and to undertake the growth physiological and yield traits under field conditions el hendawy et al 2005 hussain et al 2017 photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination δ13c provides measurement of plant s transpiration efficiency such as carbon in leaf to water transpired over the period during which dry matter is assimilated hussain et al 2018 the quantification of eco physiological traits intracellular co2 intrinsic water use efficiency carbon and nitrogen isotope composition are good indicator for the grouping of barley genotypes as sensitive and tolerant hussain et al 2015 2017 moreover it is also helpful for estimating the relation of long term nutrient and water use efficiency yousfi et al 2012 soil salinity disturbs in gaseous exchange traits limiting stomatal conductance resulting in declined inter co2 concentration that restricts photosynthesis damages to photosynthetic pigments and excessive production of reactive oxygen species chaudhry et al 2020 however stomatal closure can improve water use efficiency carbon isotope discrimination δ13c has negative relationship with transpiration rate that is simple and reliable indicator of water use efficiency under salinity stress yousfi et al 2009 the plant n isotope composition δ15n has also been proposed as potent indicator for screening of nitrogen metabolism in plant that broaden the horizons of nitrogen pathways fluxes and allocations evans 2001 several studies have revealed that it can increase or decrease under salinity stress hussain et al 2018 yousfi et al 2009 the isotope discrimination and salinity tolerance are associated as halophytes and non halophyte plants exhibits differential response patterns in δ13c additionally the δ13c increases with higher salinity when closure of stomata is main factor limiting the photosynthesis wei et al 2008 salinity stress also disturbs the ionic homeostasis favoring the uptake of sodium and restricting the absorption of essential nutrients which subsequently results in poor quality grain there is urgent need to identify genotypes that have potential to accumulate essential mineral ions under salinity conditions currently low yield is also mainly attributed to restricted nutrients supply to the barley but it can be changed with the introduction of novel high yielding salt tolerant barley genotypes additionally it will help for the conservation of freshwater resources that will be economically beneficial for sustainable agriculture on salt degraded marginal lands munns and tester 2008 hussain et al 2016 2019 current study was hypothesized to quantify the performance of contrasting barley genotypes to varying salinity levels 7 and 14 ds m 1 this study will help in unfolding of the physiological mechanisms under hypersaline environment additionally stable genotypes can be included in future breeding program to ensure food security 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site

other table 5 3 3 salinity impact on seed yield water use efficiency carbon and nitrogen isotope signature increased salinity level resulted in maximum decrease in grain yield the lowest grain yield 2 26 t ha 1 was noticed from barley genotypes exposed to 14 ds m 1 nacl treatment table 6 furthermore all the genotypes depicted significant p 0 001 difference and interaction between genotypes salinity

and 62 3 a while lowest ci ca was obtained in genotype badia 0 51 table 7 the intrinsic water use efficiency iwue increased significantly following salinity treatment of 7 ds m 1 109 4 and it decreased significantly after exposure to 14 ds m 1 salinity 99 9 table 6 the badia genotype 121 4 showed higher iwue compared to all genotypes contrarily the genotypes n2 4 96 9 and 62 3 a 96 8 exhibited maximum reduction in iwue table 7 the carbon isotope discrimination δ13c and δ13c values showed only significant differences among genotypes table 6 the δ13c was higher in 62 3 a n2 4 and furat1 genotypes the δ13c for genotypic variability showed higher values 25 in 62 3 a 76 2 a n2 35 n2 4 and furat1 genotypes whereas only badia genotype showed differential response compared to other

elucidation of stability in yield of barley genotypes barley genotypes varied greatly for mean grain yield across the treatments mi table 8 the barley genotypes exhibited very different scores for both static environmental variance s 2 and dynamic wricke s ecovalence w 2 the static environment variance for grain yield among all the 6 genotypes ranged from 0 337 to 1 693 while wricke s ecovalence varied from 0 014 to 1 313 in this stability analysis the lowest values demonstrate the stability in yield over saline environments the variety n2 35 was static stable and high yielding ranking 1st for s 2i grain yield index across all saline environments the barley 62 3 a and n2 4 were found to produce the 2nd and 3rd highest static yield index across all treatments the genotypes n2 35 and 62 3 a showed stable mean yield w 2i among all the genotypes across all environments table 8 3 6 correlation analysis all the observed traits were subjected for correlation analysis fig 3

correlation with harvest index and dry biomass fig 3a the potassium showed strongly positive correlation with chloride the leaf nitrogen exhibited positive correlation with leaf carbon nitrogen isotopes and grain protein contents the leaf carbon was also positively correlated with nitrogen isotopes and grain protein contents however carbon isotope showed significant negative correlation with carbon isotope discrimination and ci ca whereas it was positively correlated intrinsic water use efficiency the carbon isotope discrimination and ci ca showed negative correlation with intrinsic water use efficiency fig 3b 3 7 principal component analysis pca the pca analysis of the six barley genotypes subjected to two varying salinity levels was conducted fig 4 the pca biplot of the first two components pc1 and pc2 explained 95 variance for the morphological variables fig 4a the genotypes n2 4 and n2 35 lied in the positive quadrate with higher morphological growth of the barley in response to salinity stress whereas the genotypes 76 2 a and 62 3 a existed in the negative quadrate with the maximum reduction in morphological functioning additively it also suggested their sensitive to salinity stress fig 4a the pca biplot of the first two components pc1 and pc2 explained 79 9 variance for water use efficiency mineral contents and isotope signatures variables fig 4b the genotype badia exhibited higher accumulation of sodium contents carbon isotopes and higher intrinsic water use efficiency compared to other genotypes the n2 35 demonstrated higher leaf carbon and nitrogen nitrogen isotopes and higher protein contents the genotype furat1 lied near to center suggesting their moderate response to salinity whereas the genotypes 76 2 a and n2 4 grouped into negative quadrate suggesting sensitivity to the applied salinity stresses fig 4b 4 discussion salinity stress is the major abiotic stress factor that also triggers the impact of other abiotic stresses the uae region is arid with prevailing salt degraded sandy and marginal lands influencing the agriculture of the region additionally the available water is high in sodium contents and regions near the sea are prone to severe salinity higher salt aggravates the essential nutrient supply to the plants throughout their growth cycle resulting in devastating yield losses hussain et al 2018 2019 2020a b it is extremely necessary to screen out salt resilient genotypes to ensure future barley growth and yield additionally salt tolerance is a polygenic trait that is attributed to several physio biochemical functioning of the plants to cope with salinity as well as with secondary oxidative stress to protects the cellular machinery and maintain ionic homeostasis the soil biochemical analysis of the studied region showed that soil was sandy with no organic matter contents as shown in table 1 in the studied region salinity is a continuous problem and least number of studies has explored the potential of barley based on morpho physiological attributes and yield characteristics negrão et al 2017 shabala 2013 current study exhibited that all the yield attributes were negatively influenced with salinity treatment table 3 the genotype n2 35 exhibited better morphological growth that might be attributed to least disturbance in metabolism that resultantly showed higher growth characteristics compared to other genotypes table 3 the barley genotypes furat 1 produced higher number of tillers number of spikes and grains number spike 1 but resulted in lower grain yield this might be due to the bad performance of secondary tillers that did not contribute to the yield trait towards achieving a good yield it was reported that secondary tillers produced only 4 18 of the total grain yield haaning et al 2020 the findings of our study were supported by bagues et al 2021 in barley that higher accumulation of salts reduced the yield of plants it is most likely due to damage to photosynthetic apparatus antioxidant capacity and phytochemical profile of barley under salinity stress bagues et al 2021 the barley genotypic specific response might be due to genetic differences among the genotypes as they failed to cope with higher salinity level 14 ds m 1 resulted in lower yield attributes additionally salinity also aggravates moisture deficiency as plant roots failed to uptake water resulting in oxidative stress with higher accumulation of reactive oxygen species that causes damage to membranes and results in poor morphological growth and yield hussain et al 2018 the cultivated barley is moderately salt tolerant having capability to maintain leaf water potential with the accumulation of salt ions in leaf tissues thus enabled plant for maintaining cell turgor pressure by restricting transpiration rate with the acclimatization to 14 ds m 1 salinity mahmoud et al 2020 our results are also in accordance with earlier reports depicting the tolerance behavior of barley against salinity elsawy et al 2018 liu et al 2020 it is also attributed to different strategies adapted by sensitive and tolerant genotypes as sensitive plant manages na amount that reaches leaves contrarily tolerant one tends to accumulate in leaf vacuoles by using it as osmoticum for maintenance of cell turgor assaha et al 2017 the plant failing to sequester in vacuole build up in cytosol that exerts toxic impact on cellular metabolism resulting in cell death zhao et al 2020 all the barley genotypes showed distinctive response to salinity stress the grain yield is the most desired trait to categorize genotypes as sensitive and tolerant to salinity stress in this study the nursery genotypes showed highest grain yield and lowest was noticed in batini genotypes the number of spikes m 2 in the saline water treatment varied among the genotypes and highest number was obtained in genotypes n2 35 followed by genotypes furat1 n2 4 badia 62 3 a and 76 2 a the saline water treatment resulted in decline in all the genotypes at higher water salinity 14 ds m 1 the decreased in number of spikes might be due to over production of ros species damaging photosynthetic apparatus and disturbances in ionic homeostasis failed to supply essential nutrients gökçe et al 2022 panuccio et al 2022 the ratio of ambient co2 was significantly reduced after both salinity treatments that suggested stomatal closure table 7 the closing of stomata restricts the supply of co2 to carboxylation sites with decreased activity of rubisco ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase synthesis of carbon translocation and storage yousfi et al 2009 farquhar et al 2007 earlier studies also reported that stomatal closure in response salinity stress resulted in declined plant growth through decreased carbon assimilation hussain et al 2020 the carbon isotope discrimination quantifies stomatal control to limit carbon dioxide concentration and explain photosynthetic carbon of c3 plants farquhar and richards 1984 the δ13c and ci ca was higher in n2 4 and 62 3 a and lowest in badia table 7 the change in intracellular co2 is positively correlated under salinity suggesting that stomatal conductance is the key attribute to limit photosynthesis and maintains water contents netondo et al 2004 the balance between carbon and nitrogen is imperative to maximize crop response under stress conditions aranjuelo et al 2013 therefore current study also revealed the partitioning of carbon and nitrogen in barley genotypes table 5 the genetic variation noticed in different barley genotypes regarding δ13c was due to differences in photosynthetic capacity supported by earlier study vasilakoglou et al 2021 the genotype 62 3 a exhibited higher δ13c that also showed higher leaf c and grain protein it decreased abruptly in response to salinity stress in sensitive genotypes th findings of our study are also reinforced by the results of earlier study reported by mustafa et al 2019 the barley genotype n2 4 exhibited higher c n ratio and lower in 76 2 a that suggested decreased uptake in this genotype it is well reported that this concentration can vary among different genotypes as we reported in our earlier study on quinoa hussain et al 2018 the c n ratio in plant is also influenced by nitrogen concentration availability access of root to nitrogen pool in soil and barley genotypes klem et al 2022 least studies have reported the carbon isotope composition δ13c and nitrogen isotope composition δ15n genotypic variation in barley in response to salinity the differential δ15n is an important indicator of screening genotypes because it is related with nitrogen metabolism in plant current study showed higher δ15n in genotypes n2 35 and n2 4 whereas lowest was in 62 3 a and 76 2 a genotypes table 7 it might be due to different mechanisms of nitrogen uptake that can differentiate δ15n hussain et al 2018 hussain and reigosa 2014 the barley genotypes showed salinity induced mineral disturbances in plants it was noticed that leaves accumulated elevated levels of na with the acclimatization to higher salinity level 14 ds m 1 although barley is salt tolerant but 14 ds m 1 of salt stress exposure resulted in ionic disturbances table 4 results of our study are consistent with earlier reports that higher na in soil solution favors its uptake and suppress the uptake of k to the upper parts of barley zeeshan et al 2020 akhter et al 2021 additionally both ions have antagonistic effect in root zone that subsequently leads to k deficiency resulting in reduction of yield attributes xie et al 2021 therefore current study exhibited that all the genotypes accumulated higher na levels that was attributed to decreased availability of k however k was higher in badia and n2 4 genotypes that might be attributed to its tolerance nature table 5 it was also corroborated from the results of earlier studies that tolerant genotypes have potential to accumulate higher k over na ishikawa and shabala 2019 the compartmentation of toxic na ions in vacuoles is an imperative strategy to limit excessive na in leaf and protects cytosol from toxic elements dell aversana et al 2021 contrarily the genotype 62 3 a failed to uptake higher k that might be due to difference in genetic makeup of the tested genotypes to cope with salinity it is crucial to understand the tolerance mechanisms related with the uptake of toxic elements such as na and cl ions that was noticed in furat1 table 5 interestingly it also accumulated k contents contrary to 62 3 a and 76 2 a genotypes the mineral elements are decisive factor depicting the severity of salinity stress the pca results also showed that 62 3 a and 76 2 a genotypes showed sensitivity to the applied stress fig 4 it is reported in earlier studies that sensitivity is attributed to failure to avoid ionic toxicity osmotic adjustment that leads to oxidative burst with higher production of ros species hussain et al 2016 chaudhry et al 2021 it is also well reported that deficiency of essential nutrients due to reduction in uptake under salinity stress negatively impairs the vegetative growth resulting in yield losses hussain et al 2016 munns et al 2006 the n2 35 genotype resulted in higher grain yield with less na accumulation which suggested that although it accumulated na but it had no effect on the grain yield table 7 the barley varieties nurseries and landraces showed higher mean grain yield across the treatments mi table 8 all the barley varieties and landraces revealed diverse scores for s 2 and w 2 indices the results from stability analysis indicate that the lowest values demonstrate the stability in yield over saline environments the genotype n2 35 was static stable and high yielding ranking 1st for s 2i grain yield index 5 conclusions current study revealed wide ranging genetic diversity in barley genotypes under varying salt stress treatments it was due to large variations among climatic and seasonal characteristics history of cultivation and selection pressure all the barley genotypes responded differentially to the applied salt stress levels however the barley genotypes n2 35 and n2 4 showed higher grain yield and these genotypes can be grown with saline water on marginal lands additionally stable c and n isotope ratios exhibited disseminative physiological processes of the tested barley genotypes along with their interactions to the exposed salinity environment the n2 35 genotype was the most stable to the saline environment most studies

the uae falls in the arid region that is more prone to these environmental hazards it is also facing water scarcity where water resource per capita was 1250 m3 in 1950 and it declined to 76 2 m3 in 2014 the world bank 2017 therefore the water available to support agriculture is saline that is degrading the land and negatively influencing the yield and quality of the crops it is need of the hour to screen out adapt resilient crop for this region by considering the aforementioned stress scenario hussain et al 2016 2018 barley is a valuable grain crop which ranked 4th among the cereal crops faostat 2020 it is generally consumed as food and fodder pour aboughadareh et al 2021 barley exhibits moderate tolerance to salinity however it s morpho physiological and yield attributes have been least studied on degraded marginal lands therefore cultivation of salt tolerant barley genotype has been proposed as an alternative option to retain its yield in hyper arid and saline regions such as dubai united arab emirates in barley extensive genetic diversity exists that provides ease to screen genotypes under marginal growth conditions in contrast it is also essential to expose them to varying salinity levels for the evaluation of their growth yield performance and physiological attributes this kind of study is very important to develop efficient breeding programs and tool kits of salt tolerant crop genotypes and to undertake the growth physiological and yield traits under field conditions el hendawy et al 2005 hussain et al 2017 photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination δ13c provides measurement of plant s transpiration efficiency such as carbon in leaf to water transpired over the period during which dry matter is assimilated hussain et al 2018 the quantification of eco physiological traits intracellular co2 intrinsic water use efficiency carbon and nitrogen isotope composition are good indicator for the grouping of barley genotypes as sensitive and tolerant hussain et al 2015 2017 moreover it is also helpful for estimating the relation of long term nutrient and water use efficiency yousfi et al 2012 soil salinity disturbs in gaseous exchange traits limiting stomatal conductance resulting in declined inter co2 concentration that restricts photosynthesis damages to photosynthetic pigments and excessive production of reactive oxygen species chaudhry et al 2020 however stomatal closure can improve water use efficiency carbon isotope discrimination δ13c has negative relationship with transpiration rate that is simple and reliable indicator of water use efficiency under salinity stress yousfi et al 2009 the plant n isotope composition δ15n has also been proposed as potent indicator for screening of nitrogen metabolism in plant that broaden the horizons of nitrogen pathways fluxes and allocations evans 2001 several studies have revealed that it can increase or decrease under salinity stress hussain et al 2018 yousfi et al 2009 the isotope discrimination and salinity tolerance are associated as halophytes and non halophyte plants exhibits differential response patterns in δ13c additionally the δ13c increases with higher salinity when closure of stomata is main factor limiting the photosynthesis wei et al 2008 salinity stress also disturbs the ionic homeostasis favoring the uptake of sodium and restricting the absorption of essential nutrients which subsequently results in poor quality grain there is urgent need to identify genotypes that have potential to accumulate essential mineral ions under salinity conditions currently low yield is also mainly attributed to restricted nutrients supply to the barley but it can be changed with the introduction of novel high yielding salt tolerant barley genotypes additionally it will help for the conservation of freshwater resources that will be economically beneficial for sustainable agriculture on salt degraded marginal lands munns and tester 2008 hussain et al 2016 2019 current study was hypothesized to quantify the performance of contrasting barley genotypes to varying salinity levels 7 and 14 ds m 1 this study will help in unfolding of the physiological mechanisms under hypersaline environment additionally stable genotypes can be included in future breeding program to ensure food security 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site

genotypes in each assessment act independently to the above mentioned attributes the environmental data temperature humidity and evapotranspiration during the study period 2013 14 has been shown in fig 1 3 1 impact of salinity treatments and genotypes on growth attributes salt stress resulted in reduction of morphological growth of all the genotypes tested in this study the significant reduction in plant biomass was noticed after exposure to 7 and 14 ds m 1 salt stress the higher salinity treatment 14 ds m 1 resulted in devastating reduction in barley yield traits additionally salt treatments

of interaction between genotypes salinity levels only non significant difference was noticed in k na ratio table 4 the individual response of the tested barley genotypes to mineral contents accumulation is shown in table 5 the highest k was noticed from badia 660 6 mg 100 g 1 genotype whereas the 62 3 a genotype failed to accumulate k and resulted in lowest 578 2 mg 100 g 1 in response

other table 5 3 3 salinity impact on seed yield water use efficiency carbon and nitrogen isotope signature increased salinity level resulted in maximum decrease in grain yield the lowest grain yield 2

also resulted in higher harvest index 38 4 the lowest hi was exhibited by genotypes furat1 20 3 and 62 3 a 20 3 table 7 the ambient co2 concentration ci ca was significantly p 0 001 different among tested barley genotypes whereas it showed non significant differences to treatment and interaction treatment genotype table 6 the maximum value of ci ca was quantified in genotypes furat1 n2 4 76 2 a and 62 3 a while lowest ci ca was obtained in genotype badia 0 51 table 7 the intrinsic water use efficiency iwue increased significantly following salinity treatment of 7 ds m 1 109 4 and it decreased significantly after exposure to 14 ds m 1 salinity 99 9 table 6 the badia genotype 121 4 showed higher iwue compared to all genotypes contrarily the genotypes n2 4 96 9 and 62 3 a 96 8 exhibited maximum reduction in iwue table 7 the carbon isotope discrimination δ13c and δ13c values showed only significant differences among genotypes table 6 the δ13c was higher in 62 3 a n2 4 and furat1 genotypes the δ13c for genotypic variability showed higher values 25 in 62 3 a 76 2 a n2 35 n2 4 and furat1 genotypes whereas only badia genotype showed differential response compared to other five genotypes with lower δ13c value 23 6 table 7 the δ15n trait increased following salinity treatment table 6 genotypes n2 35 and n2 4 showed highest δ15n while 62 3 a and 76 2 a exhibit lowest values for δ15n table 7 3 4 grain protein contents the grain protein contents gp showed significant p 0 05 differential response to both salinity levels it increased under both stress conditions and in all genotypes compared to the control group barley plants all the tested genotypes exhibited different protein accumulation in barley grains fig 2 higher gp contents were obtained from 62 3 a and

demonstrated by furat1 genotype that gp increased to 18 6 mg g 1 dw surpassing all other genotypes under 7 ds m 1 salinity but under higher salinity 14 ds m 1 it showed 14 reduction fig 2 3 5 elucidation of stability in yield of barley genotypes barley genotypes varied greatly for mean grain yield across the treatments mi table 8 the barley genotypes exhibited very different scores for both static environmental variance s 2 and dynamic wricke s ecovalence w 2 the static environment variance for grain yield among all the 6 genotypes ranged from 0 337 to 1 693 while wricke s ecovalence varied from 0 014 to 1 313 in this stability analysis the lowest values demonstrate the stability in yield over saline environments the variety n2 35 was static stable and high yielding ranking 1st for s 2i grain yield index across all saline environments the barley 62 3 a and n2 4 were found to produce the 2nd and 3rd highest static yield index across all treatments the genotypes n2 35 and 62 3 a showed stable mean yield w 2i among all the genotypes across all environments table 8 3 6 correlation analysis all the observed traits were subjected for correlation analysis fig 3 pearson correlation coefficient showed significant positive correlations of number spikes with grain number per spikes and grain numbers per plant the grain yield also showed significantly positive correlation with harvest index and dry biomass fig 3a the potassium showed strongly positive correlation with chloride the leaf nitrogen exhibited positive correlation with leaf carbon nitrogen isotopes and grain protein contents the leaf carbon was also positively correlated with nitrogen isotopes and grain protein contents however carbon isotope showed significant negative correlation with carbon isotope discrimination and ci ca whereas it was positively correlated intrinsic water use efficiency the carbon isotope discrimination and ci ca showed negative correlation with intrinsic water use efficiency fig 3b 3 7 principal component analysis pca the pca analysis of the six barley genotypes subjected to two varying salinity levels was conducted fig 4 the pca biplot of the first two components pc1 and pc2 explained 95 variance for the morphological variables fig 4a the genotypes n2 4 and n2 35 lied in the positive quadrate with higher morphological growth of the barley in response to salinity stress whereas the genotypes 76 2 a and 62 3 a existed in the negative quadrate with the maximum reduction in morphological functioning additively it also suggested their sensitive to salinity stress fig 4a the pca biplot of the first two components pc1 and pc2 explained 79 9 variance for water use efficiency mineral contents and isotope signatures variables fig 4b the genotype badia exhibited higher accumulation of sodium contents carbon isotopes and higher intrinsic water use efficiency compared to other genotypes the n2 35 demonstrated higher leaf carbon and nitrogen nitrogen isotopes and higher protein contents the genotype furat1 lied near to center suggesting their moderate response to salinity whereas the genotypes 76 2 a and n2 4 grouped into negative quadrate suggesting sensitivity to the applied salinity stresses fig 4b 4 discussion salinity stress is the major abiotic stress factor that also triggers the impact of other abiotic stresses the uae region is arid with prevailing salt degraded sandy and marginal lands influencing the agriculture of the region additionally the available water is high in sodium contents and regions near the sea are prone to severe salinity higher salt aggravates the essential nutrient supply to the plants throughout their growth cycle resulting in devastating yield losses hussain et al 2018 2019 2020a b it is extremely necessary to screen out salt resilient genotypes to ensure future barley growth and yield additionally salt tolerance is a polygenic trait that is attributed to several physio biochemical functioning of the plants to cope with salinity as well as with secondary oxidative stress to protects the cellular machinery and maintain ionic homeostasis the soil biochemical analysis of the studied region showed that soil was sandy with no organic matter contents as shown in table 1 in the studied region salinity is a continuous problem and least number of studies has explored the potential of barley based on morpho physiological attributes and yield characteristics negrão et al 2017 shabala 2013 current study exhibited that all the yield attributes were negatively influenced with salinity treatment table 3 the genotype n2 35 exhibited better morphological growth that might be attributed to least disturbance in metabolism that resultantly showed higher growth characteristics compared to other genotypes table 3 the barley genotypes furat 1 produced higher number of tillers number of spikes and grains number spike 1 but resulted in lower grain yield this might be due to the bad performance of secondary tillers that did not contribute to the yield trait towards achieving a good yield it was reported that secondary tillers produced only 4 18 of the total grain yield haaning et al 2020 the findings of our study were supported by bagues et al 2021 in barley that higher accumulation of salts reduced the yield of plants it is most likely due to damage to photosynthetic apparatus antioxidant capacity and phytochemical profile of barley under salinity stress bagues et al 2021 the barley genotypic specific response might be due to genetic differences among the genotypes as they failed to cope with higher salinity level 14 ds m 1 resulted in lower yield attributes additionally salinity also aggravates moisture deficiency as plant roots failed to uptake water resulting in oxidative stress with higher accumulation of reactive oxygen species that causes damage to membranes and results in poor morphological growth and yield hussain et al 2018 the cultivated barley is moderately salt tolerant having capability to maintain leaf water potential with the accumulation of salt ions in leaf tissues thus enabled plant for maintaining cell turgor pressure by restricting transpiration rate with the acclimatization to 14 ds m 1 salinity mahmoud et al 2020 our results are also in accordance with earlier reports depicting the tolerance behavior of barley against salinity elsawy et al 2018 liu et al 2020 it is also attributed to different strategies adapted by sensitive and tolerant genotypes as sensitive plant manages na amount that reaches leaves contrarily tolerant one tends to accumulate in leaf vacuoles by using it as osmoticum for maintenance of cell turgor assaha et al 2017 the plant failing to sequester in vacuole build up in cytosol that exerts toxic impact on cellular metabolism resulting in cell death zhao et al 2020 all the barley genotypes showed distinctive response to salinity stress the grain yield is the most desired trait to categorize genotypes as sensitive and tolerant to salinity stress in this study the nursery genotypes showed highest grain yield and lowest was noticed in batini genotypes the number of spikes m 2 in the saline water treatment varied among the genotypes and highest number was obtained in genotypes n2 35 followed by genotypes furat1 n2 4 badia 62 3 a and 76 2 a the saline water treatment resulted in decline in all the genotypes at higher water salinity 14 ds m 1 the decreased in number of spikes might be due to over production of ros species damaging photosynthetic apparatus and disturbances in ionic homeostasis failed to supply essential nutrients gökçe et al 2022 panuccio et al 2022 the ratio of ambient co2 was significantly reduced after both salinity treatments that suggested stomatal closure table 7 the closing of stomata restricts the supply of co2 to carboxylation sites with decreased activity of rubisco ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase synthesis of carbon translocation and storage yousfi et al 2009 farquhar et al 2007 earlier studies also reported that stomatal closure in response salinity stress resulted in declined plant growth through decreased carbon assimilation hussain et al 2020 the carbon isotope discrimination quantifies stomatal control to limit carbon dioxide concentration and explain photosynthetic carbon of c3 plants farquhar and richards 1984 the δ13c and ci ca was higher in n2 4 and 62 3 a and lowest in badia table 7 the change in intracellular co2 is positively correlated under salinity suggesting that stomatal conductance is the key attribute to limit photosynthesis and maintains water contents netondo et al 2004 the balance between carbon and nitrogen is imperative to maximize crop response under stress conditions aranjuelo et al 2013 therefore current study also revealed the partitioning of carbon and nitrogen in barley genotypes table 5 the genetic variation noticed in different barley genotypes regarding δ13c was due to differences in photosynthetic capacity supported by earlier study vasilakoglou et al 2021 the genotype 62 3 a exhibited higher δ13c that also showed higher leaf c and grain protein it decreased abruptly in response to salinity stress in sensitive genotypes th findings of our study are also reinforced by the results of earlier study reported by mustafa et al 2019 the barley genotype n2 4 exhibited higher c n ratio and lower in 76 2 a that suggested decreased uptake in this genotype it is well reported that this concentration can vary among different genotypes as we reported in our earlier study on quinoa hussain et al 2018 the c n ratio in plant is also influenced by nitrogen concentration availability access of root to nitrogen pool in soil and barley genotypes klem et al 2022 least studies have reported the carbon isotope composition δ13c and nitrogen isotope composition δ15n genotypic variation in barley in response to salinity the differential δ15n is an important indicator of screening genotypes because it is related with nitrogen metabolism in plant current study showed higher δ15n in genotypes n2 35 and n2 4 whereas lowest was in 62 3 a and 76 2 a genotypes table 7 it might be due to different mechanisms of nitrogen uptake that can differentiate δ15n hussain et al 2018 hussain and reigosa 2014 the barley genotypes showed salinity induced mineral disturbances in plants it was noticed that leaves accumulated elevated levels of na with the acclimatization to higher salinity level 14 ds m 1 although barley is salt tolerant but 14 ds m 1 of salt stress exposure resulted in ionic disturbances table 4 results of our study are consistent with earlier reports that higher na in soil solution favors its uptake and suppress the uptake of k to the upper parts of barley zeeshan et al 2020 akhter et al 2021 additionally both ions have antagonistic effect in root zone that subsequently leads to k deficiency resulting in reduction of yield attributes xie et al 2021 therefore current study exhibited that all the genotypes accumulated higher na levels that was attributed to decreased availability of k however k was higher in badia and n2 4 genotypes that might be attributed to its tolerance nature table 5 it was also corroborated from the results of earlier studies that tolerant genotypes have potential to accumulate higher k over na ishikawa and shabala 2019 the compartmentation of toxic na ions in vacuoles is an imperative strategy to limit excessive na in leaf and protects cytosol from toxic elements dell aversana et al 2021 contrarily the genotype 62 3 a failed to uptake higher k that might be due to difference in genetic makeup of the tested genotypes to cope with salinity it is crucial to understand the tolerance mechanisms related with the uptake of toxic elements such as na and cl ions that was noticed in furat1 table 5 interestingly it also accumulated k contents contrary to 62 3 a and 76 2 a genotypes the mineral elements are decisive factor depicting the severity of salinity stress the pca results also showed that 62 3 a and 76 2 a genotypes showed sensitivity to the applied stress fig 4 it is reported in earlier studies that sensitivity is attributed to failure to avoid ionic toxicity osmotic adjustment that leads to oxidative burst with higher production of ros species hussain et al 2016 chaudhry et al 2021 it is also well reported that deficiency of essential nutrients due to reduction in uptake under salinity stress negatively impairs the vegetative growth resulting in yield losses hussain et al 2016 munns et al 2006 the n2 35 genotype resulted in higher grain yield with less na accumulation which suggested that although it accumulated na but it had no effect on the grain yield table 7 the barley varieties nurseries and landraces showed higher mean grain yield across the treatments mi table 8 all the barley varieties and landraces revealed diverse scores for s 2 and w 2 indices the results from stability analysis indicate that the lowest values demonstrate the stability in yield over saline environments the genotype n2 35 was static stable and high yielding ranking 1st for s 2i grain yield index 5 conclusions current study revealed wide ranging genetic diversity in barley genotypes under varying salt stress treatments it was due to large variations among climatic and seasonal characteristics history of cultivation and selection pressure all the barley genotypes responded differentially to the applied salt stress levels however the barley genotypes n2 35 and n2 4 showed higher grain yield and these genotypes can be grown with saline water on marginal lands additionally stable c and n isotope ratios exhibited disseminative physiological processes of the tested barley genotypes along with their interactions to the exposed salinity environment the n2 35 genotype was the most stable to the saline environment most studies focused on the growth and yield reduction attributes but current also reported the change in grain protein contents in response to salinity funding information authors gratefully acknowledge the

9336,irrigation has traditionally been managed as uniform applications where an entire field receives the same depth of water motivation to improve current irrigation practices has led to different approaches utilizing remotely sensed images to inform variable rate irrigation management this study conducted in 2019 and 2020 implemented the spatial evapotranspiration modeling interface setmi a remote sensing based evapotranspiration et and water balance model for managing variable rate irrigation of a maize and soybean field this model tracked soil water content through the estimation of daily et and tracking of various water fluxes entering and leaving a field setmi was used in two different irrigation treatments informed using planet satellite setmi sat and unmanned aerial system uas setmi uas remotely sensed images a uniform irrigation approach managed by a professional crop consultant and a non irrigated approach were used as the baseline in comparing irrigation management approaches the irrigation treatments were evaluated on dry grain yield gross irrigation actual et deep percolation change in soil water content and water productivity the uniform irrigation approach managed by the crop consultant applied the highest irrigation in 2019 and 2020 for maize 2019 155 mm 2020 213 mm and soybean 2019 124 mm 2020 183 mm while the setmi irrigation treatments applied less

the highest soybean yield was produced by the setmi sat irrigation management approach in 2019 5 0 mg ha 1 and 2020 4 8 mg ha 1 significant differences p value 0 05 in applied irrigation between the uniform and setmi irrigation management approaches were observed while there were no significant differences in dry grain yield for both maize and soybean in 2019 and 2020 at least one of the setmi irrigation treatments produced higher crop irrigation and et water productivity values in comparison to those produced by the uniform irrigation treatment for all crop years a post season analysis was completed using the setmi uas and setmi sat treatments to evaluate the accuracy of estimated rootzone soil water depletion provided by setmi rootzone depletion calculated from neutron probe volumetric soil water content measurements were compared to the modeled depletion from the setmi uas and setmi sat treatments the 2020 modeled and measured depletion comparison produced better agreement resulting in a root mean squared error rmse 17 mm compared to 2019 rmse 27 mm the vri center pivot malfunctioned during the 2019 season which caused unresolved discrepancies between actually applied

unmanned aerial system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction variable rate irrigation vri provides a means to apply varying amounts of water within a field giving producers the potential to improve water productivity and better manage water resources approaches for managing vri have utilized remotely sensed images to inform remote sensing based

as a decision support system dss while there is no standard practice for managing vri systems today numerous approaches have been explored various sources of information have proven beneficial in vri management potentially most notable is the variability in soil type within a field as evans et al 2013 discussed that a thirty percent difference in applied water could be observed solely based on soil type others have been successful at managing vri using various sensors sensor networks and models kim et al 2008 discussed the conversion of a conventional irrigation system into a site specific irrigation system using a wireless soil sensing network and wireless in field sensing and control software several others have explored using infrared thermometers irt to monitor crop canopy

infrared images proven to be beneficial in agriculture leading to the development of models that quantify aspects related to crop growth et and water management a widely used purpose of remotely

approach has been used to inform irrigation management as it can provide a more realistic estimation of crop et with varying field conditions bausch and neale 1987 neale et al 1989 huete 1988 singh and irmak 2009 a second approach utilizing remotely sensed data for estimating et are energy balance models that estimate the surface energy balance fluxes by partitioning the total energy received at the earth s surface into its respective components of net radiation and sensible latent and soil heat flux the two source energy balance tseb model proposed by norman et al 1995 computes the surface energy balance components for soil and vegetation separately requiring radiometric surface temperature observations to inform the model furthermore neale et al 2006 2012 developed a hybrid modeling approach that combined the tseb model and water balance wb model updated with kcbrf which helped maintain the soil water balance throughout the growing season this hybrid model known as the spatial evapotranspiration model interface setmi geli and neale 2012 is unique in that the assimilation of the tseb estimated et into the wb model can provide corrections to the soil water balance the setmi model has been used in recent studies for managing vri barker et al 2018a and bhatti et al 2020 used the setmi hybrid approach with landsat satellite multispectral and thermal images for determining vri timing and depths bhatti et al 2020 also used the setmi wb approach informed with uas multispectral images but the study lacked uas thermal images required to run the hybrid model while these studies utilized the hybrid model using satellite images the hybrid model has not been evaluated when informed with uas acquired multispectral and thermal images with the setmi hybrid approach providing adjustments to the wb model based on the tseb estimated et these recent studies may not have fully utilized setmi s capabilities due to the low spatiotemporal resolution of satellite images the landsat thermal band has a spatial resolution of 100 m while uas acquired thermal images can have spatial resolutions of less than 1 m the high spatial resolution of uas thermal images may allow for better estimations of spatial et providing insight into the spatial variably of soil water depletion and crop water requirements the additional benefit of uas remote sensing is the flexibility in image acquisition timing landsat 7 and 8 satellites have a revisit interval of sixteen days with an eight day offset between the two satellites meaning landsat images are collected over a given area every eight days if weather permits poor weather conditions may result in missed satellite images which can be problematic during critical crop growth stages the flexibility of uas remote sensing can provide more regularly timed remotely sensed images to better inform models like setmi the development of a dss for spatial irrigation management has involved the exploration of several management approaches utilizing the fao 56 wb approach allen et al 1998 the kcbrf methodology and energy balance models the setmi model encompasses all three of these components giving it the potential to be versatile the recent progress in uas remote sensing presents an opportunity to assess the setmi hybrid approach in ways not previously feasible this study evaluated two spatial irrigation management approaches with respect to uniform irrigation the objective was to determine if the spatial irrigation management approaches could significantly reduce irrigation application without significantly reducing yield the irrigation management field study analysis included an assessment of gross irrigation dry grain yield and seasonal actual et deep percolation and change in soil water content to determine the overall effects of each irrigation management approach irrigation crop and evapotranspiration water productivity were also assessed for each irrigation management approach a post season analysis was completed using the setmi model to evaluate the differences in modeled and measured rootzone soil water depletion 2 materials and methods 2 1 research site this study was conducted at a 53 ha irrigated field site located at the eastern nebraska research and extension center near mead ne the field was equipped with a model 8500 zimmatic variable rate center pivot with individual nozzle control and sprinklers mounted on top of the pivot lateral a catch can test was completed before each season to assess application uniformity of the center pivot a christiansen s uniformity coefficient of 89 and 94 were observed in 2019 and 2020 respectively christiansen 1942 during the 2019 irrigation season control nodes on the vri center pivot malfunctioned leading to discrepancies between programmed and actually applied irrigation depths this issue likely affected the scheduling of irrigations in 2019 and the lack of as applied irrigation data from the vri system did not allow for compensation of incorrectly applied irrigation in irrigated treatments the malfunctioning control nodes were replaced before the 2020 irrigation season the field site was split into north and south halves with maize and soybean planted in annual rotation with maize and soybean planted in the north and south halves respectively in 2019 field soil types were silty clay loam and silt loam soil survey staff 2016 the field was managed as no till with anhydrous ammonia injections prior to all maize plantings the research field was further divided into 36 6 m by 60 1 m plots with 48 and 24 plots in the north and south halves respectively barker et al 2016 each plot contained an aluminum neutron probe np access tube located near the plot s geometric center for collecting np volumetric soil water content measurements field soil properties of observational field capacity fc and wilting point wp were computed for each plot using np volumetric water content measurements and soil samples near the np access tubes barker et al 2018a plot fc values were computed using depth weighted averages of in situ fc values at each np access tube with fc values updated in 2018 bhatti et al 2020 wp was measured using soil samples and a model wp4 t dewpoint potentiameter decagon devices inc pullman wa 2 2 setmi model formulation the setmi hybrid model included the tseb and kcbrf updated wb models the wb model followed the fao 56 approach allen et al 1998 with some deviations discussed in detail by barker et al 2018a the wb model within setmi accounted for daily crop et precipitation net irrigation inet surface runoff ro and deep percolation dp and solved a daily spatial soil water balance that provided daily rootzone soil water depletion dr and irrigation requirements the surface ro was determine using the usda natural resources conservation service runoff equation and a curve number of 0 75 usda 2004 the wb daily crop et was estimated using the dual crop coefficient method allen et al 1998 1 et k cb k s k e et r where kcb is the basal crop coefficient ks is the water stress coefficient ke is the soil evaporation coefficient and etr is the alfalfa based reference et ke was reduced by twenty five percent during the study following barker et al 2018a setmi uses the reflectance based crop coefficient kcbrf approach to estimate the basil crop coefficient used in eq 1 for estimating crop et in the kcbrf approach the soil adjusted vegetation index savi eq 2 huete 1988 calculated using multispectral reflectance images was related to the crop coefficient using the approach described by campos et al 2017 this method uses cumulative growing degree days cgdd and calculated savi to determine the slopes and intercepts used in a regression summation formula from which daily savi values are modeled eq 3 this method includes a two stage process to represent the vegetative 2 savi nir red nir red 0 5 1 5 3 savi j min exp a 1 cgdd j b 1 savi max exp exp a 2 cgdd j b 2 growth and senescence stages of the crop where savij is the current day modeled savi savimax is the maximum savi or peak seasonal savi value cgddj is the cumulative gdds for the current day a and b are linear regression coefficients and the subscripts 1 and 2 represent the vegetative growth and senescence stages respectively the calculation of regression coefficients a and b is discussed in campos et al 2017 using this method and the remotely sensed multispectral reflectance images savi was estimated daily over the entire growing season after estimating daily savi values using eq 3 a linear model relating savi to the basil crop coefficient savi to kcbrf for maize eq 4 and soybean eq 5 were used to derive seasonal basil crop coefficient curves campos et al 2017 using this method the modeled daily kcbrf values were used in eq 1 to estimated daily crop et 4 k cbrf maize 1 414 savi 0 02 5 k cbrf soybean 1 258 savi 0 006 setmi s second approach for estimating et uses the tseb model to estimate the surface energy balance components of net radiation rn latent le sensible h and soil heat g flux norman et al 1995 this model requires radiometric surface temperature and reflectance measurements and solves for the instantaneous latent heat flux which is scaled to daily et using instantaneous and daily etr following the method proposed by chavez et al 2008 the hybrid approach of setmi uses estimated et from the tseb ettseb and wb etwb models in a statistical weighting function 6 et hybrid et wb w et tseb et wb where ethybrid is modeled et after assimilation of the ettseb and etwb the w in eq 6 is the kalman gain and was set to a value of 0 6 barker et al 2018b when using the hybrid approach the wb model is updated by back calculating for a dr that reproduces the ks necessary to compute ethybrid which provides a mechanism to correct for soil water balance drift the hybrid model determines if dr should be adjusted through the comparison of ettseb and etwb and the value of ks if ettseb etwb and ks 1 no dr adjustments are performed and the ethybrid is used as the daily et in the wb model if ettseb etwb or ks 1 the hybrid model adjusts ks to satisfy eq 1 with ethybrid substituted for et eq 7 7 k s et hybrid et r k e k cb after back calculating ks the previous day dr drlast is calculated using 8 d rlast taw k s taw raw where taw and raw are total available and readily available water respectively taw was determined based on the difference of soil fc and wp and raw was determined based on a threshold p of when water stress begins calculated using raw p taw the p value used in calculating raw is crop specific and can vary depending on evaporative rate allen et al 1998 this setmi hybrid approach is used when thermal infrared images are available setmi offers the functionality to run a wb model without estimated ettseb where daily estimated et is solely calculated from the dual crop coefficient method updated with kcbrf a detailed setmi user manual was presented in the appendix of barker 2017 2 3 reflectance based crop coefficient analysis the campos et al 2017 approach for modeling kcbrf was developed using landsat 5 and landsat 7 satellite reflectance images this study included uas and planet satellite reflectance images to model daily kcbrf within setmi for estimating daily crop et this presented the need to evaluate the differences in modeled kcbrf based on the different sources of reflectance images as each source contained a different spatiotemporal resolution maize and soybean daily savi and kcbrf were modeled using landsat uas and planet reflectance images in 2020 at the irrigated field site following the campos et al 2017 approach the reflectance images from each image source were used to calculate savi on days with images daily savi values were then modeled using the campos et al 2017 approach the calculated and modeled savi were compared on days with available images to assess the difference between calculated and modeled savi between the three image sources after modeling daily savi kcbrf was modeled for maize and soybean for each image source the daily kcbrf modeled using uas and planet satellite images was compared to the daily kcbrf modeled using landsat satellite images the reflectance images used in this analysis consisted of seven landsat 7 and 8 sixteen uas and eighteen planet satellite images the three image sources had different spatial resolutions where landsat had the lowest spatial resolution at 30 m the uas and planet images were resampled to a 30 m spatial resolution and aligned to the landsat spatial grid reflectance data on a given date from each image source was averaged from five locations in both maize and soybean separately 2 4 irrigation management the irrigation management field study included four different irrigation management treatments with two treatments utilizing vri one uniform irrigation treatment and a rainfed treatment that did not receive irrigation the uniform irrigation treatment was managed by a professional crop consultant and farm manager which was to represent the logic put forth by a typical producer who may use different means of determining when to irrigate the crop consultant provided weekly assessments of field conditions and irrigation recommendations through visual inspection of crops and soil probing irrigation recommendations from the crop consultant were applied uniformly to all uniform treatment plots the first vri management approach used the setmi model informed with planet satellite multispectral reflectance images setmi sat which did not use the hybrid functionality of setmi the setmi sat management approach used the kcbrf updated wb method for estimating daily et with the kcbrf curve modeled using the planet satellite reflectance images the second vri management approach used the setmi hybrid model informed with uas acquired multispectral reflectance and radiometric thermal images setmi uas this approach used the hybrid model where et was estimated using both the tseb and kcbrf updated wb approaches this approach included the assimilation of ettseb and etwb which allowed for soil water content corrections the setmi model required initialization of the start of growing season soil water content in 2019 the initialized soil water content was set to plot fc as there was sufficient precipitation before planting for soil water content to reach fc in 2020 the start of growing season soil water content was not at fc due to lack of precipitation and np volumetric soil water content measurements collected in each plot were used to initialize the start of growing season soil water content setmi also requires maximum crop root depth which is used in calculating the rootzone soil water depletion a maximum root depth of 1 2 m and 1 0 m were used for maize and soybean respectively the timing of irrigation events in the vri management approaches were based on an allowable soil water depletion threshold also known as management allowable depletion mad a mad of fifty percent was used for maize and soybean meaning that the soil water content could deplete to fifty percent of total crop available water before irrigation was required the center pivot required four days to apply a full irrigation 30 5 mm to the entire field while a fifty percent mad was used to determine the timing of irrigations a 30 5 mm depletion buffer was used to avoid the potential of water stress occurring during an ongoing irrigation this meant that an irrigation was required once rootzone soil water depletion reached mad 30 5 mm this irrigation management strategy maintained rootzone soil water depletion at a level above mad to avoid water stress and below fc to allow the soil the capacity to store water in future precipitation events limiting the potential for dp irrigation was applied on a plot level where individual plots received a uniform irrigation depth no more than 30 5 mm setmi provided spatial irrigation requirements at a 1 m spatial resolution the plots managed using setmi were irrigated to meet ninety percent of a plot s 1 m spatial irrigation requirements comparable to the concept of irrigation adequacy eisenhauer et al 2021 2 5 irrigation management experimental design the four treatments were randomly assigned to plots with twelve and six plots assigned to a single treatment in the north and south halves of the field respectfully fig 1 while previous studies at this site included blocking by soil available water capacity when determining treatment assignment this study did not include such feature since the benefits of blocking were small in previous irrigation studies at this site barker et al 2018a bhatti et al 2020 2 6 experimental data weather data required by the setmi model was obtained from the high plains regional climate center s agricultural weather data network s awdn mead agronomy farm weather station data collected by the awdn station and used in setmi modeling included air temperature wind speed incoming shortwave solar radiation actual vapor pressure atmospheric pressure maximum and minimum daily air temperatures and daily reference et during the 2019 season averaged precipitation from four tipping bucket rain gauges installed around the field were used for measuring precipitation and barometric pressure was obtained from the neb field 3 cosmic ray soil moisture observing system station located nearby zreda et al 2012 during the 2020 season precipitation and barometric pressure data collected by a realmfive weather station realmfive lincoln ne located near the field were used to inform setmi volumetric soil water content measurements were collected throughout the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons using two model 503 elite hydroprobe nps cpn concord ca where bhatti et al 2020 discussed the np calibration measurements were collected at each plot s np access tube at depths of 15 46 76 107 and 137 cm with dates of soil water content measurements listed in table 1 the soil water content measurements were used to provide corrections to the setmi uas and setmi sat treatments during the irrigation study with corrections applied once to maize and soybean in 2019 maize 8 19 2019 soybean 8 20 2019 twice to maize in 2020 7 31 2020 and 8 23 2020 and once to soybean in 2020 8 25 26 2020 the corrections were based on using the averaged difference between modeled and measured soil water content from three plots within each setmi treatment the averaged difference was then used to scale modeled soil water content in each plot within a treatment this method minimized the overall number of soil water content measurements used in corrections which more closely followed what is feasible for a typical producer the study acknowledges that the setmi water balance soil water content corrections likely affected modeling in a positive manner and future work should limit these types of corrections if the setmi approach is to be more widely adopted by producers for managing irrigation planet satellite images used to inform the setmi sat treatment were retrieved through the planet explorer online interface which provided surface reflectance images with atmospheric corrections in four spectral bands blue green red and near infrared at a spatial resolution of 3 m the planet satellite images used in the setmi model included twenty two images in 2019 starting 14 may and ending 2 september and thirty images in 2020 starting 5 may and ending 29 september uas remotely sensed images were collected with a dji matrice 600 with integrated micasense rededge multispectral and flir duo pro r thermal cameras at an altitude of 240 m above ground level which produced images with spatial resolutions of approximately 17 and 33 cm respectively maguire et al 2021 both cameras were mounted on a gimbal and positioned nadir to the ground surface when acquiring images uas images were collected on a near weekly basis and on clear sky days table 2 uas multispectral and thermal images were processed into ortho images using pix4d mapper pix4d prilly switzerland the uas multispectral ortho images were radiometrically calibrated into reflectance using reflectance panel images collected before and after image collection flights corrections were applied to the thermal ortho images to account for emissivity and atmospheric effects the modtran and linear calibration methods discussed in maguire et al 2021 were used in correcting thermal ortho images in 2019 and 2020 respectively the calibrated uas multispectral and thermal ortho images were resampled to a spatial resolution of 1 m before being used in the setmi model 2 7 analysis of treatment response variables irrigation treatment performance was assessed using the response variables of dry grain yield gross applied irrigation ig actual crop et eta change in soil water content δsw deep percolation dp irrigation water productivity iwp eq 9 et water productivity etwp eq 10 and crop water productivity cwp eq 11 evett et al 2020 djaman and irmak 2012 iwp etwp and cwp expressed as kg m 3 were calculated using 9 iwp y i y d i i 10 etwp y i y d et a i et a d 11 cwp y i et a where y is dry grain yield i is applied irrigation and et is actual et subscripts i d and a represent irrigated dryland non irrigated and actual conditions respectively dry grain yield was recorded during harvest with a yield monitor which provided spatial yield data yield maps were processed using the usda s yield editor 2 07 software sudduth et al 2012 field total dry grain yield was weighed and used to verify spatial yield data plot yield was computed by averaging the spatial yield data within a 12 2 m buffer inside of each plot seasonal plot eta was assessed on a time scale coinciding with the first and last np soil water content measurements table 1 seasonal plot eta used a measurement period water balance approach eta p ro dp inet δsw using direct measurements of irrigation precipitation and δsw the δsw was calculated using a depth weighted average of the first and last np soil water content measurements at all five depths ro was estimated using the usda natural resources conservation service runoff equation as discussed in section 2 2 dp was estimated using the np volumetric soil water content measurements and precipitation data the statistical analysis of response variables was analyzed as crop year combinations the mean standard deviation and unpaired t tests were calculated on dry grain yield ig eta δsw and dp to determine if statistically significant differences p value 0 05 were present between the response variables of each irrigation treatment 2 8 setmi modeled rootzone depletion analysis a separate analysis was competed on the setmi sat and setmi uas treatments to evaluate how well the model estimated rootzone soil water depletion in 2019 and 2020 the model was setup similar to the irrigation scheduling experiment with the np soil water content measurements used to initiate the model s start of season soil water content but did not include mid season soil water content corrections the np measurement depths extended down to 137 cm and the setmi model was ran using a 1 4 m soil profile allowing the crop root depth to extend to 1 4 m for both maize and soybean the 2019 uas thermal images were re calibrated using the linear calibration method discussed in maguire et al 2021 all applied irrigation from 2019 and 2020 were included in the model the setmi modeled rootzone depletion was compared to measured depletion where measured depletion was calculated using a depth weighted average of the np volumetric water content measurements and the modeled root depths from setmi 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water content measurements fig 2 shows the np volumetric soil water content measurements for each crop and treatment in 2019 and 2020 table 3 shows the starting and ending np volumetric soil water content measurements for the five measurement depths for irrigated and rainfed treatments all treatments experienced soil water depletion at the 137 cm measurement depth indicating root depth of both maize and soybean extended beyond the maximum root depth used in the setmi model maize 1 2 m soybean 1 0 m overall the rainfed treatments had higher soil water depletion at the 137 cm np measurement depth in comparison to the irrigated treatments highlighting the ability of maize and soybean to access water at deeper soil depths especially in rainfed conditions 3 2 irrigation management field study the response variables from each irrigation treatment were compared to determine if statistically significant p value 0 05 differences were present between treatments with treatment response variable means and standard deviations listed in table 4 the uniform irrigation approach consistently applied the most irrigation with significant differences in ig observed between the uniform and vri management approaches for each crop year combination the ig for the setmi uas and setmi sat treatments were not significantly different except for soybean in 2020 no significant differences were observed in yields between the vri and uniform irrigation treatments the seasonal eta was highest for the uniform irrigation treatment in all crop years with the seasonal eta of irrigated treatments significantly higher than the rainfed treatment significant differences in seasonal eta was observed between irrigated soybean treatments while no significant differences were observed between irrigated maize treatments the differences in δsw were most apparent between rainfed and irrigated treatments except for the irrigated soybean treatments in 2019 where differences in δsw were observed between irrigated treatments the δsw for the soybean treatments was significantly higher than the maize treatments in 2019 due to significant precipitation received prior to the last np measurements collected in the maize treatments the treatment dp was zero in most cases except for maize in 2019 the dp that occurred in the 2019 maize treatments is a result of high soil water content and high precipitation received shortly after the first np measurement date np measurements were collected on 5 31 2019 and the field received 55 mm of precipitation between 6 3 2019 and 6 5 2019 the dp in the maize plots was calculated using np measurements from 5 31 2019 the precipitation received shortly after the np measurements accounting for estimated ro and the estimated crop et between 5 31 2019 and 6 5 2019 overall the dp calculated for the 2019 maize treatments was small water productivity metrics were calculated using three methods cwp iwp and etwp each method was calculated using treatment averaged dry grain yield ig and seasonal eta table 5 the setmi irrigation treatments produce similar or higher cwp in all crop years compared to the uniform irrigation treatment the rainfed treatment produced the highest cwp in 2019 maize 3 57 kg m 3 and 2020 soybean 1 17 kg m 3 with the setmi uas and setmi sat treatments producing the highest cwp in 2019 soybean 1 46 kg m 3 and 2020 maize 2 94 kg m 3 respectively the setmi sat treatment produced the highest iwp three out of the four crop year combinations 2019 soybean 0 35 kg m 3 2020 maize 1 03 kg m 3 2020 soybean 0 35 kg m 3 with the setmi uas treatment producing the highest iwp in 2019 maize 0 50 kg m 3 the setmi uas treatment produced the highest etwp in 2019 soybean 2 04 kg m 3 and maize 0 66 kg m 3 with the setmi sat treatment producing the highest etwp in 2020 soybean 0 79 kg m 3 and maize 3 44 kg m 3 3 3 reflectance based crop coefficients daily savi and kcbrf were modeled for maize and soybean using three remote sensing image sources landsat uas and planet fig 3 the difference in modeled and calculated savi on days with remotely sensed images compared well for all three image sources when using the campos et al 2017 approach figs 3a and 3b having more frequently collected images uas and planet image sources did not have a large effect on the accuracy of modeling savi on days with images available the daily kcbrf generated for maize from all three image sources compared well up until peak kcbrf where the planet kcbrf curve did not reach the same kcbrf peak as the landsat and uas image sources fig 3c differences in modeled daily kcbrf for soybean were present for all three image sources at different stages of crop development fig 3d the differences in the daily kcbrf curves for maize and soybean can be attributed to differences in savi values produced from each image source the peak savi values averaged over the five locations for landsat uas and planet image sources were 0 69 0 68 and 0 66 for maize and 0 74 0 75 and 0 70 for soybean respectively overall modeled daily kcbrf from the uas and planet sources compared well to daily kcbrf from the landsat source figs 3e and 3f modeled daily kcbrf from the uas and landsat sources had higher agreement for maize rmse 0 017 while the modeled daily kcbrf from the planet and landsat sources had higher agreement for soybean rmse 0 033 while the variations observed in modeled kcbrf for maize and soybean would produce variations in estimated daily crop et eq 1 between the different image sources the effects on estimating crop et over the entire growing season would be small uas and planet satellite images produce similar daily kcbrf for maize and soybean in comparison to daily kcbrf produced with landsat images showing that these image sources can be used in estimating daily kcbrf 3 4 setmi rootzone soil water depletion the np volumetric soil water content measurements showed soil water depletion at the 137 cm measurement depth for maize and soybean indicating that the root depth extended beyond the maximum root depths used in setmi modeling maize 1 2 m soybean 1 0 m to compare the modeled and measured rootzone depletion depletion was modeled using the setmi uas and setmi sat treatments with a maximum root depth of 1 4 m for both maize and soybean fig 4 shows the comparison of modeled rootzone depletion from the setmi uas and setmi sat treatments in comparison to measured rootzone depletion the 2020 maize and soybean modeled rootzone depletion compared better to measured rootzone depletion than the 2019 maize and soybean modeled rootzone depletion the 2019 rootzone depletion comparison was likely affected by the discrepancies in programmed and actually applied irrigation as the vri center pivot had control nodes that malfunctioned during the 2019 growing season discrepancies in irrigation were not accounted for in the setmi treatments which would have resulted in additional error in the water balance model when accounting for irrigations the 2020 maize and soybean modeled rootzone depletion compared similarly to measured rootzone depletion for both the setmi uas and setmi sat treatments 2020 maize setmi uas rmse 15 4 mm 2020 maize setmi sat rmse 13 1 mm 2020 soybean setmi uas rmse 16 9 mm 2020 soybean setmi sat rmse 17 0 mm fig 5 shows 2020 time series water balance modeled rootzone depletion from four different plots with one maize and soybean plot from the setmi uas and setmi sat treatments the two setmi treatments used np volumetric soil water content measurements to provide the model with the start of season soil water content no in season modeled depletion corrections were applied fig 5 includes received precipitation and applied irrigations measured rootzone depletion and the mad calculated for both a 1 0 and 1 4 m root profile for soybean and a 1 2 and 1 4 m root profile for maize the two mads were included to show whether irrigations were scheduled properly so that estimated rootzone depletion did not exceed mad associated with the original maximum root depth used in the irrigation management study and for a 1 4 m root depth profile as the np measurements showed depletion at the 137 cm measurement depth the setmi uas soybean treatment modeled rootzone depletion exceeded the original 1 0 m profile mad during the vegetative growth stage fig 5b all four examples did not show modeled rootzone depletion exceeding the 1 4 m profile mad which infers that the setmi uas and setmi sat treatments likely did not experience water stress during the 2020 season overall the 2020 setmi treatments tracked rootzone soil water depletion well throughout the growing season showing that both the hybrid and stand alone wb models within setmi can be informed with uas and planet satellite images to produce good estimates of rootzone depletion these results indicate that the need for in season estimated soil water depletion corrections may be unwarranted especially in production applications given the time intensiveness of collecting soil water content measurements 4 summary and conclusion an irrigation field study assessed three different approaches for managing uniform and variable rate irrigation over a maize and soybean field the irrigation management approaches were assessed to determine if significant differences were present in dry grain yield gross applied irrigation and seasonal actual et change in soil water content and deep percolation the setmi uas and setmi sat irrigation management approaches consistently applied less irrigation than the uniform irrigation approach without significantly reducing yields for both maize and soybean the setmi irrigation treatments typically produced similar or higher cwp iwp and etwp in comparison to the uniform irrigation treatment for both maize and soybean given that the maize and soybean yields were not significantly different between irrigated treatments the uniform irrigation treatment likely applied more irrigation than what was required by the crop to achieve full yield the uniform treatment did not over irrigate as there was no dp during the season except for early season 2019 maize but it did not utilize the water already available in the soil as well as the setmi uas and setmi sat treatments the setmi hybrid and wb models informed with uas and planet satellite images respectively modeled rootzone depletion well in comparison to np measured depletion the depletion comparison produced better agreement in 2020 than in 2019 which could be due to unresolved discrepancies is the programmed and actually applied irrigations in 2019 the comparison of rootzone depletion modeled by setmi and measured by the np shows that corrections to estimated depletion in season may not be necessary for managing irrigation using setmi the rmse for modeled and measured depletion for 2019 and 2020 maize and soybean was less than 26 6 mm which is less than the depth of one full irrigation 30 5 mm the modeled maize and soybean daily kcbrf generated from the uas landsat satellite and planet satellite images agreed well although variation in kcbrf were present for uas and planet images sources compared to kcbrf generated with landsat images the difference in kcbrf between image sources would not have a significant effect on estimating et on a seasonal basis which would likely affect the timing of irrigation more than the total seasonal applied irrigation this study evaluated the use of setmi a remote sensing based et and water balance model for estimating rootzone soil water depletion to inform the timing and depths of variable rate irrigations over a growing season the study demonstrated the accuracy of estimating rootzone depletion using both the hybrid and water balance functions of setmi both approaches performed similarly in estimating rootzone depletion in comparison to measured depletion the irrigation management study assumed a maximum root depth of 1 2 and 1 0 m for maize and soybean however measured soil water content showed depletion at the 137 cm depth knowing the root depth of a crop is important in irrigation management as it affects the amount of water available in the soil that can be used in transpiration crops with deeper root depths in a uniformly wet soil profile will have access to more water than a shallower root depth in the same profile while setmi estimated rootzone depletion well using a 1 4 m root profile for maize and soybean using a 1 4 m root profile may not be ideal in other fields with different soil types assuming a root depth deeper than the actual root depth in the setmi model would result in the underestimation of rootzone depletion

9336,irrigation has traditionally been managed as uniform applications where an entire field receives the same depth of water motivation to improve current irrigation practices has led to different approaches utilizing remotely sensed images to inform variable rate irrigation management this study conducted in 2019 and 2020 implemented the spatial evapotranspiration modeling interface setmi a remote sensing based evapotranspiration et and water balance model for managing variable rate irrigation of a maize and soybean field this model tracked soil water content through the estimation of daily et and tracking of various water fluxes entering and leaving a field setmi was used in two different irrigation treatments informed using planet satellite setmi sat and unmanned aerial system uas setmi uas remotely sensed images a uniform irrigation approach managed by a professional crop consultant and a non irrigated approach were used as the baseline in comparing irrigation management approaches the irrigation treatments were evaluated on dry grain yield gross irrigation actual et deep percolation change in soil water content and water productivity the uniform irrigation approach managed by the crop consultant applied the highest irrigation in 2019 and 2020 for maize 2019 155 mm 2020 213 mm and soybean 2019 124 mm 2020 183 mm while the setmi irrigation treatments applied less irrigation for maize 2019 131 132 mm 2020 154 140 mm and soybean 2019 116 94 mm 2020 154 175 mm maize yield was highest for the uniform irrigation approach in 2019 14 9 mg ha 1 and 2020 13 3 mg ha 1 the highest soybean yield was produced by the setmi sat irrigation management approach in 2019 5 0 mg ha 1 and 2020 4 8 mg ha 1 significant differences p value 0 05 in applied irrigation between the uniform and setmi irrigation management approaches were observed while there were no significant differences in dry grain yield for both maize and soybean in 2019 and 2020 at least one of the setmi irrigation treatments produced higher crop irrigation and et water productivity values in comparison to those produced by the uniform irrigation treatment for all crop years a post season analysis was completed using the setmi uas and setmi sat treatments to evaluate the accuracy of estimated rootzone soil water depletion provided by setmi rootzone depletion calculated from neutron probe volumetric soil water content measurements were compared to the modeled depletion from the setmi uas and setmi sat treatments the 2020 modeled and measured depletion comparison produced better agreement resulting in a root mean squared error rmse 17 mm compared to 2019 rmse 27 mm the vri center pivot malfunctioned during the 2019 season which caused unresolved discrepancies between actually applied irrigation and what the system was programmed to apply the vri system was fixed before the 2020 season keywords variable rate irrigation remote sensing evapotranspiration water balance energy balance unmanned aerial system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction variable rate irrigation vri provides a means to apply varying amounts of water within a field giving producers the potential to improve water productivity and better manage water resources approaches for managing vri have utilized remotely sensed images to inform remote sensing based evapotranspiration et models capable of quantifying the magnitude and spatial variability of irrigation requirements recent studies have used remote sensing platforms like satellite and airborne systems to inform remote sensing based et models the recent advent of unmanned aerial system uas remote sensing provides additional opportunities to collect the information needed in modeling spatial et uas remote sensing can provide high spatiotemporal images that can be used to further evaluate remote sensing based et models previously unfeasible and provide enhanced insight into spatial et modeling potentially improving vri management while vri systems are becoming more available there lacks a consensus on a best method for determining depths and timing of irrigation events also known as a decision support system dss while there is no standard practice for managing vri systems today numerous approaches have been explored various sources of information have proven beneficial in vri management potentially most notable is the variability in soil type within a field as evans et al 2013 discussed that a thirty percent difference in applied water could be observed solely based on soil type others have been successful at managing vri using various sensors sensor networks and models kim et al 2008 discussed the conversion of a conventional irrigation system into a site specific irrigation system using a wireless soil sensing network and wireless in field sensing and control software several others have explored using infrared thermometers irt to monitor crop canopy temperature a key component in detecting crop water stress o shaughnessy and evett 2008 other means of managing vri have explored different modeling approaches with some utilizing remotely sensed data with remote sensing data such as satellite images acquiring spatial information of an area or field is more feasible satellite and crewed aircraft have been used to collect shortwave and thermal infrared images proven to be beneficial in agriculture leading to the development of models that quantify aspects related to crop growth et and water management a widely used purpose of remotely sensed data is to derive relationships between multispectral reflectance and the crop coefficient the reflectance based basal crop coefficient kcbrf approach is used to estimate daily crop et this approach has been used to inform irrigation management as it can provide a more realistic estimation of crop et with varying field conditions bausch and neale 1987 neale et al 1989 huete 1988 singh and irmak 2009 a second approach utilizing remotely sensed data for estimating et are energy balance models that estimate the surface energy balance fluxes by partitioning the total energy received at the earth s surface into its respective components of net radiation and sensible latent and soil heat flux the two source energy balance tseb model proposed by norman et al 1995 computes the surface energy balance components for soil and vegetation separately requiring radiometric surface temperature observations to inform the model furthermore neale et al 2006 2012 developed a hybrid modeling approach that combined the tseb model and water balance wb model updated with kcbrf which helped maintain the soil water balance throughout the growing season this hybrid model known as the spatial evapotranspiration model interface setmi geli and neale 2012 is unique in that the assimilation of the tseb estimated et into the wb model can provide corrections to the soil water balance the setmi model has been used in recent studies for managing vri barker et al 2018a and bhatti et al 2020 used the setmi hybrid approach with landsat satellite multispectral and thermal images for determining vri timing and depths bhatti et al 2020 also used the setmi wb approach informed with uas multispectral images but the study lacked uas thermal images required to run the hybrid model while these studies utilized the hybrid model using satellite images the hybrid model has not been evaluated when informed with uas acquired multispectral and thermal images with the setmi hybrid approach providing adjustments to the wb model based on the tseb estimated et these recent studies may not have fully utilized setmi s capabilities due to the low spatiotemporal resolution of satellite images the landsat thermal band has a spatial resolution of 100 m while uas acquired thermal images can have spatial resolutions of less than 1 m the high spatial resolution of uas thermal images may allow for better estimations of spatial et providing insight into the spatial variably of soil water depletion and crop water requirements the additional benefit of uas remote sensing is the flexibility in image acquisition timing landsat 7 and 8 satellites have a revisit interval of sixteen days with an eight day offset between the two satellites meaning landsat images are collected over a given area every eight days if weather permits poor weather conditions may result in missed satellite images which can be problematic during critical crop growth stages the flexibility of uas remote sensing can provide more regularly timed remotely sensed images to better inform models like setmi the development of a dss for spatial irrigation management has involved the exploration of several management approaches utilizing the fao 56 wb approach allen et al 1998 the kcbrf methodology and energy balance models the setmi model encompasses all three of these components giving it the potential to be versatile the recent progress in uas remote sensing presents an opportunity to assess the setmi hybrid approach in ways not previously feasible this study evaluated two spatial irrigation management approaches with respect to uniform irrigation the objective was to determine if the spatial irrigation management approaches could significantly reduce irrigation application without significantly reducing yield the irrigation management field study analysis included an assessment of gross irrigation dry grain yield and seasonal actual et deep percolation and change in soil water content to determine the overall effects of each irrigation management approach irrigation crop and evapotranspiration water productivity were also assessed for each irrigation management approach a post season analysis was completed using the setmi model to evaluate the differences in modeled and measured rootzone soil water depletion 2 materials and methods 2 1 research site this study was conducted at a 53 ha irrigated field site located at the eastern nebraska research and extension center near mead ne the field was equipped with a model 8500 zimmatic variable rate center pivot with individual nozzle control and sprinklers mounted on top of the pivot lateral a catch can test was completed before each season to assess application uniformity of the center pivot a christiansen s uniformity coefficient of 89 and 94 were observed in 2019 and 2020 respectively christiansen 1942 during the 2019 irrigation season control nodes on the vri center pivot malfunctioned leading to discrepancies between programmed and actually applied irrigation depths this issue likely affected the scheduling of irrigations in 2019 and the lack of as applied irrigation data from the vri system did not allow for compensation of incorrectly applied irrigation in irrigated treatments the malfunctioning control nodes were replaced before the 2020 irrigation season the field site was split into north and south halves with maize and soybean planted in annual rotation with maize and soybean planted in the north and south halves respectively in 2019 field soil types were silty clay loam and silt loam soil survey staff 2016 the field was managed as no till with anhydrous ammonia injections prior to all maize plantings the research field was further divided into 36 6 m by 60 1 m plots with 48 and 24 plots in the north and south halves respectively barker et al 2016 each plot contained an aluminum neutron probe np access tube located near the plot s geometric center for collecting np volumetric soil water content measurements field soil properties of observational field capacity fc and wilting point wp were computed for each plot using np volumetric water content measurements and soil samples near the np access tubes barker et al 2018a plot fc values were computed using depth weighted averages of in situ fc values at each np access tube with fc values updated in 2018 bhatti et al 2020 wp was measured using soil samples and a model wp4 t dewpoint potentiameter decagon devices inc pullman wa 2 2 setmi model formulation the setmi hybrid model included the tseb and kcbrf updated wb models the wb model followed the fao 56 approach allen et al 1998 with some deviations discussed in detail by barker et al 2018a the wb model within setmi accounted for daily crop et precipitation net irrigation inet surface runoff ro and deep percolation dp and solved a daily spatial soil water balance that provided daily rootzone soil water depletion dr and irrigation requirements the surface ro was determine using the usda natural resources conservation service runoff equation and a curve number of 0 75 usda 2004 the wb daily crop et was estimated using the dual crop coefficient method allen et al 1998 1 et k cb k s k e et r where kcb is the basal crop coefficient ks is the water stress coefficient ke is the soil evaporation coefficient and etr is the alfalfa based reference et ke was reduced by twenty five percent during the study following barker et al 2018a setmi uses the reflectance based crop coefficient kcbrf approach to estimate the basil crop coefficient used in eq 1 for estimating crop et in the kcbrf approach the soil adjusted vegetation index savi eq 2 huete 1988 calculated using multispectral reflectance images was related to the crop coefficient using the approach described by campos et al 2017 this method uses cumulative growing degree days cgdd and calculated savi to determine the slopes and intercepts used in a regression summation formula from which daily savi values are modeled eq 3 this method includes a two stage process to represent the vegetative 2 savi nir red nir red 0 5 1 5 3 savi j min exp a 1 cgdd j b 1 savi max exp exp a 2 cgdd j b 2 growth and senescence stages of the crop where savij is the current day modeled savi savimax is the maximum savi or peak seasonal savi value cgddj is the cumulative gdds for the current day a and b are linear regression coefficients and the subscripts 1 and 2 represent the vegetative growth and senescence stages respectively the calculation of regression coefficients a and b is discussed in campos et al 2017 using this method and the remotely sensed multispectral reflectance images savi was estimated daily over the entire growing season after estimating daily savi values using eq 3 a linear model relating savi to the basil crop coefficient savi to kcbrf for maize eq 4 and soybean eq 5 were used to derive seasonal basil crop coefficient curves campos et al 2017 using this method the modeled daily kcbrf values were used in eq 1 to estimated daily crop et 4 k cbrf maize 1 414 savi 0 02 5 k cbrf soybean 1 258 savi 0 006 setmi s second approach for estimating et uses the tseb model to estimate the surface energy balance components of net radiation rn latent le sensible h and soil heat g flux norman et al 1995 this model requires radiometric surface temperature and reflectance measurements and solves for the instantaneous latent heat flux which is scaled to daily et using instantaneous and daily etr following the method proposed by chavez et al 2008 the hybrid approach of setmi uses estimated et from the tseb ettseb and wb etwb models in a statistical weighting function 6 et hybrid et wb w et tseb et wb where ethybrid is modeled et after assimilation of the ettseb and etwb the w in eq 6 is the kalman gain and was set to a value of 0 6 barker et al 2018b when using the hybrid approach the wb model is updated by back calculating for a dr that reproduces the ks necessary to compute ethybrid which provides a mechanism to correct for soil water balance drift the hybrid model determines if dr should be adjusted through the comparison of ettseb and etwb and the value of ks if ettseb etwb and ks 1 no dr adjustments are performed and the ethybrid is used as the daily et in the wb model if ettseb etwb or ks 1 the hybrid model adjusts ks to satisfy eq 1 with ethybrid substituted for et eq 7 7 k s et hybrid et r k e k cb after back calculating ks the previous day dr drlast is calculated using 8 d rlast taw k s taw raw where taw and raw are total available and readily available water respectively taw was determined based on the difference of soil fc and wp and raw was determined based on a threshold p of when water stress begins calculated using raw p taw the p value used in calculating raw is crop specific and can vary depending on evaporative rate allen et al 1998 this setmi hybrid approach is used when thermal infrared images are available setmi offers the functionality to run a wb model without estimated ettseb where daily estimated et is solely calculated from the dual crop coefficient method updated with kcbrf a detailed setmi user manual was presented in the appendix of barker 2017 2 3 reflectance based crop coefficient analysis the campos et al 2017 approach for modeling kcbrf was developed using landsat 5 and landsat 7 satellite reflectance images this study included uas and planet satellite reflectance images to model daily kcbrf within setmi for estimating daily crop et this presented the need to evaluate the differences in modeled kcbrf based on the different sources of reflectance images as each source contained a different spatiotemporal resolution maize and soybean daily savi and kcbrf were modeled using landsat uas and planet reflectance images in 2020 at the irrigated field site following the campos et al 2017 approach the reflectance images from each image source were used to calculate savi on days with images daily savi values were then modeled using the campos et al 2017 approach the calculated and modeled savi were compared on days with available images to assess the difference between calculated and modeled savi between the three image sources after modeling daily savi kcbrf was modeled for maize and soybean for each image source the daily kcbrf modeled using uas and planet satellite images was compared to the daily kcbrf modeled using landsat satellite images the reflectance images used in this analysis consisted of seven landsat 7 and 8 sixteen uas and eighteen planet satellite images the three image sources had different spatial resolutions where landsat had the lowest spatial resolution at 30 m the uas and planet images were resampled to a 30 m spatial resolution and aligned to the landsat spatial grid reflectance data on a given date from each image source was averaged from five locations in both maize and soybean separately 2 4 irrigation management the irrigation management field study included four different irrigation management treatments with two treatments utilizing vri one uniform irrigation treatment and a rainfed treatment that did not receive irrigation the uniform irrigation treatment was managed by a professional crop consultant and farm manager which was to represent the logic put forth by a typical producer who may use different means of determining when to irrigate the crop consultant provided weekly assessments of field conditions and irrigation recommendations through visual inspection of crops and soil probing irrigation recommendations from the crop consultant were applied uniformly to all uniform treatment plots the first vri management approach used the setmi model informed with planet satellite multispectral reflectance images setmi sat which did not use the hybrid functionality of setmi the setmi sat management approach used the kcbrf updated wb method for estimating daily et with the kcbrf curve modeled using the planet satellite reflectance images the second vri management approach used the setmi hybrid model informed with uas acquired multispectral reflectance and radiometric thermal images setmi uas this approach used the hybrid model where et was estimated using both the tseb and kcbrf updated wb approaches this approach included the assimilation of ettseb and etwb which allowed for soil water content corrections the setmi model required initialization of the start of growing season soil water content in 2019 the initialized soil water content was set to plot fc as there was sufficient precipitation before planting for soil water content to reach fc in 2020 the start of growing season soil water content was not at fc due to lack of precipitation and np volumetric soil water content measurements collected in each plot were used to initialize the start of growing season soil water content setmi also requires maximum crop root depth which is used in calculating the rootzone soil water depletion a maximum root depth of 1 2 m and 1 0 m were used for maize and soybean respectively the timing of irrigation events in the vri management approaches were based on an allowable soil water depletion threshold also known as management allowable depletion mad a mad of fifty percent was used for maize and soybean meaning that the soil water content could deplete to fifty percent of total crop available water before irrigation was required the center pivot required four days to apply a full irrigation 30 5 mm to the entire field while a fifty percent mad was used to determine the timing of irrigations a 30 5 mm depletion buffer was used to avoid the potential of water stress occurring during an ongoing irrigation this meant that an irrigation was required once rootzone soil water depletion reached mad 30 5 mm this irrigation management strategy maintained rootzone soil water depletion at a level above mad to avoid water stress and below fc to allow the soil the capacity to store water in future precipitation events limiting the potential for dp irrigation was applied on a plot level where individual plots received a uniform irrigation depth no more than 30 5 mm setmi provided spatial irrigation requirements at a 1 m spatial resolution the plots managed using setmi were irrigated to meet ninety percent of a plot s 1 m spatial irrigation requirements comparable to the concept of irrigation adequacy eisenhauer et al 2021 2 5 irrigation management experimental design the four treatments were randomly assigned to plots with twelve and six plots assigned to a single treatment in the north and south halves of the field respectfully fig 1 while previous studies at this site included blocking by soil available water capacity when determining treatment assignment this study did not include such feature since the benefits of blocking were small in previous irrigation studies at this site barker et al 2018a bhatti et al 2020 2 6 experimental data weather data required by the setmi model was obtained from the high plains regional climate center s agricultural weather data network s awdn mead agronomy farm weather station data collected by the awdn station and used in setmi modeling included air temperature wind speed incoming shortwave solar radiation actual vapor pressure atmospheric pressure maximum and minimum daily air temperatures and daily reference et during the 2019 season averaged precipitation from four tipping bucket rain gauges installed around the field were used for measuring precipitation and barometric pressure was obtained from the neb field 3 cosmic ray soil moisture observing system station located nearby zreda et al 2012 during the 2020 season precipitation and barometric pressure data collected by a realmfive weather station realmfive lincoln ne located near the field were used to inform setmi volumetric soil water content measurements were collected throughout the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons using two model 503 elite hydroprobe nps cpn concord ca where bhatti et al 2020 discussed the np calibration measurements were collected at each plot s np access tube at depths of 15 46 76 107 and 137 cm with dates of soil water content measurements listed in table 1 the soil water content measurements were used to provide corrections to the setmi uas and setmi sat treatments during the irrigation study with corrections applied once to maize and soybean in 2019 maize 8 19 2019 soybean 8 20 2019 twice to maize in 2020 7 31 2020 and 8 23 2020 and once to soybean in 2020 8 25 26 2020 the corrections were based on using the averaged difference between modeled and measured soil water content from three plots within each setmi treatment the averaged difference was then used to scale modeled soil water content in each plot within a treatment this method minimized the overall number of soil water content measurements used in corrections which more closely followed what is feasible for a typical producer the study acknowledges that the setmi water balance soil water content corrections likely affected modeling in a positive manner and future work should limit these types of corrections if the setmi approach is to be more widely adopted by producers for managing irrigation planet satellite images used to inform the setmi sat treatment were retrieved through the planet explorer online interface which provided surface reflectance images with atmospheric corrections in four spectral bands blue green red and near infrared at a spatial resolution of 3 m the planet satellite images used in the setmi model included twenty two images in 2019 starting 14 may and ending 2 september and thirty images in 2020 starting 5 may and ending 29 september uas remotely sensed images were collected with a dji matrice 600 with integrated micasense rededge multispectral and flir duo pro r thermal cameras at an altitude of 240 m above ground level which produced images with spatial resolutions of approximately 17 and 33 cm respectively maguire et al 2021 both cameras were mounted on a gimbal and positioned nadir to the ground surface when acquiring images uas images were collected on a near weekly basis and on clear sky days table 2 uas multispectral and thermal images were processed into ortho images using pix4d mapper pix4d prilly switzerland the uas multispectral ortho images were radiometrically calibrated into reflectance using reflectance panel images collected before and after image collection flights corrections were applied to the thermal ortho images to account for emissivity and atmospheric effects the modtran and linear calibration methods discussed in maguire et al 2021 were used in correcting thermal ortho images in 2019 and 2020 respectively the calibrated uas multispectral and thermal ortho images were resampled to a spatial resolution of 1 m before being used in the setmi model 2 7 analysis of treatment response variables irrigation treatment performance was assessed using the response variables of dry grain yield gross applied irrigation ig actual crop et eta change in soil water content δsw deep percolation dp irrigation water productivity iwp eq 9 et water productivity etwp eq 10 and crop water productivity cwp eq 11 evett et al 2020 djaman and irmak 2012 iwp etwp and cwp expressed as kg m 3 were calculated using 9 iwp y i y d i i 10 etwp y i y d et a i et a d 11 cwp y i et a where y is dry grain yield i is applied irrigation and et is actual et subscripts i d and a represent irrigated dryland non irrigated and actual conditions respectively dry grain yield was recorded during harvest with a yield monitor which provided spatial yield data yield maps were processed using the usda s yield editor 2 07 software sudduth et al 2012 field total dry grain yield was weighed and used to verify spatial yield data plot yield was computed by averaging the spatial yield data within a 12 2 m buffer inside of each plot seasonal plot eta was assessed on a time scale coinciding with the first and last np soil water content measurements table 1 seasonal plot eta used a measurement period water balance approach eta p ro dp inet δsw using direct measurements of irrigation precipitation and δsw the δsw was calculated using a depth weighted average of the first and last np soil water content measurements at all five depths ro was estimated using the usda natural resources conservation service runoff equation as discussed in section 2 2 dp was estimated using the np volumetric soil water content measurements and precipitation data the statistical analysis of response variables was analyzed as crop year combinations the mean standard deviation and unpaired t tests were calculated on dry grain yield ig eta δsw and dp to determine if statistically significant differences p value 0 05 were present between the response variables of each irrigation treatment 2 8 setmi modeled rootzone depletion analysis a separate analysis was competed on the setmi sat and setmi uas treatments to evaluate how well the model estimated rootzone soil water depletion in 2019 and 2020 the model was setup similar to the irrigation scheduling experiment with the np soil water content measurements used to initiate the model s start of season soil water content but did not include mid season soil water content corrections the np measurement depths extended down to 137 cm and the setmi model was ran using a 1 4 m soil profile allowing the crop root depth to extend to 1 4 m for both maize and soybean the 2019 uas thermal images were re calibrated using the linear calibration method discussed in maguire et al 2021 all applied irrigation from 2019 and 2020 were included in the model the setmi modeled rootzone depletion was compared to measured depletion where measured depletion was calculated using a depth weighted average of the np volumetric water content measurements and the modeled root depths from setmi 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water content measurements fig 2 shows the np volumetric soil water content measurements for each crop and treatment in 2019 and 2020 table 3 shows the starting and ending np volumetric soil water content measurements for the five measurement depths for irrigated and rainfed treatments all treatments experienced soil water depletion at the 137 cm measurement depth indicating root depth of both maize and soybean extended beyond the maximum root depth used in the setmi model maize 1 2 m soybean 1 0 m overall the rainfed treatments had higher soil water depletion at the 137 cm np measurement depth in comparison to the irrigated treatments highlighting the ability of maize and soybean to access water at deeper soil depths especially in rainfed conditions 3 2 irrigation management field study the response variables from each irrigation treatment were compared to determine if statistically significant p value 0 05 differences were present between treatments with treatment response variable means and standard deviations listed in table 4 the uniform irrigation approach consistently applied the most irrigation with significant differences in ig observed between the uniform and vri management approaches for each crop year combination the ig for the setmi uas and setmi sat treatments were not significantly different except for soybean in 2020 no significant differences were observed in yields between the vri and uniform irrigation treatments the seasonal eta was highest for the uniform irrigation treatment in all crop years with the seasonal eta of irrigated treatments significantly higher than the rainfed treatment significant differences in seasonal eta was observed between irrigated soybean treatments while no significant differences were observed between irrigated maize treatments the differences in δsw were most apparent between rainfed and irrigated treatments except for the irrigated soybean treatments in 2019 where differences in δsw were observed between irrigated treatments the δsw for the soybean treatments was significantly higher than the maize treatments in 2019 due to significant precipitation received prior to the last np measurements collected in the maize treatments the treatment dp was zero in most cases except for maize in 2019 the dp that occurred in the 2019 maize treatments is a result of high soil water content and high precipitation received shortly after the first np measurement date np measurements were collected on 5 31 2019 and the field received 55 mm of precipitation between 6 3 2019 and 6 5 2019 the dp in the maize plots was calculated using np measurements from 5 31 2019 the precipitation received shortly after the np measurements accounting for estimated ro and the estimated crop et between 5 31 2019 and 6 5 2019 overall the dp calculated for the 2019 maize treatments was small water productivity metrics were calculated using three methods cwp iwp and etwp each method was calculated using treatment averaged dry grain yield ig and seasonal eta table 5 the setmi irrigation treatments produce similar or higher cwp in all crop years compared to the uniform irrigation treatment the rainfed treatment produced the highest cwp in 2019 maize 3 57 kg m 3 and 2020 soybean 1 17 kg m 3 with the setmi uas and setmi sat treatments producing the highest cwp in 2019 soybean 1 46 kg m 3 and 2020 maize 2 94 kg m 3 respectively the setmi sat treatment produced the highest iwp three out of the four crop year combinations 2019 soybean 0 35 kg m 3 2020 maize 1 03 kg m 3 2020 soybean 0 35 kg m 3 with the setmi uas treatment producing the highest iwp in 2019 maize 0 50 kg m 3 the setmi uas treatment produced the highest etwp in 2019 soybean 2 04 kg m 3 and maize 0 66 kg m 3 with the setmi sat treatment producing the highest etwp in 2020 soybean 0 79 kg m 3 and maize 3 44 kg m 3 3 3 reflectance based crop coefficients daily savi and kcbrf were modeled for maize and soybean using three remote sensing image sources landsat uas and planet fig 3 the difference in modeled and calculated savi on days with remotely sensed images compared well for all three image sources when using the campos et al 2017 approach figs 3a and 3b having more frequently collected images uas and planet image sources did not have a large effect on the accuracy of modeling savi on days with images available the daily kcbrf generated for maize from all three image sources compared well up until peak kcbrf where the planet kcbrf curve did not reach the same kcbrf peak as the landsat and uas image sources fig 3c differences in modeled daily kcbrf for soybean were present for all three image sources at different stages of crop development fig 3d the differences in the daily kcbrf curves for maize and soybean can be attributed to differences in savi values produced from each image source the peak savi values averaged over the five locations for landsat uas and planet image sources were 0 69 0 68 and 0 66 for maize and 0 74 0 75 and 0 70 for soybean respectively overall modeled daily kcbrf from the uas and planet sources compared well to daily kcbrf from the landsat source figs 3e and 3f modeled daily kcbrf from the uas and landsat sources had higher agreement for maize rmse 0 017 while the modeled daily kcbrf from the planet and landsat sources had higher agreement for soybean rmse 0 033 while the variations observed in modeled kcbrf for maize and soybean would produce variations in estimated daily crop et eq 1 between the different image sources the effects on estimating crop et over the entire growing season would be small uas and planet satellite images produce similar daily kcbrf for maize and soybean in comparison to daily kcbrf produced with landsat images showing that these image sources can be used in estimating daily kcbrf 3 4 setmi rootzone soil water depletion the np volumetric soil water content measurements showed soil water depletion at the 137 cm measurement depth for maize and soybean indicating that the root depth extended beyond the maximum root depths used in setmi modeling maize 1 2 m soybean 1 0 m to compare the modeled and measured rootzone depletion depletion was modeled using the setmi uas and setmi sat treatments with a maximum root depth of 1 4 m for both maize and soybean fig 4 shows the comparison of modeled rootzone depletion from the setmi uas and setmi sat treatments in comparison to measured rootzone depletion the 2020 maize and soybean modeled rootzone depletion compared better to measured rootzone depletion than the 2019 maize and soybean modeled rootzone depletion the 2019 rootzone depletion comparison was likely affected by the discrepancies in programmed and actually applied irrigation as the vri center pivot had control nodes that malfunctioned during the 2019 growing season discrepancies in irrigation were not accounted for in the setmi treatments which would have resulted in additional error in the water balance model when accounting for irrigations the 2020 maize and soybean modeled rootzone depletion compared similarly to measured rootzone depletion for both the setmi uas and setmi sat treatments 2020 maize setmi uas rmse 15 4 mm 2020 maize setmi sat rmse 13 1 mm 2020 soybean setmi uas rmse 16 9 mm 2020 soybean setmi sat rmse 17 0 mm fig 5 shows 2020 time series water balance modeled rootzone depletion from four different plots with one maize and soybean plot from the setmi uas and setmi sat treatments the two setmi treatments used np volumetric soil water content measurements to provide the model with the start of season soil water content no in season modeled depletion corrections were applied fig 5 includes received precipitation and applied irrigations measured rootzone depletion and the mad calculated for both a 1 0 and 1 4 m root profile for soybean and a 1 2 and 1 4 m root profile for maize the two mads were included to show whether irrigations were scheduled properly so that estimated rootzone depletion did not exceed mad associated with the original maximum root depth used in the irrigation management study and for a 1 4 m root depth profile as the np measurements showed depletion at the 137 cm measurement depth the setmi uas soybean treatment modeled rootzone depletion exceeded the original 1 0 m profile mad during the vegetative growth stage fig 5b all four examples did not show modeled rootzone depletion exceeding the 1 4 m profile mad which infers that the setmi uas and setmi sat treatments likely did not experience water stress during the 2020 season overall the 2020 setmi treatments tracked rootzone soil water depletion well throughout the growing season showing that both the hybrid and stand alone wb models within setmi can be informed with uas and planet satellite images to produce good estimates of rootzone depletion these results indicate that the need for in season estimated soil water depletion corrections may be unwarranted especially in production applications given the time intensiveness of collecting soil water content measurements 4 summary and conclusion an irrigation field study assessed three different approaches for managing uniform and variable rate irrigation over a maize and soybean field the irrigation management approaches were assessed to determine if significant differences were present in dry grain yield gross applied irrigation and seasonal actual et change in soil water content and deep percolation the setmi uas and setmi sat irrigation management approaches consistently applied less irrigation than the uniform irrigation approach without significantly reducing yields for both maize and soybean the setmi irrigation treatments typically produced similar or higher cwp iwp and etwp in comparison to the uniform irrigation treatment for both maize and soybean given that the maize and soybean yields were not significantly different between irrigated treatments the uniform irrigation treatment likely applied more irrigation than what was required by the crop to achieve full yield the uniform treatment did not over irrigate as there was no dp during the season except for early season 2019 maize but it did not utilize the water already available in the soil as well as the setmi uas and setmi sat treatments the setmi hybrid and wb models informed with uas and planet satellite images respectively modeled rootzone depletion well in comparison to np measured depletion the depletion comparison produced better agreement in 2020 than in 2019 which could be due to unresolved discrepancies is the programmed and actually applied irrigations in 2019 the comparison of rootzone depletion modeled by setmi and measured by the np shows that corrections to estimated depletion in season may not be necessary for managing irrigation using setmi the rmse for modeled and measured depletion for 2019 and 2020 maize and soybean was less than 26 6 mm which is less than the depth of one full irrigation 30 5 mm the modeled maize and soybean daily kcbrf generated from the uas landsat satellite and planet satellite images agreed well although variation in kcbrf were present for uas and planet images sources compared to kcbrf generated with landsat images the difference in kcbrf between image sources would not have a significant effect on estimating et on a seasonal basis which would likely affect the timing of irrigation more than the total seasonal applied irrigation this study evaluated the use of setmi a remote sensing based et and water balance model for estimating rootzone soil water depletion to inform the timing and depths of variable rate irrigations over a growing season the study demonstrated the accuracy of estimating rootzone depletion using both the hybrid and water balance functions of setmi both approaches performed similarly in estimating rootzone depletion in comparison to measured depletion the irrigation management study assumed a maximum root depth of 1 2 and 1 0 m for maize and soybean however measured soil water content showed depletion at the 137 cm depth knowing the root depth of a crop is important in irrigation management as it affects the amount of water available in the soil that can be used in transpiration crops with deeper root depths in a uniformly wet soil profile will have access to more water than a shallower root depth in the same profile while setmi estimated rootzone depletion well using a 1 4 m root profile for maize and soybean using a 1 4 m root profile may not be ideal in other fields with different soil types assuming a root depth deeper than the actual root depth in the setmi model would result in the underestimation of rootzone depletion

drought stress revealed an improvement in plant growth characteristics over untreated seeds after 45 days of transplantation among the different bacterial strains used pseudomonas fluorescens was found to increase the mean root and shoot length of pepper the increase in the mean root 3 cm and shoot length 22 5 cm was greater in seedlings treated with p fluorescens compared to untreated control 1 67 cm and 14 83 cm respectively table 7 in contrast pepper seedlings treated with aaule51 recorded higher fresh and dry weight compared to other treatments table 7 the survival rate and recovery of pepper plants were approximately 66 7 and 100 respectively when inoculated with drought tolerant strain aaule51 whereas none of the plants survived under drought stress without bacterial inoculation table 8 the pepper inoculated with aaule51 undetermined appeared healthy and had the highest values of dry weight fresh weight turgid weight and relative water content whereas pepper inoculated with aaule 41 pseudomonas fluorescens had the longest roots table 7 at the end of the experiment the highest soil moisture reduction was recorded in the isolate aaule41 28 while the lowest was recorded in the isolate aaule51 24 33 table 8 however some significant protection against drought was detected in pepper plants when the aaule51 strain was used as the inoculant aaule51 showed a drought tolerant effect in pepper plants under our assay conditions moreover these findings suggest that only strains with the highest desiccation resistance protect plants from drought 3 10 3 analysis of selected bacterial isolates to promote growth and alter root system architecture through an auxin signaling mechanism in arabidopsis thaliana in vitro tests were conducted to evaluate the plant growth promoting activity of bacterial isolates under in vitro conditions after inoculation of the thirteen day old arabidopsis seedlings with the selected bacterial suspension at a concentration of 5 108 cfu which promoted the growth of the plants by significantly increasing the fresh weight length and the number of lateral roots as compared with the untreated control seedlings fig 5b c d the number of lateral roots per seedling in aaule51 treated seedlings was 15 2 1 9 almost five times more than the lateral roots of the control seedlings which was 4 76 0 5 fig 5a d the fresh weight was 4 88 0 66 mg seedling in aaule51 undetermined treated seedlings compared with the untreated control 2 67 0 66 mg seedling fig 5 a b however except for aaule41 pseudomonas fluorescence no significant difference was observed in the shoot length between the treated and untreated control seedlings fig 5 c our results suggest that the selected bacterial isolates have the potential to promote plant growth by altering the plant root system the response of arabidopsis seedlings to selected bacterial isolates was observed using the dr5 gus transgenic line the primary root tips of 5 day old seedlings co cultivated with enterobacter hormaechei rhizobium spp pseudomonas fluorescens and aaule51 for 13 days showed more gus staining fig 5e f g h compared to the control representing auxin response fig 5i j these results indicated that dr5 gus responded to inoculation with selected bacterial isolates which indicated the production of auxin or an auxin like compound by the bacteria 4 discussion drought being one of the most common environmental problems affecting the growth and development of plants and subsequently agricultural yields and food supply has gained research attention over the years it is indicated that crop production is hampered by water stress which is a major environmental concern and it is important to develop crop varieties with higher yields under water scarcity penella et al 2014 the action of pgpb characteristics can decrease the devastating effects of drought on plants these bacteria are capable of tolerating and surviving in harsh environments through the regulation of phytohormones production of acc deaminase activity accumulation of osmolytes production of volatile compounds and antioxidant defense vurukonda et al 2016 the high osmotic pressure outside bacterial cells causes the fluid inside the cell to diffuse out of the cell so the destruction of microbial cell walls will cause lysis tolerance is a condition where bacteria can survive and persist in a less favorable environment namely drought meanwhile sensitivity is a state in which bacteria cannot tolerate a harsh environment dimichele et al 2020 all the firmibacterial cultures were tested for their drought tolerance in a nutrient broth mixed with peg 6000 to induce the osmotic condition among which 30 peg concentration was taken as criteria for selecting efficient isolates as they had a minimum osmotic potential of 1 03 mpa paul et al 2017 for further experiments previously many research studies have been conducted using peg 6000 up to 25 0 73 mpa for selecting drought tolerant isolates grover et al 2011 sandhya et al 2017 and hence in this study it has been tested up to 35 peg a total of sixty endophyte and rhizosphere bacterial strains were grown in nutrient broth supplemented with peg 6000 at various concentrations of which 20 33 3 strains showed growth up to 35 peg6000 supplementation table 2 among the sixty tested bacterial isolates 8 strains had significantly higher growth compared to other bacterial isolates on od 600 nm 0 5 1 0 od at a concentration of 25 peg6000 in the present study 18 3 of the bacterial isolates that grew in a medium containing 30 peg 1 03 mpa were considered drought tolerant the tolerance is mainly associated with biofilm formation kasim et al 2016 mohammed 2018 flocculation hong et al 2017 bio surfactant tran et al 2008 and eps morcillo and manzanera 2021 production of bacterial strains this is an initial selection of bacterial strains based on their ability to grow in medium and is a fascinating approach for other stress associated assays this feature is very important for degraded land restoration under water stressed conditions by applying such drought tolerant bacterial strains plant growth promoting rhizobacteria pgpr play a vital role in increasing plant growth through a variety of favorable effects on the various soil microflora this is frequently accomplished by building biofilms in the rhizosphere which supply benefits over planktonic bacterial life which are resistant to extreme environments and can protect microbes from ultraviolet uv radiation extreme temperature extreme ph high salinity high pressure poor nutrients and antibiotics by acting as protective clothing yin et al 2019 in the present study 48 3 of bacterial isolates showed the activity of biofilm formation at different nacl concentrations the highest biofilm formation was recorded in isolates aausr13 pseudomonas aeruginosa aaule41 pseudomonas fluorescens and aaule51 undetermined both in slide and tube methods when compared to the control a significant difference in pgpb ability to produce a biofilm was recorded in 100 and 150 mm nacl concentrations in our findings the activity of biofilm formation increased with increasing a nacl concentration especially at 150 mm nacl these findings were consistent with those of kasim et al 2016 who found that biofilm growth protected bacterial cells against increased nutritional and salt stress over time they also added that environmental stress such as nutritional and osmotic stress increases bacterial competition for available nutrients and bacteria shift from planktonic to sessile assemblages at diverse biotic and abiotic surfaces to protect themselves in the rhizosphere furthermore increasing exopolysaccharide production in response to higher salt stress promotes biofilm formation and protects them during assembly by retaining a water layer around the cells by lowering the amount of na available for plant absorption bacterial exopolysaccharide eps can help to alleviate salt stress plant growth promoting rhizobacteria pgpr and their exopolysaccharides eps have a significant impact on plant growth and drought stress resistance under water stress plants inoculated with eps producing bacteria accumulated more proline carbohydrates and free amino acids naseem et al 2018 all of the selected drought tolerant bacterial isolates showed the ability to produce eps flocculate and form biofilms when exposed to saline media as compared to non saline media bacterial cells could form close attachments or interactions with the root systems of plants considerably improving moisture retention and abiotic stress a concomitant increase in floc yield was observed with increasing nacl concentration in all tested isolates when compared to the control the maximum floc yield was recorded in most of the bacterial isolates at 1 m nacl concentration table 4 however enterobacter hormaechei aausr 23 showed the highest floc yield at 0 5 m of nacl concentration 0 15 g l these findings regarding increased floc yield at various nacl concentrations back up a previous report hong et al 2017 who discovered that increasing nacl concentration up to 2 m and increased flocculation are important to the change in adhesion of bacterial strains plant growth promoting rhizobacteria with eps producing features chelate a variety of cations including na and it has been discovered that under salt stress bacteria can bond with the na ion via eps secretion reducing its toxicity in the soil shultana et al 2020 biosurfactants are extensively induced by bacteria yeast and fungi which have low molecular weight surface active compounds which are produced by soil microbes and provide the soil with wettability as well as allow for proper chemical fertilizer dispersion in the soil supporting the promotion of plant growth biosurfactants can be produced economically for a variety of uses in the pharmaceutical cosmetics food and agriculture industries because they are less harmful and environmentally friendly many rhizosphere and plant related bacteria produce biosurfactant which is important for motility signaling and biofilm formation implying that biosurfactant regulates plant microbe interactions sachdev and cameotra 2013 it can also be used in agriculture to eliminate plant pathogens and increase nutrient bioavailability for beneficial plant associated microorganisms raj et al 2021 biosurfactants can be used to improve the quality of agricultural soils through soil remediation sachdev and cameotra 2013 the results of this study show that among 60 bacterial isolates 31 67 produced biosurfactants bacillus thruringienesis aausr2 pseudomonas fluorescens aaule 29 enterobacter hormaechei aausr 23 pseudomonas putida aaule 27 and aaule51 undetermined had the highest production of biosurfactants this is comparable with the frequency of 1 3 reported previously by tran et al 2008 and found that biosurfactant producing fluorescent pseudomonads isolated from the black pepper rhizosphere varied from 6 to 60 depending on the soil type whereas only 6 of sugar beet rhizosphere isolates were able to produce biosurfactants nielsen et al 2006 salinity is one of the soil stresses which decreases pepper production in desert areas salt stress is one of the world s fastest growing environmental stresses salt stress affects 22 of the world s cultivated land and 33 of the world s irrigated land which is increasing rapidly by an average rate of 10 every year abbas et al 2019 the accumulation of na in plants causes cell death and osmotic stress in plants by suppressing photosynthesis and producing reactive oxygen species ros which cause dna damage membrane injury protein denaturation and cell wall degeneration it also disrupts osmotic equilibrium resulting in turgidity damage cell dryness and cell death abbas et al 2019 many studies have been conducted to address this issue including the use of salt tolerant pgpb in this study twelve bacterial isolates were chosen from a pool of sixty isolates based on their tolerance to high salt conditions these four selected strains exhibit plant growth promoting properties in vitro and under greenhouse conditions according to yan et al 2015 the impact of salinity and water content on soil microorganisms was evaluated and the plant growth promoting properties decreased gradually with increased salt concentration salt tolerant bacterial strains have been shown to have high nitrogenase activity under saline conditions and can produce osmolytes to maintain cell turgidity and metabolism under unfavorable conditions in this study one isolate of pseudomonas stutzeri aausr 19 was able to retain a significantly high bacterial population at 1 5 m of nacl amended media which is similar to the findings of a previous report qurashi and sabri 2011 bacterial eps production is an important salt tolerant trait because it can reduce the harmful effect of osmotic stress in plants by increasing fresh weight dry weight and water content ghosh et al 2019 heat stress caused by global climate change can have a severe impact on the growth and yield of temperature sensitive crops increased temperature reduced agricultural output by influencing biochemical physiological molecular and morphological aspects alone or in combination with other abiotic stresses the application of plant growth promoting bacteria pgpb results in an ecofriendly approach to improve agricultural crop production and combat the negative effects of heat stress khan et al 2020a the role of microbes in the control of abiotic and biotic stresses has been recognized and much attention has been paid to the use of pgpb as a promising alternative to reducing plant heat stress in the present study of 60 isolates 14 were grown at 55 0c and 11 at 65 c among the tested isolates bacillus spp exhibited a higher tolerance to temperature than other gram negative bacteria the possible reason for the higher heat tolerance is due to the induction of heat shock proteins schumann 2017 and also the presence of dormant endospores produced by bacillus spp which increases their tolerance to high temperatures reineke and mathys 2020 phytoremediation is a new environmentally benign way of removing or immobilizing heavy metals from the environment using plants plant growth promoting bacteria pgpb that are resistant to heavy metals are an essential strategy for enhancing biomass production and increasing plant tolerance to heavy metals tirry et al 2018 in our study sixty bacterial isolates were originally isolated for the different morphological appearances of their colonies on nb agar medium all the bacteria were multiresistant to several heavy metals resistance of the selected ten bacterial isolates to heavy metals at different concentrations is summarized in table 6 all of the tested bacterial isolates were shown to be resistant to the heavy metals approximately 70 of isolates were able to grow at 500 µg l of concentrations 90 of isolates resist 500 µg l of fe concentrations 60 of isolates resisted 500 µg l of cu concentrations 90 of isolates resisted 500 µg l of pb concentrations and 10 of isolates resisted 500 µg l of co concentration all heavy metals tested were completely tolerant to p polymyxa strain a calcoaceticus p putida and p fluorescens at 300 µg ml getahun et al 2020 azzam and tawfik 2015 reported pseudomonas sp showed a 97 9 pb 93 5 cd and 68 cu removal efficiency from contaminated industrial waste water the isolates that have a high tolerance to metals could be useful in the bioremediation of heavy metal polluted environments this could be done by removing converting harmful contaminants like heavy metals into less harmful substances and or degrading organic substances and finally mineralizing of organic substances into carbon dioxide water and nitrogen gas plants response to water stress is a complicated process that appears to entail the synthesis of polyamines as well as the emergence of a new group of proteins whose function is unknown drought reduces the availability of co2 for photosynthesis which can lead to the formation of reactive oxygen species from misdirected electrons in the photosystems in addition free radicals are produced during abiotic stresses reactive oxygen species ros such as superoxide radical o2 hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals oh cause membrane lipid peroxidation saravanakumar et al 2011 the ability of four selected drought tolerant bacteria to protect plants from drought was tested using pepper plants all four bacterial isolates were previously isolated in our laboratory enterobacter hormaechei rhizobium sp pseudomonas fluorecens and undetermined aaule51 for negative control we used non inoculated plants plants were inoculated and subjected to drying conditions as described in the methods and materials section after 30 days in the absence of water non inoculated pepper plants showed signs of dying fig 4a vílchez et al 2016 tested the ability of five bacterial strains namely microbacterium sp 3j1 arthrobacter koreensis 5j12a a siccitolerans 4j27 rhodococcus sp 4j2a2 and leucobacter sp 4j7b1 and found that all microorganisms showed high tolerance to desiccation protecting pepper and tomato from drought however pepper plants inoculated with the most drought tolerant isolates undetermined aaule51 and rhizobium spp as well as with enterobacter hormaechei and pseudomonas fluorescens appeared healthy and yielded the highest values of dry weight fresh weight turgid weight and relative water content and had the longest roots and stems at the end of the experiment compared to the uninoculated pepper plants table 7 these findings suggest that only isolates with the highest desiccation resistance protect plants from drought plant tissues increase ethylene production under abiotic stress and an increased concentration of ethylene in plants can inhibit plant growth bleecker and kende 2000 the acc deaminase produced by pgpr can reduce plant ethylene concentration by cleaving the ethylene precursor acc consequently the plants maintain normal growth siddikee et al 2011 the selected drought resistant bacterial isolates might be able to reduce the ethylene concentration of pepper plants by cleaving acc under drought stress and hence increase plant growth and resist desiccation sustainable agriculture will be more beneficial with the characterization of beneficial microorganisms and appropriate formulations for moderating biotic and abiotic stress in crop plants in drought is one of the most common abiotic stresses that plants face and it can limit their growth relative water content rwc is an important indicator of drought stress the higher rwc is an indicator of drought tolerance in black pepper krishnamurthy et al 1998 rwc and transpiration rates are significantly reduced in plants exposed to drought drought tolerant cultivars have an improved water use efficiency as compared to susceptible cultivars this effect in drought tolerant plants may be due to increased biomass accumulation and low evapotranspiration because of stomatal closure abdelaal et al 2021 one of the first responses to drought is a reduction in rwc which is frequently followed by a reduction in leaf water potential and stomatal closure noctor et al 2014 moreover stomatal closing is linked to higher leaf temperatures which causes protein denaturation and compromises membrane stability photosynthesis mineral nutrition ion transport and amino acid synthesis varshikar and tan 2017 in order to closely elucidate the participation of an auxin like molecule during the interaction of arabidopsis with four selected bacterial isolates we further analyzed the interaction by inoculating 13 day old dr5 gus plants growing in vitro with selected bacterial isolates several studies have used the dr5 gus transgenic line to monitor auxin regulated gene expression xiao et al 2020 thirteen days post inoculated dr5 gus plants were analyzed under the microscope interestingly arabidopsis inoculated with enterobacter hormaechei rhizopium spp pseudomonas fuorescens and aaule51 undetermined slightly increased the gus activity in the root tips as compared with control plants fig 5a b c d e f g h i j these results strengthen our hypothesis about the involvement of an auxin dependent mechanism in plant growth and root architecture changes in a thaliana mediated by selected bacterial isolates 5 conclusion the study revealed that pepper plants cultivated on dry land are naturally associated with a variety of bacteria that exhibit high tolerance to drought stress and show plant growth promoting traits the pepper plants could therefore act as a resource for bacteria that are capable of directly protecting plants from drought stress our results suggest that flocculation biofilm auxin and eps producing bacteria associated with pepper plants could alleviate drought stress in plants as indicated by improved seedling growth of arabidopsis and pepper plants some pgpb strains such as enterobacter hormaechei rhizobium spp p fluorescens and aaule51 undetermined enhanced the drought stress tolerance in pepper under greenhouse conditions production of eps and biofilm formation bacteria appears to improve their efficiency as pgp bacteria in drought environments possibly by improving soil structure and colonization these findings also suggest that different pgp traits should be considered to identify more efficient pgpb inoculants for agricultural applications in the future funding the authors acknowledge receipt of funding from addis ababa university

exopolysaccharide flocculate data availability the authors confirm that the data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article 1 introduction drought stress is one of the most damaging abiotic stresses that has become more intense in recent decades threatening global food security by reducing agricultural yields abiotic stress has the largest effect on crop production forty five percent of worldwide farming fields are subjected to continuous droughts yadav et al 2020 drought stress could be moderate short or extremely severe and prolonged which restricts the crop yields vurukonda et al 2016 it is also expected to cause serious plant growth problems for more than 50 of the arable lands by 2050 kasim et al 2013 drought stress is one of the major yield affecting factors

agricultural plants alvino et al 1994 moreover drought stress had an impact on harvested pepper fruit yield ficiciyan et al 2021 changes in the structure of plant associated bacterial communities in the root zone towards the selection of assemblages that are adapted to abiotic stress which improves the drought tolerance of plant and promote its health cherif et al 2015 under desert farming conditions there was a difference in the distribution of bacteria at the endosphere rhizosphere and root surrounding soil indicating a selective pressure determined by the plant activity on the structure of the microbiome marasco et al 2012 when pepper plants were inoculated with desert bacterial strains they were more resistant to water shortage than control plants inoculation enhanced the root system up to 40 which improved the plant s ability to uptake water vigani et al 2019 plant characteristics are selected by microbial communities below the ground surface which mitigate the impacts of abiotic stress on plant population marasco et al 2013 pgp bacteria enhance drought tolerance in plants in a variety of ways etesami and maheshwari 2018 including the microbial enzyme acc synthase microorganisms modulate plant hormone homeostasis by generating auxin and producing 1 aminocyclopropane 1 carboxylate acc deaminase to regulate the concentration of the plant stress phytohormone ethylene by decomposing its precursor acc glick 2014 microorganisms produce auxin indole 3 acetic acid iaa cytokinins and gibberellins which help to modify plant hormone balance these phytohormones play an important role in a variety of adaptive responses in plants and they may influence changes in root gene expression and root architecture egamberdieva et al 2017 microorganisms reduce the plant s antioxidant system to lessen the number of reactive oxygen species ros wang et al 2012 exopolysaccharides produced by microorganisms restore the root microenvironment by favoring water retention and protecting plant roots against desiccation rossi et al 2012 microorganisms contribute to enhancing the plant induced systemic tolerance to drought by altering the host physiology and the metabolic processes also the production of exopolysaccharides protects against extreme conditions like desiccation forming a protective capsule around soil aggregates and improving permeability by increasing soil aggregation and maintaining a higher water potential around the roots naseem et al 2018 therefore screening of stress tolerance bacterial strains could be important for advancing the field performance of various crops including pepper the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of selected bacterial strains in reducing environmental stress and promoting the growth of pepper seedlings under drought stress 2 materials and methods 2 1 area of study and sample collection the rhizospheric and endophyte samples were collected from south eastern ethiopia a total of 200 samples were collected from the main pepper plant growing areas of the region in sterile polyethylene bags and stored at 4 c until analysis 2 2 isolation and characterization of bacterial

dark for 2 days murashige and skoog 1962 five day old seedlings were transferred to a new ms ½ agar medium on bipartite plates in which the bacteria inoculum was placed near the root tips thirteen days after inoculation the fresh weight and length of arabidopsis thaliana were measured by comparing them to the un inoculated control plants 2 6 1 gus histochemical assay the auxin inducible system of plants has enabled rapid conditional protein depletion in cultured microbes holland et al 2012 to regulate the activity of auxin in response to both biotic factors a dr5 auxin inducible promoter fused to a gus reporter gene is used it is also shown that microbes from pathogens and benign bacteria modulate root growth and differentiation zolobowska and van gijsegem 2006 studies showed that few beneficial microbes such as pseudomonas sp induce root developmental changes via the secretion of diffused compounds zamioudis et al 2013 to determine whether the growth promotion of arabidopsis thaliana by selected bacterial isolates was due to auxin or auxin related compounds to co cultivate with bacteria a thaliana transgenic line expressing auxin inducible dr5 gus was used histochemical detection of the gus staining was determined in the dr5 gus transgenic line a thaliana seedlings were co inoculated with selected bacterial isolates for 10 days on 0 2 ms media and were incubated at

sensitive to drought at 30 of peg600 table 2 isolates aausr 4 aaure 13 and aausr19 are grouped as highly tolerant because they have an od 0 5 in 30 of pge600 the aaure16 isolate was included in the class of tolerance because the od value fell to 0 487 in 30 of peg600 isolate aausr20 is listed in the class of highly sensitive because the od value decreased to 0 26 in 30 of the peg600 the different asterisk above the number indicates statistically significant differences across different concentrations tukey kramer s hsd test p 0 05 3 3 exopolysaccharide production the production of eps was determined based on both mucoid colony production surrounding the filter paper disc on nutrient agar plate culture medium and precipitate formation in chilled absolute ethanol in a test tube fig 1a b of the 60 pgpbs tested for eps production 54 90 were positive while the remaining 6 10 were negative the highest eps production was recorded by aaule41 pseudomonas fluorescencens followed by aaule51 undetermined at 10 of glucose concentration fig 1a 3 4 biofilm formation 3 4 1 plate method out of 60 isolates twenty nine produced biofilms in both tube and slide methods fig 2a b biofilm detection of endophytic and rhizospheric bacteria was done by the congo red agar method it was observed that the strains producing white colored colonies on cra medium were negative while positive isolates produced black colored colonies which was a typical indication of biofilm production fig 2a in this study it was reported that the nutrient composition of the cra medium especially the supplementation of various salts greatly affected the colony morphology as well as the efficiency of biofilm formation of the rhizospheric and endophytic bacteria the highest biofilm was produced at a 150 mm nacl concentration fig 2c 3 4 2 tube method in this method biofilm formation was detected by the formation of a visible thick film within the wall of the tube and at the bottom of the tube isolates showed a thick film within the bottom of the glass tube indicating strong biofilm formation while other isolates showed no biofilm formation in the glass tubes fig 2b optical density was also measured after washing with methanol sixteen isolates had strong biofilm production od 570 nm 1 isolate showed moderate biofilm production while 12 isolates showed weak biofilm formation at a concentration of 150 mm nacl fig 2c 3 5 estimation of bacterial flocculation bacterial flocculation yield increased gradually with an increase in nacl concentration fig 3 significantly the highest flocculation yield was recorded by aausr23 148 mg l followed by aausr20 134 mg l at 0 5 and 1 0 m of nacl respectively while the lowest was recorded by aausr1 1 8 mg l at 0 m of nacl the yield

bacterial isolates bacterial isolates that could survive under nutrient agar media containing nacl decreased with the increased salinity concentration a total of 60 46 30 and 12 isolates could survive under nacl concentrations of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 m respectively twelve isolates were able to grow at 2 0 m of nacl and were selected as highly salt tolerant strains and labeled as aausr1 uncultured

selected bacterial isolates the number of colony forming units cfu in the nutrient agar medium plate was counted to determine the bacterial population all twelve bacterial isolates showed optimal growth 10 8 cfu ml at 0 m of nacl followed by a steady decline of the bacterial number with the increase in nacl concentration table 4 in comparison to the other eleven strains aausr19 pseudomonas stutzeri had a considerably greater population at 2 0 m nacl 3 8 temperature tolerance test all the selected strains were examined for their ability to grow at 4 c 28 c 37 c 40 c 45 c 50 c 55 c 60 c and 65 c on solid and n liquid nutrient media the bacterial growth was measured using a series of 10 fold dilutions and total plate counts the maximum bacterial population ranging from 8 to 9 12 log 10 cfu ml was recorded at 28 and 37 c however as the temperature increased the growth of all isolates decreased furthermore all the tested bacterial strains except three aausr8 comamonas testostroni aausr23 enterobacter hormaechei and aaufe29 rhizobium sp can tolerate up to 65 c table 5 3 9 heavy metal tolerance test of selected pgpb ten bacterial strains tolerant to 500 µg l were selected and tested for various concentrations of heavy metals amended with nb agar medium 100 500 1000 and 1500 µg l of fe ni cu pb and co table 6 those bacterial strains were found to resist the tested heavy metals with different concentrations ranging from 100 to 1500 µg l for fe 100 1000 µg l for ni 100 1500 µg l for cu 100 1500 µg l for pb and 100 500 µg l for co approximately 70 of strains were able

of 1500 µg l and 10 of strains were tolerant to co at a concentration of 500 µg l 3 10 pot study on water stress of pepper 3 10 1 pot study on water stress after 10 days in the absence of water the non treated pepper plants negative control showed signs of wilting the results of the pot study demonstrated that the plants treated with strain aaule51 unidentified exhibited greater resistance to water stress compared to all other treatments table 8 and fig 4 which showed wilting after 30 days of water stress in the case of aausr23 aaufe29 and aaule41 treatments the plants showed wilting symptoms after 14 14 and 16 days of water stress respectively 3 10 2 the effects of plant growth promoting bacteria on the growth characteristics and survival rate of pepper plants subjected to drought stress 45 days after transplantation pepper seeds treated with different bacterial strains enterobacter hormaechei rhizobium spp pseudomonas fluorescens and aaule51 undetermined strains under drought stress revealed an improvement in plant growth characteristics over untreated seeds after 45 days of transplantation among the different bacterial strains used pseudomonas fluorescens was found to increase the mean root and shoot length of pepper the increase in the mean root 3 cm and shoot length 22 5 cm was greater in seedlings treated with p fluorescens compared to untreated control 1 67 cm and 14 83 cm respectively table 7 in contrast pepper seedlings treated with aaule51 recorded higher fresh and dry weight compared to other treatments table 7 the survival rate and recovery of pepper plants were approximately 66 7 and 100 respectively when inoculated with drought tolerant strain aaule51 whereas none of the plants survived under drought stress without bacterial inoculation table 8 the pepper inoculated with aaule51 undetermined appeared healthy and had the highest values of dry weight fresh weight turgid weight and relative water content whereas pepper inoculated with aaule 41 pseudomonas fluorescens had the longest roots table 7 at the end of the experiment the highest soil moisture reduction was recorded in the isolate aaule41 28 while the lowest was recorded in the isolate aaule51 24 33 table 8 however some significant protection against drought was detected in pepper plants when the aaule51 strain was used as the inoculant aaule51 showed a drought tolerant effect in pepper plants under our assay conditions moreover these findings suggest that only strains with the highest desiccation resistance protect plants from drought 3 10 3 analysis of selected bacterial isolates to promote growth and alter root system architecture through an auxin signaling mechanism in arabidopsis thaliana in vitro tests were conducted to evaluate the plant growth promoting activity of bacterial isolates under in vitro conditions after inoculation of the thirteen day old arabidopsis seedlings with the selected bacterial suspension at a concentration of 5 108 cfu which promoted the growth of the plants by significantly increasing the fresh weight length and the number of lateral roots as compared with the untreated control seedlings fig 5b c d the number of lateral roots per seedling in aaule51 treated seedlings was 15 2 1 9 almost five times more than the lateral roots of the control seedlings which was 4 76 0 5 fig 5a d the fresh weight was 4 88 0 66 mg seedling in aaule51 undetermined treated seedlings compared with the untreated control 2 67 0 66 mg seedling fig 5 a b however except for aaule41 pseudomonas fluorescence no significant difference was observed in the shoot length between the treated and untreated control seedlings fig 5 c our results suggest that the selected bacterial isolates have the potential to promote plant growth by altering the plant root system the response of arabidopsis seedlings to selected bacterial isolates was observed using the dr5 gus transgenic line the primary root tips of 5 day old seedlings co cultivated with enterobacter hormaechei rhizobium spp pseudomonas fluorescens and aaule51 for 13 days showed more gus staining fig 5e f g h compared to the control representing auxin response fig 5i j these results indicated that dr5 gus responded to inoculation with selected bacterial isolates which indicated the production of auxin or an auxin like compound by the bacteria 4 discussion drought being one of the most common environmental problems affecting the growth and development of plants and subsequently agricultural yields and food supply has gained research attention over the years it is indicated that crop production is hampered by water stress which is a major environmental concern and it is important to develop crop varieties with higher yields under water scarcity penella et al 2014 the action of pgpb characteristics can decrease the devastating effects of drought on plants these bacteria are capable of tolerating and surviving in harsh environments through the regulation of phytohormones production of acc deaminase activity accumulation of osmolytes production of volatile compounds and antioxidant defense vurukonda et al 2016 the high osmotic pressure outside bacterial cells causes the fluid inside the cell to diffuse out of the cell so the destruction of microbial cell walls will cause lysis tolerance is a condition where bacteria can survive and persist in a less favorable environment namely drought meanwhile sensitivity is a state in which bacteria cannot tolerate a harsh environment dimichele et al 2020 all the firmibacterial cultures were tested for their drought tolerance in a nutrient broth mixed with peg 6000 to induce the osmotic condition among which 30 peg concentration was taken as criteria for selecting efficient isolates as they had a minimum osmotic potential of 1 03 mpa paul et al 2017 for further experiments previously many research studies have been conducted using peg 6000 up to 25 0 73 mpa for selecting drought tolerant isolates grover et al 2011 sandhya et al 2017 and hence in this study it has been tested up to 35 peg a total of sixty endophyte and rhizosphere bacterial strains were grown in nutrient broth supplemented with peg 6000 at various concentrations of which 20 33 3 strains showed growth up to 35 peg6000 supplementation table 2 among the sixty tested bacterial isolates 8 strains had significantly higher growth compared to other bacterial isolates on od 600 nm 0 5 1 0 od at a concentration of 25 peg6000 in the present study 18 3 of the bacterial isolates that grew in a medium containing 30 peg 1 03 mpa were considered drought tolerant the tolerance is mainly associated with biofilm formation kasim et al 2016 mohammed 2018 flocculation hong et al 2017 bio surfactant tran et al 2008 and eps morcillo and manzanera 2021 production of bacterial strains this is an initial selection of bacterial strains based on their ability to grow in medium and is a fascinating approach for other stress associated assays this feature is very important for degraded land restoration under water stressed conditions by applying such drought tolerant bacterial strains plant growth promoting rhizobacteria pgpr play a vital role in increasing plant growth through a variety of favorable effects on the various soil microflora this is frequently accomplished by building biofilms in the rhizosphere which supply benefits over planktonic bacterial life which are resistant to extreme environments and can protect microbes from ultraviolet uv radiation extreme temperature extreme ph high salinity high pressure poor nutrients and antibiotics by acting as protective clothing yin et al 2019 in the present study 48 3 of bacterial isolates showed the activity of biofilm formation at different nacl concentrations the highest biofilm formation was recorded in isolates aausr13 pseudomonas aeruginosa aaule41 pseudomonas fluorescens and aaule51 undetermined both in slide and tube methods when compared to the control a significant difference in pgpb ability to produce a biofilm was recorded in 100 and 150 mm nacl concentrations in our findings the activity of biofilm formation increased with increasing a nacl concentration especially at 150 mm nacl these findings were consistent with those of kasim et al 2016 who found that biofilm growth protected bacterial cells against increased nutritional and salt stress over time they also added that environmental stress such as nutritional and osmotic stress increases bacterial competition for available nutrients and bacteria shift from planktonic to sessile assemblages at diverse biotic and abiotic surfaces to protect themselves in the rhizosphere furthermore increasing exopolysaccharide production in response to higher salt stress promotes biofilm formation and protects them during assembly by retaining a water layer around the cells by lowering the amount of na available for plant absorption bacterial exopolysaccharide eps can help to alleviate salt stress plant growth promoting rhizobacteria pgpr and their exopolysaccharides eps have a significant impact on plant growth and drought stress resistance under water stress plants inoculated with eps producing bacteria accumulated more proline carbohydrates and free amino acids naseem et al 2018 all of the selected drought tolerant bacterial isolates showed the ability to produce eps flocculate and form biofilms when exposed to saline media as compared to non saline media bacterial cells could form close attachments or interactions with the root systems of plants considerably improving moisture retention and abiotic stress a concomitant increase in floc yield was observed with increasing nacl concentration in all tested isolates when compared to the control the maximum floc yield was recorded in most of the bacterial isolates at 1 m nacl concentration table 4 however enterobacter hormaechei aausr 23 showed the highest floc yield at 0 5 m of nacl concentration 0 15 g l these findings regarding increased floc yield at various nacl concentrations back up a previous report hong et al 2017 who discovered that increasing nacl concentration up to 2 m and increased flocculation are important to the change in adhesion of bacterial strains plant growth promoting rhizobacteria with eps producing features chelate a variety of cations including na and it has been discovered that under salt stress bacteria can bond with the na ion via eps secretion reducing its toxicity in the soil shultana et al 2020 biosurfactants are extensively induced by bacteria yeast and fungi which have low molecular weight surface active compounds which are produced by soil microbes and provide the soil with wettability as well as allow for proper chemical fertilizer dispersion in the soil supporting the promotion of plant growth biosurfactants can be produced economically for a variety of uses in the pharmaceutical cosmetics food and agriculture industries because they are less harmful and environmentally friendly many rhizosphere and plant related bacteria produce biosurfactant which is important for motility signaling and biofilm formation implying that biosurfactant regulates plant microbe interactions sachdev and cameotra 2013 it can also be used in agriculture to eliminate plant pathogens and increase nutrient bioavailability for beneficial plant associated microorganisms raj et al 2021 biosurfactants can be used to improve the quality of agricultural soils through soil remediation sachdev and cameotra 2013 the results of this study show that among 60 bacterial isolates 31 67 produced biosurfactants bacillus thruringienesis aausr2 pseudomonas fluorescens aaule 29 enterobacter hormaechei aausr 23 pseudomonas putida aaule 27 and aaule51 undetermined had the highest production of biosurfactants this is comparable with the frequency of 1 3 reported previously by tran et al 2008 and found that biosurfactant producing fluorescent pseudomonads isolated from the black pepper rhizosphere varied from 6 to 60 depending on the soil type whereas only 6 of sugar beet rhizosphere isolates were able to produce biosurfactants nielsen et al 2006 salinity is one of the soil stresses which decreases pepper production in desert areas salt stress is one of the world s fastest growing environmental stresses salt stress affects 22 of the world s cultivated land and 33 of the world s irrigated land which is increasing rapidly by an average rate of 10 every year abbas et al 2019 the accumulation of na in plants causes cell death and osmotic stress in plants by suppressing photosynthesis and producing reactive oxygen species ros which cause dna damage membrane injury protein denaturation and cell wall degeneration it also disrupts osmotic equilibrium resulting in turgidity damage cell dryness and cell death abbas et al 2019 many studies have been conducted to address this issue including the use of salt tolerant pgpb in this study twelve bacterial isolates were chosen from a pool of sixty isolates based on their tolerance to high salt conditions these four selected strains exhibit plant growth promoting properties in vitro and under greenhouse conditions according to yan et al 2015 the impact of salinity and water content on soil microorganisms was evaluated and the plant growth promoting properties decreased gradually with increased salt concentration salt tolerant bacterial strains have been shown to have high nitrogenase activity under saline conditions and can produce osmolytes to maintain cell turgidity and metabolism under unfavorable conditions in this study one isolate of pseudomonas stutzeri aausr 19 was able to retain a significantly high bacterial population at 1 5 m of nacl amended media which is similar to the findings of a previous report qurashi and sabri 2011 bacterial eps production is an important salt tolerant trait because it can reduce the harmful effect of osmotic stress in plants by increasing fresh weight dry weight and water content ghosh et al 2019 heat stress caused by global climate change can have a severe impact on the growth and yield of temperature sensitive crops increased temperature reduced agricultural output by influencing biochemical physiological molecular and morphological aspects alone or in combination with other abiotic stresses the application of plant growth promoting bacteria pgpb results in an ecofriendly approach to improve agricultural crop production and combat the negative effects of heat stress khan et al 2020a the role of microbes in the control of abiotic and biotic stresses has been recognized and much attention has been paid to the use of pgpb as a promising alternative to reducing plant heat stress in the present study of 60 isolates 14 were grown at 55 0c and 11 at 65 c among the tested isolates bacillus spp exhibited a higher tolerance to temperature than other gram negative bacteria the possible reason for the higher heat tolerance is due to the induction of heat shock proteins schumann 2017 and also the presence of dormant endospores produced by bacillus spp which increases their tolerance to high temperatures reineke and mathys 2020 phytoremediation is a new environmentally benign way of removing or immobilizing heavy metals from the environment using plants plant growth promoting bacteria pgpb that are resistant to heavy metals are an essential strategy for enhancing biomass production and increasing plant tolerance to heavy metals tirry et al 2018 in our study sixty bacterial isolates were originally isolated for the different morphological appearances of their colonies on nb agar medium all the bacteria were multiresistant to several heavy metals resistance of the selected ten bacterial isolates to heavy metals at different concentrations is summarized in table 6 all of the tested bacterial isolates were shown to be resistant to the heavy metals approximately 70 of isolates were able to grow at 500 µg l of concentrations 90 of isolates resist 500 µg l of fe concentrations 60 of isolates resisted 500 µg l of cu concentrations 90 of isolates resisted 500 µg l of pb concentrations and 10 of isolates resisted 500 µg l of co concentration all heavy metals tested were completely tolerant to p polymyxa strain a calcoaceticus p putida and p fluorescens at 300 µg ml getahun et al 2020 azzam and tawfik 2015 reported pseudomonas sp showed a 97 9 pb 93 5 cd and 68 cu removal efficiency from contaminated industrial waste water the isolates that have a high tolerance to metals could be useful in the bioremediation of heavy metal polluted environments this could be done by removing converting harmful contaminants like heavy metals into less harmful substances and or degrading organic substances and finally mineralizing of organic substances into carbon dioxide water and nitrogen gas plants response to water stress is a complicated process that appears to entail the synthesis of polyamines as well as the emergence of a new group of proteins whose function is unknown drought reduces the availability of co2 for photosynthesis which can lead to the formation of reactive oxygen species from misdirected electrons in the photosystems in addition free radicals are produced during abiotic stresses reactive oxygen species ros such as superoxide radical o2 hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals oh cause membrane lipid peroxidation saravanakumar et al 2011 the ability of four selected drought tolerant bacteria to protect plants from drought was tested using pepper plants all four bacterial isolates were previously isolated in our laboratory enterobacter hormaechei rhizobium sp pseudomonas fluorecens and undetermined aaule51 for negative control we used non inoculated plants plants were inoculated and subjected to drying conditions as described in the methods and materials section after 30 days in the absence of water non inoculated pepper plants showed signs of dying fig 4a vílchez et al 2016 tested the ability of five bacterial strains namely microbacterium sp 3j1 arthrobacter koreensis 5j12a a siccitolerans 4j27 rhodococcus sp 4j2a2 and leucobacter sp 4j7b1 and found that all microorganisms showed high tolerance to desiccation protecting pepper and tomato from drought however pepper plants inoculated with the most drought tolerant isolates undetermined aaule51 and rhizobium spp as well as with enterobacter hormaechei and pseudomonas fluorescens appeared healthy and yielded the highest values of dry weight fresh weight turgid weight and relative water content and had the longest roots and stems at the end of the experiment compared to the uninoculated pepper plants table 7 these findings suggest that only isolates with the highest desiccation resistance protect plants from drought plant tissues increase ethylene production under abiotic stress and an increased concentration of ethylene in plants can inhibit plant growth bleecker and kende 2000 the acc deaminase produced by pgpr can reduce plant ethylene concentration by cleaving the ethylene precursor acc consequently the plants maintain normal growth siddikee et al 2011 the selected drought resistant bacterial isolates might be able to reduce the ethylene concentration of pepper plants by cleaving acc under drought stress and hence increase plant growth and resist desiccation sustainable agriculture will be more beneficial with the characterization of beneficial microorganisms and appropriate formulations for moderating biotic and abiotic stress in crop plants in drought is one of the most common abiotic stresses that plants face and it can limit their growth relative water content rwc is an important indicator of drought stress the higher rwc is an indicator of drought tolerance in black pepper krishnamurthy et al 1998 rwc and transpiration rates are significantly reduced in plants exposed to drought drought tolerant cultivars have an improved water use efficiency as compared to susceptible cultivars this effect in drought tolerant plants may be due to increased biomass accumulation and low evapotranspiration because of stomatal closure abdelaal et al 2021 one of the first responses to drought is a reduction in rwc which is frequently followed by a reduction in leaf water potential and stomatal closure noctor et al 2014 moreover stomatal closing is linked to higher leaf temperatures which causes protein denaturation and compromises membrane stability photosynthesis mineral nutrition ion transport and amino acid synthesis varshikar and tan 2017 in order to closely elucidate the participation of an auxin like molecule during the interaction of arabidopsis with four selected bacterial isolates we further analyzed the interaction by inoculating 13 day old dr5 gus plants growing in vitro with selected bacterial isolates several studies have used the dr5 gus transgenic line to monitor auxin regulated gene expression xiao et al 2020 thirteen days post inoculated dr5 gus plants were analyzed under the microscope interestingly arabidopsis inoculated with enterobacter hormaechei rhizopium spp pseudomonas fuorescens and aaule51 undetermined slightly increased the gus activity in the root tips as compared with control plants fig 5a b c d e f g h i j these results strengthen our hypothesis about the involvement of an auxin dependent mechanism in plant growth and root architecture changes in a thaliana mediated by selected bacterial isolates 5 conclusion the study revealed that pepper plants cultivated on dry land are naturally associated with a variety of bacteria that exhibit high tolerance to drought stress and show plant growth promoting traits the pepper plants could therefore act as a resource for bacteria that are capable of directly protecting plants from drought stress our results suggest that flocculation biofilm auxin and eps producing bacteria associated with pepper plants could alleviate drought stress in plants as indicated by improved seedling growth of arabidopsis and pepper plants some pgpb strains such as enterobacter hormaechei rhizobium spp p fluorescens and aaule51 undetermined enhanced the drought stress tolerance in pepper under greenhouse conditions production of eps and biofilm

9338,soil salinization is the major factor affecting the sustainable development of agriculture in the kaidu river irrigation district krid in xinjiang province china to better understand water and salt variation regularity in the krid this study established a watershed scale distributed water and salt transport model for the krid based on the new soil and water assessment tool with a salinity module swat salt its point source salt module and irrigation water salt module were modified in the study to obtain more accurate simulation results based on evaluation indices the simulation results of streamflow salt loading and crop yield showed that the modified model can more accurately depict water and salt transport processes in the krid and has good applicability according to the simulation results the average annual amount of water and salt entering bosten lake through the drainage canal accounted for 15 and 51 reaching 4 29 108 m3 and 57 87 104 t respectively the drainage and salt discharge during winter irrigation accounted for 69 and 74 reaching 2 95 108 m3 and 42 47 104 t respectively however the regions along bosten lake had high groundwater and soil salinity facing a risk of increased salinization and necessitating land or water management to decrease salinization in conclusion the modified swat salt can be applied in agricultural irrigation areas with more diverse irrigation sources and is a useful tool for investigating and assessing watershed scale salinization as well as implementing targeted management strategies to reduce salinization keywords swat swat salt watershed scale agricultural irrigation areas water and salt transport spatial and temporal variation 1 introduction soil salinization is one of the key limiting constraints for crop growth in arid and semiarid areas salt overload has been linked to reduced crop yields soil compaction and deterioration of water quality mirlas 2012 tanji and kielen 2002 wang et al 2018 taking xinjiang in the interior of northwestern china as an example the region has plentiful inland light and heat resources as well as being a significant cotton and grain production area in china however soil salinization has been a severe challenge for agriculture in the region due to insufficient rainfall excessive evaporation and high groundwater salinity currently xinjiang has 1 1 107 hectares of saline soil accounting for over one third of china s total saline soil area chen et al 2010 wang et al 2001 therefore it is of great importance to analyze water and salt transport regularity in xinjiang to implement land and water management strategies according to local conditions improve soil salinization optimize water allocation increase crop water productivity promote sustainable development of local agriculture and ensure food security traditionally field experiments are a direct method of obtaining variations in soil water and salt liu and tian 2005 studied the dynamic changes and equilibrium of salinity in submembrane drip irrigation with cotton and the results showed that salinity was strongly aggregated in the 0 40 cm soil layer between membranes at the seedling stage and in the 0 20 cm soil layer between membranes at the end of the reproductive period wang et al 2012a conducted a three year field experiment on a saline wasteland in xinjiang china and set up five water treatments based on the soil water matric potential all of which showed a decrease in soil salinity and determined that irrigation of cotton was triggered when the soil water matric potential was 10 kpa for the first three years of reclaiming the saline wasteland liang and shi 2021 designed an intercropping system between cotton and two saline plants to analyze the effect of improving soil salinization and the intercropping system was effective in reducing soil salt accumulation compared to monoculture cotton field experiments can be set up with different treatments according to research needs and used to analyze water and salt changes under different production conditions however it is time consuming and laborious to use experiments as the only way to understand the regularity especially when applied to different farm environments and hydrological years santhi et al 2006 to overcome the limitations of field experiments numerical models are used to provide a more accurate analysis and prediction of water and salt regularity as well as crop development processes wang et al 2012b constructed a field scale two dimensional numerical model of water and salt transport based on experimental data from agricultural fields in yanqi xinjiang using winter wheat as the research object formulated a reasonable irrigation system by analyzing the water demand regularity of wheat and soil salt changes and determined 2 5 m as a reasonable groundwater regulation burial depth in arid and saline soil areas based on the optimized irrigation water volume and irrigation system yuan 2020 used the swap model to analyze the process of soil water salt dynamics in saline wastelands through field experiments in the hetao irrigation district and the results showed that saline wastelands are a drainage and salt discharge region for cultivated land that plays a key role in adjusting and maintaining the salt dynamic balance in irrigation area gao et al 2020 added soil salinity simulation to the awpm sg model and explored the effects of different groundwater depths and groundwater salinities on corn growth based on field experiments the smaller the groundwater depth is the smaller the irrigation water productivity of corn at the same salinity and the higher the salinity is the smaller the irrigation water productivity of corn at the same groundwater depth ning et al 2021 used the hydrus 2d model with modified root water uptake combined with crop water productivity to evaluate the results of soil salinity plant water and crop yield in different irrigation scenarios under film mulched drip irrigation conditions in dry northwest china providing a reference for optimizing irrigation systems and agricultural management davoodi et al 2019 evaluated the drainmod s model to predict the process of water salt change in three subsurface drainage systems in northern iranian paddy fields which better captured the trend of groundwater depth and drainage water salinity and the deeper drains were the more salt load when the drain spacing was the same in a growing season with less rainfall field scale experiments and simulations can explain water salt and crop growth under specific conditions and predict future trends but these models can t account for different atmospheric boundaries and land use types when dealing with boundary conditions and source sink terms and their conclusions and recommendations aren t directly applicable on regional scales where soil water salinity cropping structure irrigation systems and climate characteristics are highly variable santhi et al 2006 in response many scholars have done regional research on water and salt transport classical statistics geo statistics neural networks and remote sensing techniques lal and datta 2020 panagopoulos et al 2006 sahbeni 2021 shi et al 2020 xu et al 2019 can be used to better understand and quantify overall soil water salt trends and reflect regional water salt spatial variability however these methods are impacted by algorithm optimization and indicator weights which have substantial limits for studying various environmental circumstances and predicting future water salt processes in contract physically process based numerical models can be used to quantify the water salt behavior of a regional system in response to system properties and system inputs zhong 2008 used the groundwater model modflow as the basic framework to divide the arid oasis area into three kinds of calculation cells irrigation cells town country cells and ecological cells and calculated the water and solute transport processes in each cell based on the water salt balance principle which can be used to guide the sustainable use of groundwater in the oasis area tavakoli kivi et al 2019 added a new salinity equilibrium chemistry sec module to the uzf rt3d model bailey et al 2013 to simulate the movement and transformation processes of eight ions which better reflects the spatial and temporal trends of salinity in soils and aquifers and the salt load in streams bailey et al 2019 presented a new soil and water assessment tool with a salinity module swat salt that simulates the fate and transport of salt in surface runoff soil percolation lateral flow groundwater and streams in a watershed and tested and applied it in a salinity impaired irrigated region which can be used to explore measures to control salinization wen et al 2020 proposed a semi distributed model to simulate the monthly drainage water and salinity in the hetao irrigation district which can consider the processes of surface return flow and groundwater drainage but it is only a conceptual model that cannot specifically describe the physical processes of water and salt and its applicability is somewhat limited in addition these models as published do not consider the model the effects of salt stress on crop growth an important aspect of water and salinity management for future years given the lack of systematic analysis the objectives of this study are to use the swat salt model to simulate water and salt transport regularity in the krid first we modified the swat salt model to 1 include salt loading in irrigation water originating from outside the model domain and 2 include the effects of soil salinity on crop growth second we calibrated and validated the modified model and compared the simulation results before and after the model modification to evaluate the applicability of the modified model finally we analyzed the spatial and temporal in the variation regularity of water and salt in the krid based on simulated results providing a reference for salinity management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the kaidu

50 60 and annual rainfall of 50 7 79 9 mm rusuli et al 2015 wang 2013 zhang et al 2006 corn wheat tomatoes and peppers are the principal crops grown in the krid s agricultural cultivated land which is around 2 05 105 hectares the krid is an important production base of characteristic agricultural goods in xinjiang in the krid soil salinization is widespread with significantly salinized land accounting for 35 32 of cultivated land the most common forms of salty soil are chloride sulfate and sulfate li et al 2010 the average groundwater salinity in the krid is 4 00 g l 1 with a minimum of 0 52 g l 1 and a maximum of 20 25 g l 1 the salinity of groundwater comprises eight types of ions so4 ca mg na k cl co3 and hco3 with so4 na cl and hco3 accounting for over 90 of the total salt ion content wang et al 2007a dashankou hydrological station yanqi hydrological station huangshuigou hydrological station and keerguti hydrological station are the four hydrological stations in the krid the kaidu river is the krid s largest river and the only one entering bosten lake all year the annual average flow is 39 64 108 m3 the salinity of the upstream river is 348 mg l 1 and the salinity of the downstream river is 395 mg l 1 over the years the average quantity of salt entering the irrigated region has been 125 104 t with hco3 ca and mg being the primary ions in the river accounting for

the soil and water assessment tool swat is a continuous in time physically based semi distributed watershed hydrological model arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 that is developed for the long term prediction of water quality and hydrological implications of various land and water management practices the model is split into multiple subbasins based on topography elevation river networks and water systems the subbasins are separated into relatively independent hydrological response units hrus based on land use soil type and slope a load of water sediment and nutrients is calculated in each hru which is then aggregated in the subbasin and calculated to the tributaries finally the confluence is calculated into the main river channel to obtain the result of the outlet of the basin the swat model is based on the water balance calculating rainfall evapotranspiration surface runoff soil percolation lateral flow groundwater and revap and simulating the hydrological cycle of the basin through the atmosphere land surface and river channels in addition different operations in agricultural management such as crop planting irrigation fertilization and harvesting can be timed to simulate crop growth nutrient migration and transformation process which are used to solve agricultural water quality and environmental problems 2 2 2 overview of the swat salt model although the swat model can simulate the fate and transport of nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus pesticides and sediment it does not include the fate and transport of salt in its source code bailey et al 2019 modified the swat modeling code to include a salt module based on the salt module presented in tavakoli kivi et al 2019 for a groundwater irrigated watershed system the swat salt model uses salt ion mass balance for the soil layers of each hru the aquifer of each hru and the stream channel of each subbasin for 8 major ions so4 ca mg na k cl co3 hco3 salt ion mass is transported in each major hydrologic pathway in the watershed including surface runoff soil lateral flow soil percolation leaching groundwater flow and streamflow with salt loading to streams equal to the summation of salt loading in surface runoff soil lateral flow and groundwater discharge the module includes the precipitation dissolution of five salt minerals in the soil layers and aquifer caco3 mgco3 caso4 mgso4 nacl with complexation and cation exchange chemical reactions also included the module uses solute equilibrium chemistry for simulating chemical reactions bailey et al 2019 the module also simulates the loading of salt mass to the soil profile via saline irrigation water from both surface water subbasin channel and groundwater aquifer sources the mass balance in the hru soil layer system for a daily time step is formulated as 1 s i s o i l j s i s o i l j 1 s i i r r i g s i s o i l d i s s s i r e v a p s i s o i l p r e c i p s i s u r f s i l a t s i p e r c where s i soil j represents

salt ion in irrigation water kg ha 1 s i soil diss represents the dissolution of salt minerals into the i th salt ion mass kg ha 1 in the soil layer s i revap represents the i th salt ion mass added to the soil layer via upflux from the shallow aquifer kg ha 1 s i soil precip represents precipitation of salt minerals dissolved in the i th salt ion mass kg ha 1 in the soil layer s i surf represents the i th salt ion mass removed via surface runoff kg ha 1 s i lat represents the i th salt ion mass removed via soil lateral kg ha 1 s i perc represents the i th salt ion mass removed via percolation from the bottom of the soil layer kg ha 1 the above variables without explanation all represent the result on day j at a daily time step the mass balance in the aquifer for each hru is as follows 2 s i g w j s i g w j 1 s i p e r c s i a q u d i s s s i a q u p r e c i p s i r e v a p s i g w f l o w s i g w s e e p where s i gw j represents the mass of the i th salt ion in the aquifer layer on day j kg ha 1 s i gw j 1 represents the mass of the i th salt ion in the aquifer layer on day j 1 kg ha 1 s i aqu diss represents the dissolution of salt minerals into the i th salt ion mass kg ha 1 in the aquifer layer s i aqu precip represents precipitation of salt minerals from dissolving the i th salt ion mass kg ha 1 in the aquifer layer s i gwflow represents the i th salt ion mass removed from the aquifer via groundwater discharge to the subbasin stream kg ha 1 s i gwseep represents the i th salt ion mass removed from the shallow aquifer discharge to the deep aquifer kg ha 1 the above variables without explanation all represent the result on day j the plant growth component of the swat model is a simplified version of the epic plant growth module water stress temperature stress nitrogen stress and phosphorus stress are four primary stress factors that the plant growth component considers while simulating the plant growth process the swat salt model simulates the salt ion concentration of soil water during plant growth salt stress is calculated using the equation 3 k s 1 b r 100 c r θ k c o n v θ s a e c where k s represents salt stress b r represents the reduction factor ds m 1 c r represents the soil salt concentration tds summation of the 8 ions mg l 1 θ represents the average soil water content of the soil layer m3 m 3 θ s represents the soil water content at saturation of the soil layer m3 m 3 k conv represents the conversion factor of soil water tds mg l 1 and soil water conductivity ecw ds m 1 mg l 1 ds m 1 and a ec represents the electrical conductivity of the saturation extract of the soil above which salt stress occurs ds m 1 according to the study of maas and hoffman 1977 k conv takes 640 1 ds m 1 640 mg l 1 k s is multiplied by the water stress coefficient to restrict plant transpiration as follows 5 e t s e t w s t r s k s where e t s represents the actual plant transpiration mm d 1 e t represents the maximum potential plant transpiration mm d 1 and w strs represents the stress of water the plant growth regulating factor used to quantify the fraction of potential growth achieved on a given day was calculated by considering k s as follows 6 γ r e g 1 max w s t r s k s t s t r s n s t r s p s t r s where γ reg represents the plant growth factor 0 1 and t strs n strs and p strs represent the stress of temperature nitrogen and phosphorus respectively 2 2 3 modified swat salt model for this study the swat salt modeling code was modified to account for monthly salt point source loads and salt mass in irrigation water originating from outside the model domain when considering the point source salt module input the original module can only be input according to the daily time step not the monthly time step in this study point source salt module subroutines such as recmon f readmon f and rtout f were modified according to the available hydrological station observations and the monthly average loading kg mon 1 of eight ions so4 ca mg na k cl co3 and hco3 was added to the point source input files of the appropriate subbasin in addition the swat salt model can only simulate the loading of salt mass to the soil profile via saline irrigation water from both surface water subbasin channel and groundwater aquifer sources in the irrigation water salt module bailey et al 2019 but not from outside the modeled watershed because irrigation water from outside watersheds was used in this study to set up the irrigation operation using the krid diversion irrigation methods the irrigation water salt module subroutines such as salt irrig f salt read f and simulated f were modified to include the salinity of irrigation water originating from outside watersheds which is calculated as follows 7 s i irrig w irrig 1000 a hru s i conc 1000 where s i irrig represents the mass of the i th salt ion in irrigation water kg ha 1 w irrig represents the amount of irrigation water mm ahru represents the area of hru ha and s i conc represents the concentration of the i th salt ion in irrigation water mg l 1 concentrations of each of the 8 salt ions for outside water is included in the appropriate input file the salt ion concentrations in the kaidu river were approximated to be equivalent to the irrigation water salt concentration to generalize the original model input and the appropriate file was used as input to run the model 2 3 input data and model construction the arcswat interface winchell et al 2013 based on swat2012 was used to prepare input files of the swat salt model the digital elevation model dem with 30 m precision was provided by geospatial data cloud https www gscloud cn the land use map at a resolution of 30 m was obtained by the institute of geographic science and natural resources research cas data on soil maps at a scale of 1 1000 000 was acquired from the harmonized world soil database hwsd the china national meteorological science data center provided the data for the yanqi and korla meteorological stations and cfsr https swat tamu edu provided missing measurement data and solar radiation monthly runoff and ion concentration data were obtained by the xinjiang tarim river basin authority and the bayingoleng mongol autonomous prefecture water resources bureau respectively crop yield data was provided by the xinjiang statistical yearbook table 1 lists the data sources and descriptions used for the swat salt model because the krid s topography is relatively flat and the watershed includes both the natural kaidu river and artificially constructed diversion and drainage canals the model is unable to extract the river network water system directly based on the dem so the main artificial drainage canals in the irrigation area are generalized for the construction of the river network water system using google earth identification and manual drawing to obtain the corresponding river network systems and subbasins the dem was processed using the principles of the elevation increment iterative algorithm martz and garbrecht 1998 and burn in algorithm saunders and maidment 1996 figs 2a and 2b depict the primary land use types and soil types in the watershed the cultivated field in the basin accounts for 58 71 of the total area and the cultivated land is divided into four primary crops corn wheat tomato and pepper according to the crop cultivation structure of the krid according to the 2010 2020 xinjiang statistical yearbook the average cultivated land ratio of the four crops is 16 4 35 4 20 1 28 1 and the cultivated field type agrr was redefined based on the matching crop cultivation ratio a total of 33 subbasins and 337 hrus were divided in the final model fig 2c the initial salt ion concentration of groundwater in each subbasin in the model was determined using groundwater observation wells in the krid in 2005 where the magnitude of eight ion concentrations was mentioned in the research by wang et al 2007b the initial content fractions of caco3 and caso4 in the soil layer were set according to the 1 m depth soil layer investigated by the world soil database hwsd fao iiasa isric isscas jrc 2012 and the initial content fractions of other salt minerals were set to 0 which was used as the objective function for subsequent salt parameters calibration and validation the initial salt ion concentration in the soil layer is the same as in the groundwater setting and the initial salt mineral content fraction in the aquifer is the same as in the soil layer setting both differences can be considered by adjusting the salt ion concentration and salt mineral content in the soil layer and shallow aquifer over a warm up period of several years bailey et al 2019 the solubility product parameters of salt minerals were the same used as in determined from relevant research bailey et al 2019 tavakoli kivi et al 2019 which are based on published values in chemistry literature the salt loading kg in the upper reaches of the kaidu river and huangshuigou river was calculated based on the monthly average salt ion concentration mg l 1 multiplied by the streamflow m3 s 1 and added to the swat point source input file for the corresponding subbasins in monthly time steps according to the modified salt point source input format moreover the automatic fertilization operation was configured in the management file to investigate the impact of salt stress on crop growth nitrogen stress was not taken into account hence the nitrogen stress factor was set to 1 0 auto nstrs 1 0 the primary crops irrigation system was based on the xinjiang agricultural irrigation water quota and combined with field investigations in the krid 2 4 model parameter calibration and validation 2 4 1 streamflow parameters the model ran from 2005 to 2020 with the warm up phase being 2005 2009 the calibration period being from 2010 to 2015 and the validation period being from 2016 to 2020 for sensitivity analysis calibration and validation of the selected 22 parameters relevant to streamflow table 2 the sufi 2 algorithm in the swat cup swat calibration and uncertainty programs abbaspour 2007 program was used for analysis the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was used as the objective function after four iterations of 2000 simulations and the parameters were altered after each iteration to constantly minimize the error between the simulated and observed values to get the ideal parameters according to table 2 trnsrch is the most sensitive runoff parameter since the kaidu river in the arid area is susceptible to seasonal hydrology and the majority of the runoff is lost through riverbed infiltration during reach transmission besides the effective hydraulic conductivity of channel ch k2 and delay time for aquifer recharge gw delay are also strongly sensitive in the arid watershed 2 4 2 salinity parameters manual calibration was performed to alter the parameters for the salt simulation the hwsd investigated the content of caco3 and caso4 in each soil but did not record the content of nacl as a result the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse is used as the objective function to adjust the content of nacl to minimize the error between the simulated and observed values the fraction of nacl content was adjusted according to the conductivity investigated for each soil table 3 lists the calibration results of the initial and optimal values of the salt mineral content parameters 2 4 3 crop parameters the crop parameters and value ranges selected in the research of other scholars nair et al 2011 ouyang et al 2015 were combined with the characteristics of the study area to calibrate the crop yield wheat and corn yields per hectare kg ha 1 in the four counties yanqi hejing heshuo and bohu in the study area were taken as observed values based on the xinjiang statistical yearbook and the salt stress threshold parameters of the crop in the swat salt model were considered and the correlation coefficient r2 and percentage bias pbias were used as the objective functions to minimize the error between the simulated and observed values of the average yields of wheat and corn in the subbasins where the four counties were located by manually adjusting the relevant parameters and comparing the yields of the crop without considering the salt stress conditions table 4 lists the calibration results of the initial and fitted values of crop yield parameters 2 4 4 evaluation indices the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias moriasi et al 2007 moriasi et al 2015 were chosen as goodness of fit indices to evaluate the swat salt model performance r2 has a range of values from 0 to 1 the closer r2 is to 1 the greater the model correlation r2 more than 0 5 is considered acceptable whereas r2 larger than 0 8 is regarded as excellent nse takes values in the range of 1 a larger nse indicates better model applicability when nse is less than 0 5 the results are unacceptable when nse is between 0 5 and 0 7 the results are acceptable when nse is greater than 0 8 the performance is deemed excellent pbias indicates the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than the observations positive values indicate model underestimation bias negative values indicate model overestimation bias and its optimal value is 0 when pbias is greater than 15 the results are unacceptable when pbias is between 10 and 15 the results are acceptable when pbias is less than 5 the results are excellent the following equations are used to calculate these statistical indices 8 r 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs q sim i q sim i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 i 1 n q sim i q sim 2 2 9 n s e 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 10 p b i a s i 1 n q obs i q sim i i 1 n q obs i 100 where n is the number of data points in the whole observation and simulation period i is the time step q obs i is the observed value q sim i is the simulated value q obs is the arithmetic mean of the observed value and q sim is the arithmetic mean of the simulated value 3 results and analysis 3 1 calibration and validation of simulation results 3 1 1 streamflow the best simulation result was obtained after automatically calibrating the streamflow parameters as shown in fig 3 during the calibration period the average monthly streamflow simulation evaluation indices r2 was 0 89 nse was 0 82 and pbias was 8 80 during the validation period r2 was 0 96 nse was 0 95 and pbias was 7 00 the validation period s nse was greater than the calibration period s and the validation period s simulation accuracy was higher the simulation results of the two periods performed well and had a strong correlation according to the relevant index evaluation standards in the calculation results of the average monthly streamflow during the calibration period the average monthly measured and simulated flow was 73 04 m3 s 1 and 79 45 m3 s 1 respectively during the validation period the average monthly measured and simulated flow was 101 82 m3 s 1 and 94 64 m3 s 1 respectively which was consistent with the pbias results the good streamflow simulation results lay the foundation for the accuracy of subsequent salt transport simulations in the krid table 5 shows the streamflow evaluation indices for the calibration and validation periods 3 1 2 total salt loading the best simulation results were obtained after calibrating and validating the salt parameters as shown in fig 4 during the calibration period the average monthly salt loading simulation evaluation indices r2 was 0 81 nse was 0 78 and pbias was 4 30 during the validation period r2 was 0 93 nse was 0 91 and pbias was 8 30 the validation period s nse was higher than the calibration period s which was consistent with the streamflow simulation results while the calibration period s pbias was better than the validation period s the simulation results of the two periods performed well and had a strong correlation according to the relevant index evaluation standards in the calculation results of the average monthly salt loading during the calibration period the average monthly measured and simulated salt loading was 5 72 107 kg and 5 96 107 kg respectively during the validation period the average monthly measured and simulated salt loading was 7 46 107 kg and 6 84 107 kg respectively table 5 shows the salt loading evaluation indices for the calibration and validation periods the comparison of simulated and observed salt loading levels at the yanqi hydrological station before and after the model modification is shown in fig 5a when just the irrigation water salt module was modified the average annual salt loading simulated by yanqi hydrological station was 5 55 107 kg when just the point source salt module was modified the average annual salt loading was 72 5 107 kg after two modules were modified the average annual salt loading was 76 3 107 kg whereas the measured was 78 1 107 kg after modifying two modules the salt loading simulated was closer to the observed the total salt loading entering bosten lake through the kaidu river and drainage canal before and after module modification is shown in fig 5b when just the irrigation water salt module was modified the average annual total salt loading into the lake was 49 6 107 kg when just the point source salt module was modified the average annual total salt loading was 84 8 107 kg after two modules were modified the average annual salt loading was 112 2 107 kg whereas other researchers studies dong et al 2006 zhong and dong 2008 found that the average annual salt loading into the lake was 110 7 107 115 8 107 kg as a result the salt loading simulation results after modifying two modules were better demonstrating the need to modify the model 3 1 3 crop yield this study solely calibrated the yield simulation results for wheat and corn since the unit hectares yield of tomato and pepper was not published in the xinjiang statistical yearbook as shown in figs 6a and 6b the best simulation results were obtained after calibrating the crop yield parameters considering the influence of salt stress the simulated evaluation indices of wheat yield r2 was 0 81 and pbias was 0 40 the simulated evaluation indices of corn yield r2 was 0 54 and pbias was 0 30 without considering the influence of salt stress the simulated evaluation indices of wheat yield r2 was 0 74 and pbias was 3 90 the simulated evaluation indices of corn yield r2 was 0 53 and pbias was 5 60 when the salt stress module was added to the model the simulation effect of crop yield was better and the fitting accuracy was higher in the calculation results of the average crop yield the average measured wheat yield of the four counties yanqi county hejing county heshuo county and bohu county was 6584 9 kg ha 1 the average simulated yield of wheat with salt stress and without salt stress was 6559 5 kg ha 1 and 6844 6 kg ha 1 respectively the average measured yield of corn was 11 624 0 kg ha 1 and the average simulated yield of corn with salt stress and without salt stress was 11 593 5 kg ha 1 and 12 271 4 kg ha 1 respectively as a result the swat salt model with the salt stress module can predict crop yield more accurately than the swat model in the salinized agricultural irrigation region table 5 shows the simulation evaluation indices of wheat and corn yield in conclusion the distributed water salt transport swat salt model established in this study with the krid as the representative of the northwest arid oasis agricultural irrigation area has good applicability and can better reflect the water salt transport process in the krid based on the evaluation indices of model simulation and the comparison of the effects before and after model modification the model can be used in agricultural irrigation areas with more diverse irrigation sources and provides an important technical tool for water and salt regularity in agriculture oriented arid and semiarid irrigation areas 3 2 analysis of drainage and salt discharge the krid is situated in a semi arid inland arid region with less rainfall irrigation is carried out mainly by the diversion of water from the kaidu river as a result the irrigation infiltration drainage process is the primary driving force behind salt diversion salt leaching and salt discharge in the krid the change in salt within the year is similar to the change process of streamflow which follows the regularity of water and salt movement of salt comes with water and salt goes with water according to an analysis of the interannual variation regularity of water and salt entering bosten lake figs 7a and 7b from 2010 to 2020 the average annual amount of water entering the lake through the kaidu river and drainage canal accounted for 84 49 and 15 51 of the total lake input reaching 23 38 108 m3 and 4 29 108 m3 respectively the average annual quantity of salt loading entering the lake through the kaidu river and drainage canal accounted for 48 46 and 51 54 of the total lake input reaching 54 42 104 t and 57 87 104 t respectively figs 7c and 7d this indicates that salt discharge from the agriculture drainage canal is a significant source of increased salinity in the lake according to the analysis of the intra annual variation regularity of water and salt the water and salt of kaidu river entering bosten lake were mainly concentrated from april to september accounting for 73 04 and 77 54 of the total lake intake respectively during the year there were two peaks in drainage and salt discharge crop growth from april to september and winter irrigation from october to november drainage during growth and winter irrigation accounted for 24 82 and 68 69 of the whole year reaching 1 07 108 m3and 2 95 108 m3 respectively the salt discharge during the growth period and winter irrigation accounted for 20 65 and 73 79 of the whole year reaching 11 95 104 t and 42 47 104 t respectively figs 7e and 7f this indicates that winter irrigation leaching has a positive impact on salt discharge the yearly salt intake salt discharge and desalination conditions in the krid are listed in table 6 the findings demonstrate that the average annual salt diversion and desalination in the krid were 48 00 104 t and 9 88 104 t respectively indicating that the drainage canal in the krid discharged a large amount of salt into bosten lake although the krid was in a desalination state the salt discharged from the agriculture drainage canal into bosten lake increased the salt accumulation in the lake 3 3 groundwater salinity concentration tds and soil salt loading fig 8 depicts the variations in average groundwater salinity concentration tds summation of the 8 ions and soil salt loading in the krid from 2010 to 2020 the annual average groundwater salinity declined from 2845 mg l 1 in 2010 2176 mg l 1 in 2018 then climbed to 2191 mg l 1 by 2020 according to the findings the salinity of the groundwater in the krid was decreasing overall the salt content of the soil layer increased to some extent and the annual average soil salt loading increased from 1 75 106 kg ha 1to 2 02 106 kg ha 1 table 7 shows the tds and ece of different land use types and the results indicate that the tds and ece in wheat corn tomato and pepper were lower than in wasteland grassland and wetland with tds and ece of wetland reaching 5243 mg l 1 and 9 08 ds m 1 respectively and tds and ece of grassland reaching 4874 mg l 1 and 13 87 ds m 1 respectively the tds of pepper 1729 mg l 1 was higher than the other three crops and the ece of wheat 1 80 ds m 1 was higher than the other three crops for all four crop types 3 4 the spatial distribution regularity of water and salt the contribution of diverse hydrological processes to salt loading in the krid showed large spatial heterogeneity as seen in fig 9 which depicts the spatial distribution of salt loading from various hydrological processes in each subbasin the spatial distribution of salt loading via surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater discharge to the stream in each subbasin is depicted in figs 9a 9b and 9c respectively the results demonstrate that the maximum spatial contribution of salt loading from surface runoff was 0 486 kg ha 1 with a mostly decreasing trend from the basin s northwest to southeast the maximum spatial contribution of lateral flow salt loading was 57 81 kg ha 1 with greater spatial contributions located mostly in the watershed s northwest and center regions the maximum spatial contribution of groundwater salt loading was 3494 64 kg ha 1 and the contributing regions were mostly concentrated in the agricultural cultivated fields in the watershed s midsection the contribution of groundwater discharge of salt accounted for 98 59 whereas surface runoff and lateral flow accounted for only 1 41 the average groundwater salinity concentration tds and spatial distribution of soil salt loading in each subbasin of the krid are depicted in figs 9d and 9e respectively the results showed that the groundwater salinity ranged from 1078 mg l 1 to 10 155 mg l 1 in each subbasin with the average minimum groundwater salinity of 412 mg l 1 and the average maximum groundwater salinity of 19256 mg l 1 according to the average groundwater salinity of each hru low groundwater salinity regions were primarily distributed in the pre mountain sloping plains entering the plain and along the kaidu river whereas high salinity areas were primarily distributed around the lake in the eastern and southern portions of the krid each subbasin s soil salt loading ranged from 1327 kg ha 1 to 7 73 107 kg ha 1 the soil salt of cultivated land in the irrigation area was relatively low whereas places with higher soil salt loading were mostly located in the desert in the west of the krid and near the lake this is mostly because they are usually desert and wetland environments with relatively high soluble mineral content in the soil layer and salt accumulates in the soil layer due to strong evaporation 4 discussion 4 1 modified model evaluation in this study the simulation results can only be calibrated and validated using streamflow and salt loading observation data from an existing hydrological station due to the lack of long term effective observation of water and salt discharged into bosten lake from agricultural drainage canal the simulated total salt loading entering bosten lake through the kaidu river and drainage canal after model modification was 112 2 107 kg see fig 5b a comparison with the studies of other scholars ba et al 2020 cheng and li 1997 dong et al 2006 lin and jin 2006 zhong and dong 2008 revealed that the annual average simulated salt entering bosten lake through the kaidu river and drainage canal is consistent furthermore the model evaluation indices show that the modified swat salt model is more applicable see table 5 so the simulation results can be used as a reference swat is primarily used in natural watersheds where the river starts typically originate from mountain ranges whereas in irrigation watersheds a portion of the natural river is intercepted and loaded into the model salt loading changes downstream of the river are mainly influenced by the upstream which will underestimate the salt discharged into the lake downstream if there is no input from upstream see figs 5a and 5b thus it is necessary to modify the point source salt module to add salt loading input upstream of the river in plain irrigation areas bailey et al 2019 furthermore irrigation is one of the most significant sources of water input in arid and semi arid irrigated areas the krid is primarily irrigated by water diversions from outside the basin but the swat salt model cannot account for salt from irrigation sources outside the watershed if the salt is ignored in the model the simulated salt discharge entering bosten lake is 24 less than the actual reaching 27 4 107 kg see fig 5b consequently it is also necessary to modify the irrigation water salt module in accordance with the irrigation input in the model in conclusion the modified swat salt model can better depict the water salt transport process in the krid 4 2 water salt characteristic of krid according to the results river water accounting for 84 5 of the total water entering the lake contributed 48 5 of salt loading while agricultural drainage accounting for 15 5 of the total water entering the lake contributed 51 5 of salt loading see figs 7c and 7d this is since the kaidu river is a freshwater river with a low salt concentration and the overall salt carried is mostly determined by runoff nevertheless soil salinity is high in the krid the salt in the soil is leached out through flooding irrigation with a large amount of agricultural wastewater containing high salinity being discharged into the drainage canal where the total salt through drainage depends on the amount of drainage as well as the salt content of the soil lin and jin 2006 it is worth mentioning that drainage and salt discharge during the winter irrigation period accounted for 68 7 and 73 8 of the entire year respectively see figs 7e and 7f this is because drip irrigation is commonly used in xinjiang during the growth period and the irrigation is relatively small whereas a larger quota of irrigation is used to leach the salt in the soil during the winter irrigation resulting in a higher proportion of drainage and salt discharge during the winter irrigation period this indicates that winter irrigation leaching has a positive impact on salt discharge moreover the average tds and soil salt loading in each subbasin were 10 155 mg l 1 and 7 73 107 kg ha 1 respectively see figs 9d and 9e and mostly occurred near bosten lake the primary reason is that the high salinity drainage near the tail of the drainage channel seeped into the groundwater due to the influence of terrain under the impact of strong evaporation the subsidence zones around bosten lake had higher groundwater and soil salinity concentrations making the salinization phenomena more serious brunner 2005 li et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 zhao et al 2016 salinization seriously affects the normal development of agriculture in irrigation areas to effectively alleviate the problem of salinization on the one hand new irrigation technologies sprinkler irrigation micro irrigation drip irrigation etc can be used to replace conventional flood irrigation to prevent salt from returning to the soil layer owing to the rapid rise of the groundwater level tanji and kielen 2002 tedeschi et al 2001 in addition the drainage and salt discharge technology of subsurface tile drains can be promoted to control salinization in xinjiang according to related research heng et al 2018 liu et al 2021 qian et al 2021 the arrangement of subsurface tile drains can effectively decrease soil salinity although likely will increase salt loading to downstream areas 4 3 model application and limitations currently there are still more salinized irrigation sites in xinjiang and throughout the world but there is no appropriate tool for analyzing the region s water and salt movement regularity the modified swat salt model can compensate for the lack of salt in the original model s point source and irrigation settings allowing it to be applied not only to areas with irrigation water sources from channels and groundwater within the basin but also to areas with irrigation water sources from outside the basin providing an analytical tool for the development of salinization prevention and control schemes however the swat model does not account for the exchange of water and solutes between hrus so it may be inaccurate in simulating groundwater movement and solute transport processes bailey et al 2019 maleki tirabadi et al 2021 neitsch et al 2011 as a result strengthening the swat salt model s groundwater module is a future research direction for example the integrated swat modflow rt3d wei et al 2019 which currently simulates the movement of nitrogen and phosphorus in the coupled surface subsurface hydrologic system can be amended to include the salinity module of swat salt we will pursue this avenue of research in a future study 5 summary and conclusions a distributed water salt transport model of the arid irrigation area was constructed based on the newly developed swat salt model and applied to the krid in xinjiang in this work the modeling code was modified to account for salt mass in irrigation water originating outside the watershed domain and the impact of soil salinity on crop growth the main findings are 1 based on the evaluation indices of model simulation and the comparison of the impacts before and after model modification the distributed water salt transport model swat salt is a good simulator of salt mobilization and transport in the krid 2 from 2010 2020 the average annual amount of water entering bosten lake through the kaidu river and drainage canal accounted for 84 5 and 15 5 respectively whereas the average annual quantity of salt loading entering the lake through the kaidu river and drainage canal accounted for 48 5 and 51 5 respectively 3 drainage during growth and winter irrigation accounted for 24 8 and 68 7 of the whole year respectively the salt discharge during the growth period and winter irrigation accounted for 20 7 and 73 8 of the whole year respectively 4 the average groundwater salinity concentration decreased from 2845 mg l 1 to 2191 mg l 1 but the average soil salt loading increased from 1 75 106 kg ha 1 to 2 02 106 kg ha 1 between 2010 and 2020 indicating a risk of increasing soil salinization despite improvement in groundwater quality 5 the quantity of salt in the krid and salt loadings from the landscape to the stream system exhibited a large spatial heterogeneity the areas with high groundwater salinity and soil salt loading are mostly distributed around the lake highlighting problem areas that require salinization control measures in general with the benefit of the distributed hydrological model swat salt can better reflect the spatial and temporal variation of water salt transport in agricultural irrigation areas at the watershed scale and provide a reference for land and water management aimed at reducing salinization and ensuring sustainable agricultural development in irrigation areas declaration of

9338,soil salinization is the major factor affecting the sustainable development of agriculture in the kaidu river irrigation district krid in xinjiang province china to better understand water and salt variation regularity in the krid this study established a watershed scale distributed water and salt transport model for the krid based on the new soil and water assessment tool with a salinity module swat salt its point source salt module and irrigation water salt module were modified in the study to obtain more accurate simulation results based on evaluation indices the simulation results of streamflow salt loading and crop yield showed that the modified model can more accurately depict water and salt transport processes in the krid and has good applicability according to the simulation results the average annual amount of water and salt entering bosten lake through the drainage canal accounted for 15 and 51 reaching 4 29 108 m3 and 57 87 104 t respectively the drainage and salt discharge during winter irrigation accounted for 69 and 74 reaching 2 95 108 m3 and 42 47 104 t respectively however the regions along bosten lake had high groundwater and soil salinity facing a risk of increased salinization and necessitating land or water management to decrease salinization in conclusion the modified swat salt can be applied in agricultural irrigation areas with more diverse irrigation sources and is a useful tool for investigating and assessing watershed scale salinization as well as implementing targeted management strategies to reduce salinization keywords swat swat salt watershed scale agricultural irrigation areas water and salt transport spatial and temporal variation 1 introduction soil salinization is one of the key limiting constraints for crop growth in arid and semiarid areas salt overload has been linked to reduced crop yields soil compaction and deterioration of water quality mirlas 2012 tanji and kielen 2002 wang et al 2018 taking xinjiang in the interior of northwestern china as an example the region has plentiful inland light and heat resources as well as being a significant cotton and grain production area in china however soil salinization has been a severe challenge for agriculture in the region due to insufficient rainfall excessive evaporation and high groundwater salinity currently xinjiang has 1 1 107 hectares of saline soil accounting for over one third of china s total saline soil area chen et al 2010 wang et al 2001 therefore it is of great importance to analyze water and salt transport regularity in xinjiang to implement land and water management strategies according to local conditions improve soil salinization optimize water allocation increase crop water productivity promote sustainable development of local agriculture and ensure food security traditionally field experiments are a direct method of obtaining variations in soil water and salt liu and tian 2005 studied the dynamic changes and equilibrium of salinity in submembrane drip irrigation with cotton and the results showed that salinity was strongly aggregated in the 0 40 cm soil layer between membranes at the seedling stage and in the 0 20 cm soil layer between membranes at the end of the reproductive period wang et al 2012a conducted a three year field experiment on a saline wasteland in xinjiang china and set up five water treatments based on the soil water matric potential all of which showed a decrease in soil salinity and determined that irrigation of cotton was triggered when the soil water matric potential was 10 kpa for the first three years of reclaiming the saline wasteland liang and shi 2021 designed an intercropping system between cotton and two saline plants to analyze the effect of improving soil salinization and the intercropping system was effective in reducing soil salt accumulation compared to monoculture cotton field experiments can be set up with different treatments according to research needs and used to analyze water and salt changes under different production conditions however it is time consuming and laborious to use experiments as the only way to understand the regularity especially when applied to different farm environments and hydrological years santhi et al 2006 to overcome the limitations of field experiments numerical models are used to provide a more accurate analysis and prediction of water and salt regularity as well as crop development processes wang et al 2012b constructed a field scale two dimensional numerical model of water and salt transport based on experimental data from agricultural fields in yanqi xinjiang using winter wheat as the research object formulated a reasonable irrigation system by analyzing the water demand regularity of wheat and soil salt changes and determined 2 5 m as a reasonable groundwater regulation burial depth in arid and saline soil areas based on the optimized irrigation water volume and irrigation system yuan 2020 used the swap model to analyze the process of soil water salt dynamics in saline wastelands through field experiments in the hetao irrigation district and the results showed that saline wastelands are a drainage and salt discharge region for cultivated land that plays a key role in adjusting and maintaining the salt dynamic balance in irrigation area gao et al 2020 added soil salinity simulation to the awpm sg model and explored the effects of different groundwater depths and groundwater salinities on corn growth based on field experiments the smaller the groundwater depth is the smaller the irrigation water productivity of corn at the same salinity and the higher the salinity is the smaller the irrigation water productivity of corn at the same groundwater depth ning et al 2021 used the hydrus 2d model with modified root water uptake combined with crop water productivity to evaluate the results of soil salinity plant water and crop yield in different irrigation scenarios under film mulched drip irrigation conditions in dry northwest china providing a reference for optimizing irrigation systems and agricultural management davoodi et al 2019 evaluated the drainmod s model to predict the process of water salt change in three subsurface drainage systems in northern iranian paddy fields which better captured the trend of groundwater depth and drainage water salinity and the deeper drains were the more salt load when the drain spacing was the same in a growing season with less rainfall field scale experiments and simulations can explain water salt and crop growth under specific conditions and predict future trends but these models can t account for different atmospheric boundaries and land use types when dealing with boundary conditions and source sink terms and their conclusions and recommendations aren t directly applicable on regional scales where soil water salinity cropping structure irrigation systems and climate characteristics are highly variable santhi et al 2006 in response many scholars have done regional research on water and salt transport classical statistics geo statistics neural networks and remote sensing techniques lal and datta 2020 panagopoulos et al 2006 sahbeni 2021 shi et al 2020 xu et al 2019 can be used to better understand and quantify overall soil water salt trends and reflect regional water salt spatial variability however these methods are impacted by algorithm optimization and indicator weights which have substantial limits for studying various environmental circumstances and predicting future water salt processes in contract physically process based numerical models can be used to quantify the water salt behavior of a regional system in response to system properties and system inputs zhong 2008 used the groundwater model modflow as the basic framework to divide the arid oasis area into three kinds of calculation cells irrigation cells town country cells and ecological cells and calculated the water and solute transport processes in each cell based on the water salt balance principle which can be used to guide the sustainable use of groundwater in the oasis area tavakoli kivi et al 2019 added a new salinity equilibrium chemistry sec module to the uzf rt3d model bailey et al 2013 to simulate the movement and transformation processes of eight ions which better reflects the spatial and temporal trends of salinity in soils and aquifers and the salt load in streams bailey et al 2019 presented a new soil and water assessment tool with a salinity module swat salt that simulates the fate and transport of salt in surface runoff soil percolation lateral flow groundwater and streams in a watershed and tested and applied it in a salinity impaired irrigated region which can be used to explore measures to control salinization wen et al 2020 proposed a semi distributed model to simulate the monthly drainage water and salinity in the hetao irrigation district which can consider the processes of surface return flow and groundwater drainage but it is only a conceptual model that cannot specifically describe the physical processes of water and salt and its applicability is somewhat limited in addition these models as published do not consider the model the effects of salt stress on crop growth an important aspect of water and salinity management for future years given the lack of systematic analysis the objectives of this study are to use the swat salt model to simulate water and salt transport regularity in the krid first we modified the swat salt model to 1 include salt loading in irrigation water originating from outside the model domain and 2 include the effects of soil salinity on crop growth second we calibrated and validated the modified model and compared the simulation results before and after the model modification to evaluate the applicability of the modified model finally we analyzed the spatial and temporal in the variation regularity of water and salt in the krid based on simulated results providing a reference for salinity management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the kaidu

50 60 and annual rainfall of 50 7 79 9 mm rusuli et al 2015 wang 2013 zhang et al 2006 corn wheat tomatoes and peppers are the principal crops grown in the krid s agricultural cultivated land which is around 2 05 105 hectares the krid is an important production base of characteristic agricultural goods in xinjiang in the krid soil salinization is widespread with significantly salinized land accounting for 35 32 of cultivated land the most common forms of salty soil are chloride sulfate and sulfate li et al 2010 the average groundwater salinity in the krid is 4 00 g l 1 with a minimum of 0 52 g l 1 and a maximum of 20 25 g l 1 the salinity of groundwater comprises eight types of ions so4 ca mg na k cl co3 and hco3 with so4 na cl and hco3 accounting for over 90 of the total salt ion content wang et al 2007a dashankou hydrological station yanqi hydrological station huangshuigou hydrological station and keerguti hydrological station are the four hydrological stations in the krid the kaidu river is the krid s largest river and the only one entering bosten lake all year the annual average flow is 39 64 108 m3 the salinity of the upstream river is 348 mg l 1 and the salinity of the downstream river is 395 mg l 1 over the years the average quantity of salt entering the irrigated region has been 125 104 t with hco3 ca and mg being the primary ions in the river accounting for almost 80 of the total salt ion content the huangshuigou river is the second largest river in the lake in the krid with an average annual flow of 3 33 108 m3 and a river water salinity of 422 mg l 1 the qingshui river is the third largest river in the krid with an average annual flow of 1 01 108 m3 and a river water salinity of 385 mg l 1 2 2 overview of the model 2 2 1 overview of the swat model the soil and water assessment tool swat is a continuous in time physically based semi distributed watershed hydrological model arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 that is developed for the long term prediction of water quality and hydrological implications of various land and water management practices the model is split into multiple subbasins based on topography elevation river networks and water systems the subbasins are separated into relatively independent hydrological response units hrus based on land use soil type and slope a load of water sediment and nutrients is calculated in each hru which is then aggregated in the subbasin and calculated to the tributaries finally the confluence is calculated into the main river channel to obtain the result of the outlet of the basin the swat model is based on the water balance calculating rainfall evapotranspiration surface runoff soil percolation lateral flow groundwater and revap and simulating the hydrological cycle of the basin through the atmosphere land surface and river channels in addition different operations in agricultural management such as crop planting irrigation fertilization and harvesting can be timed to simulate crop growth nutrient migration and transformation process which are used to solve agricultural water quality and environmental problems 2 2 2 overview of the swat salt model although the swat model can simulate the fate and transport of nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus pesticides and sediment it does not include the fate and transport of salt in its source code bailey et al 2019 modified the swat modeling code to include a salt module based on the salt module presented in tavakoli kivi et al 2019 for a groundwater irrigated watershed system the swat salt model uses salt ion mass balance for the soil layers of each hru the aquifer of each hru and the stream channel of each subbasin for 8 major ions so4 ca mg na k cl co3 hco3 salt ion mass is transported in each major hydrologic pathway in the watershed including surface runoff soil lateral flow soil percolation leaching groundwater flow and streamflow with salt loading to streams equal to the summation of salt loading in surface runoff soil lateral flow and groundwater discharge the module includes the precipitation dissolution of five salt minerals in the soil layers and aquifer caco3 mgco3 caso4 mgso4 nacl with complexation and cation exchange chemical reactions also included the module uses solute equilibrium chemistry for simulating chemical reactions bailey et al 2019 the module also simulates the loading of salt mass to the soil profile via saline irrigation water from both surface water subbasin channel and groundwater aquifer sources the mass balance in the hru soil layer system for a daily time step is formulated as 1 s i s o i l j s i s o i l j 1 s i i r r i g s i s o i l d i s s s i r e v a p s i s o i l p r e c i p s i s u r f s i l a t s i p e r c where s i soil j represents

percolation from the bottom of the soil layer kg ha 1 the above variables without explanation all represent the result on day j at a daily time step the mass balance in the aquifer for each hru is as follows 2 s i g w j s i g w j 1 s i p e r c s i a q u d i s s s i a q u p r e c i p s i r e v a p s i g w f l o w s i g w s e e p where s i gw j represents the mass of the i th salt ion in the aquifer

removed from the aquifer via groundwater discharge to the subbasin stream kg ha 1 s i gwseep represents the i th salt ion mass removed from the shallow aquifer discharge to the deep aquifer kg ha 1 the above variables without explanation all represent the result on day j the plant growth component of the swat model is a simplified version of the epic plant growth module water stress temperature stress nitrogen stress and phosphorus stress are four primary stress factors that the plant growth component considers while simulating the plant growth process the swat salt model simulates the salt ion concentration of soil water during plant growth salt stress is calculated using the equation 3 k s 1 b r 100 c r θ k c o n v θ s a e c where k s represents salt stress b r represents the reduction factor ds m 1 c r represents the soil salt concentration tds summation of the 8 ions mg l 1 θ represents the average soil water content of the soil layer m3 m 3 θ s represents the soil water content

conductivity of the saturation extract of the soil above which salt stress occurs ds m 1 according to the study of maas and hoffman 1977 k conv takes 640 1 ds m 1 640 mg l 1 k s is multiplied by the water stress coefficient to restrict plant transpiration as follows 5 e t s e t w s t r s k s where e t s represents the actual plant transpiration mm d 1 e t represents the maximum potential plant transpiration mm d 1 and w strs represents the stress of water the plant growth regulating factor used to quantify the fraction of potential growth achieved on a given day was calculated by considering k s as follows 6 γ r e g 1 max w s t r s k s t s t r s n s t r s p s t r s where γ reg represents the plant growth factor 0 1 and t strs n strs and p strs represent the stress of temperature nitrogen and phosphorus respectively 2 2 3 modified swat salt model for this study the swat salt modeling code was modified to account for monthly salt point source loads and salt mass in irrigation water originating from outside the model domain when considering the point source salt module input the original module can only be input according to the daily time step not the monthly time step in this study point source salt module subroutines such as recmon f readmon f and rtout f were modified according to the available hydrological station observations and the monthly average loading kg mon 1 of eight ions so4 ca mg na k cl co3 and hco3 was added to the point source input files of the appropriate subbasin in addition the swat salt model can only simulate the loading of salt mass to the soil profile via saline irrigation water from both surface water subbasin channel and groundwater aquifer sources in the irrigation water salt module bailey et al 2019 but not from outside the modeled watershed because irrigation water from outside watersheds was used in this study to set up the irrigation operation using the krid diversion irrigation methods the irrigation water salt module subroutines such as salt irrig f salt read f and simulated f were modified to include the salinity of irrigation water originating from outside watersheds which is calculated as follows 7 s i irrig w irrig 1000 a hru s i conc 1000 where s i irrig represents the mass of the i th salt ion in irrigation water kg ha 1 w irrig represents the amount of irrigation water mm ahru represents the area of hru ha and s i conc represents the concentration of the i th salt ion in irrigation water mg l 1 concentrations of each of the 8 salt ions for outside water is included in the appropriate input file the salt ion concentrations in the kaidu river were approximated to be equivalent to the irrigation water salt concentration to generalize the original model input and the appropriate file was used as input to run the model 2 3 input data and model construction the arcswat interface winchell et al 2013 based on swat2012 was used to prepare input files of the swat salt model the digital elevation model dem with 30 m precision was provided by geospatial data cloud https www gscloud cn the land use map at a resolution of 30 m was obtained by the institute of geographic science and natural resources research cas data on soil maps at a scale of 1 1000 000 was acquired from the harmonized world soil database hwsd the china national meteorological science data center provided the data for the yanqi and korla meteorological stations and cfsr https swat tamu edu provided missing measurement data and solar radiation monthly runoff and ion concentration data were obtained by the xinjiang tarim river basin authority and the bayingoleng mongol autonomous prefecture water resources bureau respectively crop yield data was provided by the xinjiang statistical yearbook table 1 lists the data sources and descriptions used for the swat salt model because the krid s topography is relatively flat and the watershed includes both the natural kaidu river and artificially constructed diversion and drainage canals the model is unable to extract the river network water system directly based on the dem so the main artificial drainage canals in the irrigation area are generalized for the construction of the river network water system using google earth identification and manual drawing to obtain the corresponding river network systems and subbasins the dem was processed using the principles of the elevation increment iterative algorithm martz and garbrecht 1998 and burn in algorithm saunders and maidment 1996 figs 2a and 2b depict the primary land use types and soil types in the watershed the cultivated field in the basin accounts for 58 71 of the total area and the cultivated land is divided into four primary crops corn wheat tomato and pepper according to the crop cultivation structure of the krid according to the 2010 2020 xinjiang statistical yearbook the average cultivated land ratio of the four crops is 16 4 35 4 20 1 28 1 and the cultivated field type agrr was redefined based on the matching crop cultivation ratio a total of 33 subbasins and 337 hrus were divided in the final model fig 2c the initial salt ion concentration of groundwater in each subbasin in the model was determined using groundwater observation wells in the krid in 2005 where the magnitude of eight ion concentrations was mentioned in the research by wang et al 2007b the initial content fractions of caco3 and caso4 in the soil layer were set according to the 1 m depth soil layer investigated by the world soil database hwsd fao iiasa isric isscas jrc 2012 and the initial content fractions of other salt minerals were set to 0 which was used as the objective function for subsequent salt parameters calibration and validation the initial salt ion concentration in the soil layer is the same as in the groundwater setting and the initial salt mineral content fraction in the aquifer is the same as in the soil layer setting both differences can be considered by adjusting the salt ion concentration and salt mineral content in the soil layer and shallow aquifer over a warm up period of several years bailey et al 2019 the solubility product parameters of salt minerals were the same used as in determined from relevant research bailey et al 2019 tavakoli kivi et al 2019 which are based on published values in chemistry literature the salt loading kg in the upper reaches of the kaidu river and huangshuigou river was calculated based on the monthly average salt ion concentration mg l 1 multiplied by the streamflow m3 s 1 and added to the swat point source input file for the corresponding subbasins in monthly time steps according to the modified salt point source input format moreover the automatic fertilization operation was configured in the management file to investigate the impact of salt stress on crop growth nitrogen stress was not taken into account hence the nitrogen stress factor was set to 1 0 auto nstrs 1 0 the primary crops irrigation system was based on the xinjiang agricultural irrigation water quota and combined with field investigations in the krid 2 4 model parameter calibration and validation 2 4 1 streamflow parameters the model ran from 2005 to 2020 with the warm up phase being 2005 2009 the calibration period being from 2010 to 2015 and the validation period being from 2016 to 2020 for sensitivity analysis calibration and validation of the selected 22 parameters relevant to streamflow table 2 the sufi 2 algorithm in the swat cup swat calibration and uncertainty programs abbaspour 2007 program was used for analysis the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was used as the objective function after four iterations of 2000 simulations and the parameters were altered after each iteration to constantly minimize the error between the simulated and observed values to get the ideal parameters according to table 2 trnsrch is the most sensitive runoff parameter since the kaidu river in the arid area is susceptible to seasonal hydrology and the majority of the runoff is lost through riverbed infiltration during reach transmission besides the effective hydraulic conductivity of channel ch k2 and delay time for aquifer recharge gw delay are also strongly sensitive in the arid watershed 2 4 2 salinity parameters manual calibration was performed to alter the parameters for the salt simulation the hwsd investigated the content of caco3 and caso4 in each soil but did not record the content of nacl as a result the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse is used as the objective function to adjust the content of nacl to minimize the error between the simulated and observed values the fraction of nacl content was adjusted according to the conductivity investigated for each soil table 3 lists the calibration results of the initial and optimal values of the salt mineral content parameters 2 4 3 crop parameters the crop parameters and value ranges selected in the research of other scholars nair et al 2011 ouyang et al 2015 were combined with the characteristics of the study area to calibrate the crop yield wheat and corn yields per hectare kg ha 1 in the four counties yanqi hejing heshuo and bohu in the study area were taken as observed values based on the xinjiang statistical yearbook and the salt stress threshold parameters of the crop in the swat salt model were considered and the correlation coefficient r2 and percentage bias pbias were used as the objective functions to minimize the error between the simulated and observed values of the average yields of wheat and corn in the subbasins where the four counties were located by manually adjusting the relevant parameters and comparing the yields of the crop without considering the salt stress conditions table 4 lists the calibration results of the initial and fitted values of crop yield parameters 2 4 4 evaluation indices the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias moriasi et al 2007 moriasi et al 2015 were chosen as goodness of fit indices to evaluate the swat salt model performance r2 has a range of values from 0 to 1 the closer r2 is to 1 the greater the model correlation r2 more than 0 5 is considered acceptable whereas r2 larger than 0 8 is regarded as excellent nse takes values in the range of 1 a larger nse indicates better model applicability when nse is less than 0 5 the results are unacceptable when nse is between 0 5 and 0 7 the results are acceptable when nse is greater than 0 8 the performance is deemed excellent pbias indicates the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than the observations positive values indicate model underestimation bias negative values indicate model overestimation bias and its optimal value is 0 when pbias is greater than 15 the results are unacceptable when pbias is between 10 and 15 the results are acceptable when pbias is less than 5 the results are excellent the following equations are used to calculate these statistical indices 8 r 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs q sim i q sim i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 i 1 n q sim i q sim 2 2 9 n s e 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i

observed value q sim i is the simulated value q obs is the arithmetic mean of the observed value and q sim is the arithmetic mean of the simulated value 3 results and analysis 3 1 calibration and validation of simulation results 3 1 1 streamflow the best simulation result was obtained after automatically calibrating the streamflow parameters as shown in fig 3 during the calibration period the average monthly streamflow simulation evaluation indices r2 was 0 89 nse was 0 82 and pbias was 8 80 during the validation period r2 was 0 96 nse was 0 95 and pbias was 7 00 the validation period s nse was greater than the calibration period s and the validation period s simulation accuracy was higher the simulation results of the two periods performed well and had a strong correlation according to the relevant index evaluation standards in the calculation results of the average monthly streamflow during the calibration period the average monthly measured and simulated flow was 73 04 m3 s 1 and 79 45 m3 s 1 respectively during the validation period the average monthly measured and simulated flow was 101 82 m3 s 1 and 94 64 m3 s 1 respectively which was consistent with the pbias results the good streamflow simulation results lay the foundation for the accuracy of subsequent salt transport simulations in the krid table 5 shows the streamflow evaluation indices for the calibration and validation periods 3 1 2 total salt loading the best simulation results were obtained after calibrating and validating the salt parameters as shown in fig 4 during the calibration period the average monthly salt loading simulation evaluation indices r2 was 0 81 nse was 0 78 and pbias was 4 30 during the validation period r2 was 0 93 nse was 0 91 and pbias was 8 30 the validation period s nse was higher than the calibration period s which was consistent with the streamflow simulation results while the calibration period s pbias was better than the validation period s the simulation results of the two periods performed well and had a strong correlation according to the relevant index evaluation standards in the calculation results of the average monthly salt loading during the calibration period the average monthly measured and simulated salt loading was 5 72 107 kg and 5 96 107 kg respectively during the validation period the average monthly measured and simulated salt loading was 7 46 107 kg and 6 84 107 kg respectively table 5 shows the salt loading evaluation indices for the calibration and validation periods the comparison of simulated and observed salt loading levels at the yanqi hydrological station before and after the model modification is shown in fig 5a when just the irrigation water salt module was modified the average annual salt loading simulated by yanqi hydrological station was 5 55 107 kg when just the point source salt module was modified the average annual salt loading was 72 5 107 kg after two modules were modified the average annual salt loading was 76 3 107 kg whereas the measured was 78 1 107 kg after modifying two modules the salt loading simulated was closer to the observed the total salt loading entering bosten lake through the kaidu river and drainage canal before and after module modification is shown in fig 5b when just the irrigation water salt module was modified the average annual total salt loading into the lake was 49 6 107 kg when just the point source salt module was modified the average annual total salt loading was 84 8 107 kg after two modules were modified the average annual salt loading was 112 2 107 kg whereas other researchers studies dong et al 2006 zhong and dong 2008 found that the average annual salt loading into the lake was 110 7 107 115 8 107 kg as a result the salt loading simulation results after modifying two modules were better demonstrating the need to modify the model 3 1 3 crop yield this study solely calibrated the yield simulation results for wheat and corn since the unit hectares yield of tomato and pepper was not published in the xinjiang statistical yearbook as shown in figs 6a and 6b the best simulation results were obtained after calibrating the crop yield parameters considering the influence of salt stress the simulated evaluation indices of wheat yield r2 was 0 81 and pbias was 0 40 the simulated evaluation indices of corn yield r2 was 0 54 and pbias was 0 30 without considering the influence of salt stress the simulated evaluation indices of wheat yield r2 was 0 74 and pbias was 3 90 the simulated evaluation indices of corn yield r2 was 0 53 and pbias was 5 60 when the salt stress module was added to the model the simulation effect of crop yield was better and the fitting accuracy was higher in the calculation results of the average crop yield the average measured wheat yield of the four counties yanqi county hejing county heshuo county and bohu county was 6584 9 kg ha 1 the average simulated yield of wheat with salt stress and without salt stress was 6559 5 kg ha 1 and 6844 6 kg ha 1 respectively the average measured yield of corn was 11 624 0 kg ha 1 and the average simulated yield of corn with salt stress and without salt stress was 11 593 5 kg ha 1 and 12 271 4 kg ha 1 respectively as a result the swat salt model with the salt stress module can predict crop yield more accurately than the swat model in the salinized agricultural irrigation region table 5 shows the simulation evaluation indices of wheat and corn yield in conclusion the distributed water salt transport swat salt model established in this study with the krid as the representative of the northwest arid oasis agricultural irrigation area has good applicability and can better reflect the water salt transport process in the krid based on the evaluation indices of model simulation and the comparison of the effects before and after model modification the model can be used in agricultural irrigation areas with more diverse irrigation sources and provides an important technical tool for water and salt regularity in agriculture oriented arid and semiarid irrigation areas 3 2 analysis of drainage and salt discharge the krid is situated in a semi arid inland arid region with less rainfall irrigation is carried out mainly by the diversion of water from the kaidu river as a result the irrigation infiltration drainage process is the primary driving force behind salt diversion salt leaching and salt discharge in the krid the change in salt within the year is similar to the change process of streamflow which follows the regularity of water and salt movement of salt comes with water and salt goes with water according to an analysis of the interannual variation regularity of water and salt entering bosten lake figs 7a and 7b from 2010 to 2020 the average annual amount of water entering the lake through the kaidu river and drainage canal accounted for 84 49 and 15 51 of the total lake input reaching 23 38 108 m3 and 4 29 108 m3 respectively the average annual quantity of salt loading entering the lake through the kaidu river and drainage canal accounted for 48 46 and 51 54 of the total lake input reaching 54 42 104 t and 57 87 104 t respectively figs 7c and 7d this indicates that salt discharge from the agriculture drainage canal is a significant source of increased salinity in the lake according to the analysis of the intra annual variation regularity of water and salt the water and salt of kaidu river entering bosten lake were mainly concentrated from april to september accounting for 73 04 and 77 54 of the total lake intake respectively during the year there were two peaks in drainage and salt discharge crop growth from april to september and winter irrigation from october to november drainage during growth and winter irrigation accounted for 24 82 and 68 69 of the whole year reaching 1 07 108 m3and 2 95 108 m3 respectively the salt discharge during the growth period and winter irrigation accounted for 20 65 and 73 79 of the whole year reaching 11 95 104 t and 42 47 104 t respectively figs 7e and 7f this indicates that winter irrigation leaching has a positive impact on salt discharge the yearly salt intake salt discharge and desalination conditions in the krid are listed in table 6 the findings demonstrate that the average annual salt diversion and desalination in the krid were 48 00 104 t and 9 88 104 t respectively indicating that the drainage canal in the krid discharged a large amount of salt into bosten lake although the krid was in a desalination state the salt discharged from the agriculture drainage canal into bosten lake increased the salt accumulation in the lake 3 3 groundwater salinity concentration tds and soil salt loading fig 8 depicts the variations in average groundwater salinity concentration tds summation of the 8 ions and soil salt loading in the krid from 2010 to 2020 the annual average groundwater salinity declined from 2845 mg l 1 in 2010 2176 mg l 1 in 2018 then climbed to 2191 mg l 1 by 2020 according to the findings the salinity of the groundwater in the krid was decreasing overall the salt content of the soil layer increased to some extent and the annual average soil salt loading increased from 1 75 106 kg ha 1to 2 02 106 kg ha 1 table 7 shows the tds and ece of different land use types and the results indicate that the tds and ece in wheat corn tomato and pepper were lower than in wasteland grassland and wetland with tds and ece of wetland reaching 5243 mg l 1 and 9 08 ds m 1 respectively and tds and ece of grassland reaching 4874 mg l 1 and 13 87 ds m 1 respectively the tds of pepper 1729 mg l 1 was higher than the other three crops and the ece of wheat 1 80 ds m 1 was higher than the other three crops for all four crop types 3 4 the spatial distribution regularity of water and salt the contribution of diverse hydrological processes to salt loading in the krid showed large spatial heterogeneity as seen in fig 9 which depicts the spatial distribution of salt loading from various hydrological processes in each subbasin the spatial distribution of salt loading via surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater discharge to the stream in each subbasin is depicted in figs 9a 9b and 9c respectively the results demonstrate that the maximum spatial contribution of salt loading from surface runoff was 0 486 kg ha 1 with a mostly decreasing trend from the basin s northwest to southeast the maximum spatial contribution of lateral flow salt loading was 57 81 kg ha 1 with greater spatial contributions located mostly in the watershed s northwest and center regions the maximum spatial contribution of groundwater salt loading was 3494 64 kg ha 1 and the contributing regions were mostly concentrated in the agricultural cultivated fields in the watershed s midsection the contribution of groundwater discharge of salt accounted for 98 59 whereas surface runoff and lateral flow accounted for only 1 41 the average groundwater salinity concentration tds and spatial distribution of soil salt loading in each subbasin of the krid are depicted in figs 9d and 9e respectively the results showed that the groundwater salinity ranged from 1078 mg l 1 to 10 155 mg l 1 in each subbasin with the average minimum groundwater salinity of 412 mg l 1 and the average maximum groundwater salinity of 19256 mg l 1 according to the average groundwater salinity of each hru low groundwater salinity regions were primarily distributed in the pre mountain sloping plains entering the plain and along the kaidu river whereas high salinity areas were primarily distributed around the lake in the eastern and southern portions of the krid each subbasin s soil salt loading ranged from 1327 kg ha 1 to 7 73 107 kg ha 1 the soil salt of cultivated land in the irrigation area was relatively low whereas places with higher soil salt loading were mostly located in the desert in the west of the krid and near the lake this is mostly because they are usually desert and wetland environments with relatively high soluble mineral content in the soil layer and salt accumulates in the soil layer due to strong evaporation 4 discussion 4 1 modified model evaluation in this study the simulation results can only be calibrated and validated using streamflow and salt loading observation data from an existing hydrological station due to the lack of long term effective observation of water and salt discharged into bosten lake from agricultural drainage canal the simulated total salt loading entering bosten lake through the kaidu river and drainage canal after model modification was 112 2 107 kg see fig 5b a comparison with the studies of other scholars ba et al 2020 cheng and li 1997 dong et al 2006 lin and jin 2006 zhong and dong 2008 revealed that the annual average simulated salt entering bosten lake through the kaidu river and drainage canal is consistent furthermore the model evaluation indices show that the modified swat salt model is more applicable see table 5 so the simulation results can be used as a reference swat is primarily used in natural watersheds where the river starts typically originate from mountain ranges whereas in irrigation watersheds a portion of the natural river is intercepted and loaded into the model salt loading changes downstream of the river are mainly influenced by the upstream which will underestimate the salt discharged into the lake downstream if there is no input from upstream see figs 5a and 5b thus it is necessary to modify the point source salt module to add salt loading input upstream of the river in plain irrigation areas bailey et al 2019 furthermore irrigation is one of the most significant sources of water input in arid and semi arid irrigated areas the krid is primarily irrigated by water diversions from outside the basin but the swat salt model cannot account for salt from irrigation sources outside the watershed if the salt is ignored in the model the simulated salt discharge entering bosten lake is 24 less than the actual reaching 27 4 107 kg see fig 5b consequently it is also necessary to modify the irrigation water salt module in accordance with the irrigation input in the model in conclusion the modified swat salt model can better depict the water salt transport process in the krid 4 2 water salt characteristic of krid according to the results river water accounting for 84 5 of the total water entering the lake contributed 48 5 of salt loading while agricultural drainage accounting for 15 5 of the total water entering the lake contributed 51 5 of salt loading see figs 7c and 7d this is since the kaidu river is a freshwater river with a low salt concentration and the overall salt carried is mostly determined by runoff nevertheless soil salinity is high in the krid the salt in the soil is leached out through flooding irrigation with a large amount of agricultural wastewater containing high salinity being discharged into the drainage canal where the total salt through drainage depends on the amount of drainage as well as the salt content of the soil lin and jin 2006 it is worth mentioning that drainage and salt discharge during the winter irrigation period accounted for 68 7 and 73 8 of the entire year respectively see figs 7e and 7f this is because drip irrigation is commonly used in xinjiang during the growth period and the irrigation is relatively small whereas a larger quota of irrigation is used to leach the salt in the soil during the winter irrigation resulting in a higher proportion of drainage and salt discharge during the winter irrigation period this indicates that winter irrigation leaching has a positive impact on salt discharge moreover the average tds and soil salt loading in each subbasin were 10 155 mg l 1 and 7 73 107 kg ha 1 respectively see figs 9d and 9e and mostly occurred near bosten lake the primary reason is that the high salinity drainage near the tail of the drainage channel seeped into the groundwater due to the influence of terrain under the impact of strong evaporation the subsidence zones around bosten lake had higher groundwater and soil salinity concentrations making the salinization phenomena more serious brunner 2005 li et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 zhao et al 2016 salinization seriously affects the normal development of agriculture in irrigation areas to effectively alleviate the problem of salinization on the one hand new irrigation technologies sprinkler irrigation micro irrigation drip irrigation etc can be used to replace conventional flood irrigation to prevent salt from returning to the soil layer owing to the rapid rise of the groundwater level tanji and kielen 2002 tedeschi et al 2001 in addition the drainage and salt discharge technology of subsurface tile drains can be promoted to control salinization in xinjiang according to related research heng et al 2018 liu et al 2021 qian et al 2021 the arrangement of subsurface tile drains can effectively decrease soil salinity although likely will increase salt loading to downstream areas 4 3 model application and limitations currently there are still more salinized irrigation sites in xinjiang and throughout the world but there is no appropriate tool for analyzing the region s water and salt movement regularity the modified swat salt model can compensate for the lack of salt in the original model s point source and irrigation settings allowing it to be applied not only to areas with irrigation water sources from channels and groundwater within the basin but also to areas with irrigation water sources from outside the basin providing an analytical tool for the development of salinization prevention and control schemes however the swat model does not account for the exchange of water and solutes between hrus so it may be inaccurate in simulating groundwater movement and solute transport processes bailey et al 2019 maleki tirabadi et al 2021 neitsch et al 2011 as a result strengthening the swat salt model s groundwater module is a future research direction for example the integrated swat modflow rt3d wei et al 2019 which currently simulates the movement of nitrogen and phosphorus in the coupled surface subsurface hydrologic system can be amended to include the salinity module of swat salt we will pursue this avenue of research in a future study 5 summary and conclusions a distributed water salt transport model of the arid irrigation area was constructed based on the newly developed swat salt model and applied to the krid in xinjiang in this work the modeling code was modified to account for salt mass in irrigation water originating outside the watershed domain and the impact of soil salinity on crop growth the main findings are 1 based on the evaluation indices of model simulation and the comparison of the impacts before and after model modification the distributed water salt transport model swat salt is a good simulator of salt mobilization and transport in the krid 2 from 2010 2020 the average annual amount of water entering bosten lake through the kaidu river and drainage canal accounted for 84 5 and 15 5 respectively whereas the average annual quantity of salt loading entering the lake through the kaidu river and drainage canal accounted for 48 5 and 51 5 respectively 3 drainage during growth and winter irrigation accounted for 24 8 and 68 7 of the whole year respectively the salt discharge during the growth period and winter irrigation accounted for 20 7 and 73 8 of the whole year respectively 4 the average groundwater salinity concentration decreased from 2845 mg l 1 to 2191 mg l 1 but the average soil salt loading increased from 1 75 106 kg ha 1 to 2 02 106 kg ha 1 between 2010 and 2020 indicating a risk of increasing soil salinization despite improvement in groundwater quality 5 the quantity of salt in the krid and salt loadings from the landscape to the stream system exhibited a large spatial heterogeneity the areas with high groundwater salinity and soil salt loading are mostly distributed around the lake highlighting problem areas that require salinization control measures in general with the benefit of the distributed hydrological model swat salt can better reflect the spatial and temporal variation of water salt transport in agricultural irrigation areas at the watershed scale and provide a reference for land and water management aimed at reducing salinization and ensuring sustainable agricultural development in irrigation areas declaration of

9339,in precision agriculture methods for analysing 3d point clouds of plants have been introduced particularly pointing to the high accuracy of light detection and ranging lidar laser scanning under field conditions in the present work lidar based 3d point clouds of cherry trees n 255 were analysed for estimating the leaf area as the main factor for water interception canopies were scanned for segmenting leaf area pointing to a high variability of canopy surface the derived tree specific data of leaf area index lai were implemented into the community land model clm which takes into account canopy interception processes during rainfall events during canopy development of perennial trees the lai increased resulting in increased water interception events with low rain fall the interception reached 38 100 capturing lai of 0 76 2 11 m2 m2 respectively in high rainfall events interception varied 10 14 capturing the same lai range an equation for describing the varying effects of rainfall intensity and lai is proposed the evapotranspiration and water interception data point to a substantial decrease of effective water supply that varies tree individually during the season in commercial fruit production the proposed method can support precise irrigation management keywords fruit tree laser scanner leaf area leaf area index rainfall interception data availability data will be made

critical in arid and semiarid regions high irrigation water use causes water retention agricultural nutrient leakage and reduces water productivity afzal et al 2017 therefore precise irrigation scheduling is required to improve crop yield and avoid overwatering tree canopy parameters are involved in key actions of crop management such as irrigation but also fertilisation pesticide application and crop load management zude sasse et al 2016 canopy features interacting with the environment are the foliage woody parts and reproductive organs particularly the leaf area index lai has been introduced for predicting ecosystem models of hydrologic and carbon cycles changes in the lai can affect evapotranspiration et which regulates soil moisture content liu et al 2016 seo and kim 2021 furthermore irrigation lebon et al 2006 water stress junttila et al 2021 fertilisation rosell and sanz 2012 application of plant protection agents gil et al 2014 light interception louarn et al 2008 and fruit yield and quality penzel et al 2021 have all been linked to leaf area and leaf density kliewer and dokoozlian 2005 several models that calculate fluxes among soil and land surface systems frequently employ the lai as a key input variable gao et al 2012 gyeviki et al 2012 carrasco benavides et al 2016 the actual lai is directly measured using time consuming processes that include partial or complete defoliation of trees the general effect of foliage enhancing the water interception was shown in deciduous trees staelens et al 2008 however direct lai measurements of individual trees in vegetation cover or orchards are hardly applied in large scale research and are typically used to calibrate indirect methods garrigues et al 2008 fuentes et al 2012 confalonieri et al 2013 in research light detection and ranging lidar laser scanners are frequently employed as an indirect way to analyse trees and arable crops overcoming effects of varying lighting conditions that limit the use of camera systems del moral martínez et al 2016 the lidar sensor is typically mounted on terrestrial or aerial platforms in order to acquire the three dimensional 3d profile of plants additionally to the lai the tree area index arnó et al 2013 as well as the leaf wall area del moral martínez et al 2015 are two further metrics obtained with terrestrial laser scanners recent studies in forestry exploited the potential of 3d point cloud measured for individual tree to discriminate la from stem area by means of lidar backscattered reflectance and geometric features hackel et al 2016 2022 using the same method the estimation of la was achieved for fruit trees with high accuracy zhang et al 2021 tsoulias et al 2022 similarly lidar backscattered reflectance and geometric features have been exploited to segment cotton balls sun et al 2020 and implemented for autonomous harvesting in greenhouse applications tao and zhou 2017 lin et al 2020 in fruit production the reflectance intensity and geometric features were combined to identify and segment the total number and size of apples per tree gené mola et al 2019 tsoulias et al 2020 a similar approach based on geometric features was introduced to segment 3d points of woody parts from leaves and fruit in pomegranates zhang et al 2021 considering irrigation management la and lai play critical roles in hydrological processes during and after a rain event leaves intercept substantial amounts of precipitation and evaporate back into the atmosphere the net intake of orchard soils is determined by taking into account this relationship consequently water resource management requires an understanding of canopy variation in terms of lai to estimate water interception interception is an important component of whole orchards seasonal water balance especially in the case of intensive planting systems where net irrigation requirements should incorporate an estimate of interception loss gómez et al 2001 for precise management the amount and intensity of rainfall are critical factors in determining canopy interception in mixed forest results showed that the canopy of broad leaved korean pine intercepted 22 of rainfall sheng and cai 2019 however rainfall interception by the canopy varied from 7 to 83 interception by olive trees ranged from 7 to 25 of the average annual precipitation 606 mm considering 0 3 and 5 0 m2 m2 lai respectively gómez et al 2001 high rainfall amount might lead to changes of canopy interception sheng and cai 2019 sun et al 2011 according to schneebeli et al 2012 up to 60 of rainfall is intercepted during light rainfall whereas only 4 is intercepted during periods of strong rainfall and roughly 15 of the rain volume is intercepted during rainfalls of medium intensity rain interception of oak canopy trees was affected by wind speed lockwood and sellers 1982 low wind speeds 0 2 m s resulted in no effect on water interception whereas interception decreased

the present study l leaf was replaced by leaf area index lai measured with lidar laser scanner in previous studies precipitation less than 0 5 mm were considered negligible according to clm sheng and cai 2019 therefore clm was modified to consider all rainfall data including the light rainfall events which provide deeper insight in the influences of canopy surface as follows 3 i m α r m 1 exp 0 5 lai where m r if r 0 5 and m 0 4 if r 0 5 from the beginning of april when leaves appeared through the end of july fully grown canopy after harvesting the rainfall interception was calculated for each day when precipitation was recorded considering the tree individual lai 3 results and discussion 3 1 estimation of lai during the canopy growth period cherry trees were scanned with lidar scanner from both sides which facilitated to produce a 3d tree point cloud model of each tree n 255 at high density of points with average of 109467 points per tree ppt fig 2 the 3d point clouds were further analysed to segment the leaf area la of the trees the coefficient of determination for la estimation based on ppt lalidar and manually measured la lamanual has frequently been reported as very high also in fruit trees pforte et al 2012 sanz et al 2018 tsoulias et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 which was confirmed in the present study however a limiting factor for the lalidar estimation are occlusion effects occurring in the canopies lei et al 2019 and differences in the percentage of wood during seasonal canopy growth in perennial trees in the present study the verification of the lidar based la estimation was carried out considering reference lamanual analysis n 7 after defoliation ranging between 5 7 m2 and 14 6 m2 and ppt after removal of points belonging to wood fig 2 a strong correlation r2 0 93 was found between lidar based la and manually measured la from the corresponding cherry trees fig 3 geometric features of linearity and lidar backscattered reflectivity were utilised for this purpose as shown earlier e g by sanz et al 2018 already revealing high correlation of manual and lidar analyses in apples trees r2 0 88 and vineyards r2 0 80 recent work on segmenting woody parts and lalidar at several growth stages in apple trees by means of 3d point cloud analysis indicated that percentage of wood decreased during canopy growth considering the entire vegetation period lalidar estimation was improved when subtracting the increased amount of lidar points belonging to wood tsoulias et al 2022 the relationship between lamanual and lalidar were enhanced after removal of woody parts revealing a substantial increase of r2 adj cv 0 81 with wood and r2 adj cv 0 92 without wood tsoulias et al 2022 the lalidar values obtained at three measuring dates were interpolated by means of growth model equ 1 to estimate the gla of each tree over the season starting at bud break in april until the canopy was fully developed after fruit harvest in july fig 4 during the growth period from 36 days after bud break dabb until 80 dabb the gla increased sigmoidal as expected leaves were developing rapidly till june and with decreased growth rate in july when the leaves were mature and finally no further canopy growth appeared considering all trees n 255 per measuring date la ranged from 0 02 to 2 95 m² in may 0 15 3 49 m² in june and 0 78 3 51 m² in july fig 4 for further calculation of the canopy water interception the la was expressed per unit ground area as dimensionless index lai equally the lai changed according to the canopy growth of the perennial deciduous fruit trees a high variability of la and lai was observed in the orchard which possibly affects the water interception 3 2 effects of rainfall and lai on canopy water interception canopy water interception of rainfall is a dynamic process thus the interception ratio is not a constant value as reported by sheng and cai 2019 mean interception of all trees at each rain event 31 points were calculated and the relationship with amount of rainfall described fig 5 an increase of rainfall resulted in exponential decrease of interception eq 4 high coefficient of determination of r2 0 92 was found in the present study the relationship of rainfall r and water interception i was calculated as 4 i 46 958 r 0 475 rainfall was fully intercepted for light rainfall events less than 0 5 mm fig 5 mean interception during small rainfall events 5 mm was 42 compared to 15 for high rainfall 5 mm during events with high peak intensities 30 mm calculated interception was occasionally low 14 as rainfall continued during most large events 30 mm there was slight difference between gross precipitation and calculated net rainfall as shown earlier sidle and ziegler 2017 yerk and montalto 2014 van stan et al 2011 actually numerous studies have mentioned that the intensity of rain has a significant impact on canopy water interception zeng et al 2000 murakami 2007 it was noticed that interception process was sensitive to rainfall intensity but marginally affected by its duration with less rainfall intensity the interception increased because of the proportion of rainwater required for wetting the crown surface a main component of interception loss from rainfall in the present study the maximum calculated interception 100 occurred for a rainfall intensity of 0 5 mm h in contrast the minimum interception 5 was calculated for a rainfall intensity of 9 0 mm h the mean lai development generally followed the sigmoid growth curve of la during the season however lidar laser scanning of canopies pointed to high variability of lai of individual trees within the orchard which can be assumed to affect water interception due to the general growth trend of canopies but individual tree growth this variability of lai differed at each rain event fig 6 lai was calculated for each tree at each rain event considering 255 trees at 31 rainfall events equalling 7905 data sets which were used in clm to calculate interception equ 2 3 changes in canopy surface affected the amount of rainwater intercepted fig 7 however no trend was visible over the growth period in may when the leaves were small frequently low rainfall events occurred leading to high percentage of interception this was the case even if hardly any la was measured on the other hand in the temperate climate with increased precipitation in summer months frequently high rainfall event occurred end of june and in july at these high rainfall events the percentage of intercepted water decreased even if the foliage was fully developed considering the highest rainfall event 23 4 mm in july it was found that the water interception of individual trees varied substantially between 9 and 20 the increase of lai from 1 95 to 2 11 m2 m2 during june and july increased the simulated interception by 6 49 mm 86 this was calculated without wind consideration lü et al 2007 however toba and ohta 2008 reported that interception was not significantly affected by low wind speeds 0 2 m s and even decreased under windy conditions 3 3 m s for vinyl trees the relationship of measured rainfall r and lai with estimated water interception i was described by one equation eq 5 the coefficient of determination r2 between modelled and measured values was high with r2 0 99 and fit standard error and fstat were found 0 11 and 2736 14 respectively fig 8 5 i 1 0 33 2 37 r 0 5 0 97 e lai increasing lai by 25 and 50 resulted in 17 and 34 increase in interception for precise irrigation management in practise the interception additionally to gross rainfall data would be valuable such data can be calculated based on the empirical model table 1 presents the summary of calculated interception and gross rainfall for the total of 31 rainfall events in the sweet cherry orchard considering the period from bud break until after harvest when fruit trees are commonly irrigated in temperate climate average interception varied between 27 and 46 for the monthly cumulative rainfall depending on lai the average interception values for all events was 41 the discrepancy between crop evapotranspiration etc and net rainfall appeared especially in june and july fig 9 the high water needs here etc at high water vapour pressure deficit is the main factor dominating the seasonal trend the seasonal course of etc is actually hiding the high variability of percentage of water interception during canopy development however despite an increase in rainfall during end of june and in july water supply is insufficient due to increased water demand resulting from the relationship shown in fig 8 in cherry orchard the interception can be calculated it can be assumed that the model can be used in other fruit trees as well the substantial amount of intercepted water explains that it is an important part of the seasonal water balance and an estimate of water loss due to interception should be factored into the calculation of net irrigation demand lidar laser scanning may therefore provide a feasible method for more precise irrigation additionally wind may affect canopy interception zabret et al 2018 especially for medium size leaves leathery and smooth such as cherry trees gyeviki et al 2012 van stan et al 2011 yang et al 2019 which needs to be investigated further 4 conclusion high spatial resolution information on canopy geometry and structure may result in better orchard management decisions in this study lidar was applied to estimate lai as critical parameter influencing rainwater interception by cherry tree canopy in a commercial orchard the relationship between measured lai and rainfall with estimated interception was derived from the community land model clm which provides a numerical equation to calculate interception in fruit trees the results considering lai are pointing to inter tree variability in water interception as such the present results support that rainfall interception are increased by increasing lai and should be considered in seasonal water balance calculations of cherry orchards the model needs to be confirmed for other fruit trees interception losses increase the

9339,in precision agriculture methods for analysing 3d point clouds of plants have been introduced particularly pointing to the high accuracy of light detection and ranging lidar laser scanning under field conditions in the present work lidar based 3d point clouds of cherry trees n 255 were analysed for estimating the leaf area as the main factor for water interception canopies were scanned for segmenting leaf area pointing to a high variability of canopy surface the derived tree specific data of leaf area index lai were implemented into the community land model clm which takes into account canopy interception processes during rainfall events during canopy development of perennial trees the lai increased resulting in increased water interception events with low rain fall the interception reached 38 100 capturing lai of 0 76 2 11 m2 m2 respectively in high rainfall events interception varied 10 14 capturing the same lai range an equation for describing the varying effects of rainfall intensity and lai is proposed the evapotranspiration and water interception data point to a substantial decrease of effective water supply that varies tree individually during the season in commercial fruit production the proposed method can support precise irrigation management keywords fruit tree laser scanner leaf area leaf area index rainfall interception data availability data will be made

application and crop load management zude sasse et al 2016 canopy features interacting with the environment are the foliage woody parts and reproductive organs particularly the leaf area index lai has been introduced for predicting ecosystem models of hydrologic and carbon cycles changes in the lai can affect evapotranspiration et which regulates soil moisture content liu et al 2016 seo and kim 2021 furthermore irrigation lebon et al 2006 water stress junttila et al 2021 fertilisation rosell and sanz 2012 application of plant protection agents gil et al 2014 light interception louarn et al 2008 and fruit yield and quality penzel et al 2021 have all been linked to leaf area and leaf density kliewer and dokoozlian 2005 several models that calculate fluxes among soil and land surface systems frequently employ the lai as a key input variable gao et al 2012 gyeviki et al 2012 carrasco benavides et al 2016 the actual lai is directly measured using time consuming processes that include partial or complete defoliation of trees the general effect of foliage enhancing the water interception was shown in deciduous trees staelens et al 2008 however direct lai measurements of individual trees in vegetation cover or orchards are hardly applied in large scale research and are typically used to calibrate indirect methods garrigues et al 2008 fuentes et al 2012 confalonieri et al 2013 in research light detection and ranging lidar laser scanners are frequently employed as an indirect way to analyse trees and arable crops overcoming effects of varying lighting conditions that limit the use of camera systems del moral martínez et al 2016 the lidar sensor is typically mounted on terrestrial or aerial platforms in order to acquire the three dimensional 3d profile of plants additionally to the lai the tree area index arnó et al 2013 as well as the leaf wall area del moral martínez et al 2015 are two further metrics obtained with terrestrial laser scanners recent studies in forestry exploited the potential of 3d point cloud measured for individual tree to discriminate la from stem area by means of lidar backscattered reflectance and geometric features hackel et al 2016 2022 using the same method the estimation of la was achieved for fruit trees with high accuracy zhang et al 2021 tsoulias et al 2022 similarly lidar backscattered reflectance and geometric features have been exploited to segment cotton balls sun et al 2020 and implemented for autonomous harvesting in greenhouse applications tao and zhou 2017 lin et al 2020 in fruit production the reflectance intensity and geometric features were combined to identify and segment the total number and size of apples per tree gené mola et al 2019 tsoulias et al 2020 a similar approach based on geometric features was introduced to segment 3d points of woody parts from leaves and fruit in pomegranates zhang et al 2021 considering irrigation management la and lai play critical roles in hydrological processes during and after a rain event leaves intercept substantial amounts of precipitation and evaporate back into the atmosphere the net intake of orchard soils is determined by taking into account this relationship consequently water resource management requires an understanding of canopy variation in terms of lai to estimate water interception interception is an important component of whole orchards seasonal water balance especially in the case of intensive planting systems where net irrigation requirements should incorporate an estimate of interception loss gómez et al 2001 for precise management the amount and intensity of rainfall are critical factors in determining canopy interception in mixed forest results showed that the canopy of broad leaved korean pine intercepted 22 of rainfall sheng and cai 2019 however rainfall interception by the canopy varied from 7 to 83 interception by olive trees ranged from 7 to 25 of the average annual precipitation 606 mm considering 0 3 and 5 0 m2 m2 lai respectively gómez et al 2001 high rainfall amount might lead to changes of canopy interception sheng and cai 2019 sun et al 2011 according to schneebeli et al 2012 up to 60 of rainfall is intercepted during light rainfall whereas only 4 is intercepted during periods of strong rainfall and roughly 15 of the rain volume is intercepted during rainfalls of medium intensity rain interception of oak canopy trees was affected by wind speed lockwood and sellers 1982 low wind speeds 0 2 m s resulted in no effect on water interception whereas interception decreased significantly under windy conditions 3 3 m s for vinyl trees toba and ohta 2008 simulation models such as community land model clm or gash model have been developed for understanding these important dynamics because canopy interception can exceed 59 of yearly precipitation in mature trees xiao et al 2000 modeling performance was good for olive trees with total interception loss of 18 considering the experimental period and modeling using the gash model nóbrega et al 2015 however most studies were conducted in forests whereas in commercial fruit production the clm hasn t been applied so far

precipitation in summer months frequently high rainfall event occurred end of june and in july at these high rainfall events the percentage of intercepted water decreased even if the foliage was fully developed considering the highest rainfall event 23 4 mm in july it was found that the water interception of individual trees varied substantially between 9 and 20 the increase of lai from 1 95 to 2 11 m2 m2 during june and july increased the simulated interception by 6 49 mm 86 this was calculated without wind consideration lü et al 2007 however toba and ohta 2008 reported that interception was not significantly affected by low wind speeds 0 2 m s and even decreased under windy conditions 3 3 m s for vinyl trees the relationship of measured rainfall r and lai with estimated water interception i was described by one equation eq 5 the coefficient of determination r2 between modelled and measured values was high with r2 0 99 and fit standard error and fstat were found 0 11 and 2736 14 respectively fig 8 5 i 1 0 33 2 37 r 0 5 0 97 e lai increasing lai by 25 and 50 resulted in 17 and 34 increase in interception for precise irrigation management in practise the interception additionally to gross rainfall data would be valuable such data can be calculated based on the empirical model table 1 presents the summary of calculated interception and gross rainfall for the total of 31 rainfall events in the sweet cherry orchard considering the period from bud break until after harvest when fruit trees are commonly irrigated in temperate climate average interception varied between 27 and 46 for the monthly cumulative rainfall depending on lai the average interception values for all events was 41 the discrepancy between crop evapotranspiration etc and net rainfall appeared especially in june and july fig 9 the high water needs here etc at high water vapour pressure deficit is the main factor dominating the seasonal trend the seasonal course of etc is actually hiding the high variability of percentage of water interception during canopy development however despite an increase in rainfall during end of june and in july water supply is insufficient due to increased water demand resulting from the relationship shown in fig 8 in cherry orchard the interception can be calculated it can be assumed that the model can be used in other fruit trees as well the substantial amount of intercepted water explains that it is an important part of the seasonal water balance and an estimate of water loss due to interception should be factored into the calculation of net irrigation demand lidar laser scanning may therefore provide a feasible method for more precise irrigation additionally wind may affect canopy interception zabret et al 2018 especially for medium size leaves leathery and smooth such as cherry trees gyeviki et al 2012 van stan et al 2011 yang et al 2019 which needs to be investigated further 4 conclusion high spatial resolution information on canopy geometry and structure may result in better orchard management decisions in this study lidar was applied to estimate lai as critical parameter influencing rainwater interception by cherry tree canopy in a commercial orchard the relationship between measured lai and rainfall with estimated interception was derived from the community land model clm which provides a numerical equation to calculate interception in fruit trees the results considering lai are pointing to inter tree variability in water interception as such the present results support that rainfall interception are increased by increasing lai and should be considered in seasonal water balance calculations of cherry orchards the model needs to be confirmed for other fruit trees interception losses increase the water demand of crops necessitating additional irrigation demands declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships
