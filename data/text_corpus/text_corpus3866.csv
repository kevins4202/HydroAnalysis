19330,this study investigates the biofouling resistance of modified reverse osmosis ro feed spacers control spacers made of polypropylene were functionalized with a biocidal coating silver hydrophilic sio2 nanoparticles or superhydrophobic tmpsi tio2 nanoparticles anti adhesive coatings or a hybrid hydrophilic biocidal coating graphene oxide performance was measured by adhesion assays viability tests and permeate flow decline in a bench scale ro system the control spacers proved to be one of the better performing materials based on bacterial deposition and dynamic ro fouling experiments the good anti adhesive properties of the control can be explained by its near ideal surface free energy sfe the only surface modification that significantly reduced biofouling compared to the control was the biocidal silver coating which outperformed the other spacers by all measured indicators therefore future efforts to improve spacer materials for biofouling control should focus on engineering biocidal coatings rather than anti adhesive ones graphical abstract image 1 keywords spacers desalination biofouling reverse osmosis nanomaterials 1 introduction due to a growing global population expanding economies and a broadening international middle class by 2030 the united nations projects the world will face a global water deficit of 40 un water 2015 in order to meet the rising demand for freshwater utilities around the world are turning to non traditional sources such as seawater and wastewater the high salinity of seawater and to a lesser degree wastewater means that these alternative feedwaters must be desalinated for domestic industrial or agricultural uses wade miller 2006 desalination via reverse osmosis ro using thin film composite tfc membranes is the industry standard for desalination due to ro s high energy efficiency compared to other large scale desalination technologies fritzmann et al 2007 however ro desalination is still burdened by substantial economic and environmental costs both of which must be addressed to ensure the sustainability of this increasingly important water treatment process biofouling or the attachment and proliferation of microorganisms on a surface reduces the efficiency of ro and contributes to the high economic and environmental costs of operating ro systems the formation of biofilms a heterogeneous assembly of microbial cells and extrapolymeric substances eps in membrane modules increases the hydraulic resistance in the feed channel and therefore the energy required to move water through the membrane chong et al 2008 biofouling in membrane modules requires extensive chemical cleaning procedures which increases costs associated with chemical use reduces the membrane lifetime and forces downtime in water production flemming 1997 madaeni et al 2001 due to biofilm enhanced osmotic pressure at the membrane interface biofouling can also negatively impact the quality of the permeate herzberg and elimelech 2007 altogether the impact of fouling leads to significant economic impacts with previous work estimating the costs of biofouling and biofouling control to be as high as 30 of the plant s total operating costs flemming 1997 significant research efforts have been made towards designing biofouling resistant membranes and reducing the costs associated with biofilm formation rana and matsuura 2010 kochkodan and hilal 2015 the most common strategy is to modify membranes with biocidal or anti adhesive properties to reduce deposition of bacteria or inhibit their proliferation bogler et al 2017 membranes that express biocidal properties are often coated with toxic substances so that microorganisms are impaired and or removed from the surface membranes coated with biocidal materials such as silver copper graphene oxide and selenium have been shown to outperform control membranes in terms of flux decline and biofilm formation akar et al 2013 perreault et al 2014 yin et al 2013 ben sasson et al 2014 on the other hand anti adhesive coatings aim to minimize the attachment of microorganisms to the surface this is typically achieved by altering the surface characteristics that makes a membrane prone to fouling namely hydrophobicity roughness surface charges and surface free energy kato et al 1995 vrijenhoek et al 2001 asatekin et al 2007 salta et al 2010 zhao et al 2015 most research on fouling control in membrane processes has focused on membrane modifications vrouwenvelder et al 2009 however modifying the polyamide layer of ro membranes can be challenging since the anti adhesive modifications often alter the membrane performance or are hard to implement in the current roll to roll fabrication process at the industrial scale rana and matsuura 2010 kochkodan and hilal 2015 conversely feed spacers which provide a channel for water to flow through and induce turbulence to reduce concentration polarization are passive surfaces that can be easily functionalized without affecting the membrane permeability araujo et al 2012 ronen et al 2013 2016 more importantly spacers have been shown to have a disproportionately high impact on the feed channel pressure drop when fouled for example fouled feed spacers led to a 4 times higher increase in feed channel pressure drop compared to the same amount of biomass fouling on the membrane vrouwenvelder et al 2009 bucs et al 2014 additionally biofilms on spacers can shear off and redeposit on membranes resulting in increased membrane fouling radu et al 2014 research by yang et al further confirmed the importance of spacers in fouling as ro modules with nanosilver coated spacers outperformed nanosilver coated membranes in terms of permeate flux yang et al 2009 however most of the research efforts have focused on antimicrobial spacer designs and the optimal approach for biofouling mitigation on feed spacers is yet to be established bucs et al 2014 radu et al 2014 ronen et al 2016 2013 to date no studies have compared the efficacy of anti adhesive spacers versus antimicrobial ones for biofouling control in desalination systems in the present study we investigated the biofouling resistance of a suite of modified feed spacers containing a broad range of anti adhesive or biocidal surface chemistries with the objective of identifying the surface properties that contribute most to spacer s biofouling resistance nanosilver was used as the biocidal coating silica nanoparticles sio2 nps and trimethoxypropyl silane coated titanium dioxide nanoparticles tmpsi tio2 nps were used as hydrophilic and superhydrophobic anti adhesive coatings respectively while graphene oxide go was applied as a combined anti adhesive and antimicrobial coating commercial polypropylene feed spacers were used as control samples in order to compare performance against the industry standard for desalination modules and provide useful guidelines for feed spacers material design the performance of the spacers was measured by deposition assays and flux decline measured via biofouling experiments in a bench scale ro system our findings indicate that surface free energy sfe was the dominant factor in predicting the materials propensity to foul and that a biocidal coating appears to be the best strategy for biofouling control 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals and supplies were obtained from

characterization successful modification of the control spacers was confirmed by various approaches i different surface characteristics were captured by sem microscopy fig 1 top panels the control surface appears as a smooth and homogeneous surface however after functionalization a clear morphological change was noted for the functionalized spacers nanoscale sized particles were visible on the silver sio2 and tmpsi tio2 coated spacers while the go coated surface showed the distinctive wrinkled morphology of go sheets as previously observed on other go coated surfaces soroush et al 2016a yin et al 2016 some heterogeneity in particle size shape and aggregation state was observed for all the functionalized surfaces which suggest that the functionalization procedure could be further optimized for more homogeneous surface characteristics ii spectroscopic analyses of the functionalized surfaces confirmed the nature of the morphological change observed on the sem micrographs the sem images analyzed by edax spectroscopy fig 1 bottom panels show peaks attributable according to the functionalization considered to carbon 0 2 kev oxygen 0 5 kev silver 3 kev ti 4 5 kev and si 1 75 kev

further confirmed by raman spectroscopy of the go coated spacers which revealed the distinctive d and g bands of go at 1325 cm 1 and 1575 cm 1 respectively figure s2 the appearance of the d and g bands is in agreement with previous research on go coated surfaces and supports the successful functionalization of the go coated spacers ionita et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 xue et al 2018 these different surface characterization techniques confirm that spacers were successfully functionalized with the different materials considered in this study 3 2 spacer functionalization alters the surface chemistry of control surface properties that are known to influence bacteria deposition were characterized for each functionalized surface and compared to pristine control surface wettability which was indicated by the wca varied significantly between the different functionalized surfaces fig 2 a the addition of go and silver coatings increased the hydrophilicity of the spacers reducing the wca from 91 9 3 5 for pristine control to 58 1 3 2 and 50 8 1 5 for the go and silver modified surfaces respectively the increased hydrophilicity of the go and silver modified surfaces agrees with previous work where similar functionalizations were applied to membrane surfaces yin et al 2013 perreault et al 2014 the increase in hydrophilicity can be attributed partly to the oxygen functional group of go and to some extent to the hydrophilic nature of the pda coating used as an intermediate for functionalization perreault et al 2014 tang et al 2015 the spacers functionalized with sio2 nps were rendered highly hydrophilic with a wca of 31 6 8 4 while the tmpsi tio2 coated spacers achieved superhydrophobicity at a wca of 143 9 8 9 concomitant change in surface free energy is also shown on fig 2a with surface free energy increasing as the surface gets more hydrophilic surface free energy and hydrophilicity are two major factors influencing the deposition of bacteria to surfaces zhao et al 2005 asatekin et al 2007 bogler et al 2017 the functionalized spacers produced in this study were designed to cover a range of wettability and surface energy values our results indicate that each modification increased the surface roughness of the feed spacers compared to the control fig 2b the tmpsi tio2 coated spacer stood out as being very rough with a 296 nm 46 3 average surface roughness compared to 40 nm for the go silver and sio2 coated spacers the high roughness of tmpsi tio2 modified spacers was due to the harsh functionalization conditions where a hot 120 c suspension of tmpsi tio2 in xylene was used to melt the control and embed the tmpsi tio2 nps in the polymer the high surface roughness of the tmpsi tio2 spacers was fundamental to the superhydrophobicity of the surface as it generated a heterogeneous surface that changes the surface wetting conditions to the cassie baxter regime where air pockets trapped in the rough microstructure prevent complete wetting of the surface yoshimitsu et al 2002 therefore for superhydrophobic coatings high surface roughness is desired concurrently surface charge was modified after functionalization of the spacers zeta potential measured by streaming potential analysis increased with the functionalization in the following order control tmpsi tio2 go silver sio2 fig 2c the higher zeta potential value of the sio2 coated surface can be attributed to the positively charged nh3 groups on the functionalized sio2 nps the zeta potentials of the samples ranged from 25 to 15 mv in the ph range at which biofouling experiments were done with the pristine spacer and the sio2 coated spacers on either ends of the spectrum previous studies on surface fouling typically show that hydrophilic surfaces that have low surface roughness and negative surface charge are less prone to fouling for example ro and fo membranes functionalized with superhydrophilic sio2 nps were shown to better resist fouling of a variety of model organic foulants tiraferri et al 2012b roughness impacts fouling rates as foulants are more likely to deposit in the valleys and troughs of rough surfaces vrijenhoek et al 2001 past research has also demonstrated a correlation between surface charge and fouling of proteins on microfiltration membranes zhan et al 2004 however the relative importance of each of these properties on the overall fouling propensity of a surface is still not resolved and based on the surface properties measured for the different functionalized spacers it is difficult to predict which spacers will have the highest fouling resistance therefore dynamic deposition assays were performed to assess the fouling propensity of each surface 3 3 bacterial deposition and viability on functionalized control bacterial deposition was measured via cfu counts and epifluorescence microscopy analysis based on these analyses the biocidal silver coated spacers significantly outperformed the other spacers in terms of bacterial deposition fig 3 silver coated spacers experienced 87 7 less cfu on the surface compared to the control 100 30 after 1 h of contact with 1 108 cfu ml of p aeruginosa fig 3a by comparison tmpsi tio2 coated spacers had 5 39 more cfus than the control while sio2 had 76 70 more neither of which were statistically significant additionally the spacer coated with go which was previously demonstrated to be both an anti adhesive and antimicrobial agent on membranes liu et al 2011 choi et al 2013 chae et al 2015 showed the highest cfu increase compared to the control 216 155 of any of the tested spacers this unexpected result could be the product of several factors for one the synthetic wastewater used in these experiments included 0 2 mm of cacl2 calcium is known to initiate fouling by forming calcium bridges between carboxylic acid groups which are present on both bacteria and go sheets lee and elimelech 2006 these carboxylic acid groups were added to a polypropylene surface that initially was relatively inert and devoid of carboxylic acid groups in addition the spatial orientation of go was recently shown to have a profound effect on both its antimicrobial potential and its anti adhesive properties as horizontally aligned flat go sheets have both reduced biocidal and anti adhesive properties lu et al 2017 xue et al 2018 given the flat surface of control the pda mediated functionalization may have favored a flat deposition of go sheets on the surface and reduced its efficiency compared to other more rough go functionalized surfaces perreault et al 2014 the cfu results were supported by epifluorescence imaging of the deposited bacteria stained with syto 9 and propidium iodide which indicate live and dead cells respectively fig 3b bacterial viability on the control surface was 68 6 the go and sio2 had a higher cell viability for deposited cells 95 1 and 98 1 respectively and higher cell counts increases of 17 13 and 11 20 compared to the control respectively these results agree with the cfu plate counts for the silver coated samples cell counts were 97 1 lower than control values while cell viability was reduced to 23 8 the tmpsi tio2 samples performed better than the control in terms of both cell counts 35 2 p 0 05 and percent viability 53 1 p 0 05 which differs from the data obtained by cfu plate counts this discrepancy may be attributed to the different flow conditions continuous flow vs rotating flask of the different assays potentially due to the self cleaning properties of highly hydrophobic materials which under certain conditions can remove foulants as water rolls across the material s surface nishimoto and bhushan 2013 from the two deposition assays it can be concluded that more bacteria deposited on the hydrophilic surfaces compared to the control in addition silver coated spacers had a lower bacteria abundance than all other surfaces 3 4 biofouling control during reverse osmosis operation bench scale ro fouling experiments were performed using a synthetic secondary wastewater supplemented with p aeruginosa as biofilm developed in the membrane cell the permeate flux declined for all samples fig 4 while biofilm growth on feed spacers does not directly inhibit membrane flux it does so indirectly by increasing the biofilm enhanced pressure drop in the module additionally biofilm from the spacers can be transported to the membrane and accelerate fouling bar zeev et al 2015 bogler et al 2017 following 24 h of biofouling development the permeate water flux of the membrane cell with a control spacer declined by 70 2 in agreement with the bacterial deposition assay the biocidal silver coated spacers resulted in the lowest permeate flux decline of all conditions with a 28 2 decline after 24 h the sio2 spacer also had a statistically significant lower permeate flux decline 62 2 than the control in comparison all other functionalized samples resulted in similar or higher flux declines than the control spacer fig 4 therefore the reduced deposition and viability observed by epifluorescence microscopy for the tmpsi tio2 sample did not necessarily translate to better biofouling resistance in the membrane system discrepancy between short term bacterial deposition assays and dynamic biofouling experiments have been noted in the past araujo et al 2012 highlighting the importance of longer duration experiments when evaluation the biofouling resistance of a material 3 5 mechanisms and implications previous research on anti adhesive membranes correlated hydrophilicity with low bacteria or protein adhesion mansouri et al 2010 typically the adhesion of foulants to a material surface occurs in the stagnant layer of water resting between the material surface and the bulk fluid hydrogen bonding between hydrophilic materials and water can lead to a smaller stagnant layer as well as higher shear forces making it more difficult for foulants to adsorb on the surface kochkodan and hilal 2015 moreover given that most organic molecules are hydrophobic many foulants can be driven away from hydrophilic surfaces due unfavorable hydrophilic hydrophobic interactions rana and matsuura 2010 therefore based on these observations we hypothesized that hydrophilic spacers would experience less fouling than the hydrophobic control however aside from the modest outperformance of the sio2 modified spacers during the ro trials the pristine control surface which is relatively hydrophobic performed in line with or outperformed the hydrophilic surface functionalizations none of the anti adhesive modifications tested appeared to confer any advantages over the pristine control when biofouling is considered rendering the surface superhydrophobic the opposite end of the spectrum did not contribute to biofouling reduction either the only surface functionalization that minimized biofouling of the spacers was the biocidal coating based on the silver functionalization these results differ from previous research on membrane surfaces where go or superhydrophilic sio2 coatings demonstrated good resistance to biofouling this discrepancy highlights that a material s anti adhesive properties are relative and depend on the surface properties of the control in the present study the control material polypropylene was relatively anti adhesive so the modifications that had worked on membranes did not show the same effect on spacers when correlating surface properties with biofouling for the various surfaces investigated in this work sfe was found to be a key determinant of the fouling propensity this relationship between sfe and fouling was previously identified for different types of materials and conditions baier 1980 absolom et al 1983 zhao et al 2004 2005 the relationship between sfe and adhesion is related to the dlvo theory which describes the interaction of particles in water through van der waals forces and electrostatic forces zhao et al derived a formula from the dlvo theory describing the sfe at which fouling will be a minimum zhao et al 2004 4 γ s u r f a c e l w 1 2 γ b a c t e r i a l w γ f l u i d l w where γ s u r f a c e l w γ b a c t e r i a l w and γ f l u i d l w correspond to the lifshitz van der waals surface free energies of the surface bacteria and fluid respectively adhesion is less likely when the surface free energies of the surface and of the foulant are similar and are more likely to occur when the average of γ b a c t e r i a l w and γ f l u i d l w is larger than that of γ s u r f a c e l w previous research has calculated the lifshitz van der waals sfe of stationary phase of p aeruginosa γ b a c t e r i a l w to be 30 7 mn m grasso et al 1996 in addition van oss et al determined the γ w a t e r l w to be 21 8 mn m van oss and giese 1995 inputting these values into equation 4 yields γ s u r f a c e l w 26 1 m n m indicating materials with an sfe of approximately 26 mn m will have maximum resistance to adhesion of p aeruginosa in terms of sfe using contact angle measurements the sfe of the control was found to be 30 0 mn m 2 8 which is closer to the theoretical ideal sfe than any of the functionalized surfaces this near ideal sfe of the control is hypothesized to be the driving factor behind its ability to resist fouling previous research has also shown sfes between 10 and 24 mn m to be the most resistant to biofouling in marine environments lindner 1992 chambers et al 2006 however marine fouling includes fouling by algae barnacles and mussels in addition to bacteria therefore the model derived by zhao et al 2004 which describes the relationship between bacterial fouling and sfe is more representative of biofouling in ro changes in sfe also explain the performance of most of the functionalized surfaces fig 5 modification of the control surface with sio2 57 6 mn m 2 4 and go 39 2 mn m 1 0 changed the sfe of the spacers away from the theoretical optimal value and as a result the fouling propensity of the surface increased for go coated surfaces previous work highlighted the role of the material s hydrophilicity and antimicrobial properties in its ability to limit fouling on different types of surfaces soroush et al 2016b however for the control the go coating increased the sfe of the spacer and rendered the surface in respect to sfe more prone to fouling moreover the addition of go sheets on the surface will increase the abundance of carboxylic acid functional groups compared to the control these carboxylic acid functional groups can bind to organic foulants and bacteria in the presence of calcium and in the calcium rich synthetic secondary wastewater medium used in our experiments may have contributed to the increase in bacterial deposition therefore despite the promising findings found for go on other types of materials go coated spacers underperformed compared to the control on the other hand the sfe value of the hydrophobic tmpsi tio2 spacers 31 3 3 8 mn m is not significantly different from the sfe of polypropylene explaining why tmpsi tio2 s anti biofouling performance did not vary significantly from the control the biocidal spacers coated with silver nps had a similar sfe 30 7 mn m 0 4 to the control as well but these spacers also had lower bacterial abundance than all other samples silver is a strong biocidal agent thought to act through a variety of mechanisms including disruption of cell membranes and destruction or inactivation of organelles and dna fabrega et al 2009 prabhu and poulose 2012 biocidal coatings based on silver have been shown to impart biofouling control on spacers membranes and a variety of others surfaces therefore the good performance of silver coated spacers should be expected the reduced bacterial deposition and increased fouling resistance from the biocidal spacers may be the result of bacterial inactivation by the surface which inhibits cell division or due to surface avoidance in response to silver stress mitzel et al 2017 under dynamic ro biofouling conditions this biocidal surface was the only modified surface that showed resistance to biofilm formation these results highlight the critical role of antimicrobial properties as well as an optimized sfe for improved biofouling control on spacers 3 6 engineering applications feed spacers play an integral role in ro spiral wound modules as they provide a channel for water to flow through and reduce the impact of concentration polarization however their propensity to foul can have a significant increase on the pressure drop in the feed channel and by accumulating biofilms on their surface can encourage the deposition of bacteria on membranes flemming 1997 vrouwenvelder et al 2009 radu et al 2014 the findings of our research suggest that the polypropylene spacers used in commercial ro modules possess good anti adhesive properties largely due to their sfe these results support the use of sfe models rather than the commonly used surface hydrophilicity parameters as a starting point when designing antifouling spacer materials owens and wendt 1969 baier 1980 zhao et al 2004 however to specifically target biofouling control providing anti adhesive functions is not sufficient and biocidal properties are needed for polypropylene surfaces this study employed a synthetic secondary wastewater in which p aeruginosa was the only bacteria present in practice other bacteria organic molecules and inorganic compounds will be in feed water so it is important to consider how other constituents might interact with the spacers using zhao et al s adhesion model and sfe literature values of several other common foulants it is possible to predict which compounds may be prone to foul the spacers the sfes of escherichia coli e coli bacteria alginate polysaccharide and bovine serum albumin bsa protein are 32 mn m 1 2 20 7 mn m and 30 8 mn m respectively lee and ruckenstein 1988 harkes et al 1993 caykara et al 2005 inputting these values into zhao et al s model generates theoretical antifouling material sfes of 27 7 mn m 0 5 21 3 mn m and 26 1 mn m respectively which are similar to the values obtained for p aeruginosa this suggests that the relative fouling resistance of polypropylene spacers can be expected to hold true in real world applications however biofouling is more complex than only deposition of foulants and to efficiently mitigate biofilm formation inactivation of deposited microorganisms is critical the results of this work demonstrate that biocidal spacers are the optimal way to improve the biofouling resistance of polypropylene spacers future work on the development of biofouling resistant spacers should consider different biocidal coatings and longer duration studies with complex natural waters in order to identify the optimal surface coatings and validate their long term performance in real systems the role of the water composition should also be investigated to validate the use of biocidal coatings for biofouling control in seawater desalination settings where higher ionic strength and chloride concentration may alter the performance of the biocidal compound used for antimicrobial properties 4 conclusion this study describes the fouling behavior of control spacers with different anti adhesive and antimicrobial surface chemistries our results demonstrate that sfe is a dominant factor in determining a material s biofouling propensity and that the control due to its near ideal surface free energy possesses good intrinsic anti adhesive properties in addition the strong performance of the biocidal silver coated spacer shows that to make spacers more biofilm resistant modified spacers should have good antimicrobial properties spacers development should therefore focus on increasing the antimicrobial performance of biocidal functionalizations rather than developing anti

19330,this study investigates the biofouling resistance of modified reverse osmosis ro feed spacers control spacers made of polypropylene were functionalized with a biocidal coating silver hydrophilic sio2 nanoparticles or superhydrophobic tmpsi tio2 nanoparticles anti adhesive coatings or a hybrid hydrophilic biocidal coating graphene oxide performance was measured by adhesion assays viability tests and permeate flow decline in a bench scale ro system the control spacers proved to be one of the better performing materials based on bacterial deposition and dynamic ro fouling experiments the good anti adhesive properties of the control can be explained by its near ideal surface free energy sfe the only surface modification that significantly reduced biofouling compared to the control was the biocidal silver coating which outperformed the other spacers by all measured indicators therefore future efforts to improve spacer materials for biofouling control should focus on engineering biocidal coatings rather than anti adhesive ones graphical abstract image 1 keywords spacers desalination biofouling reverse osmosis nanomaterials 1 introduction due to a growing global population expanding economies and a broadening international middle class by 2030 the united nations projects the world will face a global water deficit of 40 un water 2015 in order to meet the rising demand for freshwater utilities around the world are turning to non traditional sources such as seawater and wastewater the high salinity of seawater and to a lesser degree wastewater means that these alternative feedwaters must be desalinated for domestic industrial or agricultural uses wade miller 2006 desalination via reverse osmosis ro using thin film composite tfc membranes is the industry standard for desalination due to ro s high energy efficiency compared to other large scale desalination technologies fritzmann et al 2007 however ro desalination is still burdened by substantial economic and environmental costs both of which must be addressed to ensure the sustainability of this increasingly important water treatment process biofouling or the attachment and proliferation of microorganisms on a surface reduces the efficiency of ro and contributes to the high economic and environmental costs of operating ro systems the formation of biofilms a heterogeneous assembly of microbial cells and extrapolymeric substances eps in membrane modules increases the hydraulic resistance in the feed channel and therefore the energy required to move water through the membrane chong et al 2008 biofouling in membrane modules requires extensive chemical cleaning procedures which increases costs associated with chemical use reduces the membrane lifetime and forces downtime in water production flemming 1997 madaeni et al 2001 due to biofilm enhanced osmotic pressure at the membrane interface biofouling can also negatively impact the quality of the permeate herzberg and elimelech 2007 altogether the impact of fouling leads to significant economic impacts with previous work estimating the costs of biofouling and biofouling control to be as high as 30 of the plant s total operating costs flemming 1997 significant research efforts have been made towards designing biofouling resistant membranes and reducing the costs associated with biofilm formation rana and matsuura 2010 kochkodan and hilal 2015 the most common strategy is to modify membranes with biocidal or anti adhesive properties to reduce deposition of bacteria or inhibit their proliferation bogler et al 2017 membranes that express biocidal properties are often coated with toxic substances so that microorganisms are impaired and or removed from the surface membranes coated with biocidal materials such as silver copper graphene oxide and selenium have been shown to outperform control membranes in terms of flux decline and biofilm formation akar et al 2013 perreault et al 2014 yin et al 2013 ben sasson et al 2014 on the other hand anti adhesive coatings aim to minimize the attachment of microorganisms to the surface this is typically achieved by altering the surface characteristics that makes a membrane prone to fouling namely hydrophobicity roughness surface charges and surface free energy kato et al 1995 vrijenhoek et al 2001 asatekin et al 2007 salta et al 2010 zhao et al 2015 most research on fouling control in membrane processes has focused on membrane modifications vrouwenvelder et al 2009 however modifying the polyamide layer of ro membranes can be challenging since the anti adhesive modifications often alter the membrane performance or are hard to implement in the current roll to roll fabrication process at the industrial scale rana and matsuura 2010 kochkodan and hilal 2015 conversely feed spacers which provide a channel for water to flow through and induce turbulence to reduce concentration polarization are passive surfaces that can be easily functionalized without affecting the membrane permeability araujo et al 2012 ronen et al 2013 2016 more importantly spacers have been shown to have a disproportionately high impact on the feed channel pressure drop when fouled for example fouled feed spacers led to a 4 times higher increase in feed channel pressure drop compared to the same amount of biomass fouling on the membrane vrouwenvelder et al 2009 bucs et al 2014 additionally biofilms on spacers can shear off and redeposit on membranes resulting in increased membrane fouling radu et al 2014 research by yang et al further confirmed the importance of spacers in fouling as ro modules with nanosilver coated spacers outperformed nanosilver coated membranes in terms of permeate flux yang et al 2009 however most of the research efforts have focused on antimicrobial spacer designs and the optimal approach for biofouling mitigation on feed spacers is yet to be established bucs et al 2014 radu et al 2014 ronen et al 2016 2013 to date no studies have compared the efficacy of anti adhesive spacers versus antimicrobial ones for biofouling control in desalination systems in the present study we investigated the biofouling resistance of a suite of modified feed spacers containing a broad range of anti adhesive or biocidal surface chemistries with the objective of identifying the surface properties that contribute most to spacer s biofouling resistance nanosilver was used as the biocidal coating silica nanoparticles sio2 nps and trimethoxypropyl silane coated titanium dioxide nanoparticles tmpsi tio2 nps were used as hydrophilic and superhydrophobic anti adhesive coatings respectively while graphene oxide go was applied as a combined anti adhesive and antimicrobial coating commercial polypropylene feed spacers were used as control samples in order to compare performance against the industry standard for desalination modules and provide useful guidelines for feed spacers material design the performance of the spacers was measured by deposition assays and flux decline measured via biofouling experiments in a bench scale ro system our findings indicate that surface free energy sfe was the dominant factor in predicting the materials propensity to foul and that a biocidal coating appears to be the best strategy for biofouling control 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals and supplies were obtained from

characterization successful modification of the control spacers was confirmed by various approaches i different surface characteristics were captured by sem microscopy fig 1 top panels the control surface appears as a smooth and homogeneous surface however after functionalization a clear morphological change was noted for the functionalized spacers nanoscale sized particles were visible on the silver sio2 and tmpsi tio2 coated spacers while the go coated surface showed the distinctive wrinkled morphology of go sheets as previously observed on other go coated surfaces soroush et al 2016a yin et al 2016 some heterogeneity in particle size shape and aggregation state was observed for all the functionalized surfaces which suggest that the functionalization procedure could be further optimized for more homogeneous surface characteristics ii spectroscopic analyses of the functionalized surfaces confirmed the nature of the morphological change observed on the sem micrographs the sem images analyzed by edax spectroscopy fig 1 bottom panels show peaks attributable according to the functionalization considered to carbon 0 2 kev oxygen 0 5 kev silver 3 kev ti 4 5 kev and si 1 75 kev

further confirmed by raman spectroscopy of the go coated spacers which revealed the distinctive d and g bands of go at 1325 cm 1 and 1575 cm 1 respectively figure s2 the appearance of the d and g bands is in agreement with previous research on go coated surfaces and supports the successful functionalization of the go coated spacers ionita et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 xue et al 2018 these different surface characterization techniques confirm that spacers were successfully functionalized with the different materials considered in this study 3 2 spacer functionalization alters the surface chemistry of control surface properties that are known to influence bacteria deposition were characterized for each functionalized surface and compared to pristine control surface wettability which was indicated by the wca varied significantly between the different functionalized surfaces fig 2 a the addition of go and silver coatings increased the hydrophilicity of the spacers reducing the wca from 91 9 3 5 for pristine control to 58 1 3 2 and 50 8 1 5 for the go and silver modified surfaces respectively the increased hydrophilicity of the go and silver modified surfaces agrees with previous work where similar functionalizations were applied to membrane surfaces yin et al 2013 perreault et al 2014 the increase in hydrophilicity can be attributed partly to the oxygen functional group of go and to some extent to the hydrophilic nature of the pda coating used as an intermediate for functionalization perreault et al 2014 tang et al 2015 the spacers functionalized with sio2 nps were rendered highly hydrophilic with a wca of 31 6 8 4 while the tmpsi tio2 coated spacers achieved superhydrophobicity at a wca of 143 9 8 9 concomitant change in surface free energy is also shown on fig 2a with surface free energy increasing as the surface gets more hydrophilic surface free energy and hydrophilicity are two major factors influencing the deposition of bacteria to surfaces zhao et al 2005 asatekin et al 2007 bogler et al 2017 the functionalized spacers produced in this study were designed to cover a range of wettability and surface energy values our results indicate that each modification increased the surface roughness of the feed spacers compared to the control fig 2b the tmpsi tio2 coated spacer stood out as being very rough with a 296 nm 46 3 average surface roughness compared to 40 nm for the go silver and sio2 coated spacers the high roughness of tmpsi tio2 modified spacers was due to the harsh functionalization conditions where a hot 120 c suspension of tmpsi tio2 in xylene was used to melt the control and embed the tmpsi tio2 nps in the polymer the high surface roughness of the tmpsi tio2 spacers was fundamental to the superhydrophobicity of the surface as it generated a heterogeneous surface that changes the surface wetting conditions to the cassie baxter regime where air pockets trapped in the rough microstructure prevent complete wetting of the surface yoshimitsu et al 2002 therefore for superhydrophobic coatings high surface roughness is desired concurrently surface charge was modified after functionalization of the spacers zeta potential measured by streaming potential analysis increased with the functionalization in the following order control tmpsi tio2 go silver sio2 fig 2c the higher zeta potential value of the sio2 coated surface can be attributed to the positively charged nh3 groups on the functionalized sio2 nps the zeta potentials of the samples ranged from 25 to 15 mv in the ph range at which biofouling experiments were done with the pristine spacer and the sio2 coated spacers on either ends of the spectrum previous studies on surface fouling typically show that hydrophilic surfaces that have low surface roughness and negative surface charge are less prone to fouling for example ro and fo membranes functionalized with superhydrophilic sio2 nps were shown to better resist fouling of a variety of model organic foulants tiraferri et al 2012b roughness impacts fouling rates as foulants are more likely to deposit in the valleys and troughs of rough surfaces vrijenhoek et al 2001 past research has also demonstrated a correlation between surface charge and fouling of proteins on microfiltration membranes zhan et al 2004 however the relative importance of each of these properties on the overall fouling propensity of a surface is still not resolved and based on the surface properties measured for the different functionalized spacers it is difficult to predict which spacers will have the highest fouling resistance therefore dynamic deposition assays were performed to assess the fouling propensity of each surface 3 3 bacterial deposition and viability on functionalized control bacterial deposition was measured via cfu counts and epifluorescence microscopy analysis based on these analyses the biocidal silver coated spacers significantly outperformed the other spacers in terms of bacterial deposition fig 3 silver coated spacers experienced 87 7 less cfu on the surface compared to the control 100 30 after 1 h of contact with 1 108 cfu ml of p aeruginosa fig 3a by comparison tmpsi tio2 coated spacers had 5 39 more cfus than the control while sio2 had 76 70 more neither of which were statistically significant additionally the spacer coated with go which was previously demonstrated to be both an anti adhesive and antimicrobial agent on membranes liu et al 2011 choi et al 2013 chae et al 2015 showed the highest cfu increase compared to the control 216 155 of any of the tested spacers this unexpected result could be the product of several factors for one the synthetic wastewater used in these experiments included 0 2 mm of cacl2 calcium is known to initiate fouling by forming calcium bridges between carboxylic acid groups which are present on both bacteria and go sheets lee and elimelech 2006 these carboxylic acid groups were added to a polypropylene surface that initially was relatively inert and devoid of carboxylic acid groups in addition the spatial orientation of go was recently shown to have a profound effect on both its antimicrobial potential and its anti adhesive properties as horizontally aligned flat go sheets have both reduced biocidal and anti adhesive properties lu et al 2017 xue et al 2018 given the flat surface of control the pda mediated functionalization may have favored a flat deposition of go sheets on the surface and reduced its efficiency compared to other more rough go functionalized surfaces perreault et al 2014 the cfu results were supported by epifluorescence imaging of the deposited bacteria stained with syto 9 and propidium iodide which indicate live and dead cells respectively fig 3b bacterial viability on the control surface was 68 6 the go and sio2 had a higher cell viability for deposited cells 95 1 and 98 1 respectively and higher cell counts increases of 17 13 and 11 20 compared to the control respectively these results agree with the cfu plate counts for the silver coated samples cell counts were 97 1 lower than control values while cell viability was reduced to 23 8 the tmpsi tio2 samples performed better than the control in terms of both cell counts 35 2 p 0 05 and percent viability 53 1 p 0 05 which differs from the data obtained by cfu plate counts this discrepancy may be attributed to the different flow conditions continuous flow vs rotating flask of the different assays potentially due to the self cleaning properties of highly hydrophobic materials which under certain conditions can remove foulants as water rolls across the material s surface nishimoto and bhushan 2013 from the two deposition assays it can be concluded that more bacteria deposited on the hydrophilic surfaces compared to the control in addition silver coated spacers had a lower bacteria abundance than all other surfaces 3 4 biofouling control during reverse osmosis operation bench scale ro fouling experiments were performed using a synthetic secondary wastewater supplemented with p aeruginosa as biofilm developed in the membrane cell the permeate flux declined for all samples fig 4 while biofilm growth on feed spacers does not directly inhibit membrane flux it does so indirectly by increasing the biofilm enhanced pressure drop in the module additionally biofilm from the spacers can be transported to the membrane and accelerate fouling bar zeev et al 2015 bogler et al 2017 following 24 h of biofouling development the permeate water flux of the membrane cell with a control spacer declined by 70 2 in agreement with the bacterial deposition assay the biocidal silver coated spacers resulted in the lowest permeate flux decline of all conditions with a 28 2 decline after 24 h the sio2 spacer also had a statistically significant lower permeate flux decline 62 2 than the control in comparison all other functionalized samples resulted in similar or higher flux declines than the control spacer fig 4 therefore the reduced deposition and viability observed by epifluorescence microscopy for the tmpsi tio2 sample did not necessarily translate to better biofouling resistance in the membrane system discrepancy between short term bacterial deposition assays and dynamic biofouling experiments have been noted in the past araujo et al 2012 highlighting the importance of longer duration experiments when evaluation the biofouling resistance of a material 3 5 mechanisms and implications previous research on anti adhesive membranes correlated hydrophilicity with low bacteria or protein adhesion mansouri et al 2010 typically the adhesion of foulants to a material surface occurs in the stagnant layer of water resting between the material surface and the bulk fluid hydrogen bonding between hydrophilic materials and water can lead to a smaller stagnant layer as well as higher shear forces making it more difficult for foulants to adsorb on the surface kochkodan and hilal 2015 moreover given that most organic molecules are hydrophobic many foulants can be driven away from hydrophilic surfaces due unfavorable hydrophilic hydrophobic interactions rana and matsuura 2010 therefore based on these observations we hypothesized that hydrophilic spacers would experience less fouling than the hydrophobic control however aside from the modest outperformance of the sio2 modified spacers during the ro trials the pristine control surface which is relatively hydrophobic performed in line with or outperformed the hydrophilic surface functionalizations none of the anti adhesive modifications tested appeared to confer any advantages over the pristine control when biofouling is considered rendering the surface superhydrophobic the opposite end of the spectrum did not contribute to biofouling reduction either the only surface functionalization that minimized biofouling of the spacers was the biocidal coating based on the silver functionalization these results differ from previous research on membrane surfaces where go or superhydrophilic sio2 coatings demonstrated good resistance to biofouling this discrepancy highlights that a material s anti adhesive properties are relative and depend on the surface properties of the control in the present study the control material polypropylene was relatively anti adhesive so the modifications that had worked on membranes did not show the same effect on spacers when correlating surface properties with biofouling for the various surfaces investigated in this work sfe was found to be a key determinant of the fouling propensity this relationship between sfe and fouling was previously identified for different types of materials and conditions baier 1980 absolom et al 1983 zhao et al 2004 2005 the relationship between sfe and adhesion is related to the dlvo theory which describes the interaction of particles in water through van der waals forces and electrostatic forces zhao et al derived a formula from the dlvo theory describing the sfe at which fouling will be a minimum zhao et al 2004 4 γ s u r f a c e l w 1 2 γ b a c t e r i a l w γ f l u i d l w where γ s u r f a c e l w γ b a c t e r i a l w and γ f l u i d l w correspond to the lifshitz van der waals surface free energies of the surface bacteria and fluid respectively adhesion is less likely when the surface free energies of the surface and of the foulant are similar and are more likely to occur when the average of γ b a c t e r i a l w and γ f l u i d l w is larger than that of γ s u r f a c e l w previous research has calculated the lifshitz van der waals sfe of stationary phase of p aeruginosa γ b a c t e r i a l w to be 30 7 mn m grasso et al 1996 in addition van oss et al determined the γ w a t e r l w to be 21 8 mn m van oss and giese 1995 inputting these values into equation 4 yields γ s u r f a c e l w 26 1 m n m indicating materials with an sfe of approximately 26 mn m will have maximum resistance to adhesion of p aeruginosa in terms of sfe using contact angle measurements the sfe of the control was found to be 30 0 mn m 2 8 which is closer to the theoretical ideal sfe than any of the functionalized surfaces this near ideal sfe of the control is hypothesized to be the driving factor behind its ability to resist fouling previous research has also shown sfes between 10 and 24 mn m to be the most resistant to biofouling in marine environments lindner 1992 chambers et al 2006 however marine fouling includes fouling by algae barnacles and mussels in addition to bacteria therefore the model derived by zhao et al 2004 which describes the relationship between bacterial fouling and sfe is more representative of biofouling in ro changes in sfe also explain the performance of most of the functionalized surfaces fig 5 modification of the control surface with sio2 57 6 mn m 2 4 and go 39 2 mn m 1 0 changed the sfe of the spacers away from the theoretical optimal value and as a result the fouling propensity of the surface increased for go coated surfaces previous work highlighted the role of the material s hydrophilicity and antimicrobial properties in its ability to limit fouling on different types of surfaces soroush et al 2016b however for the control the go coating increased the sfe of the spacer and rendered the surface in respect to sfe more prone to fouling moreover the addition of go sheets on the surface will increase the abundance of carboxylic acid functional groups compared to the control these carboxylic acid functional groups can bind to organic foulants and bacteria in the presence of calcium and in the calcium rich synthetic secondary wastewater medium used in our experiments may have contributed to the increase in bacterial deposition therefore despite the promising findings found for go on other types of materials go coated spacers underperformed compared to the control on the other hand the sfe value of the hydrophobic tmpsi tio2 spacers 31 3 3 8 mn m is not significantly different from the sfe of polypropylene explaining why tmpsi tio2 s anti biofouling performance did not vary significantly from the control the biocidal spacers coated with silver nps had a similar sfe 30 7 mn m 0 4 to the control as well but these spacers also had lower bacterial abundance than all other samples silver is a strong biocidal agent thought to act through a variety of mechanisms including disruption of cell membranes and destruction or inactivation of organelles and dna fabrega et al 2009 prabhu and poulose 2012 biocidal coatings based on silver have been shown to impart biofouling control on spacers membranes and a variety of others surfaces therefore the good performance of silver coated spacers should be expected the reduced bacterial deposition and increased fouling resistance from the biocidal spacers may be the result of bacterial inactivation by the surface which inhibits cell division or due to surface avoidance in response to silver stress mitzel et al 2017 under dynamic ro biofouling conditions this biocidal surface was the only modified surface that showed resistance to biofilm formation these results highlight the critical role of antimicrobial properties as well as an optimized sfe for improved biofouling control on spacers 3 6 engineering applications feed spacers play an integral role in ro spiral wound modules as they provide a channel for water to flow through and reduce the impact of concentration polarization however their propensity to foul can have a significant increase on the pressure drop in the feed channel and by accumulating biofilms on their surface can encourage the deposition of bacteria on membranes flemming 1997 vrouwenvelder et al 2009 radu et al 2014 the findings of our research suggest that the polypropylene spacers used in commercial ro modules possess good anti adhesive properties largely due to their sfe these results support the use of sfe models rather than the commonly used surface hydrophilicity parameters as a starting point when designing antifouling spacer materials owens and wendt 1969 baier 1980 zhao et al 2004 however to specifically target biofouling control providing anti adhesive functions is not sufficient and biocidal properties are needed for polypropylene surfaces this study employed a synthetic secondary wastewater in which p aeruginosa was the only bacteria present in practice other bacteria organic molecules and inorganic compounds will be in feed water so it is important to consider how other constituents might interact with the spacers using zhao et al s adhesion model and sfe literature values of several other common foulants it is possible to predict which compounds may be prone to foul the spacers the sfes of escherichia coli e coli bacteria alginate polysaccharide and bovine serum albumin bsa protein are 32 mn m 1 2 20 7 mn m and 30 8 mn m respectively lee and ruckenstein 1988 harkes et al 1993 caykara et al 2005 inputting these values into zhao et al s model generates theoretical antifouling material sfes of 27 7 mn m 0 5 21 3 mn m and 26 1 mn m respectively which are similar to the values obtained for p aeruginosa this suggests that the relative fouling resistance of polypropylene spacers can be expected to hold true in real world applications however biofouling is more complex than only deposition of foulants and to efficiently mitigate biofilm formation inactivation of deposited microorganisms is critical the results of this work demonstrate that biocidal spacers are the optimal way to improve the biofouling resistance of polypropylene spacers future work on the development of biofouling resistant spacers should consider different biocidal coatings and longer duration studies with complex natural waters in order to identify the optimal surface coatings and validate their long term performance in real systems the role of the water composition should also be investigated to validate the use of biocidal coatings for biofouling control in seawater desalination settings where higher ionic strength and chloride concentration may alter the performance of the biocidal compound used for antimicrobial properties 4 conclusion this study describes the fouling behavior of control spacers with different anti adhesive and antimicrobial surface chemistries our results demonstrate that sfe is a dominant factor in determining a material s biofouling propensity and that the control due to its near ideal surface free energy possesses good intrinsic anti adhesive properties in addition the strong performance of the biocidal silver coated spacer shows that to make spacers more biofilm resistant modified spacers should have good antimicrobial properties spacers development should therefore focus on increasing the antimicrobial performance of biocidal functionalizations rather than developing anti adhesive coatings to achieve higher biofouling resistance in membrane modules acknowledgments this work was supported by the nsf nanosystems engineering research center for nanotechnology enabled

19331,this work proposes a technology for phosphonate removal from wastewater using magnetically separable microparticles modified with a tailored znfezr oxyhydroxide adsorbent material which proved to be highly efficient reaching a maximum loading of 20 mg nitrilotrimethylphosphonic acid p g 215 μmol ntmp g at room temperature ph 6 and 30 min contact time the adsorption process at ph 7 was fast following the pseudo second order kinetics model furthermore ntmp adsorption onto znfezr oxyhydroxide proved to be endothermic at ph phpzc 7 point of zero charge of the material a drop in adsorption efficiency was observed for phosphate and for five different investigated phosphonates adsorption of ntmp could not be detected at ph 8 however the presence of more than 0 5 mm caii improved significantly the adsorption efficiency successful reusability of the engineered particles was demonstrated throughout 30 loading cycles by changing the operational conditions dose ph to optimize the performance at optimal conditions complete phosphonate removal was observed even after 30 cycles of particles reuse in a synthetic ntmp solution and dtpmp rich membrane concentrate in each cycle phosphorus was desorbed and concentrated in a 2 m naoh industrial phosphonate containing wastewaters rich in calcium e g membrane concentrates proved to be especially suitable for treatment with the particles graphical abstract image 1 keywords eutrophication industrial wastewater treatment magnetic microparticles ntmp phosphonates reversible sorption 1 introduction phosphonates are complexing agents used in many different industrial sectors like the paper and textile industries as bleach stabilizers hardness stabilizers in cooling plants antiscalants in membrane plants or households and cleaning agents quantitatively relevant are the phosphonates pbtc hedp ntmp edtmp and dtpmp fig 1 their global consumption in 2012 of 94 000 t a epa 2013 differs remarkably from the 56 000 t a consumption in 1998 davenport et al 2000 cited by nowack 2003 the significant consumption increase raises concern about their impact on the environment especially when discharging untreated industrial wastewater into receiving waters it is assumed that despite of their relatively good elimination of 80 95 in wastewater treatment plants wwtps nowack 1998 and with a 49 000 t a consumption in europe epa 2013 still 9000 18 600 t a are discharged into nature mainly through insufficiently treated industrial wastewater and 7300 8700 t a through the discharge of sewage sludge rott et al 2018b very little is known about the presence of phosphonates in the environment but due to their photolytic and catalytic degradation to bioavailable phosphate the risk of eutrophication in water bodies cannot be excluded rott et al 2018b studnik et al 2015 furthermore high concentrations of phosphonates in wwtp influents may lead to an increased dosage of precipitant due to complex formation horstmann and grohmann 1984 or interfere with the wwtp operation wenger oehn et al 2005 the removal of phosphonates especially from industrial wastewater or municipal wwtps before discharge into natural waters is therefore highly desirable various physicochemical treatment processes have been investigated for this purpose in particular processes using metal salts achieve good removal of phosphonates however techniques like uv feii treatment lesueur et al 2005 rott et al 2017a photo fenton process rott et al 2017a or precipitation flocculation treatment klinger et al 1998 rott et al 2017b have the disadvantage of accumulating significant amount of iron hydroxide sludge which has to be treated and disposed at great expense in the precipitation flocculation process the fact that phosphonates are strong complexing agents also results in higher dosing concentrations of metal salts a better alternative is to remove phosphonates from wastewater using selective adsorbent materials based on metal hydr oxides nowack and stone 1999a and zenobi et al 2005 demonstrated the strong adsorption affinity of phosphonates onto goethite α feooh and boehmite γ alooh boels et al 2012 and chen et al 2017 researched ntmp sorption on granular ferric hydroxide however most studies on adsorptive removal of phosphonates lack validation of any long term adsorbent reusability furthermore usually only one phosphonate is investigated although various phosphonates with different properties are used in industry this study proposes an innovative composite material consisting of magnetic microparticles coated with a tailored adsorbent with high uptake capacity and selectivity for phosphorus which could be successfully regenerated and reused over numerous loading cycles and separated magnetically from wastewater thus outlining its application simplicity long term reusability and cost saving potential drenkova tuhtan et al 2013 2016 2017a 2017b mandel et al 2013 schneider et al 2017 the engineered composite microsorbents 5 25 μm consist of superparamagnetic nanosized fe3o4 particles embedded in a diamagnetic sio2 matrix magnetic carriers coated with a custom znfezr oxyhydroxide based adsorbent the magnetic properties of the composite particles are shown in section 1s in the supplementary material the pure adsorbent material has a surface area of 115 m2 g and the composite particles 75 m2 g which provides sufficiently high contact area for maximized adsorption efficiency the particles are freely suspended and homogeneously mixed in wastewater preventing fouling and clogging typically encountered in filters and fixed bed reactors and are separated from the liquid phase through simple magnetic harvesting via separators equipped with permanent magnets this obviates the need to invest in any sedimentation or filtration units and there is no sludge production requiring additional treatment and disposal the option for subsequent phosphorus recovery as a solid fertilizer product makes the technology an attractive superior alternative to conventional treatment techniques however so far the magnetic particles were tested predominantly for ortho phosphate elimination from wastewater and partially for removing the non reactive dissolved and particulate phosphorus the sum of p species defined as the difference between total p and ortho po4 p from municipal wastewater effluent drenkova tuhtan et al 2017b this work examines further the broad applicability of the promising microsorbents and their potential to remove also phosphonates from wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental concept for the determination of adsorption kinetics experiment 1 and the influence of temperature on adsorption experiment 2 synthetic solutions were used with 1 mg l ntmp p 3 2 mg l and 10 8 μmol l ntmp as representative phosphonate in pure water ntmp has 3 phosphonate groups which is between pbtc with 1 phosphonate group and dtpmp with 5 phosphonate groups furthermore ntmp with molecular weight of 299 05 g mol is between the molecular weight of the smallest phosphonate hedp 206 03 g mol and the largest dtpmp 573 20 g mol for all phosphonates fig 1 and phosphate the influence of ph on adsorption was determined at a fixed particle concentration experiment 3 investigations showed that the presence of caii can increase strongly the removal of phosphonates nowack and stone 1999b membrane concentrates usually containing phosphonates may have very high caii concentrations thus an experiment was performed to examine the influence of caii on the adsorption of ntmp and dtpmp experiment 4 moreover the particles reusability was tested through numerous adsorption desorption cycles in synthetic ntmp solution experiment 5 and dtpmp containing membrane concentrate experiment 6 2 2 synthesis of znfezr adsorbent magnetic particles the synthesis of fe3o4 sio2 magnetic carrier particles is based on a published procedure mandel et al 2013 and the precipitation route for znfezr hydroxide adsorbent was described in earlier publications drenkova tuhtan et al 2016 schneider et al 2017 deposition of the znfezr adsorbent on the magnetic particles was performed via co precipitation to form composite particles described by drenkova tuhtan et al 2017a the fraction of the znfezr adsorbent was approximately 20 wt of the whole composite particle the particles were stored as a thick black suspension with approx 40 g l dry matter in the following the term adsorbent always refers to the znfezr oxyhydroxide component of the composite particles 2 3 analytical methods dissolved ortho phosphate concentrations of all samples were determined spectrophotometrically after membrane filtration 0 45 μm with the ammonium molybdate method according to iso 6878 and are typically presented as elemental po4 p the total p determination was performed following iso 6878 after one hour acidic peroxodisulfate digestion and subsequent formation of molybdenum blue complex rott et al 2018a spectrophotometers shimadzu uv 1800 and jasco v 550 in absorbance mode 880 nm were used to record uv vis extinction spectra and correlate them with the corresponding phosphorus concentrations in the membrane concentrate the dtpmp p concentration was determined indirectly as the difference between total p and o po4 p the ph was measured using three identical greisinger 3551 ph temperature meters and three identical greisinger ge 117 ph electrodes electrical conductivity was determined with wtw tetracon 925 probe and wtw multi 3430 device turbidity was measured with a wtw turb 430 ir device acid neutralizing capacity anc4 3 in mmol l h was determined according to the german standard din 38409 h7 2 titration of 100 ml sample with hcl to ph 4 3 the anc can be approximately converted into carbonate hardness hco3 anc4 3 calcium magnesium water hardness hach lck 327 chemical oxygen demand hach lck 1414 chloride hach lck 311 and sulfate hach lck 153 were analyzed using hach cuvette rapid tests thermostat hach lange ht200s photometer hach lange dr2800 2 4 synthetic solution and wastewater sample for the preparation of synthetic solutions with phosphate or phosphonates pbtc hedp ntmp edtmp dtpmp 1 g l phosphate p or phosphonate p stock solutions were used these were diluted with deionized water to 1 mg l p solutions e g 1 ml in 1 l for experiment 4 cacl2 2h2o containing stock solution was added to the phosphorus solutions the membrane concentrate was obtained from a waterworks nanofiltration plant it was a clear colorless liquid with low organic load table 1 characteristic are the high concentrations of alkaline earth ions and the associated extraordinary high water hardness combined with a very high ph buffer capacity the total p of the sample was 1 39 mg l the dissolved p portion total p of the membrane filtered sample was 1 38 mg l thus the particulate p fraction is negligible and the po4 p was 0 56 mg l this resulted in 0 83 mg l p for the organic p fraction the antiscalant dtpmp is added to the plant inflow at about 0 6 mg l with an 80 average yield of the membrane plant a fivefold concentration of the added antiscalant occurs thus the membrane concentrate contains approx 3 mg l dtpmp corresponding to 0 81 mg l dtpmp p it is therefore assumed that the organic p fraction composes almost entirely of dtpmp after sampling the sample was adjusted to ph 7 and kept at room temperature to prevent precipitation of caco3 2 5 chemicals and reagents the synthetic solutions were prepared with deionized water produced on site with an ion exchange resin seradest sd 2000 and a downstream filter unit seralpur pro 90 cn purifying reverse osmosis treated tap water hcl 32 analar normapur was obtained from

as solids from sigma aldrich st louis missouri u s a 2 6 experimental procedure 2 6 1 general procedure experiments 1 4 synthetic solution in 500 ml bottles 250 ml of 1 mg l phosphonate p or phosphate p and optionally cacl2 2h2o to investigate the caii influence on the adsorption containing solution was mixed with the adsorbent stock suspension using micropipette under magnetic stirring 1000 rpm immediately after adding the adsorbent the desired ph 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 or 12 was adjusted within one minute using hcl or naoh and kept constant manually from then on for investigating the adsorption kinetics 10 ml samples were taken homogeneously at intervals of 1 4 7 15 30 60 120 240 and 480 min these samples were immediately membrane filtered with syringe filters 0 45 μm pore size nylon and subsequently the total p concentration of the filtrate was determined for investigating the influence of temperature or caii on the adsorption after 30 min contact time the reactor was placed on a cuboid magnet 40 20 20 mm neodymium iron boron ndfeb n42 nickel plated webcraft supermagnete after 30 min magnetic separation the supernatant was membrane filtered and the total p concentration of the filtrate was determined in general all tests were performed at room temperature 22 c for studying the temperature influence the entire procedure 30 min contact and 30 min magnetic separation was carried out in a temperature controlled room at 6 c and at 35 c constant temperature 2 6 2 adsorption desorption cycles with ntmp solution experiment 5 and dtpmp rich membrane concentrate experiment 6 reusability of the particles in a synthetic ntmp solution and in a real industrial wastewater matrix dtpmp rich membrane concentrate was demonstrated at 1 l lab scale over 30 adsorption desorption cycles in each case the adsorbent respectively particle concentration and ph were varied in different phases throughout the experiments to optimize the performance the exact parameter variations are indicated directly in fig 5 and fig 6 below the diagrams where vertical dashed lines represent the different phases corresponding to a change in parameters generally adsorbent concentration was varied between 0 05 g l and 0 3 g l znfezr and the ph value was maintained either at ph 6 or ph 7 by adding hcl at room temperature to find the most optimal reaction conditions contact time was fixed at 20 min for both adsorption and desorption reactions and the reactor content was well mixed via magnetic stirring after 20 min the reactor was positioned on top of a bench scale magnet 40 20 20 mm ndfeb n42 for 30 min to perform the solid liquid separation the magnetic particles were attracted to the magnet and collected at the bottom of the reactor while the clear supernatant was pumped out and membrane filtered 0 45 μm prior to analysis subsequently total phosphorus and ortho phosphate were measured in each sample see section 2 3 the ntmp p respectively dtpmp p fractions were calculated indirectly as the difference between total p and po4 p in case of the ntmp synthetic solution however the measured po4 p was practically zero i e with a high level of approximation total p was assumed equal to ntmp p adsorption efficiency e ads in was calculated with the equation 1 e a d s c 0 c t c 0 100 where c 0 and c t are respectively the initial p concentration and the p concentration at time t in the solution in mg l based on earlier research findings drenkova tuhtan et al 2016 2017a phosphorus desorption and simultaneous regeneration of the znfezr adsorbent was performed in a 2 m naoh solution ph 14 repetitive reuse of the desorption solution throughout all 30 adsorption desorption cycles could guarantee its enrichment with phosphorus by a factor of approximately 12 experiment 5 and 15 experiment 6 compared to the initial p concentration in the synthetic solution or the wastewater the declining electrical conductivity of the naoh solution was a good indicator for its exhausting regeneration capacity desorption efficiency e des in was calculated as the ratio of the desorbed to the previously adsorbed phosphorus 2 e d e s q d q a 100 where q d is the desorbed and q a is the initially adsorbed phosphorus in mg g 2 7 model equations adsorption kinetics i e loading q over time t were modelled with either the pseudo first order eq 3 or the pseudo second order eq 4 model the constants q e k 1 and k 2 were determined after linearization of the equations as described by ho 2004 2006 depending on the linear form the kinetics of pseudo second order can be classified into four different types ho 2006 3 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 4 q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 q e k 2 t curves depicting the adsorption capacity as a function of ph were represented either by the logistic function model lfm eq 5 or by the density function model dfm eq 6 the parameters a b d α μ and σ were determined using the least squares method 5 q p h d 1 a e b p h 6 q p h e α p h μ σ 2 σ 2 π the coefficient of

q m q i 2 2 8 acid dissociation constants for phosphoric and some phosphonic acids critical evaluations of stability constants are available in literature goldberg et al 2002 popov et al 2001 the constants are usually presented with ionic strength which required correction of the data for the species in this work to an ionic strength of 0 m using the davies equation table 2 these constants facilitated calculating the shares of the individual phosphonate species of the sum adsorption curves modelled by lfm 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of time and temperature on adsorption of ntmp experiments 1 and 2 synthetic solution in the case of 0 1 g l adsorbent a clear difference in the adsorption rate between ph 6 and 7 could be observed fig 2a at ph 6 almost complete adsorption of ntmp was achieved quickly whereas at ph 7 adsorption equilibrium could not be reached even after 8 h increased adsorbent dosage of 0 4 g l led to a fast and almost complete adsorption at both ph values both kinetics at ph 6 were most accurately modelled with the pseudo second order type 3 psot3 the course at ph 7 and 0 4 g l with psot4 and at ph 7 and 0 1 g l using the pseudo first order kinetics see table 1s for the latter sample the coefficients of determination of all psos were low ranging between 0 45 and 0 83 similarities predominantly with the pseudo second order model indicate chemisorption yang et al 2014 the rapid adsorption at ph 6 and 0 4 g l adsorbent implies a very low activation barrier which increases considerably with an increasing ph value the difference between the adsorption process at ph 6 and 7 at 0 1 g l adsorbent is obvious the point of zero charge of the material phpzc is approximately at ph 7 see section 2s in the supplementary data which means that at ph 7 there were far fewer protonated oh groups on the adsorbent surface than at ph 6 suggesting that weaker electrostatic interactions at ph 7 resulted in slower adsorption however the weaker interaction at ph 7 could be compensated with considerably higher dosing concentration of 0 4 g l as the higher adsorbent dose provided more protonated oh groups for adsorption fig 2b shows the influence of temperature on ntmp adsorption at ph 6 all curves were determined at 30 min contact time although an equilibrium state was not necessarily reached after 30 min according to fig 2a nevertheless 30 min reaction time is more relevant for technical applications than the exact isotherm progression over several hours which is not applicable in practice moreover isotherms at equilibrium conditions with this material have already been defined for the adsorption of phosphate drenkova tuhtan et al 2017a which makes the evaluation of the ntmp adsorption behavior comparable with these data fig 2b shows the increase in loading with increasing temperature for example at ph 6 and 30 min contact time almost complete elimination of 1 mg l ntmp p was achieved at 35 c with about 60 mg l adsorbent whereas at room temperature about 100 mg l were required this indicates that the adsorption of phosphonates on znfezr oxyhydroxides might be endothermic this implies that the adsorption process can be significantly improved in practice e g by using waste heat from production processes the adsorption of ntmp on ferric hydroxide surfaces i e surfaces with oh groups which may be protonated or deprotonated occurs both physically and chemically by exchanging oh groups with ligands or through covalent binding of metallic cations by ligands innerspherical complexation chen et al 2017 martínez and farrell 2017 ntmp binds mainly via bidentate complexes to hydroxide surfaces which are energetically preferred to monodentate complexes martínez and farrell 2017 the znfezr oxyhydroxide also has surface oh groups leading to the assumption that the adsorption of ntmp occurs similarly znfezr oxyhydroxide contains metals with different oxidation numbers znii feiii zriv which have a significant influence on electrostatic interactions between the adsorptive and surface charges however whether the observations regarding ntmp adsorption on ferric hydroxide surfaces can be transferred directly to znfezr oxyhydroxide structures has to be investigated further the maximum loading found in this study at room temperature ph 6 and 30 min contact time of 20 mg ntmp p g 215 μmol ntmp g is significantly lower than the loading of 70 mg phosphate p g 2260 μmol phosphate g on the same material at ph 7 and longer contact time drenkova tuhtan et al 2017a due to the different ph and contact times both results can only be compared to a limited extent however there is an apparent tendency for preferable adsorption of the smaller phosphate molecule which is in accordance with the pattern found by nowack and stone 2006 at a higher initial concentration of 9 3 mg l ntmp p compared to this study a similar loading of approximately 230 μmol ntmp g on ferric hydroxide granulate was achieved at 9 24 h contact time and ph 7 85 without caii boels et al 2012 however this result was reached after very long contact times in the kinetics experiments of the same study at 30 min contact time as in this study a significantly lower loading occurred the maximum loading of ntmp on ferric hydroxide granules by chen et al 2017 was about 100 μmol ntmp g ph 8 3 24 h c0 9 mg l ntmp p another study of ntmp adsorption on slurry goethite nowack and stone 1999a reached a loading of 30 μmol ntmp g ph 7 2 2 h c0 1 0 2 5 mg l ntmp p boels et al 2010 also investigated the adsorption of ntmp onto iron oxide coated waste filtration sand at ph 7 5 days contact time and initial ntmp p concentrations of 1 6 93 2 mg l the maximum loading was 45 μmol ntmp g thus all studies of ntmp adsorption on iron hydr oxides showed significantly lower loadings compared to the adsorbent material discussed here exceptionally only in the case of simultaneous precipitation of feiii in the presence of 3 mg l ntmp 0 93 mg l ntmp p at ph 7 0 7 5 and 15 min contact time a maximum loading of 410 μmol g feooh was achieved rott et al 2017b which was considerably higher than in this study this may be attributed to the fact that freshly precipitated iron hydroxide flocks are very fine and have a higher specific surface than the znfezr particles 3 2 effect of ph on adsorption of phosphate pbtc hedp ntmp edtmp and dtpmp with fixed particle concentration experiment 3 synthetic solution the influence of ph on the znfezr adsorbent loading was obvious for phosphate as well as for all investigated phosphonates fig 3 with an increase in ph not only the charge on the adsorbent surface shifts in the negative direction but also the species of the compounds are increasingly negatively charged so that electrostatic repulsion starts dominating the dosing concentration of 0 03 g l adsorbent was chosen purposefully low so that in none of the cases 100 adsorption was present at ph 6 and 7 in order to compare the degree of adsorption of the different compounds at the same initial 1 mg l p concentration the order of adsorption affinity at ph 6 was hedp p po4 p edtmp p dtpmp p ntmp p pbtc p thus the phosphorus in hedp and ortho phosphate was more preferably adsorbed compared to the aminophosphonates and pbtc p showed the least adsorption efficiency of all compounds obviously due to its comparatively small p content of 11 5 per molecule compared to the polyphosphonates 27 31 rott et al 2017b po4 and pbtc with only one phosphonate group in the molecule had the same initial concentration of 32 3 μm to compare directly their degree of adsorption in relation to the compound itself and not only the phosphorus content at ph 6 the following loadings occurred 830 μmol po4 g vs 450 μmol pbtc g at ph 7 they were 480 μmol po4 g vs 300 μmol pbtc g the molar mass of pbtc 270 g mol is considerably larger than that of po4 95 g mol which favors significantly the adsorption of po4 furthermore the adsorption curve for pbtc is also illustrated in fig 3 using the density function model dfm σ 2 39 10 2 g mg μ 4 859 α 7 45 10 5 g2 mg2 r2 0 986 the dfm representation is more accurate compared to the logistic function model lfm which is validated by the r2 values summarized in table 2 s in the supplementary the assumption of a declining adsorption at ph values 5 as illustrated with the dfm makes more sense because the fully protonated species of pbtc is present in this ph range the best adsorbed phosphonate hedp had the least steep adsorption curve among all phosphonates over the ph spectrum in the studied ph range this molecule dissociates only into two differently charged species double and triple negative the aliphatic hydroxyl group in hedp would dissociate only after both phosphonate groups of the phosphonate are completely deprotonated i e above ph 13 popov et al 2001 therefore the aliphatic hydroxyl group may not play an important role in the coordination of the phosphonate for almost all compounds a considerable decline in adsorption was observed between ph 6 and 8 the phpzc of the material is approximately 7 see fig 2s in supplementary at neutral ph the aminophosphonates with their similar structure have species with different charge numbers i e ntmp 3 phosphonate groups 1 amino group 3 4 edtmp 4 phosphonate groups 2 amino groups 4 5 dtpmp 5 phosphonate groups 3 amino groups 5 6 it is thus easy to conclude that the phpzc of the adsorbent and not the number of dissociated phosphonate species to be adsorbed is the decisive factor for adsorption to occur or not i e whether a negative surface charge would cause an immediate repulsion of the target molecule 3 3 effect of caii on adsorption of ntmp and dtpmp experiment 4 synthetic solution the influence of the caii concentration was studied along with the ph value in a series of experiments with synthetic solutions containing either 1 mg l ntmp p or 1 mg l dtpmp p see fig 4 the test was carried out with both ntmp considered highly representative for most phosphonates and dtpmp contained in the membrane concentrate used in this work the concentration of caii in the membrane concentrate was 15 mm which defined the highest caii concentration in the tested synthetic solution similar behavior was observed for both phosphonates namely increasing caii concentration contributed to an increase in the adsorption efficiency already between ph 5 and 7 e g ntmp p adsorbed from 0 1 mg l without caii to 0 5 mg l with 15 mm caii above ph 8 i e in the range where no considerable adsorption of phosphonates could be observed without caii the presence of caii particularly at 0 5 mm caii improved significantly the adsorption for example at 0 5 15 mm caii concentrations the logistic function could no longer be used for modelling the values and at ph 12 even almost complete adsorption occurred the adsorbent znfezr oxyhydroxide did not appear to have a layered double hydroxide ldh structure drenkova tuhtan et al 2016 and the influence of caii on this material has not been investigated so far on the other hand there are a few known studies concerning the influence of caii on the adsorption of phosphates on ldh structures zhou et al 2011 compared the adsorption of tripolyphosphate tpp onto mg2fe cl ldh and ca2fe cl ldh the latter material achieved better phosphate removal which was attributed to the release of caii from the ldh structure forming insoluble precipitates with tpp xu et al 2010 made similar conclusions attributing the removal of ortho phosphate by ca based ldh to the formation of ca phosphate precipitates and not to adsorption the composite adsorbent material used in this work was stable and did not disintegrate in the range ph 5 12 drenkova tuhtan et al 2017a therefore it cannot be assumed that phosphonate elimination is caused by formation of insoluble zn fe or zr complexes with phosphonates due to the relatively high solubility product of ca oh 2 ksp 5 5 10 6 it is not expected that ca oh 2 will precipitate even at ph 12 and serve as adsorbent furthermore at the tested concentrations phosphonates are known to form mainly water soluble complexes with caii thus it cannot be assumed that the improved elimination is due to formation of insoluble chelate complex precipitates nevertheless analyses of the ca concentration in the membrane filtrate after adsorption showed that there was a decrease of 5 20 in the ca concentration at ph 11 12 not shown in the figure the adsorbent had a negative net charge above phpzc 7 this could have led to increased adsorption of positively charged ca2 ions which might have caused the shift of surface charge in the positive direction phosphonates which would have been repelled from the surface above the phpzc without caii were thus able to adsorb as ligand like or metal ion like ternary complexes through caii adsorption martínez and farrell 2017 the fact that the caii influence was negligible at ph 7 8 where the phpzc is located strengthens this hypothesis because in the neutral ph range the surface charge was close to zero which did not allow significant caii adsorption ternary tridentate surface complexation supposedly occurs for all phosphonates which explains the lack of significant difference between the adsorption behavior of ntmp and dtpmp furthermore the ca facilitated adsorption could also be attributed to the parallel precipitation of small amounts of caco3 onto which phosphonates can adsorb rott et al 2017b the formation of caco3 might happen by reaction of dosed ca2 with co3 2 entrapped in the form of co2 from the ambient atmosphere e g during sample mixing co2 h2co3 is transformed to co3 2 at ph 8 3 4 adsorption desorption cycles with ntmp solution experiment 5 synthetic solution and dtpmp rich industrial wastewater experiment 6 membrane concentrate the main goal in the following two experiments was to optimize the adsorption performance by varying the operational conditions dose ph and to demonstrate the successful regeneration and reusability of the magnetic microsorbents over numerous loading cycles which is often times a challenge for non commercial adsorbent materials the results in fig 5 summarize the particle performance throughout 30 cycles in a synthetic ntmp solution and fig 6 in a dtpmp rich membrane concentrate the removal efficiency of ntmp p at adsorbent concentration 0 1 g l and ph 7 was insufficient and fluctuated around 50 fig 5b cycles 1 8 which is somewhat higher but still in accordance with the results from the kinetics experiment in fig 2a doubling the adsorbent concentration to 0 2 g l improved the efficiency but removal was still incomplete cycles 9 10 and even 0 3 g l resulted in 90 ntmp p adsorption at ph 7 cycle 11 in the next phase cycles 12 15 the ph was reduced to 6 to increase the positive surface charge of the adsorbent and improve the electrostatic attraction with the negatively charged ntmp species which immediately led to complete adsorption of the 1 mg l ntmp p with 0 3 g l but also with 0 1 g l adsorbent cycles 16 20 further attempt to decrease the adsorbent dose by half 0 05 g l dropped the efficiency down to 71 85 cycles 21 25 then the system was restored again by adjusting the adsorbent concentration back to 0 1 g l and keeping ph 6 cycles 26 30 under these conditions adsorption was complete and the measured ntmp p concentrations in the treated effluent were below the limit of detection fig 5a thus the adsorbent loading in this last phase was 10 mg ntmp p g which complies with the adsorption behavior at 22 c presented earlier in fig 2b the high desorption efficiency of the ntmp species and simultaneous adsorbent regeneration performed in 2 m naoh is summarized in fig 5b grey bars the strong ph shift from neutral during adsorption to highly alkaline ph 14 during desorption caused on one hand the electrostatic repulsion of ntmp species from the deprotonated and highly negatively charged adsorbent surface on the other hand ion exchange reaction might have also contributed to the desorption of the p species the gradual increase of phosphorus in the constantly reused naoh solution is shown in fig 5c the fact that the ntmp p could be consistently transferred from the synthetic solution 1 mg l ntmp p into the naoh solution via reversible sorption and gradually concentrated to 12 mg ntmp p after 30 cycles confirms that phosphonate adsorption took place through surface complexation and not through precipitation nowack and stone 1999a similarly the dtpmp rich membrane concentrate 0 81 mg l dtpmp p and 0 56 mg l po4 p was treated first with 0 1 g l adsorbent at ph 6 reaching 87 97 po4 p removal and 92 dtpmp p removal fig 6b cycles 1 10 increasing ph to 7 reduced the adsorption efficiency by 20 cycles 11 16 as logically expected and even doubling the adsorbent dose 0 2 g l could not remove completely dtpmp p cycles 17 25 only in the last cycles 26 30 effluent concentrations lod limits of detection 0 015 mg l total p and 0 005 mg l po4 p could be achieved with 0 2 g l adsorbent at ph 6 corresponding to 99 removal desorption efficiency was consistently high fig 6b grey bars even sometimes exceeding 100 most likely due to later desorption of earlier adsorbed phosphorus throughout the cycles or additional contribution from other organic p fractions likewise phosphorus was gradually concentrated in the naoh solution up to 20 mg total p after 30 cycles fig 6c in both matrices the significant adsorption drop at ph 7 versus ph 6 complies with the data presented in fig 3 indicating sharp decline of the fitting curve with increasing ph comparing the particle performance in both matrices under the same conditions e g at 0 1 g l adsorbent and ph 7 it can be concluded that dtpmp p adsorbed better with 80 efficiency fig 6b cycles 11 16 than ntmp p whose removal fluctuated around 50 fig 5b cycles 1 8 these results are also in accordance with the data presented in fig 3 showing higher adsorption capacity at ph 7 for dtpmp p than for ntmp p another explanation for the better dtpmp p sorption affinity is the presence of calcium ions in the membrane concentrate which facilitated the adsorption process as discussed in section 3 3 the experiment in fig 4 demonstrated almost complete adsorption of dtpmp p at ph 12 in a synthetic solution doped with 15 mm caii same concentration as in the membrane concentrate counterintuitively the current experiment 6 shows that at ph 14 2 m naoh instead of expected adsorption desorption of dtpmp p occurs however it needs to be considered that on one hand the naoh used as p desorption medium is free of calcium on the other hand even if some of the calcium was transferred from the wastewater into the naoh solution through the particles the ionic strength and oh gradient of the 2 m naoh is so high that the adsorption of calcium becomes irrelevant due to the dominant electrostatic repulsion and or ion exchange between the negatively charged p species and the dominating oh groups in the medium additionally the presence of calcium in the desorption solution would cause the precipitation of ca oh 2 or caco3 at ph 14 in fact some hardly detectable and very fine white flocks were visually observed on the desorption reactor surface implying that the presence of calcium in the naoh solution was extremely low and insignificant to interfere with the p desorption process 4 conclusions this work proposed a technology for

following the pseudo second order kinetics model furthermore ntmp adsorption onto znfezr oxyhydroxide proved to be endothermic at ph phpzc 7 point of zero charge of the material a drop in adsorption efficiency was observed for phosphate and for five different investigated phosphonates adsorption of ntmp could not be detected at ph 8 however the presence of more than 0 5 mm caii improved significantly the adsorption efficiency successful reusability of the engineered particles was demonstrated throughout 30 loading cycles by changing the operational conditions dose ph to optimize the performance at optimal conditions complete phosphonate removal was observed even after 30 cycles of particles reuse in a synthetic ntmp solution and dtpmp rich membrane concentrate in each cycle

particles graphical abstract image 1 keywords eutrophication industrial wastewater treatment magnetic microparticles ntmp phosphonates reversible sorption 1 introduction phosphonates are complexing agents used in many different industrial sectors like the paper and textile industries as bleach stabilizers hardness stabilizers in cooling plants antiscalants in membrane plants or households and cleaning agents quantitatively relevant are the phosphonates pbtc hedp ntmp edtmp and dtpmp fig 1 their global consumption in 2012 of 94 000 t a epa 2013 differs remarkably from the 56 000 t a consumption in 1998 davenport et al 2000 cited by nowack 2003 the significant consumption increase raises concern about their impact on the environment especially when discharging untreated industrial wastewater into receiving waters it is assumed that despite of their relatively good elimination of 80 95 in wastewater treatment plants wwtps nowack 1998 and with a 49 000 t a consumption in europe epa 2013 still 9000 18 600 t a are discharged into nature mainly through insufficiently treated industrial wastewater and 7300 8700 t a through the discharge of sewage sludge rott et al 2018b very little is known about the presence of phosphonates in the environment but due to their photolytic and catalytic degradation to bioavailable phosphate the risk of eutrophication in water bodies cannot be excluded rott et al 2018b studnik et al 2015 furthermore high concentrations of phosphonates in wwtp influents may lead to an increased dosage of precipitant due to complex formation horstmann and grohmann 1984 or interfere with the wwtp operation wenger oehn et al 2005 the removal of phosphonates especially from industrial wastewater or municipal wwtps before discharge into natural waters is therefore highly desirable various physicochemical treatment processes have been investigated for this purpose in particular processes using metal salts achieve good removal of phosphonates however techniques like uv feii treatment lesueur et al 2005 rott et al 2017a photo fenton process rott et al 2017a or precipitation flocculation treatment klinger et al 1998 rott et al 2017b have the disadvantage of accumulating significant amount of iron hydroxide sludge which has to be treated and disposed at great expense in the precipitation flocculation process the fact that phosphonates are strong complexing agents also results in higher dosing concentrations of metal salts a better alternative is to remove phosphonates from wastewater using selective adsorbent materials based on metal hydr oxides nowack and stone 1999a and zenobi et al 2005 demonstrated the strong adsorption affinity of phosphonates onto goethite α feooh and boehmite γ alooh boels et al 2012 and chen et al 2017 researched ntmp sorption on granular ferric hydroxide however most studies on adsorptive removal of phosphonates lack validation of any long term adsorbent reusability furthermore usually only one phosphonate is investigated although various phosphonates with different properties are used in industry this study proposes an innovative composite material consisting of magnetic microparticles coated with a tailored adsorbent with high uptake capacity and selectivity for phosphorus which could be successfully regenerated and reused over numerous loading cycles and separated magnetically from wastewater thus outlining its application simplicity long term reusability and cost saving potential drenkova tuhtan et al 2013 2016 2017a 2017b mandel et al 2013 schneider et al 2017 the engineered composite microsorbents 5 25 μm consist of superparamagnetic nanosized fe3o4 particles embedded in a diamagnetic sio2 matrix magnetic carriers coated with a custom znfezr oxyhydroxide based adsorbent the magnetic properties of the composite particles are shown in section 1s in the supplementary material the pure adsorbent material has a surface area of 115 m2 g and the composite particles 75 m2 g which provides sufficiently high contact area for maximized adsorption efficiency the particles are freely suspended and homogeneously mixed in wastewater preventing fouling and clogging typically encountered in filters and fixed bed reactors and are separated from the liquid phase through simple magnetic harvesting via separators equipped with permanent magnets this obviates the need to invest in any sedimentation or filtration units and there is no sludge production requiring additional treatment and disposal the option for subsequent phosphorus recovery as a solid fertilizer product makes the technology an attractive superior alternative to conventional treatment techniques however so far the magnetic particles were tested predominantly for ortho phosphate elimination from wastewater and partially for removing the non reactive dissolved and particulate phosphorus the sum of p species defined as the difference between total p and ortho po4 p from municipal wastewater effluent drenkova tuhtan et al 2017b this work examines further the broad applicability of the promising microsorbents and their potential to remove also phosphonates from wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental concept for the determination of adsorption kinetics experiment 1 and the influence of temperature on adsorption experiment 2 synthetic solutions were used with 1 mg l ntmp p 3 2 mg l and 10 8 μmol l ntmp as representative phosphonate in pure water ntmp has 3 phosphonate groups which is between pbtc with 1 phosphonate group and dtpmp with 5 phosphonate groups furthermore ntmp with molecular weight of 299 05 g mol is between the molecular weight of the smallest phosphonate hedp 206 03 g mol and the largest dtpmp 573 20 g mol for all phosphonates fig 1 and phosphate the influence of ph on adsorption was determined at a fixed particle concentration experiment 3 investigations showed that the presence of caii can increase strongly the removal of phosphonates nowack and stone 1999b membrane concentrates usually containing phosphonates may have very high caii concentrations thus an experiment was performed to examine the influence of caii on the adsorption of ntmp and dtpmp experiment 4 moreover the particles reusability was tested through numerous adsorption desorption cycles in synthetic ntmp solution experiment 5 and dtpmp containing membrane concentrate experiment 6 2 2 synthesis of znfezr adsorbent magnetic particles the synthesis of fe3o4 sio2 magnetic carrier particles is based on a published procedure mandel et al 2013 and the precipitation route for znfezr hydroxide adsorbent was described in earlier publications drenkova tuhtan et al 2016 schneider et al 2017 deposition of the znfezr adsorbent on the magnetic particles was performed via co precipitation to form composite particles described by drenkova tuhtan et al 2017a the fraction of the znfezr adsorbent was approximately 20 wt of the whole composite particle the particles were stored as a thick black suspension with approx 40 g l dry matter in the following the term adsorbent always refers to the znfezr oxyhydroxide component of the composite particles 2 3 analytical methods dissolved ortho phosphate concentrations of all samples were determined spectrophotometrically after membrane filtration 0 45 μm with the ammonium molybdate method according to iso 6878 and are typically presented as elemental po4 p the total p determination was performed following iso 6878 after one hour acidic peroxodisulfate digestion and subsequent formation of molybdenum blue complex rott et al 2018a spectrophotometers shimadzu uv 1800 and jasco v 550 in absorbance mode 880 nm were used to record uv vis extinction spectra and correlate them with the corresponding phosphorus concentrations in the membrane concentrate the dtpmp p concentration was determined indirectly as the difference between total p and o po4 p the ph was measured using three identical greisinger 3551 ph temperature meters and three identical greisinger ge 117 ph electrodes electrical conductivity was determined with wtw tetracon 925 probe and wtw multi 3430 device turbidity was measured with a wtw turb 430 ir device acid neutralizing capacity anc4 3 in mmol l h was determined according to the german standard din 38409 h7 2 titration of 100 ml sample with hcl to

solutions with phosphate or phosphonates pbtc hedp ntmp edtmp dtpmp 1 g l phosphate p or phosphonate p stock solutions were used these were diluted with deionized water to 1 mg l p solutions e g 1 ml in 1 l for experiment 4 cacl2 2h2o containing stock solution was added to the phosphorus solutions the membrane concentrate was obtained from a waterworks nanofiltration plant it was a clear colorless liquid with low organic load table 1 characteristic are the high concentrations of alkaline earth ions and the associated extraordinary high water hardness combined with a very high ph buffer capacity the total p of the sample was 1 39 mg l the dissolved p portion total p of the membrane filtered sample was 1 38 mg l thus the particulate p fraction is negligible and the po4 p was 0 56 mg l this resulted in 0 83 mg l p for the organic p fraction the antiscalant dtpmp is added to the plant inflow at about 0 6 mg l with an 80 average yield of the membrane plant a fivefold concentration of the added antiscalant occurs thus the membrane concentrate contains approx 3 mg l dtpmp corresponding to 0 81 mg l dtpmp p it is therefore assumed that the organic p fraction composes almost entirely of dtpmp after sampling the sample was adjusted to ph 7 and kept at room temperature to prevent precipitation of caco3 2 5 chemicals and reagents the synthetic solutions were prepared with deionized water produced on site with an ion exchange resin seradest sd 2000 and a downstream filter unit seralpur pro 90 cn purifying reverse osmosis treated tap water hcl 32 analar normapur was obtained from

p and optionally cacl2 2h2o to investigate the caii influence on the adsorption containing solution was mixed with the adsorbent stock suspension using micropipette under magnetic stirring 1000 rpm immediately after adding the adsorbent the desired ph 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 or 12 was adjusted within one minute using hcl or naoh and kept constant manually from then on for investigating the adsorption kinetics 10 ml samples were taken homogeneously at intervals of 1 4 7 15 30 60 120 240 and 480 min these samples were immediately membrane filtered with syringe filters 0 45 μm pore size nylon and subsequently the total p concentration of the filtrate was determined for investigating the influence of temperature or caii on the adsorption after 30 min contact time the reactor was placed on a cuboid magnet 40 20 20 mm neodymium iron boron ndfeb n42 nickel plated webcraft supermagnete after 30 min magnetic separation the supernatant was membrane filtered and the total p concentration of the filtrate was determined in general all tests were performed at room temperature 22 c for studying the temperature influence the entire procedure 30 min contact and 30 min magnetic separation was carried out in a temperature controlled room at 6 c and at 35 c constant temperature 2 6 2 adsorption desorption cycles with ntmp solution experiment 5 and dtpmp rich membrane concentrate experiment 6 reusability of the particles in a synthetic ntmp solution and in a real industrial wastewater matrix dtpmp rich membrane concentrate was demonstrated at 1 l lab scale over 30 adsorption desorption cycles in each case the adsorbent respectively particle concentration and ph were varied in different phases throughout the experiments to optimize the performance the exact parameter variations are indicated directly in fig 5 and fig 6 below the diagrams where vertical dashed lines represent the different phases corresponding to a change in parameters generally adsorbent concentration was varied between 0 05 g l and 0 3 g l znfezr and the ph value was maintained either at ph 6 or ph 7 by adding hcl at room temperature to find the most optimal reaction conditions contact time was fixed at 20 min for both adsorption and desorption reactions and the reactor content was well mixed via magnetic stirring after 20 min the reactor was positioned on top of a bench scale magnet 40 20 20 mm ndfeb n42 for 30 min to perform the solid liquid separation the magnetic particles were attracted to the magnet and collected at the bottom of the reactor while the clear supernatant was pumped out and membrane filtered 0 45 μm prior to analysis subsequently total phosphorus and ortho phosphate were measured in each sample see section 2 3 the ntmp p respectively dtpmp p fractions were calculated indirectly as the difference between total p and po4 p in case of the ntmp synthetic solution however the measured po4 p was practically zero i e with a high level of approximation total p was assumed equal to ntmp p adsorption efficiency e ads in was calculated with the equation 1 e a d s c 0 c t c 0 100 where c 0 and c t are respectively the initial p concentration and the p concentration at time t in the solution in mg l based on earlier research findings drenkova tuhtan et al 2016 2017a phosphorus desorption and simultaneous regeneration of the znfezr adsorbent was performed in a 2 m naoh solution ph 14 repetitive reuse of the desorption solution throughout all 30 adsorption desorption cycles could guarantee its enrichment with phosphorus by a factor of approximately 12 experiment 5 and 15 experiment 6 compared to the initial p concentration in the synthetic solution or the wastewater the declining electrical conductivity of the naoh solution was a good indicator for its exhausting regeneration capacity desorption efficiency e des in was calculated as the ratio of the desorbed to the previously adsorbed phosphorus 2 e d e s q d q a 100 where q d is the desorbed and q a is the initially adsorbed phosphorus in mg g 2 7 model equations adsorption kinetics i e loading q over time t were modelled with either the pseudo first order eq 3 or the pseudo second order eq 4 model the constants q e k 1 and k 2 were determined after linearization of the equations as described by ho 2004 2006 depending on the linear form the kinetics of pseudo second order can be classified into four different types ho 2006 3 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 4 q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 q e k 2 t curves depicting the adsorption capacity as a function of ph were represented either by the logistic function model

q m q i 2 2 8 acid dissociation constants for phosphoric and some phosphonic acids critical evaluations of stability constants are available in literature goldberg et al 2002 popov et al 2001 the constants are usually presented with ionic strength which required correction of the data for the species in this work to an ionic strength of 0 m using the davies equation table 2 these constants facilitated calculating the shares of the individual phosphonate species of the sum adsorption curves modelled by lfm 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of time and temperature on adsorption of ntmp experiments 1 and 2 synthetic solution in the case of 0 1 g l adsorbent a clear difference in the adsorption rate between ph 6 and 7 could be observed fig 2a at ph 6 almost complete adsorption of ntmp was achieved quickly whereas at ph 7 adsorption equilibrium could not be reached even after 8 h increased adsorbent dosage of 0 4 g l led to a fast and almost complete adsorption at both ph values both kinetics at ph 6 were most accurately modelled with the pseudo second order type 3 psot3 the course at ph 7 and 0 4 g l with psot4 and at ph 7 and 0 1 g l using the pseudo first order kinetics see table 1s for the latter sample the coefficients of determination of all psos were low ranging between 0 45 and 0 83 similarities predominantly with the pseudo second order model indicate chemisorption yang et al 2014 the rapid adsorption at ph 6 and 0 4 g l adsorbent implies a very low activation barrier which increases considerably with an increasing ph value the difference between the adsorption process at ph 6 and 7 at 0 1 g l adsorbent is obvious the point of zero charge of the material phpzc is approximately at ph 7 see section 2s in the supplementary data which means that at ph 7 there were far fewer protonated oh groups on the adsorbent surface than at ph 6 suggesting that weaker electrostatic interactions at ph 7 resulted in slower adsorption however the weaker interaction at ph 7 could be compensated with considerably higher dosing concentration of 0 4 g l as the higher adsorbent dose provided more protonated oh groups for adsorption fig 2b shows the influence of temperature on ntmp adsorption at ph 6 all curves were determined at 30 min contact time although an equilibrium state was not necessarily reached after 30 min according to fig 2a nevertheless 30 min reaction time is more relevant for technical applications than the exact isotherm progression over several hours which is not applicable in practice moreover isotherms at equilibrium conditions with this material have already been defined for the adsorption of phosphate drenkova tuhtan et al 2017a which makes the evaluation of the ntmp adsorption behavior comparable with these data fig 2b shows the increase in loading with increasing temperature for example at ph 6 and 30 min contact time almost complete elimination of 1 mg l ntmp p was achieved at 35 c with about 60 mg l adsorbent whereas at room temperature about 100 mg l were required this indicates that the adsorption of phosphonates on znfezr oxyhydroxides might be endothermic this implies that the adsorption process can be significantly improved in practice e g by using waste heat from production processes the adsorption of ntmp on ferric hydroxide surfaces i e surfaces with oh groups which may be protonated or deprotonated occurs both physically and chemically by exchanging oh groups with ligands or through covalent binding of metallic cations by ligands innerspherical complexation chen et al 2017 martínez and farrell 2017 ntmp binds mainly via bidentate complexes to hydroxide surfaces which are energetically preferred to monodentate complexes martínez and farrell 2017 the znfezr oxyhydroxide also has surface oh groups leading to the assumption that the adsorption of ntmp occurs similarly znfezr oxyhydroxide contains metals with different oxidation numbers znii feiii zriv which have a significant influence on electrostatic interactions between the adsorptive and surface charges however whether the observations regarding ntmp adsorption on ferric hydroxide surfaces can be transferred directly to znfezr oxyhydroxide structures has to be investigated further the maximum loading found in this study at room temperature ph 6 and 30 min contact time of 20 mg ntmp p g 215 μmol ntmp g is significantly lower than the loading of 70 mg phosphate p g 2260 μmol phosphate g on the same material at ph 7 and longer contact time drenkova tuhtan et al 2017a due to the different ph and contact times both results can only be compared to a limited extent however there is an apparent tendency for preferable adsorption of the smaller phosphate molecule which is in accordance with the pattern found by nowack and stone 2006 at a higher initial concentration of 9 3 mg l ntmp p compared to this study a similar loading of approximately 230 μmol ntmp g on ferric hydroxide granulate was achieved at 9 24 h contact time and ph 7 85 without caii boels et al 2012 however this result was reached after very long contact times in the kinetics experiments of the same study at 30 min contact time as in this study a significantly lower loading occurred the maximum loading of ntmp on ferric hydroxide granules by chen et al 2017 was about 100 μmol ntmp g ph 8 3 24 h c0 9 mg l ntmp p another study of ntmp adsorption on slurry goethite nowack and stone 1999a reached a loading of 30 μmol ntmp g ph 7 2 2 h c0 1 0 2 5 mg l ntmp p boels et al 2010 also investigated the adsorption of ntmp onto iron oxide coated waste filtration sand at ph 7 5 days contact time and initial ntmp p concentrations of 1 6 93 2 mg l the maximum loading was 45 μmol ntmp g thus all studies of ntmp adsorption on iron hydr oxides showed significantly lower loadings compared to the adsorbent material discussed here exceptionally only in the case of simultaneous precipitation of feiii in the presence of 3 mg l ntmp 0 93 mg l ntmp p at ph 7 0 7 5 and 15 min contact time a maximum loading of 410 μmol g feooh was achieved rott et al 2017b which was considerably higher than in this study this may be attributed to the fact that freshly precipitated iron hydroxide flocks are very fine and have a higher specific surface than the znfezr particles 3 2 effect of ph on adsorption of phosphate pbtc hedp ntmp edtmp and dtpmp with fixed particle concentration experiment 3 synthetic solution the influence of ph on the znfezr adsorbent loading was obvious for phosphate as well as for all investigated phosphonates fig 3 with an increase in ph not only the charge on the adsorbent surface shifts in the negative direction but also the species of the compounds are increasingly negatively charged so that electrostatic repulsion starts dominating the dosing concentration of 0 03 g l adsorbent was chosen purposefully low so that in none of the cases 100 adsorption was present at ph 6 and 7 in order to compare the degree of adsorption of the different compounds at the same initial 1 mg l p concentration the order of adsorption affinity at ph 6 was hedp p po4 p edtmp p dtpmp p ntmp p pbtc p thus the phosphorus in hedp and ortho phosphate was more preferably adsorbed compared to the aminophosphonates and pbtc p showed the least adsorption efficiency of all compounds obviously due to its comparatively small p content of 11 5 per molecule compared to the polyphosphonates 27 31 rott et al 2017b po4 and pbtc with only one phosphonate group in the molecule had the same initial concentration of 32 3 μm to compare directly their degree of adsorption in relation to the compound itself and not only the phosphorus content at ph 6 the following loadings occurred 830 μmol po4 g vs 450 μmol pbtc g at ph 7 they were 480 μmol po4 g vs 300 μmol pbtc g the molar mass of pbtc 270 g mol is considerably larger than that of po4 95 g mol which favors significantly the adsorption of po4 furthermore the adsorption curve for pbtc is also illustrated in fig 3 using the density function model dfm σ 2 39 10 2 g mg μ 4 859 α 7 45 10 5 g2 mg2 r2 0 986 the dfm representation is more accurate compared to the logistic function model lfm which is validated by the r2 values summarized in table 2 s in the supplementary the assumption of a declining adsorption at ph values 5 as illustrated with the dfm makes more sense because the fully protonated species of pbtc is present in this ph range the best adsorbed phosphonate hedp had the least steep adsorption curve among all phosphonates over the ph spectrum in the studied ph range this molecule dissociates only into two differently charged species double and triple negative the aliphatic hydroxyl group in hedp would dissociate only after both phosphonate groups of the phosphonate are completely deprotonated i e above ph 13 popov et al 2001 therefore the aliphatic hydroxyl group may not play an important role in the coordination of the phosphonate for almost all compounds a considerable decline in adsorption was observed between ph 6 and 8 the phpzc of the material is approximately 7 see fig 2s in supplementary at neutral ph the aminophosphonates with their similar structure have species with different charge numbers i e ntmp 3 phosphonate groups 1 amino group 3 4 edtmp 4 phosphonate groups 2 amino groups 4 5 dtpmp 5 phosphonate groups 3 amino groups 5 6 it is thus easy to conclude that the phpzc of the adsorbent and not the number of dissociated phosphonate species to be adsorbed is the decisive factor for adsorption to occur or not i e whether a negative surface charge would cause an immediate repulsion of the target molecule 3 3 effect of caii on adsorption of ntmp and dtpmp experiment 4 synthetic solution the influence of the caii concentration was studied along with the ph value in a series of experiments with synthetic solutions containing either 1 mg l ntmp p or 1 mg l dtpmp p see fig 4 the test was carried out with both ntmp considered highly representative for most phosphonates and dtpmp contained in the membrane concentrate used in this work the concentration of caii in the membrane concentrate was 15 mm which defined the highest caii concentration in the tested synthetic solution similar behavior was observed for both phosphonates namely increasing caii concentration contributed to an increase in the adsorption efficiency already between ph 5 and 7 e g ntmp p adsorbed from 0 1 mg l without caii to 0 5 mg l with 15 mm caii above ph 8 i e in the range where no considerable adsorption of phosphonates could be observed without caii the presence of caii particularly at 0 5 mm caii improved significantly the adsorption for example at 0 5 15 mm caii concentrations the logistic function could no longer be used for modelling the values and at ph 12 even almost complete adsorption occurred the adsorbent znfezr oxyhydroxide did not appear to have a layered double hydroxide ldh structure drenkova tuhtan et al 2016 and the influence of caii on this material has not been investigated so far on the other hand there are a few known studies concerning the influence of caii on the adsorption of phosphates on ldh structures zhou et al 2011 compared the adsorption of tripolyphosphate tpp onto mg2fe cl ldh and ca2fe cl ldh the latter material achieved better phosphate removal which was attributed to the release of caii from the ldh structure forming insoluble precipitates with tpp xu et al 2010 made similar conclusions attributing the removal of ortho phosphate by ca based ldh to the formation of ca phosphate precipitates and not to adsorption the composite adsorbent material used in this work was stable and did not disintegrate in the range ph 5 12 drenkova tuhtan et al 2017a therefore it cannot be assumed that phosphonate elimination is caused by formation of insoluble zn fe or zr complexes with phosphonates due to the relatively high solubility product of ca oh 2 ksp 5 5 10 6 it is not expected that ca oh 2 will precipitate even at ph 12 and serve as adsorbent furthermore at the tested concentrations phosphonates are known to form mainly water soluble complexes with caii thus it cannot be assumed that the improved elimination is due to formation of insoluble chelate complex precipitates nevertheless analyses of the ca concentration in the membrane filtrate after adsorption showed that there was a decrease of 5 20 in the ca concentration at ph 11 12 not shown in the figure the adsorbent had a negative net charge above phpzc 7 this could have led to increased adsorption of positively charged ca2 ions which might have caused the shift of surface charge in the positive direction phosphonates which would have been repelled from the surface above the phpzc without caii were thus able to adsorb as ligand like or metal ion like ternary complexes through caii adsorption martínez and farrell 2017 the fact that the caii influence was negligible at ph 7 8 where the phpzc is located strengthens this hypothesis because in the neutral ph range the surface charge was close to zero which did not allow significant caii adsorption ternary tridentate surface complexation supposedly occurs for all phosphonates which explains the lack of significant difference between the adsorption behavior of ntmp and dtpmp furthermore the ca facilitated adsorption could also be attributed to the parallel precipitation of small amounts of caco3 onto which phosphonates can adsorb rott et al 2017b the formation of caco3 might happen by reaction of dosed ca2 with co3 2 entrapped in the form of co2 from the ambient atmosphere e g during sample mixing co2 h2co3 is transformed to co3 2 at ph 8 3 4 adsorption desorption cycles with ntmp solution experiment 5 synthetic solution and dtpmp rich industrial wastewater experiment 6 membrane concentrate the main goal in the following two experiments was to optimize the adsorption performance by varying the operational conditions dose ph and to demonstrate the successful regeneration and reusability of the magnetic microsorbents over numerous loading cycles which is often times a challenge for non commercial adsorbent materials the results in fig 5 summarize the particle performance throughout 30 cycles in a synthetic ntmp solution and fig 6 in a dtpmp rich membrane concentrate the removal efficiency of ntmp p at adsorbent concentration 0 1 g l and ph 7 was insufficient and fluctuated around 50 fig 5b cycles 1 8 which is somewhat higher but still in accordance with the results from the kinetics experiment in fig 2a doubling the adsorbent concentration to 0 2 g l improved the efficiency but removal was still incomplete cycles 9 10 and even 0 3 g l resulted in 90 ntmp p adsorption at ph 7 cycle 11 in the next phase cycles 12 15 the ph was reduced to 6 to increase the positive surface charge of the adsorbent and improve the electrostatic attraction with the negatively charged ntmp species which immediately led to complete adsorption of the 1 mg l ntmp p with 0 3 g l but also with 0 1 g l adsorbent cycles 16 20 further attempt to decrease the adsorbent dose by half 0 05 g l dropped the efficiency down to 71 85 cycles 21 25 then the system was restored again by adjusting the adsorbent concentration back to 0 1 g l and keeping ph 6 cycles 26 30 under these conditions adsorption was complete and the measured ntmp p concentrations in the treated effluent were below the limit of detection fig 5a thus the adsorbent loading in this last phase was 10 mg ntmp p g which complies with the adsorption behavior at 22 c presented earlier in fig 2b the high desorption efficiency of the ntmp species and simultaneous adsorbent regeneration performed in 2 m naoh is summarized in fig 5b grey bars the strong ph shift from neutral during adsorption to highly alkaline ph 14 during desorption caused on one hand the electrostatic repulsion of ntmp species from the deprotonated and highly negatively charged adsorbent surface on the other hand ion exchange reaction might have also contributed to the desorption of the p species the gradual increase of phosphorus in the constantly reused naoh solution is shown in fig 5c the fact that the ntmp p could be consistently transferred from the synthetic solution 1 mg l ntmp p into the naoh solution via reversible sorption and gradually concentrated to 12 mg ntmp p after 30 cycles confirms that phosphonate adsorption took place through surface complexation and not through precipitation nowack and stone 1999a similarly the dtpmp rich membrane concentrate 0 81 mg l dtpmp p and 0 56 mg l po4 p was treated first with 0 1 g l adsorbent at ph 6 reaching 87 97 po4 p removal and 92 dtpmp p removal fig 6b cycles 1 10 increasing ph to 7 reduced the adsorption efficiency by 20 cycles 11 16 as logically expected and even doubling the adsorbent dose 0 2 g l could not remove completely dtpmp p cycles 17 25 only in the last cycles 26 30 effluent concentrations lod limits of detection 0 015 mg l total p and 0 005 mg l po4 p could be achieved with 0 2 g l adsorbent at ph 6 corresponding to 99 removal desorption efficiency was consistently high fig 6b grey bars even sometimes exceeding 100 most likely due to later desorption of earlier adsorbed phosphorus throughout the cycles or additional contribution from other organic p fractions likewise phosphorus was gradually concentrated in the naoh solution up to 20 mg total p after 30 cycles fig 6c in both matrices the significant adsorption drop at ph 7 versus ph 6 complies with the data presented in fig 3 indicating sharp decline of the fitting curve with increasing ph comparing the particle performance in both matrices under the same conditions e g at 0 1 g l adsorbent and ph 7 it can be concluded that dtpmp p adsorbed better with 80 efficiency fig 6b cycles 11 16 than ntmp p whose removal fluctuated around 50 fig 5b cycles 1 8 these results are also in accordance with the data presented in fig 3 showing higher adsorption capacity at ph 7 for dtpmp p than for ntmp p another explanation for the better dtpmp p sorption affinity is the presence of calcium ions in the membrane concentrate which facilitated the adsorption process as discussed in section 3 3 the experiment in fig 4 demonstrated almost complete adsorption of dtpmp p at ph 12 in a synthetic solution doped with 15 mm caii same concentration as in the membrane concentrate counterintuitively the current experiment 6 shows that at ph 14 2 m naoh instead of expected adsorption desorption of dtpmp p occurs however it needs to be considered that on one hand the naoh used as p desorption medium is free of calcium on the other hand even if some of the calcium was transferred from the wastewater into the naoh solution through the particles the ionic strength and oh gradient of the 2 m naoh is so high that the adsorption of calcium becomes irrelevant due to the dominant electrostatic repulsion and or ion exchange between the negatively charged p species and the dominating oh groups in the medium additionally the presence of calcium in the desorption solution would cause the precipitation of ca oh 2 or caco3 at ph 14 in fact some hardly detectable and very fine white flocks were visually observed on the desorption reactor surface implying that the presence of calcium in the naoh solution was extremely low and insignificant to interfere with the p desorption process 4 conclusions this work proposed a technology for phosphonate removal from industrial wastewater utilizing tailored magnetically separable znfezr based microsorbents the adsorbent proved to be highly efficient with maximum loading 20 mg ntmp p g 215 μmol ntmp g 64 mg ntmp g at ph 6 room temperature and 30 min contact time adsorption at ph 7 was fast following pseudo second order kinetics model furthermore ntmp adsorption onto znfezr oxyhydroxide proved to be an endothermic process significant drop in adsorption was observed at ph phpzc 7 for phosphate and all investigated phosphonates adsorption affinity at ph 6 and 1 mg l initial p concentration followed the order hedp p po4 p edtmp p dtpmp p ntmp p pbtc p the presence of caii improved considerably the ntmp adsorption at ph 8 where usually adsorption could not be observed without caii particle reusability was tested and optimized throughout 30 adsorption desorption cycles at lab scale achieving 90 total efficiency under optimal conditions adsorbent concentrations of 0 1 g l for synthetic ntmp solution and 0 2 g l for membrane concentrate rich in dtpmp and ca ph 6 and 20 min contact time were sufficient to maintain ultra low effluent p concentrations lod over multiple cycles successful p desorption and simultaneous regeneration of the adsorbent was performed in a constantly reused 2 m naoh where 15 fold p enrichment was achieved compared to the initial p

19332,adsorbable organic halogen aox is a bulk organic parameter conventionally used to indicate all adsorbable halogenated organic disinfection byproducts formed in disinfected water analytically aox is determined by three sequential steps 1 concentration and separation of aox from halides with activated carbon 2 conversion of aox into halides with pyrolysis and 3 quantification of halides via microcoulometry or ion chromatography ic because the approach is relatively costly and cannot effectively recover non adsorbable compounds we herein proposed a facile and green pretreatment tool to measure the nonionic portion of total organic halogen ntox with a new three step approach 1 separation of ntox and halides with electrodialysis ed 2 conversion of ntox into halides with ultraviolet and 3 analysis of halides with ic to verify this proposal this study presented the efficiency of ed in separating halides and ntox under a variety of operational and environmental conditions the results showed that ed removed 98 5 of fluoride chloride bromide and iodide from all tested waters up to 1000 mg x l within 1 5 h meanwhile ed recovered an average of 87 9 of fourteen small molecular weight model compounds with each at 100 μg l by using electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry the whole pictures of high molecular weight compounds in a chlorinated drinking water before and after ed pretreatment were compared which revealed 79 7 and 83 6 recoveries of overall polar chlorinated and brominated compounds respectively in addition the quantity and property of the dissolved organic matter were largely maintained by ed and the retained organics may be used for later characterization the study hence presents a novel use of ed as a pretreatment tool to enable subsequent ntox measurement graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfection byproducts dbps total organic halogen tox aox electrodialysis 1 introduction disinfection of drinking water wastewater and swimming water is an essential process to prevent the occurrence of waterborne diseases however disinfectants such as chlorine chloramine chlorine dioxide and ozone can react with dissolved organic matter dom bromide and iodide in water and form a range of undesirable halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps krasner 2009 up to date over 700 halogenated dbps have been identified richardson et al 2007 and extensive studies have been done to understand their human health and ecosystem risks such as carcinogenicity villanueva et al 2004 cytotoxicity genotoxicity wagner and plewa 2017 reproductive issues nieuwenhuijsen et al 2000 developmental toxicity yang and zhang 2013 and growth inhibition liu and zhang 2014 however although advanced analytical techniques have dramatically enlarged the pool of dbps with diverse structures and molecular weights mws the sum of identified halogenated dbps still account for less than 50 of total organic halogen tox produced in chlorinated water zhang et al 2000 krasner et al 2006 indicating that a significant portion of halogenated dbps remain unidentified or unknown the percentage of known dbp species is even lower for chloraminated waters zhang et al 2000 diehl et al 2000 meanwhile it has been reported that the toxicity of a disinfected water sample was positively correlated with the tox level of the sample savitz et al 2006 itoh et al 2011 pan et al 2014 yang et al 2015 liu et al 2015 2017 li et al 2017 lv et al 2017 han et al 2017 li and mitch 2018 therefore in addition to individual halogenated dbps the analysis of tox in water is warranted to better understand the overall formation of halogenated dbps including those undetectable and or unknown ones adsorbable organic halogen aox refers to the adsorbable portion of tox including total organic chlorine tocl bromine tobr and iodine toi owing to its importance many agencies including the united states environmental protection agency methods 1650 9020b usepa 1997 the international standard organization method iso 9562 iso 2004 the american public health association method 5320b apha 1999 and the chinese environmental protection ministry methods gb t 15959 1995 gb t 1995 and hj t 83 2001 hj t 2001 have promulgated standard methods and procedures to measure aox these methods although issued in different countries and labelled with different names are identical in principle and always include three sequential steps 1 concentration and separation of aox from halides i e chloride bromide and iodide with activated carbon ac 2 conversion of adsorbed aox into halides via pyrolysis and 3 quantification of halides via microcoulometry or ion chromatography ic echigo et al 2000 hua and reckhow 2006 kristiana et al 2015 despite of its usefulness recognition and robustness the aox measurement method may have some drawbacks first is the relatively high cost for not only equipment but also consumable items the ac used for adsorption should contain as little halogen as possible to avoid background errors reckhow et al 2007 and specialized ac cartridges are required kimura et al 2017 second is the relatively low recovery for non adsorbable compounds due to the diversity and variability of dbps adsorbability symons et al 1996 weakly adsorbable or hydrophilic organic dbps may not be fully recovered with ac li et al 2011a meanwhile certain anions such as iodide and iodate if present at high concentrations in water might be adsorbed onto ac and interfere with the organic iodine measurement kristiana et al 2015 also it has been reported that ac as a reductive material might dehalogenate some oxidative halogenated dbps e g organic chloramines and thus pretreatment of ac e g slight oxidation of ac by ozone might be necessary to inhibit its reduction for aox li et al 2011b to avoid the drawbacks of the conventional aox method some efforts have been devoted to developing alternatives for tox analysis one typical example was the replacement of ac with xad resin for dbp adsorption the effort appeared unappealing because xad showed lower recovery of dbps than ac sjöström et al 1985 another example was the use of silver ag cartridge a cation exchanger pre loaded with silver ions to eliminate halides from water which is a common approach in pretreating salty water for ic analysis reckhow et al 2007 although the use of ag cartridges was capable of dropping halide concentration to a few micrograms per liter μg l the technique has not been progressed and no product has been commercialized since then moreover it is unknown if tox was well recovered with ag cartridges electrodialysis ed is an ion exchange membrane iem based process that applies electrical current to separate ions from water lee et al 2002 ed was used for desalination in the water supply industry amy et al 2017 suggesting that its application in removing ions is well proven however with rapid progress of the reverse osmosis technology ed has become less competitive due to cost concerns bernardes et al 2014 despite of this ed is still widely used in ultrapure water production and certain analytical chemistry areas such as eluent generation and suppression in ic operation pietrzyk and dicinoski 2006 rabin et al 1993 previously the authors have successfully applied ed to isolate dissolved organic nitrogen don from dissolved inorganic nitrogen species zhu et al 2015 thereby allowing more reliable detection of don du et al 2017 as for halogenated compounds according to an earlier literature those unknown organic halogens featured a molecular size range between 500 and 10 000 da hua and reckhow 2008 which is greater than the sizes of halides iodide has the highest mw 127 da among all halides now that most of organic halogens have apparent mw and charge distinctions from halides richardson 2010 ed may isolate the nonionic portion of tox ntox from halides too and therefore enable quantification of ntox in light of the above information we herein proposed a new three step approach to analyze ntox as follows 1 separation of ntox from halides via ed 2 conversion of ntox into halides via ultraviolet uv and 3 measurement of halides with ic the target tox was limited to the nonionic portion at the current stage because ed is known to elute ionized compounds although in the future it may be refined to retain ionic organic compounds to validate this proposal this study aimed to 1 assess ed s efficiency in the removal of halides and the recovery of model dbps under a variety of environmental and operational conditions 2 evaluate the recoveries of high mw ntox with ed and 3 compare the changes of quantity and property of organic matter by ed and ac during the process some mechanisms potentially responsible for the removal of halides and recovery of ntox were also discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and samples for inorganic halogens four reagent grade sodium halides were purchased from aladdin inc for organic halogens a total of 20 model dbp compounds with diverse mws 75 5 393 7 g mol and functional groups were selected including seven halomethanes hms six haloacetonitriles hans chloral hydrate ch namely trichloroacetaldehyde and six haloacetic acids haas they were purchased from sigma aldrich and aladdin inc these compounds were chosen as representatives because they are either ubiquitous in water or symbolic of emerging brominated or iodinated compounds the general properties of these inorganic and organic halogens are provided in tables s1 and s2 respectively prior to tests dbp stock solutions were prepared with ultrapure water direct q3 millipore france without using organic solvent to avoid interference with each other suwannee river natural organic matter srnom 2r101n was acquired from the international humic substances society to prepare for a simulated water in addition to synthetic waters containing model dbp compounds real water samples were collected in mid august of 2017 including a surface water from a pond on campus a tap water from the laboratory a swimming pool water and a wastewater from a sewage well disinfected wastewater samples were prepared by dosing sufficient sodium hypochlorite naocl into the wastewater sample and allowing reaction for 12 h samples were filtered with 0 45 μm nylon filters xingya co ltd china and quenched with sodium thiosulfate to eliminate chlorine residual the characteristics of these real samples are provided in table s3 in addition to model compounds the whole pictures of high mw polar halogenated dbps formed during chlorination of the simulated water sample were evaluated using a powerful precursor ion scan pis method with an electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometer esi tqms zhai and zhang 2011 the simulated drinking water sample contained 3 0 mg l srnom as c 90 mg l nahco3 as caco3 and 2 0 mg l kbr as br the relatively high bromide level was adopted to represent a typical concentration in source water affected by seawater intrusion at ambient temperature the simulated drinking water sample was chlorinated with 5 0 mg l naocl as cl2 for 2 h followed by quenching with sodium thiosulfate the chlorine dose was chosen according to the previous study zhai and zhang 2011 and the relatively high chlorine dose was intended to enable better observation of dbp formation wang et al 2016 2 2 electrodialysis reactor and procedures similar to an earlier study zhu et al 2015 the ed reactor consisted of two parallel cells each cell had three chambers which were separated by two iems with a surface membrane area of 54 cm2 the middle dilute chamber was 1 cm in width and it could hold 100 ml of water aluminum plates were used as the electrodes and placed in the concentrate chambers so that they would not contact or react with dbps in the dilute chamber unlike the earlier study that used sodium chloride nacl 0 1 m sodium bicarbonate nahco3 was used as electrolyte in this study to avoid potential penetration of halides into the sample in addition to maximize the halide concentration gradient across membranes the electrolyte was continuously refreshed at a flowrate of 5 ml min using a metering pump bt100 longer pump co ltd china the electric power was supplied by a direct current transformer mch 305dii meili co ltd the iems cmi 7000 and ami 7001 were purchased from membrane international inc usa and preconditioned for 24 h per the manufacturer s guidance the iem specifications such as the ion exchange capacity selectivity electric resistance thickness and ph resistivity range are provided in table s4 the schematic diagram of ed and potential reactions occurring in the ed reactor are presented in fig 1 in kinetics studies aliquots were retrieved at designated times in efficiency studies samples were analyzed only after the designated operation time 2 3 analytical methods the anions including

analyzed with a uv visible spectrophotometer s 3100 scinco inc korea for quality assurance and control the relative standard deviations rsds of all analyzed parameters were below 10 otherwise tests were repeated meanwhile all tests were conducted at least in duplicate for the simulated drinking water sample aliquots with and without ed were analyzed with the pis method using an ab sciex qtrap 4500 mass spectrometer the details concerning the sample pretreatment prior to the pis analysis are given in the supplementary data because ion clusters may overlap during the ms analysis via direct infusion ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc was coupled with the mass spectrometer for pre separation to better observe the isotopic ion patterns of halogenated dbps the sample injection volume was 5 μl chromatographic separations of halogenated dbps were performed using a waters acquity uplc hss t3 column 100 mm 2 1 mm id 1 8 μm particle size the mobile phase consisted of water and methanol and the flow rate was set at 0 4 ml min the column temperature was maintained at 35 c the elution liquid was programed as follows the initial ratio of methanol was set at 5 and it linearly increased to 90 in 8 0 min then the methanol ratio returned to 5 in 0 1 min and maintained for another 2 9 min other optimal ms parameters included ion spray voltage 4500 v negative mode ion source gas i 55 arbitrary unit ion source gas ii 55 arbitrary unit curtain gas 40 arbitrary unit heater temperature 550 c declustering potential dp 30 v collision energy ce 30 v entrance potential ep 10 v and collision cell exit potential 10 v to compare the efficiency of ed and ac doc was measured after ed or ac pretreatment for three real samples the operation procedures of ac column generally followed an earlier study li et al 2011b in brief water samples were adjusted to ph 2 with concentrated nitric acid and then passed through two consecutively prepacked ac columns mitsubishi chemical analytech japan at a flow rate of 3 ml min the eluted water was collected for doc measurement subsequently the ac columns were rinsed by 10 ml of 5 g l kno3 to desorb halides the doc loss during the flushing process was also analyzed 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of ed in halide removal because halide removal is the prerequisite for ntox separation we firstly investigated the efficiency of ed on halide removal fig 2 a shows that it took less than 1 5 h for ed to remove 99 5 of all the four halide species 10 mg x l under this study s conditions although trace levels of halides remained as long as the concentrations of halides were not much greater than that of ntox e g 3 ntox was still calculated by subtracting halides from the final amount of total halogen tx without introducing significant analytical errors and similar calculation method has been applied for don analysis saunders et al 2017 the removal of halides followed pseudo first order kinetics by plotting logarithmic concentration logc versus time the rate constants were determined and ranked as follows fluoride 0 07 min 1 chloride 0 11 min 1 bromide 0 12 min 1 iodide 0 14 min 1 the positive relationship between the halide removal rate and the mw accorded with an earlier study in which fluoride was found to be more difficult to remove than other halides during the ed process likely because fluoride has the highest electro negativity and largest hydrated radius sata 2000 sata et al 1995 toshikatsu et al 1996 in the natural water the concentration of chloride varies widely from 2 5 to 500 mg l in terrestrial water snoeyink and jenkins 1980 and sometimes reaches up to 20 000 mg l in ocean water bromide in u s drinking water is usually below 3 mg l krasner et al 1989 but it reaches up to 65 mg l in sea water in contrast iodide in u s and canadian waters when detected ranges from 0 4 to 104 μg l richardson et al 2008 and in the ocean it is usually approximately 60 μg l because chloride is higher in concentration but lower in removal kinetics than bromide and iodide during the ed process we hereafter chose chloride as the representative of halides to simulate a harsh condition for halide removal fig 2b shows that the chloride removal rate generally decreased with increasing chloride concentration suggesting that samples with higher levels of halides require more time to eliminate halides similar to chloride other halides were dramatically removed even at elevated concentrations 99 9 as shown in fig s1 after 1 5 h of ed pretreatment proving that the ed process is reliable in reducing most of halides however regardless of the initial concentration the residual chloride after 90 min ed pretreatment was always at approximately 15 μg l the possible reason for the incomplete chloride removal was the difficulty in driving trace chloride through iem when ions were exhausted to support an electric current therefore a subtraction of the remaining halide from tx after ed appeared necessary to obtain the ntox content at current stage to understand the ion movement better fig s2 presents the variations of ph conductivity and alkalinity in three exemplary samples along the ed process it was observed that both conductivity and alkalinity decreased continuously along the process indicating that most of the ions permeated iems rapidly however the ph decreased first and then increased along the ed process suggesting that hydrogen ion h might somehow diffuse into the dilute chamber at the early stage due to its high diffusivity and then move out by electric current given that the acid dissociation coefficient pka of hydrofluoric acid hf is 3 18 table s2 the decreasing ph may increase the fraction of neutral form of fluoride i e hf thereby slowing down the penetration of fluoride during the ed process 3 2 performance of ed in recovering small mw compounds in addition to halide removal a reliable ntox analysis is highly dependent upon the organic compound recovery i e the fraction of compounds detected after ed relative to the amount before pretreatment fig 3 shows the recoveries of three groups of model dbps with ed pretreatment for 1 5 h the results indicated that the average recoveries were 85 6 89 9 and 92 2 for seven hms six hans and ch respectively which may satisfy common analytical requirements in contrast fig s3 shows that haas were not adequately recovered because of their ionic features suggesting that the ed cannot recover ionized species at the current stage under this study s condition to better understand the differences among nonionic dbps during the ed process fig s4 presents the correlation of their recoveries with three common physicochemical properties including mw an indicator of size henry s law constant hlc an indicator of volatility and the octanol water partitioning coefficient kow an indicator of adsorption capacity it was observed that most dbps tested were negatively correlated with their mws and kow but positively related with their hlc suggesting that the dbp losses during ed were mainly attributed to adsorption instead of volatilization other than trichloroacetonitrile tcan most hans showed higher recoveries than other types of dbps the reason of relatively low tcan recovery was probably attributed to its instability under acidic condition glezer et al 1999 which was evidenced by the detection of its hydrolysis product trichloroacetamide reckhow et al 2001 in this study in summary it may indicate that the recovery of dbps is determined by multiple factors 3 3 performance of ed for synthetic water similar to the conventional aox method the proposed ntox method may also be subject to interferences from high level halides to explore ed s applicability we herein tested a series of synthetic waters containing both halides and dbps ch and chloride were chosen as the representatives of ntox and halides respectively due to their proven performances as described above fig 4 a presents the ntox recovery and chloride removal for samples with a fixed ch content i e 50 μg cl l yet varying chloride contents i e 3 to 100 of the ch concentration it was found that ed consistently recovered 91 1 of ch and meanwhile removed 98 5 of chloride suggesting that the recovery of ch was independent of the halide concentrations under this study s conditions meanwhile fig 4b shows consistent recoveries of ch at varying concentrations i e 20 50 100 500 and 1000 μg cl l with a fixed halide ntox ratio 30 1 and a well calibrated curve with r2 as 0 9989 was obtained it should be noted that many real samples may have higher halide ntox ratios i e 100 than that used in this study if so multiple rounds of ed treatment are perhaps needed to reduce halides to trace levels contrast to an earlier study zhu et al 2015 this study achieved relatively constant recovery of ntox regardless of halide levels the reason is likely partially ascribed to the specialty of the selected model compound and partially due to the competition between ions and the model compound for ion exchanging sites in iem kim et al 2003 since one earlier study pointed out that only when salt was nearly depleted might dom be transported as a charge carrier to permeate through iem vanoppen et al 2015 increasing the concentration of ions should reasonably not impact the organic compound recovery significantly 3 4 performance of ed for real water in this section ed was used as a pretreatment to measure ntox in real tap water in the raw tap water three typical dbps i e trichloromethane bromodichloromethane and ch were detected before ed and their recoveries after ed ranged from 81 0 to 86 4 fig s5 meanwhile four anions i e fluoride chloride sulfate and nitrate were detected in the raw tap water and their removals reached 99 2 after ed for the same tap water spiked with ten model dbps three of them were detected in the raw tap water 75 8 recoveries were obtained regardless of their types and spiking concentrations i e 10 20 40 60 and 80 μg l and r2 values were 0 99 for their calibration curves table 1 this result supported that the ed efficiently recovered these compounds from synthetic water as well as from real water 3 5 performance of ed in recovering high mw compounds because the abovementioned low mw model dbps may not be fully representative of other unevaluated dbps especially for high mw compounds the efficiency of ed for high mw compounds should be evaluated in addition because a significant portion of dbps in water are high in mw e g 1000 da zhai and zhang 2009 wang et al 2016 it is important to know if the proposed ed method is amenable to high mw dbps by conducting piss of bromide at m z 79 and 81 with uplc esi tqms high mw polar brominated dbps formed in the simulated drinking water sample with and without ed treatment were selectively detected pis spectra shown in fig 5 present the pictures of polar brominated dbps during the entire range of retention time rt i e 0 11 min meanwhile to observe the isotopic abundance ratios of typical brominated dbps in the samples the pis spectra obtained for specific rt ranges are shown in fig s6 as shown in fig 5a and b many brominated dbps were produced in the chlorinated drinking water sample including ion clusters m z 171 173 175 193 195 215 217 219 277 279 281 293 295 297 319 321 323 325 and 327 329 331 333 these ion clusters corresponded to frequently detected dbps i e bromochloroacetic acid 2 bromobutenedioic acid dibromoacetic acid 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid 2 dibromo chloro methyl but 2 enedioic acid and 2 4 6 tribromophenol respectively in drinking water samples according to previous studies zhai and zhang 2011 pan and zhang 2013 zhang et al 2008 other major ion clusters e g 305 307 309 355 357 359 361 and 369 371 373 375 corresponded to new or currently unknown brominated dbps table s5 the pis spectra of m z 79 and 81 of the chlorinated drinking water sample after ed are shown in fig 5c and d respectively with fixed instrument parameters the total ion intensity tii the sum of ion intensities within the m z range of 100 500 of a pis m z 79 spectrum was used to indicate the total amount of polar brominated dbps jiang et al 2017 compared with the chlorinated drinking water sample without ed the tii value of the sample with ed was reduced by 16 4 indicating that approximately 83 6 of all polar brominated dbps were retained during ed similarly high mw chlorinated species were recovered by 79 7 fig s7 table s5 lists the intensity changes of representative ion clusters which indicated that the intensities of individual dbps with ed were 63 1 119 6 of those in the sample without ed specifically for one example the emerging dbp 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid or 3 5 dibromo salicylic acid showed 100 6 recovery in ion intensity after ed treatment hence the recoveries of overall dbps and individual dbps both supported that ed recovered polar ntox at acceptable levels 3 6 comparison of pretreatment methods in order to compare the proposed and conventional methods both ntox and aox should be measured however because ntox and aox apply different types of organic halogen conversion methods which might introduce varying analytical errors and uncertainties into the comparison we herein compared the doc contents in three real waters before and after either ed or ac pretreatment it has been reported that dbps with mw ranging from 500 to 10 000 da accounted for 50 of dbps detected in chlorinated drinking water zhang and minear 2002 which matched well with another study that approximately half of dom fell into the mw scope 10 000 da andersen et al 2000 therefore the assumption appears reasonable that good performance in recovering dom may imply the effectiveness of recovering dbps fig 6 shows that 29 3 52 4 of doc in selected waters were recovered by ac cartridges in comparison the doc recovered with ed for swimming pool water and tap waters were 60 8 meaning that ed recovered more doc than ac did when a flushing process was conducted more doc 6 6 15 4 was eluted out from the ac cartridges that is to say more doc was lost during flushing the ac materials there were no studies available specifically comparing doc removals between ed and ac however some studies have reported that granular ac can remove 20 50 doc from drinking water jiang et al 2017 chowdhury et al 2013 the results of doc adsorption by ac in this study fell in the range although the doc recovery was not necessarily equal to the recovery of organic halogen the results may indicate that the ed process is robust in retaining most of dom in water in addition to the quantity the potential alteration of dom quality is another concern about the use of ed especially if the water sample is used for subsequent characterization fig s8a in the supplementary data shows that the uv spectra of three real samples before and after ed pretreatment were almost unaltered meanwhile fig s8b in the supplementary data shows that the doc contents did not change significantly either 20 on average for these samples hence they together provided evidence that ed did not alter dom quality and quantity significantly after ed pretreatment the remaining dom might be used for other research purposes if they are not used for ntox analysis 4 conclusions overall this study evaluated the efficiency of ed as a pretreatment tool for separating halides and ntox under this study s conditions the ed reactor achieved at least 98 5 removal of halides for all samples tested and on average 87 9 recoveries for 14 small mw model dbp compounds for real samples spiked with dbps excellent correlation curves were obtained with r2 0 99 with the aid of uplc esi tqms analyses the recoveries of overall high mw chlorinated and brominated compounds by ed were 79 7 and 83 6 respectively for real samples ed showed better doc recovery than ac and did not change the uv spectra significantly suggesting that the remaining organic matter might be used for further characterization or other purposes such information hence demonstrates the novel use of ed which is a mature technology for water treatment as a new method in the environmental analytical chemistry area of all issues the key challenge of using ed for this method is to maximize and optimize the recovery of organic halogen although this study demonstrates several successful cases the proposed method still needs verification by analyzing more and various types of dbps and samples once halides and ntox are separated the determination of ntox will rely on a complete conversion of ntox into halides as well as an accurate quantification of halides subsequently it is necessary to compare the proposed ntox method i e a combination of ed uv ic in sequence with the conventional aox method i e a combination of ac pyrolysis ic in sequence for a series of waters in the coming studies we are also going to further improve the removal rates and extents of halides from water to allow direct ntox analysis i e without subtraction of halides from tx to further reduce ntox loss by optimizing iem and operating conditions and to design or refine the ed unit so that the system can retain not only nonionic but also ionic dbps in addition the toxicity of waters with and without ed treatment may also be compared to justify this method acknowledgements we appreciate the financial support from the shenzhen science technology innovation

19332,adsorbable organic halogen aox is a bulk organic parameter conventionally used to indicate all adsorbable halogenated organic disinfection byproducts formed in disinfected water analytically aox is determined by three sequential steps 1 concentration and separation of aox from halides with activated carbon 2 conversion of aox into halides with pyrolysis and 3 quantification of halides via microcoulometry or ion chromatography ic because the approach is relatively costly and cannot effectively recover non adsorbable compounds we herein proposed a facile and green pretreatment tool to measure the nonionic portion of total organic halogen ntox with a new three step approach 1 separation of ntox and halides with electrodialysis ed 2 conversion of ntox into halides with ultraviolet and 3 analysis of halides with ic to verify this proposal this study presented the efficiency of ed in separating halides and ntox under a variety of operational and environmental conditions the results showed that ed removed 98 5 of fluoride chloride bromide and iodide from all tested waters up to 1000 mg x l within 1 5 h meanwhile ed recovered an average of 87 9 of fourteen small molecular weight model compounds with each at 100 μg l by using electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry the whole pictures of high molecular weight compounds in a chlorinated drinking water before and after ed pretreatment were compared which revealed 79 7 and 83 6 recoveries of overall polar chlorinated and brominated compounds respectively in addition the quantity and property of the dissolved organic matter were largely maintained by ed and the retained organics may be used for later characterization the study hence presents a novel use of ed as a pretreatment tool to enable subsequent ntox measurement graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfection byproducts dbps total organic halogen tox aox electrodialysis 1 introduction disinfection of drinking water wastewater and swimming water is an essential process to prevent the occurrence of waterborne diseases however disinfectants such as chlorine chloramine chlorine dioxide and ozone can react with dissolved organic matter dom bromide and iodide in water and form a range of undesirable halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps krasner 2009 up to date over 700 halogenated dbps have been identified richardson et al 2007 and extensive studies have been done to understand their human health and ecosystem risks such as carcinogenicity villanueva et al 2004 cytotoxicity genotoxicity wagner and plewa 2017 reproductive issues nieuwenhuijsen et al 2000 developmental toxicity yang and zhang 2013 and growth inhibition liu and zhang 2014 however although advanced analytical techniques have dramatically enlarged the pool of dbps with diverse structures and molecular weights mws the sum of identified halogenated dbps still account for less than 50 of total organic halogen tox produced in chlorinated water zhang et al 2000 krasner et al 2006 indicating that a significant portion of halogenated dbps remain unidentified or unknown the percentage of known dbp species is even lower for chloraminated waters zhang et al 2000 diehl et al 2000 meanwhile it has been reported that the toxicity of a disinfected water sample was positively correlated with the tox level of the sample savitz et al 2006 itoh et al 2011 pan et al 2014 yang et al 2015 liu et al 2015 2017 li et al 2017 lv et al 2017 han et al 2017 li and mitch 2018 therefore in addition to individual halogenated dbps the analysis of tox in water is warranted to better understand the overall formation of halogenated dbps including those undetectable and or unknown ones adsorbable organic halogen aox refers to the adsorbable portion of tox including total organic chlorine tocl bromine tobr and iodine toi owing to its importance many agencies including the united states environmental protection agency methods 1650 9020b usepa 1997 the international standard organization method iso 9562 iso 2004 the american public health association method 5320b apha 1999 and the chinese environmental protection ministry methods gb t 15959 1995 gb t 1995 and hj t 83 2001 hj t 2001 have promulgated standard methods and procedures to measure aox these methods although issued in different countries and labelled with different names are identical in principle and always include three sequential steps 1 concentration and separation of aox from halides i e chloride bromide and iodide with activated carbon ac 2 conversion of adsorbed aox into halides via pyrolysis and 3 quantification of halides via microcoulometry or ion chromatography ic echigo et al 2000 hua and reckhow 2006 kristiana et al 2015 despite of its usefulness recognition and robustness the aox measurement method may have some drawbacks first is the relatively high cost for not only equipment but also consumable items the ac used for adsorption should contain as little halogen as possible to avoid background errors reckhow et al 2007 and specialized ac cartridges are required kimura et al 2017 second is the relatively low recovery for non adsorbable compounds due to the diversity and variability of dbps adsorbability symons et al 1996 weakly adsorbable or hydrophilic organic dbps may not be fully recovered with ac li et al 2011a meanwhile certain anions such as iodide and iodate if present at high concentrations in water might be adsorbed onto ac and interfere with the organic iodine measurement kristiana et al 2015 also it has been reported that ac as a reductive material might dehalogenate some oxidative halogenated dbps e g organic chloramines and thus pretreatment of ac e g slight oxidation of ac by ozone might be necessary to inhibit its reduction for aox li et al 2011b to avoid the drawbacks of the conventional aox method some efforts have been devoted to developing alternatives for tox analysis one typical example was the replacement of ac with xad resin for dbp adsorption the effort appeared unappealing because xad showed lower recovery of dbps than ac sjöström et al 1985 another example was the use of silver ag cartridge a cation exchanger pre loaded with silver ions to eliminate halides from water which is a common approach in pretreating salty water for ic analysis reckhow et al 2007 although the use of ag cartridges was capable of dropping halide concentration to a few micrograms per liter μg l the technique has not been progressed and no product has been commercialized since then moreover it is unknown if tox was well recovered with ag cartridges electrodialysis ed is an ion exchange membrane iem based process that applies electrical current to separate ions from water lee et al 2002 ed was used for desalination in the water supply industry amy et al 2017 suggesting that its application in removing ions is well proven however with rapid progress of the reverse osmosis technology ed has become less competitive due to cost concerns bernardes et al 2014 despite of this ed is still widely used in ultrapure water production and certain analytical chemistry areas such as eluent generation and suppression in ic operation pietrzyk and dicinoski 2006 rabin et al 1993 previously the authors have successfully applied ed to isolate dissolved organic nitrogen don from dissolved inorganic nitrogen species zhu et al 2015 thereby allowing more reliable detection of don du et al 2017 as for halogenated compounds according to an earlier literature those unknown organic halogens featured a molecular size range between 500 and 10 000 da hua and reckhow 2008 which is greater than the sizes of halides iodide has the highest mw 127 da among all halides now that most of organic halogens have apparent mw and charge distinctions from halides richardson 2010 ed may isolate the nonionic portion of tox ntox from halides too and therefore enable quantification of ntox in light of the above information we herein proposed a new three step approach to analyze ntox as follows 1 separation of ntox from halides via ed 2 conversion of ntox into halides via ultraviolet uv and 3 measurement of halides with ic the target tox was limited to the nonionic portion at the current stage because ed is known to elute ionized compounds although in the future it may be refined to retain ionic organic compounds to validate this proposal this study aimed to 1 assess ed s efficiency in the removal of halides and the recovery of model dbps under a variety of environmental and operational conditions 2 evaluate the recoveries of high mw ntox with ed and 3 compare the changes of quantity and property of organic matter by ed and ac during the process some mechanisms potentially responsible for the removal of halides and recovery of ntox were also discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and samples for inorganic halogens four reagent grade sodium halides were purchased from aladdin inc for organic halogens a total of 20 model dbp compounds with diverse mws 75 5 393 7 g mol and functional groups were selected including seven halomethanes hms six haloacetonitriles hans chloral hydrate ch namely trichloroacetaldehyde and six haloacetic acids haas they were purchased from sigma aldrich and aladdin inc these compounds were chosen as representatives because they are either ubiquitous in water or symbolic of emerging brominated or iodinated compounds the general properties of these inorganic and organic halogens are provided in tables s1 and s2 respectively prior to tests dbp stock solutions were prepared with ultrapure water direct q3 millipore france without using organic solvent to avoid interference with each other suwannee river natural organic matter srnom 2r101n was acquired from the international humic substances society to prepare for a simulated water in addition to synthetic waters containing model dbp compounds real water samples were collected in mid august of 2017 including a surface water from a pond on campus a tap water from the laboratory a swimming pool water and a wastewater from a sewage well disinfected wastewater samples were prepared by dosing sufficient sodium hypochlorite naocl into the wastewater sample and allowing reaction for 12 h samples were filtered with 0 45 μm nylon filters xingya co ltd china and quenched with sodium thiosulfate to eliminate chlorine residual the characteristics of these real samples are provided in table s3 in addition to model compounds the whole pictures of high mw polar halogenated dbps formed during chlorination of the simulated water sample were evaluated using a powerful precursor ion scan pis method with an electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometer esi tqms zhai and zhang 2011 the simulated drinking water sample contained 3 0 mg l srnom as c 90 mg l nahco3 as caco3 and 2 0 mg l kbr as br the relatively high bromide level was adopted to represent a typical concentration in source water affected by seawater intrusion at ambient temperature the simulated drinking water sample was chlorinated with 5 0 mg l naocl as cl2 for 2 h followed by quenching with sodium thiosulfate the chlorine dose was chosen according to the previous study zhai and zhang 2011 and the relatively high chlorine dose was intended to enable better observation of dbp formation wang et al 2016 2 2 electrodialysis reactor and procedures similar to an earlier study zhu et al 2015 the ed reactor consisted of two parallel cells each cell had three chambers which were separated by two iems with a surface membrane area of 54 cm2 the middle dilute chamber was 1 cm in width and it could hold 100 ml of water aluminum plates were used as the electrodes and placed in the concentrate chambers so that they would not contact or react with dbps in the dilute chamber unlike the earlier study that used sodium chloride nacl 0 1 m sodium bicarbonate nahco3 was used as electrolyte in this study to avoid potential penetration of halides into the sample in addition to maximize the halide concentration gradient across membranes the electrolyte was continuously refreshed at a flowrate of 5 ml min using a metering pump bt100 longer pump co ltd china the electric power was supplied by a direct current transformer mch 305dii meili co ltd the iems cmi 7000 and ami 7001 were purchased from membrane international inc usa and preconditioned for 24 h per the manufacturer s guidance the iem specifications such as the ion exchange capacity selectivity electric resistance thickness and ph resistivity range are provided in table s4 the schematic diagram of ed and potential reactions occurring in the ed reactor are presented in fig 1 in kinetics studies aliquots were retrieved at designated times in efficiency studies samples were analyzed only after the designated operation time 2 3 analytical methods the anions including fluoride chloride bromide iodide nitrate and sulfate were analyzed with an ic equipped with a conductivity detector a uv detector ic2010 tosoh inc japan an eluent generator edg 100 minghao chromatographic technology china an eluent suppressor wlk 6 reepo analytical instrument co ltd china and an as 15 column thermofisher usa the small mw model dbp compounds were detected with a gas chromatograph gc 9720 fuli inc china with an electron capture detector according to epa methods 551 1 usepa 1995 and 552 3 usepa 2003 dissolved organic carbon doc was determined with a shimadzu analyzer toc lcph according to epa method 415 3 potter and wimsatt 2012 ph was determined with a ph meter thermo fisher 8103bn for organic characteristics analyses the uv spectra of samples were analyzed with a uv visible spectrophotometer s 3100 scinco inc korea for quality assurance and control the relative standard deviations rsds of all analyzed parameters were below 10 otherwise tests were repeated meanwhile all tests were conducted at least in duplicate for the simulated drinking water sample aliquots with and without ed were analyzed with the pis method using an ab sciex qtrap 4500 mass spectrometer the details concerning the sample pretreatment prior to the pis analysis are given in the supplementary data because ion clusters may overlap during the ms analysis via direct infusion ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc was coupled with the mass spectrometer for pre separation to better observe the isotopic ion patterns of halogenated dbps the sample injection volume was 5 μl chromatographic separations of halogenated dbps were performed using a waters acquity uplc hss t3 column 100 mm 2 1 mm id 1 8 μm particle size the mobile phase consisted of water and methanol and the flow rate was set at 0 4 ml min the column temperature was maintained at 35 c the elution liquid was programed as follows the initial ratio of methanol was set at 5 and it linearly increased to 90 in 8 0 min then the methanol ratio returned to 5 in 0 1 min and maintained for another 2 9 min other optimal ms parameters included ion spray voltage 4500 v negative mode ion source gas i 55 arbitrary unit ion source gas ii 55 arbitrary unit curtain gas 40 arbitrary unit heater temperature 550 c declustering potential dp 30 v collision energy ce 30 v entrance potential ep 10 v and collision cell exit potential 10 v to compare the efficiency of ed and ac doc was measured after ed or ac pretreatment for three real samples the operation procedures of ac column generally followed an earlier study li et al 2011b in brief water samples were adjusted to ph 2 with concentrated nitric acid and then passed through two consecutively prepacked ac columns mitsubishi chemical analytech japan at a flow rate of 3 ml min the eluted water was collected for doc measurement subsequently the ac columns were rinsed by 10 ml of 5 g l kno3 to desorb halides the doc loss during the flushing process was also analyzed 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of ed in halide removal because halide removal is the prerequisite for ntox separation we firstly investigated the efficiency of ed on halide removal fig 2 a shows that it took less than 1 5 h for ed to remove 99 5 of all the four halide species 10 mg x l under this study s conditions although trace levels of halides remained as long as the concentrations of halides were not much greater than that of ntox e g 3 ntox was still calculated by subtracting halides from the final amount of total halogen tx without introducing significant analytical errors and similar calculation method has been applied for don analysis saunders et al 2017 the removal of halides followed pseudo first order kinetics by plotting logarithmic concentration logc versus time the rate constants were determined and ranked as follows fluoride 0 07 min 1 chloride 0 11 min 1 bromide 0 12 min 1 iodide 0 14 min 1 the positive relationship between the halide removal rate and the mw accorded with an earlier study in which fluoride was found to be more difficult to remove than other halides during the ed process likely because fluoride has the highest electro negativity and largest hydrated radius sata 2000 sata et al 1995 toshikatsu et al 1996 in the natural water the concentration of chloride varies widely from 2 5 to 500 mg l in terrestrial water snoeyink and jenkins 1980 and sometimes reaches up to 20 000 mg l in ocean water bromide in u s drinking water is usually below 3 mg l krasner et al 1989 but it reaches up to 65 mg l in sea water in contrast iodide in u s and canadian waters when detected ranges from 0 4 to 104 μg l richardson et al 2008 and in the ocean it is usually approximately 60 μg l because chloride is higher in concentration but lower in removal kinetics than bromide and iodide during the ed process we hereafter chose chloride as the representative of halides to simulate a harsh condition for halide removal fig 2b shows that the chloride removal rate generally decreased with increasing chloride concentration suggesting that samples with higher levels of halides require more time to eliminate halides similar to chloride other halides were dramatically removed even at elevated concentrations 99 9 as shown in fig s1 after 1 5 h of ed pretreatment proving that the ed process is reliable in reducing most of halides however regardless of the initial concentration the residual chloride after 90 min ed pretreatment was always at approximately 15 μg l the possible reason for the incomplete chloride removal was the difficulty in driving trace chloride through iem when ions were exhausted to support an electric current therefore a subtraction of the remaining halide from tx after ed appeared necessary to obtain the ntox content at current stage to understand the ion movement better fig s2 presents the variations of ph conductivity and alkalinity in three exemplary samples along the ed process it was observed that both conductivity and alkalinity decreased continuously along the process indicating that most of the ions permeated iems rapidly however the ph decreased first and then increased along the ed process suggesting that hydrogen ion h might somehow diffuse into the dilute chamber at the early stage due to its high diffusivity and then move out by electric current given that the acid dissociation coefficient pka of hydrofluoric acid hf is 3 18 table s2 the decreasing ph may increase the fraction of neutral form of fluoride i e hf thereby slowing down the penetration of fluoride during the ed process 3 2 performance of ed in recovering small mw compounds in addition to halide removal a reliable ntox analysis is highly dependent upon the organic compound recovery i e the fraction of compounds detected after ed relative to the amount before pretreatment fig 3 shows the recoveries of three groups of model dbps with ed pretreatment for 1 5 h the results indicated that the average recoveries were 85 6 89 9 and 92 2 for seven hms six hans and ch respectively which may satisfy common analytical requirements in contrast fig s3 shows that haas were not adequately recovered because of their ionic features suggesting that the ed cannot recover ionized species at the current stage under this study s condition to better understand the differences among nonionic dbps during the ed process fig s4 presents the correlation of their recoveries with three common physicochemical properties including mw an indicator of size henry s law constant hlc an indicator of volatility and the octanol water partitioning coefficient kow an indicator of adsorption capacity it was observed that most dbps tested were negatively correlated with their mws and kow but positively related with their hlc suggesting that the dbp losses during ed were mainly attributed to adsorption instead of volatilization other than trichloroacetonitrile tcan most hans showed higher recoveries than other types of dbps the reason of relatively low tcan recovery was probably attributed to its instability under acidic condition glezer et al 1999 which was evidenced by the detection of its hydrolysis product trichloroacetamide reckhow et al 2001 in this study in summary it may indicate that the recovery of dbps is determined by multiple factors 3 3 performance of ed for synthetic water similar to the conventional aox method the proposed ntox method may also be subject to interferences from high level halides to explore ed s applicability we herein tested a series of synthetic waters containing both halides and dbps ch and chloride were chosen as the representatives of ntox and halides respectively due to their proven performances as described above fig 4 a presents the ntox recovery and chloride removal for samples with a fixed ch content i e 50 μg cl l yet varying chloride contents i e 3 to 100 of the ch concentration it was found that ed consistently recovered 91 1 of ch and meanwhile removed 98 5 of chloride suggesting that the recovery of ch was independent of the halide concentrations under this study s conditions meanwhile fig 4b shows consistent recoveries of ch at varying concentrations i e 20 50 100 500 and 1000 μg cl l with a fixed halide ntox ratio 30 1 and a well calibrated curve with r2 as 0 9989 was obtained it should be noted that many real samples may have higher halide ntox ratios i e 100 than that used in this study if so multiple rounds of ed treatment are perhaps needed to reduce halides to trace levels contrast to an earlier study zhu et al 2015 this study achieved relatively constant recovery of ntox regardless of halide levels the reason is likely partially ascribed to the specialty of the selected model compound and partially due to the competition between ions and the model compound for ion exchanging sites in iem kim et al 2003 since one earlier study pointed out that only when salt was nearly depleted might dom be transported as a charge carrier to permeate through iem vanoppen et al 2015 increasing the concentration of ions should reasonably not impact the organic compound recovery significantly 3 4 performance of ed for real water in this section ed was used as a pretreatment to measure ntox in real tap water in the raw tap water three typical dbps i e trichloromethane bromodichloromethane and ch were detected before ed and their recoveries after ed ranged from 81 0 to 86 4 fig s5 meanwhile four anions i e fluoride chloride sulfate and nitrate were detected in the raw tap water and their removals reached 99 2 after ed for the same tap water spiked with ten model dbps three of them were detected in the raw tap water 75 8 recoveries were obtained regardless of their types and spiking concentrations i e 10 20 40 60 and 80 μg l and r2 values were 0 99 for their calibration curves table 1 this result supported that the ed efficiently recovered these compounds from synthetic water as well as from real water 3 5 performance of ed in recovering high mw compounds because the abovementioned low mw model dbps may not be fully representative of other unevaluated dbps especially for high mw compounds the efficiency of ed for high mw compounds should be evaluated in addition because a significant portion of dbps in water are high in mw e g 1000 da zhai and zhang 2009 wang et al 2016 it is important to know if the proposed ed method is amenable to high mw dbps by conducting piss of bromide at m z 79 and 81 with uplc esi tqms high mw polar brominated dbps formed in the simulated drinking water sample with and without ed treatment were selectively detected pis spectra shown in fig 5 present the pictures of polar brominated dbps during the entire range of retention time rt i e 0 11 min meanwhile to observe the isotopic abundance ratios of typical brominated dbps in the samples the pis spectra obtained for specific rt ranges are shown in fig s6 as shown in fig 5a and b many brominated dbps were produced in the chlorinated drinking water sample including ion clusters m z 171 173 175 193 195 215 217 219 277 279 281 293 295 297 319 321 323 325 and 327 329 331 333 these ion clusters corresponded to frequently detected dbps i e bromochloroacetic acid 2 bromobutenedioic acid dibromoacetic acid 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid 2 dibromo chloro methyl but 2 enedioic acid and 2 4 6 tribromophenol respectively in drinking water samples according to previous studies zhai and zhang 2011 pan and zhang 2013 zhang et al 2008 other major ion clusters e g 305 307 309 355 357 359 361 and 369 371 373 375 corresponded to new or currently unknown brominated dbps table s5 the pis spectra of m z 79 and 81 of the chlorinated drinking water sample after ed are shown in fig 5c and d respectively with fixed instrument parameters the total ion intensity tii the sum of ion intensities within the m z range of 100 500 of a pis m z 79 spectrum was used to indicate the total amount of polar brominated dbps jiang et al 2017 compared with the chlorinated drinking water sample without ed the tii value of the sample with ed was reduced by 16 4 indicating that approximately 83 6 of all polar brominated dbps were retained during ed similarly high mw chlorinated species were recovered by 79 7 fig s7 table s5 lists the intensity changes of representative ion clusters which indicated that the intensities of individual dbps with ed were 63 1 119 6 of those in the sample without ed specifically for one example the emerging dbp 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid or 3 5 dibromo salicylic acid showed 100 6 recovery in ion intensity after ed treatment hence the recoveries of overall dbps and individual dbps both supported that ed recovered polar ntox at acceptable levels 3 6 comparison of pretreatment methods in order to compare the proposed and conventional methods both ntox and aox should be measured however because ntox and aox apply different types of organic halogen conversion methods which might introduce varying analytical errors and uncertainties into the comparison we herein compared the doc contents in three real waters before and after either ed or ac pretreatment it has been reported that dbps with mw ranging from 500 to 10 000 da accounted for 50 of dbps detected in chlorinated drinking water zhang and minear 2002 which matched well with another study that approximately half of dom fell into the mw scope 10 000 da andersen et al 2000 therefore the assumption appears reasonable that good performance in recovering dom may imply the effectiveness of recovering dbps fig 6 shows that 29 3 52 4 of doc in selected waters were recovered by ac cartridges in comparison the doc recovered with ed for swimming pool water and tap waters were 60 8 meaning that ed recovered more doc than ac did when a flushing process was conducted more doc 6 6 15 4 was eluted out from the ac cartridges that is to say more doc was lost during flushing the ac materials there were no studies available specifically comparing doc removals between ed and ac however some studies have reported that granular ac can remove 20 50 doc from drinking water jiang et al 2017 chowdhury et al 2013 the results of doc adsorption by ac in this study fell in the range although the doc recovery was not necessarily equal to the recovery of organic halogen the results may indicate that the ed process is robust in retaining most of dom in water in addition to the quantity the potential alteration of dom quality is another concern about the use of ed especially if the water sample is used for subsequent characterization fig s8a in the supplementary data shows that the uv spectra of three real samples before and after ed pretreatment were almost unaltered meanwhile fig s8b in the supplementary data shows that the doc contents did not change significantly either 20 on average for these samples hence they together provided evidence that ed did not alter dom quality and quantity significantly after ed pretreatment the remaining dom might be used for other research purposes if they are not used for ntox analysis 4 conclusions overall this study evaluated the efficiency of ed as a pretreatment tool for separating halides and ntox under this study s conditions the ed reactor achieved at least 98 5 removal of halides for all samples tested and on average 87 9 recoveries for 14 small mw model dbp compounds for real samples spiked with dbps excellent correlation curves were obtained with r2 0 99 with the aid of uplc esi tqms analyses the recoveries of overall high mw chlorinated and brominated compounds by ed were 79 7 and 83 6 respectively for real samples ed showed better doc recovery than ac and did not change the uv spectra significantly suggesting that the remaining organic matter might be used for further characterization or other purposes such information hence demonstrates the novel use of ed which is a mature technology for water treatment as a new method in the environmental analytical chemistry area of all issues the key challenge of using ed for this method is to maximize and optimize the recovery of organic halogen although this study demonstrates several successful cases the proposed method still needs verification by analyzing more and various types of dbps and samples once halides and ntox are separated the determination of ntox will rely on a complete conversion of ntox into halides as well as an accurate quantification of halides subsequently it is necessary to compare the proposed ntox method i e a combination of ed uv ic in sequence with the conventional aox method i e a combination of ac pyrolysis ic in sequence for a series of waters in the coming studies we are also going to further improve the removal rates and extents of halides from water to allow direct ntox analysis i e without subtraction of halides from tx to further reduce ntox loss by optimizing iem and operating conditions and to design or refine the ed unit so that the system can retain not only nonionic but also ionic dbps in addition the toxicity of waters with and without ed treatment may also be compared to justify this method acknowledgements we appreciate the financial support from the shenzhen science technology innovation

19333,we demonstrate a hydrogel bowl capable of selectively and rapidly collecting spilled oil while floating on water the bowl has macroscopic openings in its sidewall and its surface is first coated with octadecyltrichlorosilane ots and then with diffusion pump oil which imparts exceptional hydrophobic oleophilic and high oil wettability properties the use of a hydrogel makes it possible to obtain surface hydrophobicity and oleophilicity while also being inexpensive eco friendly and easy to fabricate using a prototype of the bowl and a small pump system we demonstrate that oils with a broad range of viscosities 2 7 2000 0 cst at 20 40 c are more rapidly and efficiently collected from the surface of both pure water and seawater than with any other reported technique the hydrogel bowl can collect oil for more than one month without losing its efficiency and can be stored in oil for reuse therefore such hydrogel bowls represent a new alternative to conventional oil spill remediation techniques graphical abstract image 1 keywords oil spills hydrogel bowl macroscopic openings hydrophobicity oleophilicity oil wettability 1 introduction water pollution caused by oil spills causes widespread damage to ecosystems and ultimately threatens human life whitfield 2003 as an example of a serious oil spill incident the macondo blowout in the gulf of mexico spilled more than 600 million l of oil and cost 14 billion in cleanup efforts over a three year period hartogs 2013 sorbent materials choi and cloud 1992 dispersants kujawinski et al 2011 and skimmers broje and keller 2006 were used with booms wong and barin 2003 to remove the spilled oils however due to the poor efficiency of these techniques in cleaning and recycling the spilled oils the cleanup was both slow and expensive in fact similarly inefficient oil cleanup techniques are still being used today thus a new and inexpensive technology for the rapid cleanup of spilled oil is sorely needed recently various materials and techniques for selective oil collection have been developed to increase the efficiency of cleaning spilled oils for instance sponges ge et al 2017 ruan et al 2014 bi et al 2013 gui et al 2010 that have a three dimensional porous structure with super hydrophobic and oleophilic properties can selectively absorb oil spilled on water membranes and meshes with similar properties tenjimbayashi et al 2016 yuan et al 2008 feng et al 2004 zhu et al 2017 enable oil collection as filters that pass oil but block water small buoyant devices qiu et al 2017 kim et al 2016 wang et al 2014 cheng et al 2011 that collect oil spilled on water have also been developed the bodies of these devices are fabricated using hydrophobic and oleophilic meshes such as stainless steel mesh coated with nanofibers qiu et al 2017 copper mesh coated with graphene foam kim et al 2016 copper oxide mesh wang et al 2014 and nickel mesh coated with a self assembled monolayer sam of n dodecanethiol cheng et al 2011 microscale pores in such sponges membranes and meshes are able to collect oil by capillarity while rejecting water thereby allowing selective oil retention however the collection rates of these materials for high viscosity oils are low since the oils must flow through fine pores in addition difficulties in increasing the size of the devices at low cost restrict their application in actual oil spill incidents to overcome these limitations we propose the fabrication of hydrogel bowls with characteristics of collecting oil on water it has macroscopic openings in its sidewall and its surface has hydrophobic oleophilic and has high oil wettability properties fig 1 a and b which selectively allow oils with a wide range of viscosity to flow easily through the openings while preventing the inflow of water compared with other materials such as plastics hydrogels are green materials that consist mainly of water and a small amount of hydrophilic polymers lee and mooney 2001 and are easily shaped at room temperature mredha et al 2017 yu et al 2016 nakajima et al 2010 with lower cost and energy requirements additionally hydrogel surfaces with good hydrophobic and oleophilic properties are easily obtained using a variety of coating materials and techniques oliveira et al 2016 horecha et al 2013 sidorenko et al 2008 therefore hydrogels are an ideal material for fabricating oil cleaning bowls the fabrication process of such hydrogel bowls is shown in fig 1c f 2 materials and methods 2 1 geometric design of the hydrogel bowl taking in consideration the buoyancy and stability of the hydrogel bowl when floating on water several geometric design parameters of a hydrogel bowl prototype were predetermined as follows a bowl diameter of 50 mm a bowl height of 15 5 mm four slot type openings of length l 2 mm and radius r 2 5 mm fig 1b a thickness of the top edge of 2 mm a height difference between the top edge and the water surface of 7 mm and a volume of collected oil in the bowl of 9 ml fig s1 when the hydrogel bowl floats on water the buoyancy f b and weight of the bowl w h b are balanced as follows 1 f b ρ w g v s 2 w h b ρ h b g v h b 3 w h b f b where g 9 81 m s 2 is the acceleration of gravity ρ w 0 997 10 6 kg mm 3 is the density of water and ρ h b 0 134 10 5 kg mm 3 is the density of the bowl material v s and v h b are the volumes of the submerged portion of the bowl and the hydrogel in the bowl respectively by arbitrarily setting the external surface shape of the bowl based on the determined design parameters v s can be calculated between the bottom of the bowl and the water surface and then f b can be calculated using eq 1 by setting the internal surface shape of the bowl v h b can be calculated and then w h b can be calculated using eq 2 the final shape of the bowl can be obtained when the computed f b and w h b coincide with each other eq 3 and the volume inside the bowl approaches 9 ml while repeatedly adjusting the outer and inner surface shapes of the bowl fig s1 determination of the external and internal surface shape of the bowl and calculation of the volumes v s and v h b were carried out using commercial software cero parametric 3d modeling software ptc usa 2 2 fabrication of the mold for the hydrogel bowl based on the geometric design of the hydrogel bowl prototype the mold for fabricating the hydrogel bowl was designed using commercial software cero parametric 3d modeling software ptc usa the mold consists of two parts an upper part with four extrusion features which forms the inner surface and four openings of the bowl and a lower part which forms the outer surface of the bowl the designs of these parts as shown in fig s2a were exported into stereo lithography stl format files the mold was then fabricated following the stl file using a 3d printer object30 pro v20 object ltd israel with verowhite material fig s2b 2 3 preparation of the hydrogel bowl acrylamide 1 708 g and n n methylenebisacrylamide mbaa 0 001 g were dissolved in 6 4 ml of water thereafter 30 μl of ammonium persulfate aps aq solution 0 375 g ml and 15 μl of n n n n tetramethylethylenediamine temed were added to the solution and poured into the mold for polymerization at room temperature 25 c after 2 h the mold was opened to give a hydrogel bowl figs 1c d and 2 a a scanning electron microscopy sem image of its surface which is very nearly featureless is shown in fig 2b 2 4 hydrophobic coating on the hydrogel surface to obtain a hydrophobic surface the hydrogel bowl was coated with octadecyltrichlorosilane ots which has long hydrophobic alkyl chains although ots is widely used to prepare hydrophobic surfaces on various types of solid materials yilbas et al 2016 ke et al 2010 wang and lieberman 2003 it has not yet been applied to high water content materials such as hydrogels in the presence of trace amounts of water ots self polymerizes to create a mono to multilayer coating through heterogeneous nucleation wang and lieberman 2003 since the polyacrylamide paam hydrogel is a water containing material ots is readily polymerized and deposited on the surface of the bowl fig 1b to apply a hydrophobic coating on the hydrogel surface the surface of the as prepared hydrogel bowl was first washed with n pentane and dried in air for 2 min then the hydrogel was dipped into 100 ml of an ots n pentane solution at a concentration of 10 μl ml for 2 h fig 1e gradually the ots was deposited on the hydrogel surface as reflected by the hydrogel turning white in color fig 2c during the deposition process the solution was shaken frequently so that the entire gel surface was evenly exposed to the ots solution after 2 h the surface of the ots coated hydrogel bowl was dried in an oven at 55 c for 2 min sem imaging showed that applying the ots coating resulted in a very rough surface fig 2d fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir was used to determine that the hydrogel surface was completely coated with ots fig s3 2 5 force equilibrium and moment effects around openings the most interesting aspect of the hydrogel bowl for selective oil collection is the adoption of the macroscopic openings which have a cross sectional area of 10 90 mm2 fig 3 a shows the forces from the water and the atmosphere around an opening in the vertical wall note that the weight of the protruding water is ignored for simplicity in general both water and oil can flow through macroscopic openings in a material but in the case of water if the normal directional forces from the surface tension at the opening f γ c o s θ plus atmospheric pressure f a p are well balanced with the force of the water pressure f w p along the same direction the water flowing through the opening will be blocked fig 3a in contrast the low surface tension of the oil induces a small force component along the normal direction f o γ c o s θ so that the force and the normal directional force from atmospheric pressure f a p cannot maintain equilibrium with the normal directional force from the oil pressure f o p fig 3b therefore oil flows through the opening fig 3c and d shows an opening in the curved sidewalls of the bowl and the forces and moments from the water and the atmosphere around the opening specifically fig 3c and d shows the case of water on the outside and inside of the bowl respectively if the water flow is blocked by the opening the vertical and horizontal components of the forces caused by water pressure f w p atmospheric pressure f a p and the surface tension of the water f γ will be in equilibrium in these cases however resultant moments m r are generated by each force component if the moment center is placed at the center of gravity of the water protruding through the opening the resultant moments can be calculated from the sum of the products of the magnitude of each force and the perpendicular distances between the forces and the moment center therefore the equation of the resultant moment is 4 m r f γ c o s θ 1 r 1 f γ s i n θ 1 d 1 f γ c o s θ 2 r 2 f γ s i n θ 2 d 2 where d 1 d 2 r 1 and r 2 are the perpendicular distances from the moment center to each force the values of d 1 and d 2 are relatively small compared with r 1 and r 2 and the magnitudes of r 1 and r 2 are similar to each other therefore the most dominant term to determine the magnitude and direction of the moment is f γ c o s θ 1 r 1 in fig 3c and f γ c o s θ 2 r 2 in fig 3d when the water flow is blocked they must also remain in equilibrium m r 0 if the surface of the sidewall has high hydrophobicity f γ c o s θ 1 fig 3c and f γ c o s θ 2 fig 3d increase and their corresponding resultant moments increase in opposite directions these increased moments in different directions play an important role in preventing water from flowing into the bowl fig 3c and helping the water in the bowl to flow out through the openings thereby disrupting the moment equilibrium fig 3d 2 6 design of the shape and size of the openings to determine the size l and r of the slot type opening fig 1b that can block water flow the equilibrium between the increment of work d w from the pressure difference and the increased volume of the water protruding through an opening with an increment of surface energy d e s of the increased protruding water surface is given as follows 5 d w d e s the increment of work d w can be described as 6 d w δ p d v where δ p is the pressure difference between the water and the atmosphere and d v is the increment of volume of the water protruding through an opening 7 δ p p w a t e r p a t m ρ w g h 8 d v π 2 r 2 r l d r where ρ w is the density of water g is the acceleration of gravity h r l is the height of the water surface from the center of the cross section of the opening and l is the height from the upper edge of the opening to the water surface then d w becomes 9 d w ρ w g h π 2 r 2 r l d r the increment of the surface energy is given as 10 d e s γ d a where γ 71 99 10 6 n mm is the surface tension of water and d a is the increment of the surface area of the protruding water determined as follows 11 d a π 4 r l d r then d e s can be written as 12 d e s γ π 4 r l d r on the basis of eqs 5 9 and 12 the equation for designing the shape of the opening in terms of r for a chosen l can be obtained as follows 13 2 ρ w g r 3 2 ρ w g l ρ w g l r 2 ρ w g l l 4 γ r γ l 0 for each arbitrarily chosen l value the radius r 0 that satisfies eq 13 is found these data are plotted in fig 4 here l 1 5 mm was selected considering the height of the water surface outside the hydrogel bowl when placed on water and the position of its opening the surface properties of the material are irrelevant to eq 13 so the shape of an opening that can block water flow can be designed using a radius less than r 0 for any chosen l 3 results and discussion to check the surface properties of the ots coated hydrogel a disc shaped ots coated hydrogel sample was prepared using the same composition recipe as the hydrogel bowl fig s4a then a water droplet was dropped onto the flat top surface of the disc and the contact angle between the droplet and the surface was measured fig s4b the measured contact angle of the water droplet on the surface was 138 16 suggesting that the surface was highly hydrophobic crick and parkin 2011 the oleophilicity of the surface was also evaluated by dropping an oil droplet diffusion pump oil on the sample surface the fact that the droplet spread on the surface demonstrated its oleophilic nature while the shape of the oil droplet indicated relatively low wettability of the hydrogel surface fig s4c to test the water and oil flow through the openings with different surface properties small boxes of 25 mm 25 mm 18 mm in size with different surface properties were prepared a polyacrylamide paam hydrogel box with a hydrophilic surface fig 5 a a polydimethylsiloxane pdms box with a low hydrophobicity surface fig 5b and a paam hydrogel box with a high hydrophobicity surface obtained by coating with ots fig 5c were fabricated by applying the same molding and coating process that were used to fabricate the hydrogel bowl the surface properties of the paam hydrogel box and the pdms box were confirmed by test dropping a water droplet fig 5a and b the contact angles of the water droplet on the paam gel hydrophilic surface and pdms low hydrophobic surface were 36 75 and 104 49 respectively crick and parkin 2011 these boxes each had a slot type opening l 2 mm and r 2 5 mm on their vertical sidewall here r was selected to be smaller than r o 2 91 mm which corresponds to l 2 mm and l 1 5 mm was selected the test results showed that water did not flow out through the opening regardless of the surface property of each box fig 5a c however poured oil at the same height as the water inside the box easily flowed out through the opening due to the oleophilic surface property and low oil surface tension fig 5d to explore the sizes of the openings that can block or allow water flow ots coated paam hydrogel boxes 25 mm 25 mm 18 mm were fabricated with differently sized openings to maintain a consistent water height in the boxes l was set as 1 5 mm which was used to calculate the radius r o fig 4 four different values of l 0 for a circular opening 2 10 and 15 mm were selected for the openings for each value of l two different values of r were selected after comparing with the calculated r o values 3 16 2 91 2 47 and 2 36 mm respectively from eq 13 for l 0 mm and l 2 mm the two different values selected for r were 2 5 mm and 3 mm experiments indicated that the water flow was blocked by the l 0 mm r 2 5 mm fig 4 and l 2 mm r 2 5 mm openings figs 4 and 6 a however water could easily flow out through the l 0 mm r 3 mm fig 4 and l 2 mm r 3 mm openings figs 4 and 6b for l 10 mm the two selected values of r were 2 mm and 2 5 mm the l 10 mm r 2 mm opening blocked the water flow fig 4 whereas the l 10 mm r 2 5 mm opening did not block the water flow fig 4 for l 15 mm r values of 1 5 mm and 2 25 mm were selected the water flow was blocked by the l 15 mm r 1 5 mm opening figs 4 and 6c whereas the l 15 mm r 2 25 mm opening did not block the water flow figs 4 and 6d these results confirmed that water flows out through openings in the vertical sidewall with radii similar to or greater than r o but it does not flow out through openings with radii smaller than r o to confirm the water and oil flow through the openings in the curved sidewall of the hydrogel bowl two types of hydrogel boxes were fabricated with highly hydrophobic surfaces and the same curved sidewall as the hydrogel bowl the hydrogel boxes shown in fig 7 a and b were used for testing the possibility of water flowing into and out of the hydrogel bowl respectively these hydrogel boxes both had a slot type opening with l 2 mm and r 2 5 mm which blocked water flow from the vertical sidewall at l 1 5 mm figs 4 and 6a the experiments revealed that water did not flow out of the box shown in fig 7a however water flowed easily out of the box shown in fig 7b these results show the effect of the resultant moments m r eq 4 which can both block water flow into the bowl through the opening fig 7a and help the water inside of the bowl to flow out fig 7b to test the possibility of oil flow into the hydrogel bowl the box that blocked the water flow was used fig 7a the result showed that the oil could flow through the opening easily when the level of the oil inside the box was higher than the lower edge of the opening fig 7c to check the flow of oil through the openings of the hydrogel bowl an ots coated bowl was floated on water covered with a 4 8 mm thick layer of diffusion pump oil neovac sx matsumura co ltd japan 22 0 cst at 40 c which has a viscosity similar to that of medium crude oil 8 35 cst at 40 c jones 2010 al besharah et al 1987 fig s5a c it was observed that the oil did not flow spontaneously through the openings even after 5 h fig s5c the flow of oil was prevented because of the low oil pressure p o i l fig 1b caused by the thin thickness of the oil layer and relatively low oil wettability of the bowl surface fig s4c and large roughness of the inner surfaces of the openings fig 2d after coating with ots this problem was solved by increasing the oil wettability of the bowl surface for this the ots coated hydrogel bowl was dipped in diffusion pump oil for 2 h fig 1f after removal from the oil the bowl was carefully wiped with tissue paper to absorb any excess oil remaining on its surface fig 2e this treatment created a surface that was both uneven on account of the ots treatment and smooth because the ots surface topography was covered with oil fig 2f the surface roughness of the ots coated hydrogel was reduced by the oil treatment with the treatment the high hydrophobicity of the ots coated surface was reduced to a lower hydrophobicity because of the decreased roughness of the bowl surface to confirm this a disc shaped hydrogel sample that had already been coated with ots was dipped in diffusion pump oil for 2 h the gel was then removed and all excess oil on its surface was carefully cleaned using tissue paper fig s6a a water droplet was placed on the sample surface and the contact angle between the droplet and the surface was measured the measured contact angle was reduced to 117 76 from 138 16 for the ots coated hydrogel figs s6b and s4b which indirectly suggested that the high hydrophobicity of the surface was decreased the oleophilic property of the ots coated surface after the oil treatment was also examined by placing an oil droplet on the surface the surface was found to be perfectly wetted by the oil droplet fig s6c this means that the oleophilic property of the ots coated surface did not change after the oil treatment and the oil wettability was greatly increased after the oil treatment the effectiveness of a prototype hydrogel bowl was evaluated again the bowl floated easily on water and did not sink even under wavy conditions furthermore water did not flow into the bowl through the openings in its sidewalls see supplementary material movie s1 but water inside the bowl easily flowed out see supplementary material movie s2 by comparison a hydrogel bowl without the ots coating and oil treatment sank quickly as water quickly flowed into the bowl through its openings see supplementary material movie s3 supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j watres 2018 09 012 the following are the supplementary data related to this article movie 1 2 movie 1 movie 2 3 movie 2 movie 3 4 movie 3 movie 4 5 movie 4 movie 5 6 movie 5 movie 6 7 movie 6 movie 7 8 movie 7 movie 8 9 movie 8 movie 9 10 movie 9 to evaluate oil flow through the hydrogel bowl openings after the oil treatment 50 ml of diffusion pump oil was poured into a water filled beaker forming a layer on the water surface and the hydrogel bowl was placed on top of the water to start the openings of the hydrogel bowl were positioned in the oil layer oil flowed into the bowl through the openings as soon as the hydrogel bowl was allowed to float fig 8 a as the amount of oil collected in the hydrogel bowl increased the bowl sank deeper into the water lowering the position of the openings in the oil layer thus the pressure difference between the oil layer and the atmosphere δ p o i l p o i l p a t m increased and the oil flowed into the bowl more easily fig 1b once the oil was collected in the bowl it could be held stably even under wavy conditions the collected oil was kept securely within the bowl without any change in volume and water did not enter the bowl through the openings see supplementary material movie s4 to evaluate the continuous oil collecting ability of the hydrogel bowl the collected oil was retrieved using a small pumping system and placed in a graduated cylinder see supplementary material movie s5 during this process the oil outside the bowl continuously flowed into the bowl due to the pressure difference even for very thin layers of oil fig 8b when the oil outside the bowl disappeared completely oil collection stopped fig 8c shows that the oil on the water was completely removed using the bowl the retrieved oil was pure no water layer was observed even after several hours it was found that even if water enters the hydrogel bowl over its top edge due to severe wavy conditions it flows out easily through the openings thus only pure oil is retrieved the volume of the retrieved oil and the oil retrieval rate were measured using a real time movie for comparison two additional bowls with different opening sizes l 4 mm r 1 5 mm and l 11 mm r 1 5 mm where the r values are smaller than r o for each l value were fabricated fig s7a c these bowls collected diffusion pump oil from water in the same manner as described above and the retrieved oil volumes and retrieval rates were measured to determine a favorable opening size of the hydrogel bowl for efficient oil cleaning for each bowl approximately 46 ml out of 50 ml of the oil could be collected into the graduated cylinder from a 125 cm2 surface area of water the remaining oil was either attached to the bottom surface of the bowl or remained within the bowl and pump system figs s8a and b no measurable quantity of oil remained in the water it was observed that less oil was collected as the thickness of the oil layer around the bowl decreased when only a small amount of oil was collected in the bowl the pump drew both oil and air reducing its efficiency therefore after retrieving the first 40 ml of oil a relatively long time was required to retrieve the remaining small amount of oil among the various bowls used in the measurements the bowl with the l 2 mm r 2 5 mm opening which has the largest hydraulic diameter d h 6 01 mm for the highest oil flow rate took the shortest time 48 s to retrieve 40 ml of oil and the retrieval rate for the initial 20 ml of oil was the fastest at 120 ml min fig 9 a and b to check the cleaning capacity of the bowl for oils of different viscosities kerosene which has a low viscosity 2 7 cst at 20 c and a high vacuum pump oil vactor hv 100 chemteco co ltd korea 90 0 cst at 40 c which has a viscosity in the range generally observed for heavy crude oil 70 1500 cst at 40 c ge et al 2017 jones 2010 al besharah et al 1987 were also used oil collection experiments using the kerosene and high vacuum pump oil similar to those using the diffusion pump oil were performed the time to retrieve 40 ml of kerosene 24 s was much shorter than the time for diffusion pump oil 48 s and high vacuum pump oil 173 s and the retrieval rate of the initial 20 ml of kerosene was the fastest at 150 ml min fig 9c and d see supplementary material movie s6 clearly oils with higher viscosity were more difficult to retrieve our results show that the hydrogel bowl can dramatically decrease the retrieval time of low viscosity oils compared with recently developed devices for example the graphene vessel took more than 70 s to retrieve 40 ml of kerosene kim et al 2016 whereas copper mesh devices took 120 s to retrieve 8 4 ml of toluene 0 68 cst at 20 c wang et al 2014 most importantly our hydrogel bowl enabled very efficient retrieval of high viscosity oils without any external energy inputs see supplementary material movie s7 an additional experiment using silicone oil kf 96 2000cs shin etsu chemical co ltd japan 2000 0 cst at 25 c was conducted to evaluate the possibility of retrieving heavy crude oil with very high viscosity approximately 27 ml out of 50 ml of silicone oil could be retrieved in 5 min see supplementary material movie s8 previously there had been almost no success in collecting high viscosity oils except by a recently developed joule heated graphene wrapped sponge ge et al 2017 this device however required significant energy input to retrieve 4 ml of viscous crude oil in 40 s both the hydrophobic coating and the oil treatment on the surface of the hydrogel bowl provide great advantages for long term use and storage generally hydrogels easily change their shape and properties upon evaporation or absorption of water previously this meant that it was not possible to use a device made of hydrogels over a long period of time however applying the double surface treatment i e ots and oil fig 2f has a synergistic effect that results in a dramatic reduction in water evaporation and absorption of the hydrogel during oil collection therefore hydrogels treated in this manner could be used over a long period of time without changes to their shape and property to evaluate the long term usability of the hydrogel bowl three bowls collecting three different types of oil on pure water were weighed daily for one week the weight of the bowl collecting kerosene decreased the most 5 68 reduction after one week compared with the weights of the bowls collecting the other oils 5 48 for the diffusion pump oil and 3 85 for the high vacuum pump oil fig 9e notably the weight loss 5 63 of the hydrogel bowl collecting diffusion pump oil on the surface of a seawater like aqueous solution 300 ml water with 3 5 wt nacl over the course of one week was almost identical to that of the bowl collecting this oil on pure water fig 9f this result demonstrates the potential for using these hydrogel bowls to clean oil spills from seawater while collecting the oils the surfaces of the ots coated bowls were always covered with oil blocking absorption or evaporation of water the shapes of the bowls did not change after one week fig s9a h even after one month there was no significant change in the bowl shape and it was still capable of collecting oil fig s9i to demonstrate the scalability of the hydrogel bowl for practical oil retrieval applications a large hydrogel bowl of 100 mm in diameter and 30 mm in height containing eight openings l 2 mm r 2 5 mm on its sidewall was fabricated based on the hydrogel molding process figs s10a and b the efficiency of the large hydrogel bowl was tested the bowl which could collect oil very efficiently floated easily on water 600 ml covered with an oil layer 50 ml diffusion pump oil it took only 23 s to collect all of the oil on the water which could easily be retrieved using a pump see supplementary material movie s9 in this experiment most of the oil 40 ml 80 was retrieved owing to the larger size of the bowl the amount of oil attached to the surface of the bowl also increased slightly therefore the volume of oil retrieved was slightly less than that of the prototype hydrogel bowl 46 ml 92 the long term preservation of the hydrogel bowl was also verified fig s11a d the dimensions of the bowl after preservation in diffusion pump oil for two months were reduced by only 2 24 in its diameter however the shape of the bowl changed considerably in air and water after one week the bowl dried out quickly in air whereas it absorbed water when immersed in water these results suggest that the hydrogel bowls can be preserved in oil for long periods 4 conclusion oil spills in aquatic environments must be removed quickly to prevent widespread contamination and deleterious effects and the economic loss involved in the cleanup process must be low so far the development of a device that can clean oil spills with high efficiency and low economic loss has been a very challenging problem our results show that a hydrogel bowl with an engineered surface can selectively and quickly collect spilled oil the low cost of its fabrication and the recyclability of the retrieved oil may substantially reduce economic loss in fact it is possible to fabricate many large hydrogel bowls through replication based on the hydrogel molding process if a large scale oil spill occurs many large bowls can be fabricated within a short period of time and deployed quickly to retrieve the spilled oil it is also possible to prepare hydrogel bowls in advance and preserve them in oil for a long period of time so they can be used immediately when needed overall these hydrogel bowls represent a new design strategy for the speedy and economical cleanup of oil spills acknowledgments this work was supported by the

19333,we demonstrate a hydrogel bowl capable of selectively and rapidly collecting spilled oil while floating on water the bowl has macroscopic openings in its sidewall and its surface is first coated with octadecyltrichlorosilane ots and then with diffusion pump oil which imparts exceptional hydrophobic oleophilic and high oil wettability properties the use of a hydrogel makes it possible to obtain surface hydrophobicity and oleophilicity while also being inexpensive eco friendly and easy to fabricate using a prototype of the bowl and a small pump system we demonstrate that oils with a broad range of viscosities 2 7 2000 0 cst at 20 40 c are more rapidly and efficiently collected from the surface of both pure water and seawater than with any other reported technique the hydrogel bowl can collect oil for more than one month without losing its efficiency and can be stored in oil for reuse therefore such hydrogel bowls represent a new alternative to conventional oil spill remediation techniques graphical abstract image 1 keywords oil spills hydrogel bowl macroscopic openings hydrophobicity oleophilicity oil wettability 1 introduction water pollution caused by oil spills causes widespread damage to ecosystems and ultimately threatens human life whitfield 2003 as an example of a serious oil spill incident the macondo blowout in the gulf of mexico spilled more than 600 million l of oil and cost 14 billion in cleanup efforts over a three year period hartogs 2013 sorbent materials choi and cloud 1992 dispersants kujawinski et al 2011 and skimmers broje and keller 2006 were used with booms wong and barin 2003 to remove the spilled oils however due to the poor efficiency of these techniques in cleaning and recycling the spilled oils the cleanup was both slow and expensive in fact similarly inefficient oil cleanup techniques are still being used today thus a new and inexpensive technology for the rapid cleanup of spilled oil is sorely needed recently various materials and techniques for selective oil collection have been developed to increase the efficiency of cleaning spilled oils for instance sponges ge et al 2017 ruan et al 2014 bi et al 2013 gui et al 2010 that have a three dimensional porous structure with super hydrophobic and oleophilic properties can selectively absorb oil spilled on water membranes and meshes with similar properties tenjimbayashi et al 2016 yuan et al 2008 feng et al 2004 zhu et al 2017 enable oil collection as filters that pass oil but block water small buoyant devices qiu et al 2017 kim et al 2016 wang et al 2014 cheng et al 2011 that collect oil spilled on water have also been developed the bodies of these devices are fabricated using hydrophobic and oleophilic meshes such as stainless steel mesh coated with nanofibers qiu et al 2017 copper mesh coated with graphene foam kim et al 2016 copper oxide mesh wang et al 2014 and nickel mesh coated with a self assembled monolayer sam of n dodecanethiol cheng et al 2011 microscale pores in such sponges membranes and meshes are able to collect oil by capillarity while rejecting water thereby allowing selective oil retention however the collection rates of these materials for high viscosity oils are low since the oils must flow through fine pores in addition difficulties in increasing the size of the devices at low cost restrict their application in actual oil spill incidents to overcome these limitations we propose the fabrication of hydrogel bowls with characteristics of collecting oil on water it has macroscopic openings in its sidewall and its surface has hydrophobic oleophilic and has high oil wettability properties fig 1 a and b which selectively allow oils with a wide range of viscosity to flow easily through the openings while preventing the inflow of water compared with other materials such as plastics hydrogels are green materials that consist mainly of water and a small amount of hydrophilic polymers lee and mooney 2001 and are easily shaped at room temperature mredha et al 2017 yu et al 2016 nakajima et al 2010 with lower cost and energy requirements additionally hydrogel surfaces with good hydrophobic and oleophilic properties are easily obtained using a variety of coating materials and techniques oliveira et al 2016 horecha et al 2013 sidorenko et al 2008 therefore hydrogels are an ideal material for fabricating oil cleaning bowls the fabrication process of such hydrogel bowls is shown in fig 1c f 2 materials and methods 2 1 geometric design of the hydrogel bowl taking in consideration the buoyancy and stability of the hydrogel bowl when floating on water several geometric design parameters of a hydrogel bowl prototype were predetermined as follows a bowl diameter of 50 mm a bowl height of 15 5 mm four slot type openings of length l 2 mm and radius r 2 5 mm fig 1b a thickness of the top edge of 2 mm a height difference between the top edge and the water surface of 7 mm and a volume of collected oil in the bowl of 9 ml fig s1 when the hydrogel bowl floats on water the buoyancy f b and weight of the bowl w h b are balanced as follows 1 f b ρ w g v s 2 w h b ρ h b g v h b 3 w h b f b where g 9 81 m s 2 is the acceleration of gravity ρ w 0 997 10 6 kg mm 3 is the density of water and ρ h b 0 134 10 5 kg mm 3 is the density of the bowl material v s and v h b are the volumes of the submerged portion of the bowl and the hydrogel in the bowl respectively by arbitrarily setting the external surface shape of the bowl based on the determined design parameters v s can be calculated between the bottom of the bowl and the water surface and then f b can be calculated using eq 1 by setting the internal surface shape of the bowl v h b can be calculated and then w h b can be calculated using eq 2 the final shape of the bowl can be obtained when the computed f b and w h b coincide with each other eq 3 and the volume inside the bowl approaches 9 ml while repeatedly adjusting the outer and inner surface shapes of the bowl fig s1 determination of the external and internal surface shape of the bowl and calculation of the volumes v s and v h b were carried out using commercial software cero parametric 3d modeling software ptc usa 2 2 fabrication of the mold for the hydrogel bowl based on the geometric design of the hydrogel bowl prototype the mold for fabricating the hydrogel bowl was designed using commercial software cero parametric 3d modeling software ptc usa the mold consists of two parts an upper part with four extrusion features which forms the inner surface and four openings of the bowl and a lower part which forms the outer surface of the bowl the designs of these parts as shown in fig s2a were exported into stereo lithography stl format files the mold was then fabricated following the stl file using a 3d printer object30 pro v20 object ltd israel with verowhite material fig s2b 2 3 preparation of the hydrogel bowl acrylamide 1 708 g and n n methylenebisacrylamide mbaa 0 001 g were dissolved in 6 4 ml of water thereafter 30 μl of ammonium persulfate aps aq solution 0 375 g ml and 15 μl of n n n n tetramethylethylenediamine temed were added to the solution and poured into the mold for polymerization at room temperature 25 c after 2 h the mold was opened to give a hydrogel bowl figs 1c d and 2 a a scanning electron microscopy sem image of its surface which is very nearly featureless is shown in fig 2b 2 4 hydrophobic coating on the hydrogel surface to obtain a hydrophobic surface the hydrogel bowl was coated with octadecyltrichlorosilane ots which has long hydrophobic alkyl chains although ots is widely used to prepare hydrophobic surfaces on various types of solid materials yilbas et al 2016 ke et al 2010 wang and lieberman 2003 it has not yet been applied to high water content materials such as hydrogels in the presence of trace amounts of water ots self polymerizes to create a mono to multilayer coating through heterogeneous nucleation wang and lieberman 2003 since the polyacrylamide paam hydrogel is a water containing material ots is readily polymerized and deposited on the surface of the bowl fig 1b to apply a hydrophobic coating on the hydrogel surface the surface of the as prepared hydrogel bowl was first washed with n pentane and dried in air for 2 min then the hydrogel was dipped into 100 ml of an ots n pentane solution at a concentration of 10 μl ml for 2 h fig 1e gradually the ots was deposited on the hydrogel surface as reflected by the hydrogel turning white in color fig 2c during the deposition process the solution was shaken frequently so that the entire gel surface was evenly exposed to the ots solution after 2 h the surface of the ots coated hydrogel bowl was dried in an oven at 55 c for 2 min sem imaging showed that applying the ots coating resulted in a very rough surface fig 2d fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir was used to determine that the hydrogel surface was completely coated with ots fig s3 2 5 force equilibrium and moment effects around openings the most interesting aspect of the hydrogel bowl for selective oil collection is the adoption of the macroscopic openings which have a cross sectional area of 10 90 mm2 fig 3 a shows the forces from the water and the atmosphere around an opening in the vertical wall note that the weight of the protruding water is ignored for simplicity in general both water and oil can flow through macroscopic openings in a material but in the case of water if the normal directional forces from the surface tension at the opening f γ c o s θ plus atmospheric pressure f a p are well balanced with the force of the water pressure f w p along the same direction the water flowing through the opening will be blocked fig 3a in contrast the low surface tension of the oil induces a small force component along the normal direction f o γ c o s θ so that the force and the normal directional force from atmospheric pressure f a p cannot maintain equilibrium with the normal directional force from the oil pressure f o p fig 3b therefore oil flows through the opening fig 3c and d shows an opening in the curved sidewalls of the bowl and the forces and moments from the water and the atmosphere around the opening specifically fig 3c and d shows the case of water on the outside and inside of the bowl respectively if the water flow is blocked by the opening the vertical and horizontal components of the forces caused by water pressure f w p atmospheric pressure f a p and the surface tension of the water f γ will be in equilibrium in these cases however resultant moments m r are generated by each force component if the moment center is placed at the center of gravity of the water protruding through the opening the resultant moments can be calculated from the sum of the products of the magnitude of each force and the perpendicular distances between the forces and the moment center therefore the equation of the resultant moment is 4 m r f γ c o s θ 1 r 1 f γ s i n θ 1 d 1 f γ c o s θ 2 r 2 f γ s i n θ 2 d 2 where d 1 d 2 r 1 and r 2 are the perpendicular distances from the moment center to each force the values of d 1 and d 2 are relatively small compared with r 1 and r 2 and the magnitudes of r 1 and r 2 are similar to each other therefore the most dominant term to determine the magnitude and direction of the moment is f γ c o s θ 1 r 1 in fig 3c and f γ c o s θ 2 r 2 in fig 3d when the water flow is blocked they must also remain in equilibrium m r 0 if the surface of the sidewall has high hydrophobicity f γ c o s θ 1 fig 3c and f γ c o s θ 2 fig 3d increase and their corresponding resultant moments increase in opposite directions these increased moments in different directions play an important role in preventing water from flowing into the bowl fig 3c and helping the water in the bowl to flow out through the openings thereby disrupting the moment equilibrium fig 3d 2 6 design of the shape and size of the openings to determine the size l and r of the slot type opening fig 1b that can block water flow the equilibrium between the increment of work d w from the pressure difference and the increased volume of the water protruding through an opening with an increment of surface energy d e s of the increased protruding water surface is given as follows 5 d w d e s the increment of work d w can be described as 6 d w δ p d v where δ p is the pressure difference between the water and the atmosphere and d v is the increment of volume of the water protruding through an opening 7 δ p p w a t e r p a t m ρ w g h 8 d v π 2 r 2 r l d r where ρ w is the density of water g is the acceleration of gravity h r l is the height of the water surface from the center of the cross section of the opening and l is the height from the upper edge of the opening to the water surface then d w becomes 9 d w ρ w g h π 2 r 2 r l d r the increment of the surface energy is given as 10 d e s γ d a where γ 71 99 10 6 n mm is the surface tension of water and d a is the increment of the surface area of the protruding water determined as follows 11 d a π 4 r l d r then d e s can be written as 12 d e s γ π 4 r l d r on the basis of eqs 5 9 and 12 the equation for designing the shape of the opening in terms of r for a chosen l can be obtained as follows 13 2 ρ w g r 3 2 ρ w g l ρ w g l r 2 ρ w g l l 4 γ r γ l 0 for each arbitrarily chosen l value the radius r 0 that satisfies eq 13 is found these data are plotted in fig 4 here l 1 5 mm was selected considering the height of the water surface outside the hydrogel bowl when placed on water and the position of its opening the surface properties of the material are irrelevant to eq 13 so the shape of an opening that can block water flow can be designed using a radius less than r 0 for any chosen l 3 results and discussion to check the surface properties of the ots coated hydrogel a disc shaped ots coated hydrogel sample was prepared using the same composition recipe as the hydrogel bowl fig s4a then a water droplet was dropped onto the flat top surface of the disc and the contact angle between the droplet and the surface was measured fig s4b the measured contact angle of the water droplet on the surface was 138 16 suggesting that the surface was highly hydrophobic crick and parkin 2011 the oleophilicity of the surface was also evaluated by dropping an oil droplet diffusion pump oil on the sample surface the fact that the droplet spread on the surface demonstrated its oleophilic nature while the shape of the oil droplet indicated relatively low wettability of the hydrogel surface fig s4c to test the water and oil flow through the openings with different surface properties small boxes of 25 mm 25 mm 18 mm in size with different surface properties were prepared a polyacrylamide paam hydrogel box with a hydrophilic surface fig 5 a a polydimethylsiloxane pdms box with a low hydrophobicity surface fig 5b and a paam hydrogel box with a high hydrophobicity surface obtained by coating with ots fig 5c were fabricated by applying the same molding and coating process that were used to fabricate the hydrogel bowl the surface properties of the paam hydrogel box and the pdms box were confirmed by test dropping a water droplet fig 5a and b the contact angles of the water droplet on the paam gel hydrophilic surface and pdms low hydrophobic surface were 36 75 and 104 49 respectively crick and parkin 2011 these boxes each had a slot type opening l 2 mm and r 2 5 mm on their vertical sidewall here r was selected to be smaller than r o 2 91 mm which corresponds to l 2 mm and l 1 5 mm was selected the test results showed that water did not flow out through the opening regardless of the surface property of each box fig 5a c however poured oil at the same height as the water inside the box easily flowed out through the opening due to the oleophilic surface property and low oil surface tension fig 5d to explore the sizes of the openings that can block or allow water flow ots coated paam hydrogel boxes 25 mm 25 mm 18 mm were fabricated with differently sized openings to maintain a consistent water height in the boxes l was set as 1 5 mm which was used to calculate the radius r o fig 4 four different values of l 0 for a circular opening 2 10 and 15 mm were selected for the openings for each value of l two different values of r were selected after comparing with the calculated r o values 3 16 2 91 2 47 and 2 36 mm respectively from eq 13 for l 0 mm and l 2 mm the two different values selected for r were 2 5 mm and 3 mm experiments indicated that the water flow was blocked by the l 0 mm r 2 5 mm fig 4 and l 2 mm r 2 5 mm openings figs 4 and 6 a however water could easily flow out through the l 0 mm r 3 mm fig 4 and l 2 mm r 3 mm openings figs 4 and 6b for l 10 mm the two selected values of r were 2 mm and 2 5 mm the l 10 mm r 2 mm opening blocked the water flow fig 4 whereas the l 10 mm r 2 5 mm opening did not block the water flow fig 4 for l 15 mm r values of 1 5 mm and 2 25 mm were selected the water flow was blocked by the l 15 mm r 1 5 mm opening figs 4 and 6c whereas the l 15 mm r 2 25 mm opening did not block the water flow figs 4 and 6d these results confirmed that water flows out through openings in the vertical sidewall with radii similar to or greater than r o but it does not flow out through openings with radii smaller than r o to confirm the water and oil flow through the openings in the curved sidewall of the hydrogel bowl two types of hydrogel boxes were fabricated with highly hydrophobic surfaces and the same curved sidewall as the hydrogel bowl the hydrogel boxes shown in fig 7 a and b were used for testing the possibility of water flowing into and out of the hydrogel bowl respectively these hydrogel boxes both had a slot type opening with l 2 mm and r 2 5 mm which blocked water flow from the vertical sidewall at l 1 5 mm figs 4 and 6a the experiments revealed that water did not flow out of the box shown in fig 7a however water flowed easily out of the box shown in fig 7b these results show the effect of the resultant moments m r eq 4 which can both block water flow into the bowl through the opening fig 7a and help the water inside of the bowl to flow out fig 7b to test the possibility of oil flow into the hydrogel bowl the box that blocked the water flow was used fig 7a the result showed that the oil could flow through the opening easily when the level of the oil inside the box was higher than the lower edge of the opening fig 7c to check the flow of oil through the openings of the hydrogel bowl an ots coated bowl was floated on water covered with a 4 8 mm thick layer of diffusion pump oil neovac sx matsumura co ltd japan 22 0 cst at 40 c which has a viscosity similar to that of medium crude oil 8 35 cst at 40 c jones 2010 al besharah et al 1987 fig s5a c it was observed that the oil did not flow spontaneously through the openings even after 5 h fig s5c the flow of oil was prevented because of the low oil pressure p o i l fig 1b caused by the thin thickness of the oil layer and relatively low oil wettability of the bowl surface fig s4c and large roughness of the inner surfaces of the openings fig 2d after coating with ots this problem was solved by increasing the oil wettability of the bowl surface for this the ots coated hydrogel bowl was dipped in diffusion pump oil for 2 h fig 1f after removal from the oil the bowl was carefully wiped with tissue paper to absorb any excess oil remaining on its surface fig 2e this treatment created a surface that was both uneven on account of the ots treatment and smooth because the ots surface topography was covered with oil fig 2f the surface roughness of the ots coated hydrogel was reduced by the oil treatment with the treatment the high hydrophobicity of the ots coated surface was reduced to a lower hydrophobicity because of the decreased roughness of the bowl surface to confirm this a disc shaped hydrogel sample that had already been coated with ots was dipped in diffusion pump oil for 2 h the gel was then removed and all excess oil on its surface was carefully cleaned using tissue paper fig s6a a water droplet was placed on the sample surface and the contact angle between the droplet and the surface was measured the measured contact angle was reduced to 117 76 from 138 16 for the ots coated hydrogel figs s6b and s4b which indirectly suggested that the high hydrophobicity of the surface was decreased the oleophilic property of the ots coated surface after the oil treatment was also examined by placing an oil droplet on the surface the surface was found to be perfectly wetted by the oil droplet fig s6c this means that the oleophilic property of the ots coated surface did not change after the oil treatment and the oil wettability was greatly increased after the oil treatment the effectiveness of a prototype hydrogel bowl was evaluated again the bowl floated easily on water and did not sink even under wavy conditions furthermore water did not flow into the bowl through the openings in its sidewalls see supplementary material movie s1 but water inside the bowl easily flowed out see supplementary material movie s2 by comparison a hydrogel bowl without the ots coating and oil treatment sank quickly as water quickly flowed into the bowl through its openings see supplementary material movie s3 supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j watres 2018 09 012 the following are the supplementary data related to this article movie 1 2 movie 1 movie 2 3 movie 2 movie 3 4 movie 3 movie 4 5 movie 4 movie 5 6 movie 5 movie 6 7 movie 6 movie 7 8 movie 7 movie 8 9 movie 8 movie 9 10 movie 9 to evaluate oil flow through the hydrogel bowl openings after the oil treatment 50 ml of diffusion pump oil was poured into a water filled beaker forming a layer on the water surface and the hydrogel bowl was placed on top of the water to start the openings of the hydrogel bowl were positioned in the oil layer oil flowed into the bowl through the openings as soon as the hydrogel bowl was allowed to float fig 8 a as the amount of oil collected in the hydrogel bowl increased the bowl sank deeper into the water lowering the position of the openings in the oil layer thus the pressure difference between the oil layer and the atmosphere δ p o i l p o i l p a t m increased and the oil flowed into the bowl more easily fig 1b once the oil was collected in the bowl it could be held stably even under wavy conditions the collected oil was kept securely within the bowl without any change in volume and water did not enter the bowl through the openings see supplementary material movie s4 to evaluate the continuous oil collecting ability of the hydrogel bowl the collected oil was retrieved using a small pumping system and placed in a graduated cylinder see supplementary material movie s5 during this process the oil outside the bowl continuously flowed into the bowl due to the pressure difference even for very thin layers of oil fig 8b when the oil outside the bowl disappeared completely oil collection stopped fig 8c shows that the oil on the water was completely removed using the bowl the retrieved oil was pure no water layer was observed even after several hours it was found that even if water enters the hydrogel bowl over its top edge due to severe wavy conditions it flows out easily through the openings thus only pure oil is retrieved the volume of the retrieved oil and the oil retrieval rate were measured using a real time movie for comparison two additional bowls with different opening sizes l 4 mm r 1 5 mm and l 11 mm r 1 5 mm where the r values are smaller than r o for each l value were fabricated fig s7a c these bowls collected diffusion pump oil from water in the same manner as described above and the retrieved oil volumes and retrieval rates were measured to determine a favorable opening size of the hydrogel bowl for efficient oil cleaning for each bowl approximately 46 ml out of 50 ml of the oil could be collected into the graduated cylinder from a 125 cm2 surface area of water the remaining oil was either attached to the bottom surface of the bowl or remained within the bowl and pump system figs s8a and b no measurable quantity of oil remained in the water it was observed that less oil was collected as the thickness of the oil layer around the bowl decreased when only a small amount of oil was collected in the bowl the pump drew both oil and air reducing its efficiency therefore after retrieving the first 40 ml of oil a relatively long time was required to retrieve the remaining small amount of oil among the various bowls used in the measurements the bowl with the l 2 mm r 2 5 mm opening which has the largest hydraulic diameter d h 6 01 mm for the highest oil flow rate took the shortest time 48 s to retrieve 40 ml of oil and the retrieval rate for the initial 20 ml of oil was the fastest at 120 ml min fig 9 a and b to check the cleaning capacity of the bowl for oils of different viscosities kerosene which has a low viscosity 2 7 cst at 20 c and a high vacuum pump oil vactor hv 100 chemteco co ltd korea 90 0 cst at 40 c which has a viscosity in the range generally observed for heavy crude oil 70 1500 cst at 40 c ge et al 2017 jones 2010 al besharah et al 1987 were also used oil collection experiments using the kerosene and high vacuum pump oil similar to those using the diffusion pump oil were performed the time to retrieve 40 ml of kerosene 24 s was much shorter than the time for diffusion pump oil 48 s and high vacuum pump oil 173 s and the retrieval rate of the initial 20 ml of kerosene was the fastest at 150 ml min fig 9c and d see supplementary material movie s6 clearly oils with higher viscosity were more difficult to retrieve our results show that the hydrogel bowl can dramatically decrease the retrieval time of low viscosity oils compared with recently developed devices for example the graphene vessel took more than 70 s to retrieve 40 ml of kerosene kim et al 2016 whereas copper mesh devices took 120 s to retrieve 8 4 ml of toluene 0 68 cst at 20 c wang et al 2014 most importantly our hydrogel bowl enabled very efficient retrieval of high viscosity oils without any external energy inputs see supplementary material movie s7 an additional experiment using silicone oil kf 96 2000cs shin etsu chemical co ltd japan 2000 0 cst at 25 c was conducted to evaluate the possibility of retrieving heavy crude oil with very high viscosity approximately 27 ml out of 50 ml of silicone oil could be retrieved in 5 min see supplementary material movie s8 previously there had been almost no success in collecting high viscosity oils except by a recently developed joule heated graphene wrapped sponge ge et al 2017 this device however required significant energy input to retrieve 4 ml of viscous crude oil in 40 s both the hydrophobic coating and the oil treatment on the surface of the hydrogel bowl provide great advantages for long term use and storage generally hydrogels easily change their shape and properties upon evaporation or absorption of water previously this meant that it was not possible to use a device made of hydrogels over a long period of time however applying the double surface treatment i e ots and oil fig 2f has a synergistic effect that results in a dramatic reduction in water evaporation and absorption of the hydrogel during oil collection therefore hydrogels treated in this manner could be used over a long period of time without changes to their shape and property to evaluate the long term usability of the hydrogel bowl three bowls collecting three different types of oil on pure water were weighed daily for one week the weight of the bowl collecting kerosene decreased the most 5 68 reduction after one week compared with the weights of the bowls collecting the other oils 5 48 for the diffusion pump oil and 3 85 for the high vacuum pump oil fig 9e notably the weight loss 5 63 of the hydrogel bowl collecting diffusion pump oil on the surface of a seawater like aqueous solution 300 ml water with 3 5 wt nacl over the course of one week was almost identical to that of the bowl collecting this oil on pure water fig 9f this result demonstrates the potential for using these hydrogel bowls to clean oil spills from seawater while collecting the oils the surfaces of the ots coated bowls were always covered with oil blocking absorption or evaporation of water the shapes of the bowls did not change after one week fig s9a h even after one month there was no significant change in the bowl shape and it was still capable of collecting oil fig s9i to demonstrate the scalability of the hydrogel bowl for practical oil retrieval applications a large hydrogel bowl of 100 mm in diameter and 30 mm in height containing eight openings l 2 mm r 2 5 mm on its sidewall was fabricated based on the hydrogel molding process figs s10a and b the efficiency of the large hydrogel bowl was tested the bowl which could collect oil very efficiently floated easily on water 600 ml covered with an oil layer 50 ml diffusion pump oil it took only 23 s to collect all of the oil on the water which could easily be retrieved using a pump see supplementary material movie s9 in this experiment most of the oil 40 ml 80 was retrieved owing to the larger size of the bowl the amount of oil attached to the surface of the bowl also increased slightly therefore the volume of oil retrieved was slightly less than that of the prototype hydrogel bowl 46 ml 92 the long term preservation of the hydrogel bowl was also verified fig s11a d the dimensions of the bowl after preservation in diffusion pump oil for two months were reduced by only 2 24 in its diameter however the shape of the bowl changed considerably in air and water after one week the bowl dried out quickly in air whereas it absorbed water when immersed in water these results suggest that the hydrogel bowls can be preserved in oil for long periods 4 conclusion oil spills in aquatic environments must be removed quickly to prevent widespread contamination and deleterious effects and the economic loss involved in the cleanup process must be low so far the development of a device that can clean oil spills with high efficiency and low economic loss has been a very challenging problem our results show that a hydrogel bowl with an engineered surface can selectively and quickly collect spilled oil the low cost of its fabrication and the recyclability of the retrieved oil may substantially reduce economic loss in fact it is possible to fabricate many large hydrogel bowls through replication based on the hydrogel molding process if a large scale oil spill occurs many large bowls can be fabricated within a short period of time and deployed quickly to retrieve the spilled oil it is also possible to prepare hydrogel bowls in advance and preserve them in oil for a long period of time so they can be used immediately when needed overall these hydrogel bowls represent a new design strategy for the speedy and economical cleanup of oil spills acknowledgments this work was supported by the

chemical mcfa can be processed into fragrances kenealy et al 1995 food additives xu et al 2015 renewable diesel levy et al 1984 and aviation fuel harvey and meylemans 2014 or directly used as an antimicrobial agent p desbois 2012 however regardless of their versatility mcfa cannot be utilized on a large scale to ease the existing energy crisis due to the high production costs which is mainly extracted from plant animal oils and fossil sources nowadays ge et al 2015 jeon et al 2013 recently chain elongation ce a novel bio refinery process for the carboxylate platform based on reverse β oxidation pathway has attracted increasing attention due to its function of elongating scfa to mcfa agler et al 2012a chen et al 2017a ge et al 2015 liu et al 2017 steinbusch et al 2011 this industrially applicable mcfa production method based on ce technology also raises greatly public expectations the essential metabolic requirement for ce is the participation of an electron donor ed to form the intermediate acetyl coa agler et al 2012a kucek et al 2016b which is then coupled to scfa as the electron acceptor ea to elongate the two carbon chain at each cycle and simultaneously facilitate energy harvest cavalcante et al 2017 stadtman and barker 1949 several reduced organics including ethanol lactate methanol d galactitol galactose and sucrose have been utilized as eds to generate mcfa at large production disparities of 0 74 12 8 g l agler et al 2012a jeon et al 2011 kucek et al 2016a steinbusch et al 2011 zhu et al 2015 a comparison with previously reported studies table s1 supplementary information si indicates that ethanol and lactate are considered the most suitable eds for the ce process however ethanol and lactate still exhibit their respective shortcomings which largely limit substrate utilization ratio and mcfas productivity when ethanol is used as an ed co2 needs to be supplemented constantly since the corresponding mcfa forming bacteria require co2 as a carbon source to synthesize protein seedorf et al 2008 which undoubtedly increases the production cost moreover high concentrations of ethanol 200 400 mm show toxicity for microbiomes and inhibit mcfa synthesis angenent et al 2016 though diluting the substrate could alleviate ethanol toxicity it also sacrifices mcfa production efficiency angenent et al 2016 liu et al 2017 when lactate is used as an ed part of lactate is converted into propionate via the acrylate pathway to diverge the lactate carbon flow and thus reduce the conversion ratio of lactate into mcfa kucek et al 2016a furthermore a third of the carbon in lactate is released as co2 in the necessary step of lactate oxidization into acetyl coa which contributes to another consumption of the lactate carbon flow if these dispersive carbon fluxes can be transformed into mcfa again mcfa productivity would be largely improved based on the aforementioned shortcomings of ethanol or lactate as sole eds it was hypothesized that the redundant co2 released from the lactate carbon flow might exactly compensate for the co2 shortage in the ethanol guided ce lactate as the functionally equivalent ed with ethanol could be replenished into the low concentrations of ethanol guided ce to not only avoid the toxicity of ethanol for microbiomes but also guarantee a high mcfa production efficiency therefore a combination of ethanol and lactate as co eds might form a cooperative relationship to facilitate the conversion of substrate into mcfa more efficiently this implies that complex organics that contain the two eds could exhibit significantly better mcfa production performance than previously used substrates this conjecture was never proposed and verified before for reasons concerning economic costs and eco friendly considerations mcfa is inclined to be produced from organic wastes previous studies have focused on organic wastes containing ethanol or lactate such as yeast fermentation beer agler et al 2012a ge et al 2015 syngas fermentation effluent gildemyn et al 2017 vasudevan et al 2014 wine lees kucek et al 2016c and acid whey xu et al 2018 however organic wastes that contain various eds have hardly been used for mcfa production and whether some cooperative effects exist in such substrates has not been investigated therefore the chinese liquor making wastewater clmw which consists of lactate ethanol acetate n butyrate n caproate polysaccharide etc was used as a representative of such organic wastes to investigate its mcfa production ability the clmw is characterized by high output about 120 000 tons year in china and superior recycling value the chemical oxygen demand cod concentration reaches up to 10 45 g l cao et al 2010 however the current resource recovery methods for clmw generally concentrate on distilling ethanol extracting organic acids manufacturing esterified liquid and producing methane these technologies are characterized by high recycling costs significant resource wastage and low value products and therefore not appealing to winery enterprises consequently a majority of the clmw is discarded directly therefore the recovery of high value mcfa might be a commercially viable way for clmw reutilization in this study the mcfa production performances product components and respective microbiome characteristics from different combinations of eds and eas were systematically compared to verify the existence of a cooperative relationship in the co eds of ethanol and lactate during the ce process subsequently the clmw was fed as a substrate to investigate its mcfa production feasibility and performance moreover the possible relationships and reaction pathways between the various co existing eds and eas were also extensively discussed based on the experiment phenomena key discriminative microbial taxa and the energy harvest yield rate comparisons the research is expected to guide the selection and manipulation of the feedstock for mcfa production as well as provide a novel way for the clmw recycling 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum clmw and medium the inoculum used in this study was a mixture of pit mud and activated sludge pit mud was obtained from the brewing fermentation pit of a strong aroma type liquor distillery chengde china which also provided the clmw the activated sludge was collected from the secondary sedimentation tank of wenchang wastewater treatment plant harbin china the detailed information for pit mud clmw and the fermentation medium are shown in table s2 2 2 comparison of mcfa production performance for different substrate combinations in this study 17 substrates with different combinations of eds and eas were established and their details are presented in table 1 to avoid the toxic limits of mcfa and ethanol for microorganisms and enable the ce each substrate was controlled with an ed ea molar ratio of 3 and a total carbon concentration of 400 mm 2 bromoethanosulfonic acid 10 g l was added to the medium to inhibit methanogenesis the ph was adjusted to 6 5 0 1 a total of 17 batch tests were performed in triplicates in 1 l serum bottles the reactors were purged with nitrogen gas 99 9 and then stirred in an air bath shaker 35 1 c 120 rpm after 30 days of cultivation the fermentation broths in the batch reactors were dumped and the acclimatized inoculums were transferred to their respective fresh substrates for another 30 days the experimental data in this study were obtained from the latter 30 days operation 2 3 mcfa production from the clmw because the composition of the substrate fed into reactor r12 was similar to the clmw and the microbiome of r12 was enriched with abundant mcfa producing bacteria the microbiome from r12 was inoculated in the reactors that were fed with clmw to assess its mcfa production performance the operating parameters were the same as those mentioned in 2 2 2 4 illumina sequencing of 16s rrna genes after the mcfa production the microbial dna of 18 samples 17 samples mentioned in section 2 2 and one sample mentioned in section 2 3 were extracted using the z n atm mag bind soil dna kit omega biotek usa according to the standard protocol pcr amplifications of the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene were conducted with the primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 the construction of sequencing libraries and paired end sequencing were performed at an illumina miseq platform at sangon biotech co ltd shanghai china 2 5 chemical analyses 5 ml samples were collected from each reactor every day and filtered with a 0 45 μm filter for component test ethanol scfas and mcfas were analyzed by a gas chromatograph gc 7890 agilent technologies usa which was equipped with a flame ionization detector and a 30 m 0 25 mm db wax polyethylene glycol capillary column the inlet and detector temperatures were set at 220 and 240 c respectively the column temperature program increased the temperature from an initial 70 170 c with a temperature ramp of 20 c min and maintained at 170 c for 5 min followed by a temperature ramp of 20 c min to 240 c lactate was measured by a waters acquity ultra performance liquid chromatograph system equipped with an hss t3 column 2 1 50 mm 1 8 μm waters gas sample compositions h2 methane and co2 were determined by a gc 7890 agilent technologies usa equipped with a thermal conductivity detector the temperatures of the injector oven and detector were set at 120 100 and 150 c respectively 2 6 data analyses the differences in microbiomes for different eds at phylum class order family and genus levels were compared using the linear discriminant effect size lefse firstly the different features among the biological classes were distinguished using lefse subsequently standard tests were performed to estimate the statistical significance and finally the linear discriminant analysis lda was used to estimate the effect size of each discriminately abundant feature segata et al 2011 here the lefse was conducted with α value of 0 05 for the kruskal wallis test and the lda score log10 more than 3 for discriminative features borton et al 2017 the energy flow of the substrate into mcfa was presented as selectivity which is an estimation for the conversion rate of substrate into the mcfas and is calculated with the electron equivalents of products dividing by the consumed electrons from participant substrates zhu et al 2015 the detailed formula is shown in si 3 results 3 1 comparisons of mcfa productions compositions and selectivities 3 1 1 ce performance under different eas seventeen substrate combinations consisting of different eds and eas were conducted to compare the performance differences in substrate utilization and mcfa synthesis fig 1 obviously mcfa was hardly synthesized with sole scfas r15 17 and the successful ce required the participation of eds for each ed acetate n butyrate and n caproate were selected as eas to investigate their ce abilities n butyrate has been hypothesized to be a more efficient ea than acetate for ce due to an omitted step of elongating acetate into n butyrate ge et al 2015 however the obtained research results have not confirmed and explained this conjecture the pairwise comparisons r1 and r2 r5 and r6 and r9 and r10 indicated that n butyrate as an ea did not show advantage for ce performance on the contrary mcfa productions and selectivities in r2 r6 and r10 n butyrate as ea were lower than those in r1 r5 and r9 acetate as ea respectively therein in comparison to acetate n butyrate increased n caprylate selectivity reduced n caproate selectivity and scarcely affected n heptylate generation indicating n butyrate as ea could be advantageous for n caprylate generation when n caproate was used as an ea r3 r7 and r11 negligible n caproate was elongated into n caprylate whereas most n caproate was disintegrated into acetate and n butyrate moreover high concentrations of n caproate and ethanol lactate were remained in the fermentation broth the limited substrate utilization ratios in r3 r7 and r11 led to much lower mcfa productions and selectivities than other reactors in groups 1 2 and 3 respectively consequently n caproate was unsuitable as a sole ea however the substrate utilizations and mcfa syntheses in r4 r8 and r12 with low concentrations of acetate n butyrate and n caproate 13 3 mm as co eas were not suppressed on the contrary higher mcfa productions were achieved the higher mcfa productions obtained in r4 r8 and r12 were partly reflected in their higher n caprylate productions 3 1 2 ce performance under different eds in this section because of the unsuccessful ce in r3 r7 and r11 caused by the sole ea of n caproate the eds in groups 1 3 were compared by excluding the three tests as shown in fig 1 ce performances of substrates that contained both eds and eas were better than those without eas by jointly comparing the total mcfa productions and selectivities obtained from the same eas ethanol as an ed was more competitive than lactate for mcfa production which was mainly reflected in the highly effective n caproate synthesis from ethanol however ethanol was less competitive than lactate for n caprylate generation moreover ethanol and lactate coexistence group 3 resulted in higher productions and selectivities for both n heptylate and n caprylate when compared to the separate effects of ethanol or lactate it was also noted that the propionate concentrations in group 2 were significantly higher than group 1 and meanwhile the propionate was also largely obtained in r14 lactate as sole substrate this phenomenon corroborated the existence of a competing acrylate pathway which induced the lactate carbon flux toward propionate and thus reduced mcfa selectivity kucek et al 2016a it was surprisingly observed that the average selectivities of propionate and n heptylate were 15 24 and 4 54 in group 2 while those in group 3 were 2 23 and 11 18 respectively in addition the highest total mcfa production 804 49 35 96 mg cod g cod and selectivity 80 26 4 566 were obtained in r12 among all the tests suggesting the combination of co eds of ethanol and lactate and the aforementioned co eas further enhanced mcfa production 3 2 mcfa production from clmw clmw was fed into the microbiome of r12 to test its mcfa production ability the concentration changes of substrates and products in the mcfa production process are shown in fig 2 a and their respective change rates are compared with the semi logarithmic graph fig s1 it was found a lag time about 8 days were needed for microorganisms to acclimatize the complex substrates subsequently the concentrations of scfas including acetate propionate and n butyrate increased which could be mostly generated from the acidification of polysaccharides in clmw ethanol and lactate concentrations decreased rapidly from day 9 along with increased n caproate concentration during this period the decreased ethanol and lactate were converted mostly into acetate which was subsequently partly elongated into n butyrate and n caproate by coupling with the intermediate of acetyl coa about 12 days later n caproate concentration increased exponentially and n heptylate production started meanwhile the concentrations of acetate propionate and n butyrate reduced dramatically when n caproate concentration reached about 6090 32 mg cod l n caprylate production started at a growth rate that was quicker than that of n caproate fig s1 mcfa production was slowed down from day 27 due to near complete consumption of both lactate and ethanol at the end of the run considering ethanol lactate and scfas as the carbon sources of ce the selectivities of n caproate n heptylate and n caprylate were 59 23 3 13 8 96 0 37 and 12 15 0 57 and their eventual concentrations were 12331 10 379 91 1889 59 86 95 and 2832 06 113 28 mg cod l respectively table s3 the total mcfa selectivity was 80 34 5 26 which was slightly superior to that obtained from other organic wastes table s4 fig 2b shows the carbon distribution at the end of the mcfa production from clmw n caproate occupied the maximum carbon flow of 60 93 1 84 while n heptylate and n caprylate accounted for 8 98 0 4 and 12 59 0 52 respectively about 6 61 0 38 carbon existed in the scfas which could not be further elongated due to the exhausted ethanol and lactate 5 25 0 26 carbon existed in the form of co2 and the remaining 5 64 0 31 could be converted to biomass future research should focus on comprehensive condition optimization to provide technical guidance for higher conversion ratio of clmw to mcfa 3 3 microbial community distribution characteristics phylogenetic analyses of 16s rrna gene sequences at phylum class and genus levels were conducted to quantitatively characterize the microbial communities fig 3 five major phyla including proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes chloroflexi and actinobacteria were detected with different proportions in all the reactors among them proteobacteria was the mutual primary species which probably came from the initial inocula of sludge and pit mud firmicutes the positive contributor for ce agler et al 2012a angenent et al 2016 was significantly enriched in group 3 with an average relative abundance of 45 8 compared to the other three groups 28 05 27 08 and 15 56 respectively moreover firmicutes 61 53 was further enriched and far exceeded proteobacteria 18 70 when the microbiome of r12 was fed with actual clmw and operated for about 40 days this microbiome is labelled as r12 hereafter to simplify the description further analyses were conducted by combining class and genus levels proteobacteria mainly consisted of four classes i e alphaproteobacteria bataproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria compared to the control of group 4 more gammaproteobacteria and less alphaproteobacteria were detected at groups 1 3 except r3 r7 and r11 and r12 that conducted successful ce genus acinetobacter which was affiliated to gammaproteobacteria and was responsible for ce kucek et al 2016a were enriched in groups 1 3 and r12 with undistinguished relative abundances of 9 2 15 2 genera methyloversatilis and dechloromonas that belonged to betaproteobacteria were detected in these reactors with relative abundances of 3 5 7 2 both genera were affiliated to rhodocyclaceae which was observed as the dominant species 70 8 for n caprylate production from ethanol acetate after a long term cultivation kucek et al 2016b implying that these two genera might play important roles in n caprylate generation in this study phylum bacteroidetes mainly consisted of classes bacteroidia and sphingobacteriia both of which were preponderantly distributed in group 2 which also principally enriched their branches including genera of bacteroides mucinivorans petrimonas and macellibacteroides besides genus corynebacterium belonging to phylum actinobacteria also showed a strong response in group 2 with a significantly higher relative abundance than that in groups 1 and 3 classes clostridia negativicutes and bacilli were the three main members of firmicutes clostridia was distributed with higher relative abundances of 17 8 26 21 18 3 27 55 and 32 2 in group 1 group 3 and r12 respectively than that in group 2 11 07 14 61 clostridia consisted of 11 genera among which clostridium iv and clostridium sensu stricto were its major members clostridium iv was enriched in groups 1 2 3 and r12 with average relative abundances of 7 02 7 93 6 88 and 14 48 respectively the much higher relative abundance of clostridium iv observed in r12 suggested the strong adaptability and metabolic capability of clostridium iv to complex substrate clostridium sensu stricto clostridium iii clostridium xiva and clostridium xivb could also be equipped with ce ability which were preponderantly distributed in group 1 group 3 r13 and r12 indicating these species were mainly related to the mcfa production from ethanol in contrast class negativicutes and its genera veillonella and megasphaera were almost only enriched in group 2 group 3 and r12 and these species occupied overwhelming proportions in group 3 and r12 compared to group 2 another class bacilli consisted of genera oscillibacter and lactobacillus oscillibacter was beneficial for n caproate and n caprylate productions when ethanol or lactate were used as eds angenent et al 2016 kucek et al 2016a 2016b in this study oscillibacter also appeared in groups 1 3 and r12 with undifferentiated scales however lactobacillus which is known for lactate fermentation was mainly detected in groups 2 3 r14 and r12 moreover r12 enriched much higher relative abundance of lactobacillus than other reactors implying that lactobacillus might also be potentially conductive to mcfa generation 4 discussion 4 1 improved mcfa production performance from co eds the higher mcfa production and selectivity obtained from the co eds of ethanol and lactate in contrast to their individual existence could be attributed to their cooperative effects which were manifested in the following three parts fig 4 part i mutual complementarity of the metabolites for every 5 molecules of ethanol that were used as the ed the mcfa forming bacteria needed to completely oxidize 1 molecule of ethanol into acetate and h2 to obtain energy ge et al 2015 besides the other 2 molecules of h2 would be released from the reduced ferredoxin catalyzed by hydrogenase angenent et al 2016 the more h2 released from ethanol than that from lactate benefited the mcfa accumulation since a hydrogen partial pressure higher than 0 03 atm could avoid the oxidations of carboxylate and ethanol grootscholten et al 2014 compared with group 2 groups 1 and 3 assuredly kept higher h2 percentages in the headspace fig s2 which were all higher than the hydrogen partial pressure of 0 03 atm excluding the effects from h2 concentration the worse mcfa generation efficiency in group 1 when compared to group 3 could be partly ascribed to the shortage of co2 which was an essential substrate for ce due to the protein synthesis in many mcfa producers require the participation of sufficient co2 as a carbon source seedorf et al 2008 similar to group 1 co2 deficiency also caused low mcfa productivity and long lag time in the early study of ce from ethanol acetate angenent et al 2016 steinbusch et al 2011 when lactate was used as the ed lactate was first oxidized to pyruvate then an equimolar co2 was released through the further oxidation of three carbon pyruvate to two carbon acetyl coa by pyruvate decarboxylase thus co2 concentration could be enough for successful ce from lactate and there was also little research showing the additional needs of co2 in the lactate guided ce in contrast previously many researchers have supplied exogenetic co2 to enhance ce efficiency from ethanol grootscholten et al 2013 2014 roghair et al 2018 in the ce process the average co2 content in group 1 was 8 33 while co2 accounted for 43 27 and 25 67 of total gas in groups 2 and 3 respectively fig s2 which might support this conjecture part ii supererogatory substrate formation there was almost no observation of biogas release besides the methane accounted for less than 4 of the total headspace gas implying that hydrogenotrophic and acetotrophic methanogens were effectively inhibited by the addition of 2 bromoethanosulfonic acid therefore hydrogenotrophic methanogens could not compete for h2 to produce methane excess h2 and co2 released from the ce of ethanol and lactate could form acetate and ethanol again through homoacetogenesis and acetate reduction and subsequently the acetate and ethanol could be further converted into mcfa by reverse β oxidation angenent et al 2016 grootscholten et al 2013 the feasibilities of these reactions were verified by zhang et al 2013 who obtained considerable yields of acetate n butyrate n caproate and n caprylate by just adding molecular h2 and co2 to a mixed culture in addition increased ethanol acetate n butyrate and n caproate concentrations were detected after the complete consumption of ethanol and lactate from day 27 fig 2a implying the coexisting by products of h2 and co2 led to a supererogatory mcfa production which was one of the important reasons for the higher mcfa production from the simultaneous use of ethanol and lactate as co eds part iii enhanced n heptylate generation from propionate as mentioned previously considerable propionate formation from the competing acrylate pathway in the lactate guided ce process branched the lactate carbon flux to lower mcfa selectivity according to prabhu et al 2012 when the available lactate concentration was high enough a part of lactate carbon would flow toward the acrylate pathway lactyl coa and propionyl coa were formed sequentially as the intermediates and were further converted into propionate recently kucek et al 2016a proposed that propionate formation could be restrained in the continuous flow reactor equipped with in line product extraction unit by maintaining residual lactate concentration near zero and decreasing the operation ph to 5 0 however a low ph of 5 could be unfavorable for enhancing the mcfa production for reactors without the product extraction unit because an acidic ph of 5 0 resulted in an abundant existence of mcfa with the undissociated states the pka of carboxylic acids were 4 8 4 9 which would consequently seriously suppress the microbial growth agler et al 2012a in this study it was interestingly found that significantly higher n heptylate concentrations and lower propionate concentrations were obtained in group 3 than those in group 2 this implies that co eds of ethanol and lactate could promote the elongation of propionate into n heptylate which could be ascribed to the increased concentration of available acetyl coa from ethanol as a result the dispersive lactate carbon flux from the acrylate pathway was finally transformed into mcfa in conclusion some cooperation existed between ethanol and lactate in the ce process which made up for the respective shortcomings of ethanol and lactate improved the conversion ratio of substrate into mcfa and formed a more favorable environment for the mcfa producer the research results also widened the feedstock types suitable for ce organic wastes that contained these two eds and various eas were expected to be directly used for mcfa production while others that complemented each other could be combined to produce mcfa 4 2 the key discriminative microflora in the co eds of ethanol and lactate lefse was utilized to specifically identify the key discriminative microbial taxa that caused the discrepant ce performances from the co eds and to compare them with those from only ethanol or lactate the corresponding lda values quantitatively evaluated the influencing degrees according to the cladogram from lefse analysis fig 5 and the corresponding lda values fig s3 12 37 and 8 bacterial clades lda scores log10 3 showed statistically significant and biologically consistent differences in groups 1 2 and 3 respectively group 1 was characterized by a preponderance of proteobacteria with an average relative abundance of 45 8 other two groups were 34 52 and 30 36 respectively lda score log10 5 the following data displayed in this order however group 2 was enriched with preponderant bacteroidetes 17 69 7 09 7 44 4 chloroflexi 2 3 0 74 0 44 3 planctomycetes 1 30 0 54 0 63 3 and synergistetes 1 04 0 08 0 34 3 the dominant enrichment of bacteroides spp in group 2 was reasonable due to bacteroides spp was positively correlated with n caproate synthesis from lactate kucek et al 2016a firmicutes 48 36 27 75 26 51 4 contained abundant ce related bacteria was more enriched in group 3 from the nodes shown in fig 5 the discriminated firmicutes consisted of three main classes which were consistent with the aforementioned analysis therein classes clostridia and bacilli did not stimulate the discrepant ce performances it was also noticed that the type strain clostridium kluyveri affiliated to clostridia best known for producing n caproate from ethanol acetate was almost undiscovered in all the reactors previously c kluyveri was also absent or rare in other ce microbiomes with ethanol acetate as substrates kucek et al 2016b 2016c in addition to c kluyveri many other clostridia related bacteria with genes of reverse β oxidation can also carry out ce agler et al 2012a just as the identification result clostridium iv clostridium sensu stricto clostridium iii clostridium xiva and clostridium xivb were enriched in large quantities in our reactors and played a positive role in mcfa production class negativicutes and its members including the order selenomonadales family veillonellaceae and genus veillonella all with lda score log10 4 were discriminated as the primary species that distinguished group 3 from the others negativicutes on an average accounted for 16 80 of the total microorganism in group 3 but accounted for only 0 48 and 6 61 in groups 1 and 2 respectively megasphaera elsdenii belonged to negativicutes was previously known as the only strain for n caproate production from lactate kucek et al 2016a similar to the observation results of c kluyveri m elsdenii was also scarce in these microbiomes it is likely that pure cultures such as c kluyveri and m elsdenii could not adapt to the complicated environment in the mixed culture fermentation another genus veillonella affiliated to family veillonellaceae occupied significant proportions in group 3 especially in r10 15 7 and r12 16 13 however it was only 4 48 in group 2 and was absent in group 1 the genera from family veillonellaceae were considered as the closest species to m elsdenii kucek et al 2016a the nodes in fig 5 revealed that family veillonellaceae mainly consisted of two genera therein veillonella was the only discriminant genus hence the discriminative high proportioned veillonella could play an analogous role with m elsdenii in the ce and bring about the discrepant mcfa production performances ruminococcaceae was proven to be positively correlated with ce and n caproate production agler et al 2012a 2012b as mentioned earlier clostridium iv which was affiliated to ruminococcaceae promoted carboxylate elongation except clostridium iv three other members from ruminococcaceae which distributed preponderantly in group 3 were identified by lefse therein genera intestinimonas and desulfitobacterium both with lda score log10 4 were found almost only in group 3 with relative abundances of 1 05 2 27 and sporobacter lda score log10 3 took up much higher relative abundances of 4 26 5 66 in group 3 in contrast to the other two 1 in summary the abundant mcfa forming bacteria species in group 3 contributed to its superior mcfa production ability additionally the identified several discriminative microbial taxa that were positively associated with ce might play a key role in the different mcfa production performances observed in the presence of co eds and in the presence of individual eds of ethanol or lactate 4 3 thermodynamic comparison based on energy harvest yield and rate in an energy limited microbial ecosystem like ce efficient microbiomes compete for available energy avoid unnecessary energy loss and promote energy harvest gonzalez cabaleiro et al 2015 when the available substrates are abundant the reactions with higher energy harvest yields energy harvesting per unit of substrate consumption have advantages otherwise the reactions with higher energy harvest rates energy harvesting per unit time are more competitive schuster et al 2008 given the decisive role of energy harvest for a reaction the trade off between the yields and rates of energy harvest were analyzed to investigate the feasible competitive or cooperative reactions in the ce process according to an energy based model proposed by gonzalez cabaleiro et al 2015 energy harvest yield could be estimated using the gibbs energy change per mol substrate in this study the actual gibbs energy change δ g 35 c 0 was corrected at a temperature of 35 c with the gibbs helmholz equation kleerebezem and van loosdrecht 2010 the energy harvest rate was positively related to the specific maximum substrate uptake rate q s max moled molcx h 1 and was negatively related to the numbers of electron transfer per mol ed n e mole moled 1 that was also called metabolic labor a relationship q s max 3 n e is existed and the values of ne for each reaction are shown in fig s4 the ratio of δg 0 n e indirectly presented the competitiveness of specific reaction pathways the related parameters for possible reactions are shown in table s5 it was found that even though the oxidation of ethanol and lactate into acetate was endergonic δ g 35 c 0 48 5 kj moled eq e1 or could only gain a low energy yield δ g 35 c 0 12 9 kj moled eq l1 the high q s max derived from a low n e of 4 might allow the reactions to happen successfully besides propionate generation from lactate was positively competitive due to its considerable energy yield δ g 35 c 0 80 3 kj moled eq l2 and low n e of 8 therefore it is significant to inhibit these reactions to avoid the divergence of carbon flow from mcfa generation in the experimental results n butyrate was not as competitive as acetate for the mcfa production the reasons are explained based on energy harvest a pairwise comparing of pathways e3 and e5 and l4 and l6 indicated that n butyrate could accelerate n caproate synthesis compared to acetate since the specific bacteria using n butyrate as the ea involved less n e and higher q s max however n butyrate as an ea could only harvest a lower energy than acetate therefore n butyrate might not have a long term competitive advantage in the energy limited microbial ecosystems as shown in our experiment results however the longer chain n caprylate production from n butyrate might be more competitive than that from acetate since the former involved a higher q s max based on the similar energy harvest yields from eas of acetate and n butyrate eq e4 and e6 l5 and l7 similarly the n caprylate produced from direct elongation of n caproate also involves a higher q s max than from other eas eq e4 e6 and e7 l5 l7 and l8 which could explain the higher n caprylate production obtained from co eas low concentrations of acetate n butyrate and n caproate comparing with sole eas of acetate or n butyrate in addition the direct elongation of n caproate into n caprylate needs less consumption of acetyl coa and thus more acetyl coa is available for elongating acetate and n butyrate as a result co eas are capable of enhancing mcfa production it is noteworthy that due to the concentration of unionized n caproic acid above 20 7 mm would inhibit microbial activity coma et al 2016 the n caproate concentration exceed this limit is unsuitable as an ea it can be summarized from table s5 that by utilizing same substrates a higher energy yield can be obtained from the production of per unit of n caprylate than that from the production of per unit of n caproate but the longer ce pathways also reduce the energy harvest rate just as the experimental observations ce mostly ends up with n caproate instead of n caprylate as the end product this is because n caproate generation with a high energy rate overcomes the n caprylate generation with a high energy yield under the condition of insufficient substrate on the contrary sufficient substrates can reverse the phenomenon this conjecture was supported by the research of kucek et al 2016b which accomplished a high n caprylate to n caproate product ratio of 11 g cod g cod with a high ethanol to acetate ratio of 15 g cod g cod this analysis explained why the microorganism capable of harvesting more overall energy by synthesizing n caprylate were uncompetitive than other organisms that only synthesized n caproate the additional energy gained by one more elongation step may not compensate for the higher metabolic labor from the longer metabolic pathway in addition further ce is difficult since inhibitory effects on the microorganism increased with the extension of the carboxylate chain as a result the thermodynamically feasible reactions of n caprylate production from n caproate and ethanol lactate eq e7 and l8 can hardly be experimentally observed 5 conclusions this study verified that a cooperative relationship was existed between ethanol and lactate when they were used as the co eds of ce process co eds of ethanol and lactate facilitated the elongation of propionate undesired product from competing acrylate pathway into n heptylate and the reutilization of excess h2 and co2 by products from ce process in addition the co eas of acetate n butyrate and n caproate also contributed to a higher mcfa production comparing with the sole ea clmw a representative waste biomass containing both ethanol and lactate was confirmed to be a suitable feedstock to produce mcfa the main components in clmw such as lactate ethanol and scfas could be effectively transformed into mcfa without the additional introduction of eds and eas therefore mcfa production can be proposed as a prospective recycling method for clmw acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china

19334,ethanol and lactate are considered suitable electron donors eds for chain elongation ce however their respective shortcomings still limit the substrate conversion ratio and medium chain fatty acid mcfa production to address this limitation different eds and electron acceptors eas were combined to compare their ce performances and to investigate whether the combination of ethanol and lactate could further enhance the mcfa production based on the complementary characteristics of ethanol and lactate the results verified for the first time ethanol and lactate as the co eds formed a cooperative relationship to largely promote the conversion of substrates into mcfa the co eds of ethanol and lactate stimulated the transformation of dispersive lactate carbon flux from the competing acrylate pathway into n heptylate additionally the coexisting by products h2 and co2 from ethanol and lactate also contributed to the supererogatory mcfa generation the key microbial taxa that distinguished the co eds from their single action were the preponderant species from class negativicutes and family ruminococcaceae in addition the co eas of acetate n butyrate and n caproate also promoted mcfa generation low concentration of n caproate could be directly elongated into n caprylate while n caproate concentration exceeding the toxic limit was unsuitable as an ea this research provided a guide for substrate selection and collocation for ce technology chinese liquor making wastewater clmw was subsequently used as a substrate for mcfa production since it contains abundant lactate ethanol and short chain fatty acids in this study a mcfa selectivity of 80 34 5 26 a slightly higher selectivity which is in the range of previously reported ones was obtained this study paves a way for the sustainable development of chinese liquor industry by recycling the high output clmw into mcfa graphical abstract image 1 keywords chain elongation medium chain fatty acid chinese liquor making wastewater ruminococcaceae microbial community 1 introduction the depletion of finite fossil fuels accompanied by their rising social demand in the manufacturing industry in recent years has initiated unprecedented concerns for sustainable fuel and chemical productions wu et al 2017 anaerobic technology is one of the most widely applied bioprocesses to recycle renewable fuels and chemicals from low grade biomass chen et al 2017b medium chain fatty acids mcfas such as n caproate c6 n heptylate c7 and n caprylate c8 the carboxylates in this study refer to dissociated carboxylates and corresponding undissociated carboxylic acids which contain 6 to 12 carbon atoms and feature high energy density as well as hydrophobicity are considered to be more profitable anaerobic product compared to the traditional anaerobic products such as methane ethanol h2 and short chain fatty acids scfas agler et al 2012a steinbusch et al 2011 zhu et al 2015 as a platform chemical mcfa can be processed into fragrances kenealy et al 1995 food additives xu et al 2015 renewable diesel levy et al 1984 and aviation fuel harvey and meylemans 2014 or directly used as an antimicrobial agent p desbois 2012 however regardless of their versatility mcfa cannot be utilized on a large scale to ease the existing energy crisis due to the high production costs which is mainly extracted from plant animal oils and fossil sources nowadays ge et al 2015 jeon et al 2013 recently chain elongation ce a novel bio refinery process for the carboxylate platform based on reverse β oxidation pathway has attracted increasing attention due to its function of elongating scfa to mcfa agler et al 2012a chen et al 2017a ge et al 2015 liu et al 2017 steinbusch et al 2011 this industrially applicable mcfa production method based on ce technology also raises greatly public expectations the essential metabolic requirement for ce is the participation of an electron donor ed to form the intermediate acetyl coa agler et al 2012a kucek et al 2016b which is then coupled to scfa as the electron acceptor ea to elongate the two carbon chain at each cycle and simultaneously facilitate energy harvest cavalcante et al 2017 stadtman and barker 1949 several reduced organics including ethanol lactate methanol d galactitol galactose and sucrose have been utilized as eds to generate mcfa at large production disparities of 0 74 12 8 g l agler et al 2012a jeon et al 2011 kucek et al 2016a steinbusch et al 2011 zhu et al 2015 a comparison with previously reported studies table s1 supplementary information si indicates that ethanol and lactate are considered the most suitable eds for the ce process however ethanol and lactate still exhibit their respective shortcomings which largely limit substrate utilization ratio and mcfas productivity when ethanol is used as an ed co2 needs to be supplemented constantly since the corresponding mcfa forming bacteria require co2 as a carbon source to synthesize protein seedorf et al 2008 which undoubtedly increases the production cost moreover high concentrations of ethanol 200 400 mm show toxicity for microbiomes and inhibit mcfa synthesis angenent et al 2016 though diluting the substrate could alleviate ethanol toxicity it also sacrifices mcfa production efficiency angenent et al 2016 liu et al 2017 when lactate is used as an ed part of lactate is converted into propionate via the acrylate pathway to diverge the lactate carbon flow and thus reduce the conversion ratio of lactate into mcfa kucek et al 2016a furthermore a third of the carbon in lactate is released as co2 in the necessary step of lactate oxidization into acetyl coa which contributes to another consumption of the lactate carbon flow if these dispersive carbon fluxes can be transformed into mcfa again mcfa productivity would be largely improved based on the aforementioned shortcomings of ethanol or lactate as sole eds it was hypothesized that the redundant co2 released from the lactate carbon flow might exactly compensate for the co2 shortage in the ethanol guided ce lactate as the functionally equivalent ed with ethanol could be replenished into the low concentrations of ethanol guided ce to not only avoid the toxicity of ethanol for microbiomes but also guarantee a high mcfa production efficiency therefore a combination of ethanol and lactate as co eds might form a cooperative relationship to facilitate the conversion of substrate into mcfa more efficiently this implies that complex organics that contain the two eds could exhibit significantly better mcfa production performance than previously used substrates this conjecture was never proposed and verified before for reasons concerning economic costs and eco friendly considerations mcfa is inclined to be produced from organic wastes previous studies have focused on organic wastes containing ethanol or lactate such as yeast fermentation beer agler et al 2012a ge et al 2015 syngas fermentation effluent gildemyn et al 2017 vasudevan et al 2014 wine lees kucek et al 2016c and acid whey xu et al 2018 however organic wastes that contain various eds have hardly been used for mcfa production and whether some cooperative effects exist in such substrates has not been investigated therefore the chinese liquor making wastewater clmw which consists of lactate ethanol acetate n butyrate n caproate polysaccharide etc was used as a representative of such organic wastes to investigate its mcfa production ability the clmw is characterized by high output about 120 000 tons year in china and superior recycling value the chemical oxygen demand cod concentration reaches up to 10 45 g l cao et al 2010 however the current resource recovery methods for clmw generally concentrate on distilling ethanol extracting organic acids manufacturing esterified liquid and producing methane these technologies are characterized by high recycling costs significant resource wastage and low value products and therefore not appealing to winery enterprises consequently a majority of the clmw is discarded directly therefore the recovery of high value mcfa might be a commercially viable way for clmw reutilization in this study the mcfa production performances product components and respective microbiome characteristics from different combinations of eds and eas were systematically compared to verify the existence of a cooperative relationship in the co eds of ethanol and lactate during the ce process subsequently the clmw was fed as a substrate to investigate its mcfa production feasibility and performance moreover the possible relationships and reaction pathways between the various co existing eds and eas were also extensively discussed based on the experiment phenomena key discriminative microbial taxa and the energy harvest yield rate comparisons the research is expected to guide the selection and manipulation of the feedstock for mcfa production as well as provide a novel way for the clmw recycling 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum clmw and medium the inoculum used in this study was a mixture of pit mud and activated sludge pit mud was obtained from the brewing fermentation pit of a strong aroma type liquor distillery chengde china which also provided the clmw the activated sludge was collected from the secondary sedimentation tank of wenchang wastewater treatment plant harbin china the detailed information for pit mud clmw and the fermentation medium are shown in table s2 2 2 comparison of mcfa production performance for different substrate combinations in this study 17 substrates with different combinations of eds and eas were established and their details are presented in table 1 to avoid the toxic limits of mcfa and ethanol for microorganisms and enable the ce each substrate was controlled with an ed ea molar ratio of 3 and a total carbon concentration of 400 mm 2 bromoethanosulfonic acid 10 g l was added to the medium to inhibit methanogenesis the ph was adjusted to 6 5 0 1 a total of 17 batch tests were performed in triplicates in 1 l serum bottles the reactors were purged with nitrogen gas 99 9 and then stirred in an air bath shaker 35 1 c 120 rpm after 30 days of cultivation the fermentation broths in the batch reactors were dumped and the acclimatized inoculums were transferred to their respective fresh substrates for another 30 days the experimental data in this study were obtained from the latter 30 days operation 2 3 mcfa production from the clmw because the composition of the substrate fed into reactor r12 was similar to the clmw and the microbiome of r12 was enriched with abundant mcfa producing bacteria the microbiome from r12 was inoculated in the reactors that were fed with clmw to assess its mcfa production performance the operating parameters were the same as those mentioned in 2 2 2 4 illumina sequencing of 16s rrna genes after the mcfa production the microbial dna of 18 samples 17 samples mentioned in section 2 2 and one sample mentioned in section 2 3 were extracted using the z n atm mag bind soil dna kit omega biotek usa according to the standard protocol pcr amplifications of the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene were conducted with the primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 the construction of sequencing libraries and paired end sequencing were performed at an illumina miseq platform at sangon biotech co ltd shanghai china 2 5 chemical analyses 5 ml samples were collected from each reactor every day and filtered with a 0 45 μm filter for component test ethanol scfas and mcfas were analyzed by a gas chromatograph gc 7890 agilent technologies usa which was equipped with a flame ionization detector and a 30 m 0 25 mm db wax polyethylene glycol capillary column the inlet and detector temperatures were set at 220 and 240 c respectively the column temperature program increased the temperature from an initial 70 170 c with a temperature ramp of 20 c min and maintained at 170 c for 5 min followed by a temperature ramp of 20 c min to 240 c lactate was measured by a waters acquity ultra performance liquid chromatograph system equipped with an hss t3 column 2 1 50 mm 1 8 μm waters gas sample compositions h2 methane and co2 were determined by a gc 7890 agilent technologies usa equipped with a thermal conductivity detector the temperatures of the injector oven and detector were set at 120 100 and 150 c respectively 2 6 data analyses the differences in microbiomes for different eds at phylum class order family and genus levels were compared using the linear discriminant effect size lefse firstly the different features among the biological classes were distinguished using lefse subsequently standard tests were performed to estimate the statistical significance and finally the linear discriminant analysis lda was used to estimate the effect size of each discriminately abundant feature segata et al 2011 here the lefse was conducted with α value of 0 05 for the kruskal wallis test and the lda score log10 more than 3 for discriminative features borton et al 2017 the energy flow of the substrate into mcfa was presented as selectivity which is an estimation for the conversion rate of substrate into the mcfas and is calculated with the electron equivalents of products dividing by the consumed electrons from participant substrates zhu et al 2015 the detailed formula is shown in si 3 results 3 1 comparisons of mcfa productions compositions and selectivities 3 1 1 ce performance under different eas seventeen substrate combinations consisting of different eds and eas were conducted to compare the performance differences in substrate utilization and mcfa synthesis fig 1 obviously mcfa was hardly synthesized with sole scfas r15 17 and the successful ce required the participation of eds for each ed acetate n butyrate and n caproate were selected as eas to investigate their ce abilities n butyrate has been hypothesized to be a more efficient ea than acetate for ce due to an omitted step of elongating acetate into n butyrate ge et al 2015 however the obtained research results have not confirmed and explained this conjecture the pairwise comparisons r1 and r2 r5 and r6 and r9 and r10 indicated that n butyrate as an ea did not show advantage for ce performance on the contrary mcfa productions and selectivities in r2 r6 and r10 n butyrate as ea were lower than those in r1 r5 and r9 acetate as ea respectively therein in comparison to acetate n butyrate increased n caprylate selectivity reduced n caproate selectivity and scarcely affected n heptylate generation indicating n butyrate as ea could be advantageous for n caprylate generation when n caproate was used as an ea r3 r7 and r11 negligible n caproate was elongated into n caprylate whereas most n caproate was disintegrated into acetate and n butyrate moreover high concentrations of n caproate and ethanol lactate were remained in the fermentation broth the limited substrate utilization ratios in r3 r7 and r11 led to much lower mcfa productions and selectivities than other reactors in groups 1 2 and 3 respectively consequently n caproate was unsuitable as a sole ea however the substrate utilizations and mcfa syntheses in r4 r8 and r12 with low concentrations of acetate n butyrate and n caproate 13 3 mm as co eas were not suppressed on the contrary higher mcfa productions were achieved the higher mcfa productions obtained in r4 r8 and r12 were partly reflected in their higher n caprylate productions 3 1 2 ce performance under different eds in this section because of the unsuccessful ce in r3 r7 and r11 caused by the sole ea of n caproate the eds in groups 1 3 were compared by excluding the three tests as shown in fig 1 ce performances of substrates that contained both eds and eas were better than those without eas by jointly comparing the total mcfa productions and selectivities obtained from the same eas ethanol as an ed was more competitive than lactate for mcfa production which was mainly reflected in the highly effective n caproate synthesis from ethanol however ethanol was less competitive than lactate for n caprylate generation moreover ethanol and lactate coexistence group 3 resulted in higher productions and selectivities for both n heptylate and n caprylate when compared to the separate effects of ethanol or lactate it was also noted that the propionate concentrations in group 2 were significantly higher than group 1 and meanwhile the propionate was also largely obtained in r14 lactate as sole substrate this phenomenon corroborated the existence of a competing acrylate pathway which induced the lactate carbon flux toward propionate and thus reduced mcfa selectivity kucek et al 2016a it was surprisingly observed that the average selectivities of propionate and n heptylate were 15 24 and 4 54 in group 2 while those in group 3 were 2 23 and 11 18 respectively in addition the highest total mcfa production 804 49 35 96 mg cod g cod and selectivity 80 26 4 566 were obtained in r12 among all the tests suggesting the combination of co eds of ethanol and lactate and the aforementioned co eas further enhanced mcfa production 3 2 mcfa production from clmw clmw was fed into the microbiome of r12 to test its mcfa production ability the concentration changes of substrates and products in the mcfa production process are shown in fig 2 a and their respective change rates are compared with the semi logarithmic graph fig s1 it was found a lag time about 8 days were needed for microorganisms to acclimatize the complex substrates subsequently the concentrations of scfas including acetate propionate and n butyrate increased which could be mostly generated from the acidification of polysaccharides in clmw ethanol and lactate concentrations decreased rapidly from day 9 along with increased n caproate concentration during this period the decreased ethanol and lactate were converted mostly into acetate which was subsequently partly elongated into n butyrate and n caproate by coupling with the intermediate of acetyl coa about 12 days later n caproate concentration increased exponentially and n heptylate production started meanwhile the concentrations of acetate propionate and n butyrate reduced dramatically when n caproate concentration reached about 6090 32 mg cod l n caprylate production started at a growth rate that was quicker than that of n caproate fig s1 mcfa production was slowed down from day 27 due to near complete consumption of both lactate and ethanol at the end of the run considering ethanol lactate and scfas as the carbon sources of ce the selectivities of n caproate n heptylate and n caprylate were 59 23 3 13 8 96 0 37 and 12 15 0 57 and their eventual concentrations were 12331 10 379 91 1889 59 86 95 and 2832 06 113 28 mg cod l respectively table s3 the total mcfa selectivity was 80 34 5 26 which was slightly superior to that obtained from other organic wastes table s4 fig 2b shows the carbon distribution at the end of the mcfa production from clmw n caproate occupied the maximum carbon flow of 60 93 1 84 while n heptylate and n caprylate accounted for 8 98 0 4 and 12 59 0 52 respectively about 6 61 0 38 carbon existed in the scfas which could not be further elongated due to the exhausted ethanol and lactate 5 25 0 26 carbon existed in the form of co2 and the remaining 5 64 0 31 could be converted to biomass future research should focus on comprehensive condition optimization to provide technical guidance for higher conversion ratio of clmw to mcfa 3 3 microbial community distribution characteristics phylogenetic analyses of 16s rrna gene sequences at phylum class and genus levels were conducted to quantitatively characterize the microbial communities fig 3 five major phyla including proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes chloroflexi and actinobacteria were detected with different proportions in all the reactors among them proteobacteria was the mutual primary species which probably came from the initial inocula of sludge and pit mud firmicutes the positive contributor for ce agler et al 2012a angenent et al 2016 was significantly enriched in group 3 with an average relative abundance of 45 8 compared to the other three groups 28 05 27 08 and 15 56 respectively moreover firmicutes 61 53 was further enriched and far exceeded proteobacteria 18 70 when the microbiome of r12 was fed with actual clmw and operated for about 40 days this microbiome is labelled as r12 hereafter to simplify the description further analyses were conducted by combining class and genus levels proteobacteria mainly consisted of four classes i e alphaproteobacteria bataproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria compared to the control of group 4 more gammaproteobacteria and less alphaproteobacteria were detected at groups 1 3 except r3 r7 and r11 and r12 that conducted successful ce genus acinetobacter which was affiliated to gammaproteobacteria and was responsible for ce kucek et al 2016a were enriched in groups 1 3 and r12 with undistinguished relative abundances of 9 2 15 2 genera methyloversatilis and dechloromonas that belonged to betaproteobacteria were detected in these reactors with relative abundances of 3 5 7 2 both genera were affiliated to rhodocyclaceae which was observed as the dominant species 70 8 for n caprylate production from ethanol acetate after a long term cultivation kucek et al 2016b implying that these two genera might play important roles in n caprylate generation in this study phylum bacteroidetes mainly consisted of classes bacteroidia and sphingobacteriia both of which were preponderantly distributed in group 2 which also principally enriched their branches including genera of bacteroides mucinivorans petrimonas and macellibacteroides besides genus corynebacterium belonging to phylum actinobacteria also showed a strong response in group 2 with a significantly higher relative abundance than that in groups 1 and 3 classes clostridia negativicutes and bacilli were the three main members of firmicutes clostridia was distributed with higher relative abundances of 17 8 26 21 18 3 27 55 and 32 2 in group 1 group 3 and r12 respectively than that in group 2 11 07 14 61 clostridia consisted of 11 genera among which clostridium iv and clostridium sensu stricto were its major members clostridium iv was enriched in groups 1 2 3 and r12 with average relative abundances of 7 02 7 93 6 88 and 14 48 respectively the much higher relative abundance of clostridium iv observed in r12 suggested the strong adaptability and metabolic capability of clostridium iv to complex substrate clostridium sensu stricto clostridium iii clostridium xiva and clostridium xivb could also be equipped with ce ability which were preponderantly distributed in group 1 group 3 r13 and r12 indicating these species were mainly related to the mcfa production from ethanol in contrast class negativicutes and its genera veillonella and megasphaera were almost only enriched in group 2 group 3 and r12 and these species occupied overwhelming proportions in group 3 and r12 compared to group 2 another class bacilli consisted of genera oscillibacter and lactobacillus oscillibacter was beneficial for n caproate and n caprylate productions when ethanol or lactate were used as eds angenent et al 2016 kucek et al 2016a 2016b in this study oscillibacter also appeared in groups 1 3 and r12 with undifferentiated scales however lactobacillus which is known for lactate fermentation was mainly detected in groups 2 3 r14 and r12 moreover r12 enriched much higher relative abundance of lactobacillus than other reactors implying that lactobacillus might also be potentially conductive to mcfa generation 4 discussion 4 1 improved mcfa production performance from co eds the higher mcfa production and selectivity obtained from the co eds of ethanol and lactate in contrast to their individual existence could be attributed to their cooperative effects which were manifested in the following three parts fig 4 part i mutual complementarity of the metabolites for every 5 molecules of ethanol that were used as the ed the mcfa forming bacteria needed to completely oxidize 1 molecule of ethanol into acetate and h2 to obtain energy ge et al 2015 besides the other 2 molecules of h2 would be released from the reduced ferredoxin catalyzed by hydrogenase angenent et al 2016 the more h2 released from ethanol than that from lactate benefited the mcfa accumulation since a hydrogen partial pressure higher than 0 03 atm could avoid the oxidations of carboxylate and ethanol grootscholten et al 2014 compared with group 2 groups 1 and 3 assuredly kept higher h2 percentages in the headspace fig s2 which were all higher than the hydrogen partial pressure of 0 03 atm excluding the effects from h2 concentration the worse mcfa generation efficiency in group 1 when compared to group 3 could be partly ascribed to the shortage of co2 which was an essential substrate for ce due to the protein synthesis in many mcfa producers require the participation of sufficient co2 as a carbon source seedorf et al 2008 similar to group 1 co2 deficiency also caused low mcfa productivity and long lag time in the early study of ce from ethanol acetate angenent et al 2016 steinbusch et al 2011 when lactate was used as the ed lactate was first oxidized to pyruvate then an equimolar co2 was released through the further oxidation of three carbon pyruvate to two carbon acetyl coa by pyruvate decarboxylase thus co2 concentration could be enough for successful ce from lactate and there was also little research showing the additional needs of co2 in the lactate guided ce in contrast previously many researchers have supplied exogenetic co2 to enhance ce efficiency from ethanol grootscholten et al 2013 2014 roghair et al 2018 in the ce process the average co2 content in group 1 was 8 33 while co2 accounted for 43 27 and 25 67 of total gas in groups 2 and 3 respectively fig s2 which might support this conjecture part ii supererogatory substrate formation there was almost no observation of biogas release besides the methane accounted for less than 4 of the total headspace gas implying that hydrogenotrophic and acetotrophic methanogens were effectively inhibited by the addition of 2 bromoethanosulfonic acid therefore hydrogenotrophic methanogens could not compete for h2 to produce methane excess h2 and co2 released from the ce of ethanol and lactate could form acetate and ethanol again through homoacetogenesis and acetate reduction and subsequently the acetate and ethanol could be further converted into mcfa by reverse β oxidation angenent et al 2016 grootscholten et al 2013 the feasibilities of these reactions were verified by zhang et al 2013 who obtained considerable yields of acetate n butyrate n caproate and n caprylate by just adding molecular h2 and co2 to a mixed culture in addition increased ethanol acetate n butyrate and n caproate concentrations were detected after the complete consumption of ethanol and lactate from day 27 fig 2a implying the coexisting by products of h2 and co2 led to a supererogatory mcfa production which was one of the important reasons for the higher mcfa production from the simultaneous use of ethanol and lactate as co eds part iii enhanced n heptylate generation from propionate as mentioned previously considerable propionate formation from the competing acrylate pathway in the lactate guided ce process branched the lactate carbon flux to lower mcfa selectivity according to prabhu et al 2012 when the available lactate concentration was high enough a part of lactate carbon would flow toward the acrylate pathway lactyl coa and propionyl coa were formed sequentially as the intermediates and were further converted into propionate recently kucek et al 2016a proposed that propionate formation could be restrained in the continuous flow reactor equipped with in line product extraction unit by maintaining residual lactate concentration near zero and decreasing the operation ph to 5 0 however a low ph of 5 could be unfavorable for enhancing the mcfa production for reactors without the product extraction unit because an acidic ph of 5 0 resulted in an abundant existence of mcfa with the undissociated states the pka of carboxylic acids were 4 8 4 9 which would consequently seriously suppress the microbial growth agler et al 2012a in this study it was interestingly found that significantly higher n heptylate concentrations and lower propionate concentrations were obtained in group 3 than those in group 2 this implies that co eds of ethanol and lactate could promote the elongation of propionate into n heptylate which could be ascribed to the increased concentration of available acetyl coa from ethanol as a result the dispersive lactate carbon flux from the acrylate pathway was finally transformed into mcfa in conclusion some cooperation existed between ethanol and lactate in the ce process which made up for the respective shortcomings of ethanol and lactate improved the conversion ratio of substrate into mcfa and formed a more favorable environment for the mcfa producer the research results also widened the feedstock types suitable for ce organic wastes that contained these two eds and various eas were expected to be directly used for mcfa production while others that complemented each other could be combined to produce mcfa 4 2 the key discriminative microflora in the co eds of ethanol and lactate lefse was utilized to specifically identify the key discriminative microbial taxa that caused the discrepant ce performances from the co eds and to compare them with those from only ethanol or lactate the corresponding lda values quantitatively evaluated the influencing degrees according to the cladogram from lefse analysis fig 5 and the corresponding lda values fig s3 12 37 and 8 bacterial clades lda scores log10 3 showed statistically significant and biologically consistent differences in groups 1 2 and 3 respectively group 1 was characterized by a preponderance of proteobacteria with an average relative abundance of 45 8 other two groups were 34 52 and 30 36 respectively lda score log10 5 the following data displayed in this order however group 2 was enriched with preponderant bacteroidetes 17 69 7 09 7 44 4 chloroflexi 2 3 0 74 0 44 3 planctomycetes 1 30 0 54 0 63 3 and synergistetes 1 04 0 08 0 34 3 the dominant enrichment of bacteroides spp in group 2 was reasonable due to bacteroides spp was positively correlated with n caproate synthesis from lactate kucek et al 2016a firmicutes 48 36 27 75 26 51 4 contained abundant ce related bacteria was more enriched in group 3 from the nodes shown in fig 5 the discriminated firmicutes consisted of three main classes which were consistent with the aforementioned analysis therein classes clostridia and bacilli did not stimulate the discrepant ce performances it was also noticed that the type strain clostridium kluyveri affiliated to clostridia best known for producing n caproate from ethanol acetate was almost undiscovered in all the reactors previously c kluyveri was also absent or rare in other ce microbiomes with ethanol acetate as substrates kucek et al 2016b 2016c in addition to c kluyveri many other clostridia related bacteria with genes of reverse β oxidation can also carry out ce agler et al 2012a just as the identification result clostridium iv clostridium sensu stricto clostridium iii clostridium xiva and clostridium xivb were enriched in large quantities in our reactors and played a positive role in mcfa production class negativicutes and its members including the order selenomonadales family veillonellaceae and genus veillonella all with lda score log10 4 were discriminated as the primary species that distinguished group 3 from the others negativicutes on an average accounted for 16 80 of the total microorganism in group 3 but accounted for only 0 48 and 6 61 in groups 1 and 2 respectively megasphaera elsdenii belonged to negativicutes was previously known as the only strain for n caproate production from lactate kucek et al 2016a similar to the observation results of c kluyveri m elsdenii was also scarce in these microbiomes it is likely that pure cultures such as c kluyveri and m elsdenii could not adapt to the complicated environment in the mixed culture fermentation another genus veillonella affiliated to family veillonellaceae occupied significant proportions in group 3 especially in r10 15 7 and r12 16 13 however it was only 4 48 in group 2 and was absent in group 1 the genera from family veillonellaceae were considered as the closest species to m elsdenii kucek et al 2016a the nodes in fig 5 revealed that family veillonellaceae mainly consisted of two genera therein veillonella was the only discriminant genus hence the discriminative high proportioned veillonella could play an analogous role with m elsdenii in the ce and bring about the discrepant mcfa production performances ruminococcaceae was proven to be positively correlated with ce and n caproate production agler et al 2012a 2012b as mentioned earlier clostridium iv which was affiliated to ruminococcaceae promoted carboxylate elongation except clostridium iv three other members from ruminococcaceae which distributed preponderantly in group 3 were identified by lefse therein genera intestinimonas and desulfitobacterium both with lda score log10 4 were found almost only in group 3 with relative abundances of 1 05 2 27 and sporobacter lda score log10 3 took up much higher relative abundances of 4 26 5 66 in group 3 in contrast to the other two 1 in summary the abundant mcfa forming bacteria species in group 3 contributed to its superior mcfa production ability additionally the identified several discriminative microbial taxa that were positively associated with ce might play a key role in the different mcfa production performances observed in the presence of co eds and in the presence of individual eds of ethanol or lactate 4 3 thermodynamic comparison based on energy harvest yield and rate in an energy limited microbial ecosystem like ce efficient microbiomes compete for available energy avoid unnecessary energy loss and promote energy harvest gonzalez cabaleiro et al 2015 when the available substrates are abundant the reactions with higher energy harvest yields energy harvesting per unit of substrate consumption have advantages otherwise the reactions with higher energy harvest rates energy harvesting per unit time are more competitive schuster et al 2008 given the decisive role of energy harvest for a reaction the trade off between the yields and rates of energy harvest were analyzed to investigate the feasible competitive or cooperative reactions in the ce process according to an energy based model proposed by gonzalez cabaleiro et al 2015 energy harvest yield could be estimated using the gibbs energy change per mol substrate in this study the actual gibbs energy change δ g 35 c 0 was corrected at a temperature of 35 c with the gibbs helmholz equation kleerebezem and van loosdrecht 2010 the energy harvest rate was positively related to the specific maximum substrate uptake rate q s max moled molcx h 1 and was negatively related to the numbers of electron transfer per mol ed n e mole moled 1 that was also called metabolic labor a relationship q s max 3 n e is existed and the values of ne for each reaction are shown in fig s4 the ratio of δg 0 n e indirectly presented the competitiveness of specific reaction pathways the related parameters for possible reactions are shown in table s5 it was found that even though the oxidation of ethanol and lactate into acetate was endergonic δ g 35 c 0 48 5 kj moled eq e1 or could only gain a low energy yield δ g 35 c 0 12 9 kj moled eq l1 the high q s max derived from a low n e of 4 might allow the reactions to happen successfully besides propionate generation from lactate was positively competitive due to its considerable energy yield δ g 35 c 0 80 3 kj moled eq l2 and low n e of 8 therefore it is significant to inhibit these reactions to avoid the divergence of carbon flow from mcfa generation in the experimental results n butyrate was not as competitive as acetate for the mcfa production the reasons are explained based on energy harvest a pairwise comparing of pathways e3 and e5 and l4 and l6 indicated that n butyrate could accelerate n caproate synthesis compared to acetate since the specific bacteria using n butyrate as the ea involved less n e and higher q s max however n butyrate as an ea could only harvest a lower energy than acetate therefore n butyrate might not have a long term competitive advantage in the energy limited microbial ecosystems as shown in our experiment results however the longer chain n caprylate production from n butyrate might be more competitive than that from acetate since the former involved a higher q s max based on the similar energy harvest yields from eas of acetate and n butyrate eq e4 and e6 l5 and l7 similarly the n caprylate produced from direct elongation of n caproate also involves a higher q s max than from other eas eq e4 e6 and e7 l5 l7 and l8 which could explain the higher n caprylate production obtained from co eas low concentrations of acetate n butyrate and n caproate comparing with sole eas of acetate or n butyrate in addition the direct elongation of n caproate into n caprylate needs less consumption of acetyl coa and thus more acetyl coa is available for elongating acetate and n butyrate as a result co eas are capable of enhancing mcfa production it is noteworthy that due to the concentration of unionized n caproic acid above 20 7 mm would inhibit microbial activity coma et al 2016 the n caproate concentration exceed this limit is unsuitable as an ea it can be summarized from table s5 that by utilizing same substrates a higher energy yield can be obtained from the production of per unit of n caprylate than that from the production of per unit of n caproate but the longer ce pathways also reduce the energy harvest rate just as the experimental observations ce mostly ends up with n caproate instead of n caprylate as the end product this is because n caproate generation with a high energy rate overcomes the n caprylate generation with a high energy yield under the condition of insufficient substrate on the contrary sufficient substrates can reverse the phenomenon this conjecture was supported by the research of kucek et al 2016b which accomplished a high n caprylate to n caproate product ratio of 11 g cod g cod with a high ethanol to acetate ratio of 15 g cod g cod this analysis explained why the microorganism capable of harvesting more overall energy by synthesizing n caprylate were uncompetitive than other organisms that only synthesized n caproate the additional energy gained by one more elongation step may not compensate for the higher metabolic labor from the longer metabolic pathway in addition further ce is difficult since inhibitory effects on the microorganism increased with the extension of the carboxylate chain as a result the thermodynamically feasible reactions of n caprylate production from n caproate and ethanol lactate eq e7 and l8 can hardly be experimentally observed 5 conclusions this study verified that a cooperative relationship was existed between ethanol and lactate when they were used as the co eds of ce process co eds of ethanol and lactate facilitated the elongation of propionate undesired product from competing acrylate pathway into n heptylate and the reutilization of excess h2 and co2 by products from ce process in addition the co eas of acetate n butyrate and n caproate also contributed to a higher mcfa production comparing with the sole ea clmw a representative waste biomass containing both ethanol and lactate was confirmed to be a suitable feedstock to produce mcfa the main components in clmw such as lactate ethanol and scfas could be effectively transformed into mcfa without the additional introduction of eds and eas therefore mcfa production can be proposed as a prospective recycling method for clmw acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china
