9560,agroecosystem models provide valuable insights into agricultural management decisions and can serve as a useful tool to quantify the effects of management practices under varying conditions where field experimentations are impractical we evaluated a newly integrated comprehensive model drainmod dssat for hydrology nitrogen n dynamics and crop yield using eight years 1993 2000 of measured data from a no tilled subsurface drained corn soybean agricultural system near danville illinois the model satisfactorily predicted drainage flow and no3 n losses with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the ratio of the root mean squared error to the standard deviation rsr and percent bias pbias of 0 68 and 0 60 0 56 and 0 63 and 11 6 and 2 2 respectively and crop yield with nrmse pbias and index of agreement d of 8 4 0 6 and 1 respectively for the same experimental dataset the performance comparison of drainmod dssat to root zone water quality model rzwqm2 demonstrated that the two models were most different in their simulation of n loss through seepage and denitrification further we used drainmod dssat to simulate the effects of management practices n application rates and timings on no3 n losses and crop yield and compared them with rzwqm2 simulated results the results showed that both models provided the same conclusion on the effects of n management strategy on no3 n losses and crop yield but they differ in quantity this study supports being cautious in using only one model to conclude the quantification of the effectiveness of particular agricultural management practices keywords nitrogen subsurface drainage crop yield water quality management modeling 1 introduction over the past few decades numerous researchers have focused on reducing the offsite environmental impacts of conventional agricultural practices these extensive studies involve designing and evaluating effective water and nutrient management strategies to curtail no3 n losses from artificially drained agricultural lands while maintaining high agrarian productivity dinnes et al 2002 jaynes 2015 jeong and bhattarai 2018 youssef et al 2018 often of these studies involve the use of agricultural system or agroecosystem models to explore the effects of a wide range of agricultural management practices on hydrology nutrient fate and transport and crop growth and yield models provide time and cost effective alternatives to field experiments and serve as useful tools for evaluating agricultural practices effects over a longer period where experiment alone proves to be impractical thorp et al 2007 youssef and skaggs 2006 the two commonly used models for evaluating a wide range of management practices to curtail no3 n losses from artificially drained agricultural lands across the midwestern corn belt of the united states are rzwqm2 ahuja et al 2000 and drainmod skaggs 1978 drainmod nii youssef et al 2005 rzwqm2 root zone water quality model is a one dimension field scale model that simulates hydrology nutrient and pesticide fate and transport crop growth and agricultural management practice components within and below the crop root zone of a unit area ahuja et al 2000 ma et al 2005 2007 drainmod drainmod nii is a field scale process based model that simulates hydrology and c and n dynamics respectively in drained agricultural lands under a wide range of soil climatic conditions and management practices skaggs and chescheir 2003 skaggs 1978 youssef and skaggs 2006 youssef et al 2005 in recent years an effort has been made to develop a robust agroecosystem model by implementing either a new model or integrating existing models to supplement field experimentation with agroecosystem models when new models are developed or two existing models are integrated to form a new integrated model testing and evaluation become critical ale et al 2013 du et al 2017 adequate evaluation of earlier established models or newly developed models provides better insight into models capability and limitations and helps to improve the model for future research and model credibility thorp et al 2009 in addition comparing the performance of one agroecosystem model with another similar model helps determine the reliability of such models in making reasonable predictions that can be valuable for agricultural management decisions such comparisons are useful to contrast the strengths and weaknesses of each model help in improving the computational processes and enable users to select an appropriate model for an intended purpose thorp et al 2009 evaluated drainmod nii performance to simulate n dynamics for different n application rates under corn soybean agricultural system and compared simulation results with the rzwqm dssat model for the same measured datasets their finding showed that the two models mainly differed in their simulations of soybean n fixation plant n uptake and net n mineralization similarly du et al 2017 used 16 year field experiment data to compare the performance of drainmod nii with rzwqm2 in predicting no3 n concentration and losses at nine n application rates and found drainmod nii performance slightly better in simulating subsurface drainage and no3 n concentration and loss compared to rzwqm2 youssef et al 2018 compared drainmod nii predictions of water and nitrogen budgets for the corn soybean agricultural system under controlled drainage conditions with rzwqm2 results across 48 sites of the midwestern u s their find showed that both the mode predicted similar trends across the region but rzwqm2 predicted higher drainage volumes and no3 n losses under controlled drainage condition compared to drainmod nii these studies focused on how two agroecosystem models perform in predicting hydrology and n dynamics under different management practices and soil and climatic conditions however the drainmod nii model used in these comparison studies lacks a crop growth module compared to rzwqm2 which limitation from the missing component in simulating agricultural systems influences the model prediction in previous work jeong and bhattarai 2018 made an effort to understand the effects of n management alternatives on no3 losses and crop yield using 8 years of extensive field datasets and the rzwqm2 model they used the illinois nutrient loss reduction strategies inlrs iepa and idoa 2015 for managing the n fertilizer application rate to the maximum return to nitrogen mrtn rate along with the other six n application rates and three alternative n application timings to explore alternative n management strategies this study focuses on evaluating the management scenarios used in the previous study to assess the performance of the newly integrated drainmod dssat negm et al 2014 model and determine agreement disagreement between two models in predicting hydrology n dynamics and crop yield this study is the first to use information collected at the site to evaluate the drainmod dssat model the objectives of this study are i to evaluate drainmod dssat using the 8 year dataset from an experimental field with corn soybean rotation under conventional free subsurface drainage and no tillage system ii to compare the drainmod dssat model performance to that of the rzwqm 2 model previously evaluated using the same measured dataset jeong and bhattarai 2018 and iii to compare n management scenarios simulated by drainmod dssat with previous rzwqm2 results of jeong and bhattarai 2018 to determine the influence of these model selection on n management decisions when field experimentation alone is inapplicable 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description the study site is located in vermillion county of east central illinois 39 59 10 0 n 87 43 24 0 w fig 1 according to usda nrcs united states department of agriculture natural resources conservation services soil survey report the soil at the study site is predominantly characterized as sabina silt loam usda taxonomic class fine smectitic and mesic aeric epiaqualfs with 0 5 2 organic content in the surface layer and considered as somewhat poorly drained soil usda nrcs 2009 although several sites were established for long term water quality monitoring research a monitoring dataset from site e from 1993 to 2000 was used for this study the site has a drained area of 7 56 acres with tile drains installed approximately 1 02 m deep on average and spaced 28 m apart the landowners made all the agricultural management decisions and the information on fertilizer application rates methods and timing and crop yields were compiled by researchers in the department of agricultural and biological engineering at the university of illinois table s1 kalita et al 2006 the site was under corn soybean rotation with the no till condition during corn growing seasons fertilizer nitrogen was applied in the spring before planting and as a side dress application later in the spring no nitrogen fertilizer was applied during soybean growing seasons mitchell et al 2000 the drainage flow was continuously monitored using palmer bowlus flumes and data loggers at the drainage outlet for water quality monitoring water samples were collected bi weekly using a grab sampling method and additional samples were collected automatically by the auto samplers when the tile was flowing the collected water samples were analyzed for nitrate n concentration using the hydrazine sulfate reduction method 2 2 model description 2 2 1 drainmod dssat drainmod dssat is a newly integrated comprehensive agroecosystem model developed to simulated hydrology biogeochemical and crop growth and yield under different agricultural management practices and soil and climatic conditions this integrated model comprises three widely used models i drainmod skaggs 1978 water management model for simulating water and heat flow ii drainmod nii youssef et al 2005 companion model of drainmod for simulating the effects of agricultural management practices on soil carbon c and nitrogen n dynamics iii ceres maize jones et al 1986 and cropgro soybean jones et al 1986 of dssat v4 0 hoogenboom et al 2004 a suite of deterministic crop models for simulating effects of crop genetics climate and soil moisture and fertility conditions on plant phenological development and growth briefly drainmod simulates hydrologic variables infiltration subsurface drainage evapotranspiration water table depth surface runoff seepage soil water distribution in the unsaturated zone using one dimensional soil water balance at mid point between two parallel drains at each time step hourly and daily skaggs 1978 skaggs et al 2012 in the model the infiltration rate is computed using the green ampt equation green and ampt 1911 and surface runoff occurs after the ponded water on the soil surface exceeds the user defined depressional storage the model computes drainage rates using the steady state hooghdoudt equation bouwer and van schilfgaarde 1963 when the water table is below the soil surface and the kirkham equation kirkham 1957 under ponded condition potential evapotranspiration pet is either calculated by the model using the thornthwaite 1957 method or calculated separately by the user and provide to the model as input the model also simulates the effects of soil freezing thawing and snow accumulation and melt on hydrologic predictions in cold climates luo et al 2000 drainmod nii youssef et al 2005 simulates a detailed soil n cycle based on a one dimensional advection dispersion reaction equation the model simulates three soil n pools nitrate nitrogen no3 n ammoniacal nitrogen nhx n and organic nitrogen on the nhx n pool is set optional in the model so it may be ignored when soil and environmental conditions do not favor its accumulation in the soil if the nhx n pool is ignored the model simulates mineral n similar to the brevé et al 1997 the n transformation processes considered in the model simulates atmospheric deposition n fixation by legumes plant n uptake application of mineral n fertilizers and on sources plant residues animal waste n mineralization immobilization nitrification denitrification ammonia volatilization n losses subsurface drainage vertical and lateral seepage and surface runoff the sub model adapted from the century model parton et al 1987 of drainmod nii simulates soil c dynamics that considers three soil organic matter som pools active slow and passive youssef et al 2005 for further detail on draimod drainmod nii readers are referred to skaggs 1978 skaggs et al 2012 and youssef et al 2005 the ceres maize crop module uses similar principles applied in ceres crop models described by ritchie et al 1998 to simulate corn growth development and yield cropgro soybean simulates the growth and yield of soybean it is a process oriented model and considers crop carbon balance crop and soil n balance and soil water balance the details on crop modules and their simulation processes can be found in the dssat related literature boote et al 1998 hoogenboom et al 2004 jones et al 1986 drainmod dssat integration allows full data transfer and feedback between the individual models drainmod reads input parameters on a daily time step and calls drainmod nii for model initialization and parameterization of c and n dynamics on the first day of the crop growing season the crop module called for initialization and set up a new plant life cycle during the crop growing season drainmod provides the crop model with daily soil water content soil temperature weather data maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation and potential evapotranspiration pet and drainmod nii provides available soil n for plant uptake the crop modules then convert drainmod predicted pet into pt0 potential plant transpiration using the light extinction coefficient and simulated lai the actual daily root water uptake is either equal to or less than drainmod calculated et if the root water uptake is not sufficient the crop model uses two stress factors swfac and turfac to compute the stress on plant growth and development after the crop module completes crop growth simulation it returns the effective rooting depth and actual plant n uptake to drainmod and drainmod nii to complete soil water and n balance simulation for the day and update soil water and n profile for the next day of the simulation respectively on the last day of the growing period the crop model provides drainmod nii with unharvested biomass above and below the ground and related n contents for residue recycling during the non growing season simulation becomes limited to soil water and n balance components 2 2 2 rzwqm2 rzwqm2 is a field scale agroecosystem model that simulates the effect of agricultural management practices on crop production and soil and water quality ahuja et al 2000 ma et al 2012 it is a one dimensional model and consists of physical soil chemical nutrient pesticide plant growth and management processes the model contains plant growth modules from dssat crop modules for 22 field crops the crop growth n balance and pesticide modules run on a daily time step whereas soil water soil heat transfer and surface energy balance modules use sub hourly time step the model can simulate a soil profile up to 30 m deep with a single crop grown at any given time and accommodate up to 200 events for each management practice including tillage planting dates fertilization manure application etc for further details on the model readers may refer to ahuja et al 2000 and ma et al 2012 2 3 drainmod dssat and rzwqm2 comparison drainmod and drainmod nii are not fully integrated and have only a graphical user friendly windows interface designed to execute drainmod for hydrology and call drainmod nii for simulating c and n dynamics the integration of dssat with drainmod and drainmod nii is created in a single shell under which data transfer and feedback are established on a daily time step negm 2011 with regard to the model design and integration both models integrate hydrology nutrient and crop growth simulations on a daily time step however drainmod dssat and rzwm2 differ in their simulation methods for et soil water distribution and water storage on the soil surface drainmod dssat simulates surface water storage whereas rzwqm2 does not drainmod dssat uses a temperature based thornthwaite 1948 equation to compute potential evapotranspiration pet whereas rzwqm2 uses the shuttleworth wallace double layer form of the original penman monteith et model farahani and decoursey 2000 drainmod dssat simulates soil water contents in saturated and unsaturated zones and uses richards s equation for two dimensional flow rzwqm2 uses a numerical solution of richards s equation to compute soil water redistribution to simulate subsurface drainage flow drainmod dssat uses the steady state hooghoudt equation when the water table is below the soil surface and when the soil surface is under ponded condition it uses kirkham s equation rzwqm2 employs only the steady state hooghoudt equation to compute water flux to the subsurface drains both models use the darcy equation to calculate seepage and the green and ampt equation for infiltration the c n dynamics in drainmod dssat is simulated by drainmod nii based on the century model by parton et al 1987 whereas rzwmq2 uses omni organic matter and nitrogen module developed by shaffer et al 2000 drainmod nii simulates one microbial pool that acts only on the surface residue it also simulates two above ground and two below ground residue pools all of which interact in the nutrient cycling algorithm on the other hand rzwqm2 simulates three microbial pools that act within the layers of the soil profile and it simulates two below ground residue pools in rzwqm2 the surface residue is quantified and incorporated but is not considered in the nutrient cycling algorithm the solute transport through the soil profile is estimated with an advection dispersion reaction equation in drainmod nii whereas rzwqm2 uses sequential partial piston displacement and mixing method 2 4 model parameterization and initialization drainmod dssat requires several input parameters including soil weather and management practices to simulate hydrological and biogeochemical processes the drainage system design parameters used for this site are presented in table 1 for this study the same weather dataset used by jeong and bhattarai 2018 was used soil data was referenced from the nrcs soil survey report for vermillion county il and jeong and bhattarai 2018 in the previous work with rzwqm2 jeong and bhattarai 2018 simulated a seven layer soil profile for this site but drainmod accepts only a five layer soil profile thus the number of soil layers was reduced from that used for rzwqm2 by combining the soil layers with the most similar properties using similar approach described thorp et al 2009 and the drainmod utilities input file preparation program was used to prepare soil file water retention characteristics were based on that from the previous calibration of rzwqm2 therefore no further adjustment was made on the relationships for volume drained and upward flux versus water table depth similarly saturated hydraulic conductivity values from jeong and bhattarai 2018 were used to initialize the model and adjustments were made within a reasonable range during the model calibration process the soil temperature parameters were referenced from singh et al 2020 who recently used drainmod dssat for a nearby site for drainmod dssat simulation management inputs for tillage and fertilizer were set according to actual field practices over the study period the major n transport and transformation and som parameters for drainmod dssat used for this study are presented in table 2 the field was under no tillage condition during the entire period and therefore the no tillage option was used in addition the fertilizer was applied only during the corn years the model was set to recycle plant roots and shoots back into the soil after harvest the concentration of no3 n and nh4 n in the rainwater was set 1 4 mg l 1 and 0 4 mg l 1 respectively same as jeong and bhattarai 2018 and were obtained from the national atmospheric deposition program nadp gay 2008 the crop growth models ceres maize and cropgro soybean require a number of crop specific parameters to simulate plant growth and development in response to variation in the environmental conditions in this study we used previously calibrated crop growth parameters table s2 by jeong and bhattarai 2018 for ceres maize and cropgro soybean for the crop yield simulation jeong and bhattarai 2018 adjusted crop growth parameters to improve the rzwqm2 performance during the model calibration process those adjustments include the duration of the juvenile phase p1 duration of reproductive phase p5 and potential kernel number g2 for corn and the critical short day length csdl and maximum weight per seed wtpsd for soybean in this study we used crop growth parameters from jeong and bhattarai 2018 without any further modifications 2 5 model calibration and evaluation to calibrate and evaluate the model the measured dataset was partitioned into two units in the same way as the previous study with rzwqm2 jeong and bhattarai 2018 the data from the period 1993 1996 was used for model calibration and the dataset from the period 1997 2000 was used for model validation each partitioned period covered two sets of corn soybean rotation likewise a warm up period from1990 1992 was used for model initialization the hydrologic component calibration was performed by adjusting a few parameters to improve error metrics between the measured drainage flow and simulated drainage flow the hydrologic calibration focused mainly on adjusting the lateral hydraulic conductivity of soil layers and maximum surface storage the model calibration for nutrient components primarily focused on parameter adjustments for the longitudinal dispersivity denitrification rate and soc transformation to improve error metrics between simulated and measured n leaching losses no calibration was performed for crop growth and yield similar to jeong and bhattarai 2018 the criteria used for model calibration and validation followed both statistical and graphical approaches the performance of the drainmod dssat was evaluated with the observed data of tile flow tile no3 n loss and crop yields using nash sutcliffe efficiency e ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 root mean square error observations standard deviation ratio rsr singh et al 2004 percent bias pbias the index of agreement d willmott et al 1985 and the normalized root mean square error nrmse loague and green 1991 on monthly time scale the model performance was considered to be satisfactory if e ns 0 5 and rsr 0 7 and if pbias 25 for tile flow and 70 for n moriasi et al 2007 likewise the model performance in simulating crop yields on annual time scale was considered excellent when nrmse 10 good if 10 nrmse 20 fair if 20 nrmse 30 and poor if nrmse 30 jamieson et al 1991 the graphical method helped assess anomalies in the simulated values and check overall model performance over the period of 8 years the graphical comparison of measured and simulated values performed using time series and scatter plots the statistical comparison of measured and simulated values was evaluated using the nash sutcliffe efficiency ens nash and sutcliffe 1970 the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr singh et al 2004 the percent bias pbais the index of agreement d willmott et al 1985 and the normalized root mean square error nrmse loague and green 1991 for monthly and annual data aggregations 2 6 management scenarios after calibration and validation of drainmod dssat management scenarios tested by jeong and bhattarai 2018 presented in table 3 were simulated using drainmod dssat and the results from both the models were compared the n application rates evaluated include base n application rate of 150 kg n ha 1 mrtn maximum return to nitrogen rate of 193 kg n ha 1 and reduced n application rate by 10 50 of the base rate the n application timing followed the recommendation from the illinois nutrient loss reduction strategies report iepa and idoa 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of model performance 3 1 1 hydrology the annual water balance simulated by the drainmod dssat and rzwqm2 model and model performance evaluation for monthly drain flow for the calibration and validation period is presented in table 4 overall drainmod dssat simulated monthly hydrologic response satisfactorily over the period of 1993 2000 with nse rsr and pbias of 0 68 0 56 and 2 2 respectively according to model evaluation guidelines suggested by skaggs et al 2012 and moriasi et al 2007 the simulated monthly drainage flow for calibration and validation periods were ranged satisfactory to good with nse rsr and pbias of 0 62 and 0 77 0 61 and 0 48 and 0 7 and 6 3 respectively table 4 in contrast rzwqm2 simulated monthly drainage flow from 1993 to 2000 with nse rsr and pbias of 0 55 0 67 and 7 respectively the monthly drainage simulations for rzwqm2 were satisfactory for both calibration and validation period with nse rsr and pbias of 0 56 and 0 51 0 66 and 0 69 and 2 and 14 0 respectively this result indicates that the drainage flow simulated by drainmod dssat was in closer agreement with the observations than the rzwqm2 simulations the precipitation amount ranged from 74 1 cm in 2000 to 131 5 cm in 1993 the difference in the reported precipitation values used as input in drainmod dssat versus rzwqm2 is due to rounding errors in the formatting of the model input files the annual simulated drainage flow followed the precipitation patterns over the 8 year study period with a minimum drain flow of 7 8 cm in 2000 and a maximum of 38 4 cm in 1993 during the calibration period drainmod dssat overestimated drainage flow by 1 and rzwqm2 underestimated drainage flow by 2 whereas during the validation period the models underestimated drainage flow by 6 and 14 respectively the annual et simulated by drainmod dssat ranged from 49 7 cm in 1997 to 66 3 cm in 1998 with rzwqm2 the simulated et ranged from 39 4 cm in 1996 to 77 7 cm in 1999 the deviation in both models simulated et is due to the difference in et calculation methods adopted in both the models and the monthly adjustment factors used for the thornthwaite method in drainmod dssat the overall et balance over 8 years simulated by drainmod dssat and rzwqm2 were around 60 and 59 of total precipitation respectively the partitioning of modeled annual et was found consistent with fang et al 2012 and thorp et al 2007 for nearby sites and within the range of 60 69 as reported by sanford and selnick 2013 for central illinois drainmod dssat simulated runoff ranged from 0 0 cm in 2000 to 28 4 cm in 1998 whereas rzwqm2 simulated runoff ranged from 1 3 cm in 1999 to 23 4 cm in 1998 the annual simulated seepage by drainmod dssat and rzwqm2 ranged from 7 7 cm in 1999 to 9 1 cm in 1993 and 7 6 cm in 2000 to 23 cm in 1993 respectively the overall simulated water balance by both the models over the period of 8 years was very similar to some variation in average surface runoff amount and seepage rate the average difference in the simulated surface runoff and seepage between drainmod dssat and rzwqm2 was 4 6 cm and 6 1 cm respectively this deviation in the surface runoff and seepage predictions attributed to maximum surface storage and soil temperature affecting the infiltration rate during winter months in drainmod dssat however both models over predicted the surface runoff compared to the measured surface runoff from 1993 to 1998 which only accounts for 2 5 of total precipitation algoazany et al 2007 the change in simulated soil water storage ranged from 2 2 cm 1993 to 0 4 cm 1999 with drainmod dssat and 19 8 cm 1999 to 22 5 cm 2000 with rzwqm2 over the 8 year period the average variation in the soil water storage was 0 4 cm with drainmod dssat and 0 1 cm with rzwqm2 this variation in the soil water storage and other components was similar to that of thorp et al 2007 2009 and du et al 2017 the comparison of measured and simulated drainage flow fig 2 showed that drainmod dssat simulated drainage flow in good agreement with measured drainage flow compared to rzwqm2 simulated drainage flow a paired two sample student s t test showed that the simulated monthly drainage flows were not significantly different p 0 70 and p 0 314 at 95 confidence interval for drainmod dssat and rzwqm2 respectively from the measured drainage flows the monthly distribution of measured and predicted drainage flow by both the models fig 3 over the period of 1993 2000 showed that drainmod dssat simulated drainage flow closely follows the measured monthly drainage mainly during winter months december march compared to rzwqm2 similarly drainmod dssat under predicted the distribution of drainage flow derived from rzwqm2 during crop growing months june august the distribution of monthly drainage from september to november was similar for both the models 3 1 2 nitrogen dynamics the annual n balance for calibration and validation period and model performance evaluation for monthly n losses for drainmod dssat and rzwqm2 are summarized in table 5 overall drainmod dssat performed satisfactorily in simulating monthly no3 n losses over the period of 8 years with nse rsr and pbias of 0 60 0 63 11 3 respectively the statistical goodness of fit parameters nse rsr and pbias for the calibration and validation period were found 0 57 and 0 64 0 65 and 0 60 22 and 6 and 0 87 and 0 90 respectively rzwqm2 simulated monthly no3 n losses with nse rsr and pbias of 0 62 0 61 and 16 6 respectively the nse rsr and pbias for calibration and validation period was 0 6 and 0 51 0 63 and 0 69 and 15 and 18 respectively the model performance results indicated a similar prediction by both models the two plant based pathways for n input considered by both the models are n fixation and residue incorporation since both the models use cropgro soybean to simulate the soybean n fixation the difference in the simulated n fixation and soybean n uptake by both the models was small the total n fixation by the legume plants over an 8 year period simulated by drainmod dssat was 860 8 kg n ha 1 whereas rzwqm2 predicted 888 2 kg n ha 1 the other plant based pathways like n input residue incorporation demonstrated a substantial difference between the two models drainmod dssat does not directly account for n addition to the soil through residue incorporation but rather estimates it using the relationship described by youssef et al 2005 the estimated n addition to the soil through residue incorporation by drainmod dssat was 669 kg n ha 1 over 8 years whereas rzwqm2 simulated 776 kg n ha 1 of n addition to the soil through residue incorporation the simulated result showed a difference of 106 kg n ha 1 in n input through residue incorporation between the two models the n input through residue incorporation estimated for drainmod dssat was found consistently small in all corn years compared to rzwqm2 this can be attributed to the highly sensitive ceres maize radiation use efficiency of the rzwqm2 which affects the root mass growth and ultimately the amount of root assimilated n later released during root decomposition thorp et al 2009 both models simulated similar n addition to the soil through precipitation the major pathways for soil n loss are denitrification drainage leaching surface runoff and plant n uptake drainmod dssat simulated an average annual denitrification rate of 21 3 kg n ha 1 188 kg n ha 1 over the entire period of simulation which was substantially higher than the rzwqm2 simulated average annual denitrification rate of 8 5 kg n ha 1 67 7 kg n ha 1 over the entire simulation period however the predicted denitrification rates by both models were found to be consistent with previous studies du et al 2017 thorp et al 2009 youssef et al 2018 rzwqm2 predicted small denitrification of 6 5 kg n ha 1 in 1993 1 kg n ha 1 in 1994 and 3 kg n ha 1 in 1998 compared to drainmod dssat predictions of 28 1 20 5 and 32 7 kg n ha 1 respectively drainmod dssat simulated higher denitrification may be attributed to higher soil n availability due to smaller seepage losses rzwqm2 predicted higher n loss through seepage which ranges from 11 8 kg n ha 1 to 40 6 kg n ha 1 the average annual n loss through seepage predicted by rzwqm2 was found 24 7 kg n ha 1yr 1 n whereas drainmod dssat predicted only 7 9 kg n ha 1yr 1 drainmod dssat simulated low seepage of soil water resulting in reduced n loss through seepage and higher soil water content which may have caused enhance microbial activity that leads to higher denitrification prediction by the model the anaerobic condition in a shallow soil profile which favors denitrification rate is expected to increase with an increase in soil water content youssef et al 2018 likewise n leaching losses simulated by drainmod dssat and rzwqm2 was 92 3 kg n ha 1 and 87 2 kg n ha 1 respectively the comparison between monthly measured and simulated results fig 2 showed that both models underpredicted n leaching losses 11 and 20 respectively the simulated n losses due to surface runoff by drainmod dssat was 50 more than that simulated by rzwqm2 this variation in n losses was mainly associated with higher surface runoff simulated by drainmod dssat the simulated plant n uptake over the period of 8 year by drainmod dssat was 1851 7 kg n ha 1 which was slightly low compared to rzwqm2 simulated plant n uptake of 1994 6 kg n ha 1 the plant n uptake simulation by drainmod dssat was affected by the low n addition through crop residue incorporation higher denitrification and higher n leaching and runoff losses the net mineralization amount simulated by drainmod dssat and rzwqm2 was 648 9 kg n ha 1 and 751 5 kg n ha 1 respectively the overall change in soil n over the entire simulation period was 69 0 kg n ha 1 for drainmod dssat and 1 6 kg n ha 1 for rzwqm2 the difference in soil n balance simulated by both the models mostly affected due to differences in residue incorporation and denitrification rates thorp et al 2009 also reported a substantial difference in soil n balance simulated by drainmod nii and rzwqm dssat the monthly distribution of no3 n losses presented in fig 3 shows a similar distribution pattern as that of drainage flow drainmod dssat simulated monthly no3 n losses during winter months november march closely follows the distribution of measured values compared to rzwqm2 likewise drainmod dssat simulated monthly no3 n losses during the crop growing period april october also closely followed the measured values compared to rzwqm2 exception in may when the model predicted wider no3 n losses distribution 3 1 3 crop yield the measured and predicted crop yield and model performance of drainmod dssat and rzwqm2 in simulating crop yield are presented in table 6 drainmod dssat simulated corn yield using previous crop growth parameters was found in close agreement with measured corn yield and rzwqm2 simulated crop yield the newly integrated drainmod dssat model possesses the same ability as rzwqm2 to simulate the crop growth and yield response under different soil and climatic conditions the average measured corn yield over the entire simulation period was 8 94 mg ha 1 and the drainmod dssat simulated average corn yield of 8 92 mg ha 1 whereas rzwqm2 simulated 9 06 mg ha 1 both models simulated soybean yield was found similar over the entire period with an average yield of 2 95 mg ha 1 drainmod dssat maintains an excellent performance nrmse 10 in predicting the crop yields with nrmse pbias and d of 8 40 0 60 and 1 respectively over an 8 year study period the nrmse pbias and d for calibration and validation were 9 8 and 6 1 1 90 and 0 5 and 0 99 and 1 0 respectively these results were compared with rzwqm2 simulation results and found very comparable the overall performance of rzwqm2 in simulating crop yield was found very good with nrmse pbias and d of 9 70 0 50 and 1 respectively the nrmse pbias and d for calibration and validation period were 6 35 and 2 99 0 and 1 1 and 0 99 and 0 99 respectively a scatterplot fig 2 was used to visualize the relationship between measured and simulated yield as well as compare the model performance of both the models which suggest that both the model were able to simulate crop yield accurately 3 2 comparison of management strategies in the previous work jeong and bhattarai 2018 assessed the effects of n fertilizer rates and timing on nitrate loss and crop yield using rzwqm2 we used the same scenarios used in that study to evaluate the influence of the model selection on agricultural management decisions 3 2 1 response to n application rate seven different n rates simulated using evaluated drainmod dssat and compared with rzwmq2 results these include base rate 150 kg n ha 1 mrtn rate 193 kg n ha 1 90 base rate 135 kg n ha 1 80 base rate 120 kg n ha 1 70 base rate 105 kg n ha 1 60 base rate 90 kg n ha 1 and 50 base rate 75 kg n ha 1 drainmod dssat and rzwqm2 simulation results fig 4 showed decreased n leaching losses and corn yield as the n application rate decreased and vice versa compared to rzwqm2 drainmod dssat predicted small n leaching losses with varying n application rates however the simulated corn yield by both the model with varying n application rates was found similar when the base rate of 150 kg n ha 1 was decreased to 135 kg n ha 1 90 base rate drainmod dssat simulated a decrease in n leaching losses and corn yield by 2 3 and 0 5 respectively for the same scenario rzwqm2 simulated a decrease in n leaching losses and corn yield by 5 7 and 0 9 respectively these results were found very comparable between both the models however when the n application rate was increased by about 29 from 150 kg n ha 1 to 193 kg n ha 1 mrtn rate drainmod dssat simulated an increase in n leaching losses and corn yield by 3 9 and 3 7 respectively whereas rzwqm2 simulated increase of 29 8 and 1 9 respectively similarly when the n application rate was reduced by 50 from 150 kg n ha 1 to 75 kg n ha 1 50 base rate drainmod dssat predicted a decrease of n leaching losses and corn yield by 6 and 11 9 respectively whereas rzwqm2 showed decreased in n leaching losses and corn yield by 14 1 and 13 9 respectively although both the model showed increasing or decreasing n losses and corn yield with an increase or decrease in n application rates the rzwqm2 model simulation showed higher variation in n losses compared to drainmod dssat to understand why drainmod dssat simulated less n loss compared to rzwqm2 when n application rate increased from 150 kg n ha 1 to 193 kg n ha 1 and n application rate reduced from 150 kg n ha 1 to 75 kg n ha 1 we investigated plant n uptake denitrification rates and net n mineralization output of drainmod dssat we found that for 193 kg n ha 1 n application rate drainmod dssat simulated an increase in plant n uptake and denitrification rate in corn years by 11 and 7 respectively and reduced net n mineralization by 32 the decreases in mineralization rate were due to reduced n input amount and reduced amount of residue biomass in corn years carpenter boggs et al 2000 gollany et al 2004 further in corn years n loss through surface runoff increased by 5 whereas n loss through surface runoff increased by 1 in soybean years similarly we found that with a reduced n application rate of 75 kg n ha 1 the plant n uptake and denitrification were decreased by 21 and 51 respectively in corn years the model simulated n loss reduction through surface runoff by 9 in corn years and 2 in soybean years also net mineralization was increased by 32 in corn years for low rate n application 3 2 2 response to n application timing to explore the effects of n application timings on n loss and corn yield four n application timings were simulated in drainmod dssat and simulation results were compared with rzwqm2 as shown in fig 5 base 30 70 split between spring pre plant and side dressing fsd 40 fall 10 spring pre plant and 50 side dressing fs 50 fall and 50 spring pre plant and s 100 spring pre plant were simulated for each n application rates from period 1993 2000 drainmod dssat simulation results showed a small variation in the n loss and corn yield between n application timings compared to rzwqm2 results fig 5 the results obtained from drainmod dssat showed percentage change in the n loss and corn yield with varying n rate and timing ranging from 4 9 5 and 13 4 17 9 respectively whereas rzwqm2 simulation showed a variation of 27 0 38 6 in n loss and 15 3 22 9 in corn yield with varying n application rate and timing to understand why drainmod dssat simulated less n loss and corn yield we examined the yearly nitrogen output of drainmod dssat for different n timings we found that the partitioning of n losses was mostly affected due to higher n loss through surface runoff and denitrification rates due to change in soil temperature and plant n uptake changes due to change in soil n storage although the simulated n losses and crop yield by both the models vary in quantity both the model agrees with each other in making similar recommendations both models suggest that 30 70 n split application in spring pre plant and side dressing can reduce n losses and increase corn yield compared to fsd fs and s application timings one disagreement between both models was corn yield results for fs and s application timings for each n application rate drainmod dssat showed a decrease in corn yield with fs 50 50 split n application compared to other n application timings whereas rzwqm2 showed a decrease in corn yield with s 100 spring pre plant n application compared to other n application timings however both the model suggest that fs would result in higher n loss than other n application schedules 4 conclusions this study evaluated the newly integrated agroecosystem model drainmod dssat in a no tilled subsurface drained field located in east central illinois and compared its performance in simulating hydrology n losses and yield with rzwmq2 results for the same measured experimental dataset previously studied by jeong and bhattarai 2018 further the evaluated model was used to simulate different n application rates and timing scenarios and compared results with rzwqm2 to examine the influence of model selection on n management decisions overall drainmod dssat performed satisfactorily in simulating water and n budget and maintained excellent performance in simulating crop yield the comparison between drainmod dssat and rzwqm2 showed that both the models exhibit potential in reasonably quantifying the hydrology nutrient dynamics and crop yield for an agricultural system with varying management practices simulations of no3 n losses by drainmod dssat for different n rates and timing differ only in quantity compared to rzwqm2 but both models resulted in the same conclusion the simulation of corn yield by drainmod dssat under different n application rates was found closely comparable with rzwqm2 however drainmod dssat simulated lower corn yield for fs application timing compared to other n application timings whereas rzwqm2 simulated lower corn yield for s application timing compared to other timings in addition both the models suggest that split n application between spring pre plant and side dressing in corn years could be beneficial in reducing n losses without affecting corn yield although both the models provided the same conclusion on n management strategies this study provides one evidence that we should be cautious in using only one model to conclude that a particular agricultural management strategy can yield some quantitative environmental effects such as how much no3 n losses can be reduced or how much corn yield is increased besides this study demonstrates that both drainmod dssat and rzwqm2 are reliable agroecosystem models in

9560,agroecosystem models provide valuable insights into agricultural management decisions and can serve as a useful tool to quantify the effects of management practices under varying conditions where field experimentations are impractical we evaluated a newly integrated comprehensive model drainmod dssat for hydrology nitrogen n dynamics and crop yield using eight years 1993 2000 of measured data from a no tilled subsurface drained corn soybean agricultural system near danville illinois the model satisfactorily predicted drainage flow and no3 n losses with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the ratio of the root mean squared error to the standard deviation rsr and percent bias pbias of 0 68 and 0 60 0 56 and 0 63 and 11 6 and 2 2 respectively and crop yield with nrmse pbias and index of agreement d of 8 4 0 6 and 1 respectively for the same experimental dataset the performance comparison of drainmod dssat to root zone water quality model rzwqm2 demonstrated that the two models were most different in their simulation of n loss through seepage and denitrification further we used drainmod dssat to simulate the effects of management practices n application rates and timings on no3 n losses and crop yield and compared them with rzwqm2 simulated results the results showed that both models provided the same conclusion on the effects of n management strategy on no3 n losses and crop yield but they differ in quantity this study supports being cautious in using only one model to conclude the quantification of the effectiveness of particular agricultural management practices keywords nitrogen subsurface drainage crop yield water quality management modeling 1 introduction over the past few decades numerous researchers have focused on reducing the offsite environmental impacts of conventional agricultural practices these extensive studies involve designing and evaluating effective water and nutrient management strategies to curtail no3 n losses from artificially drained agricultural lands while maintaining high agrarian productivity dinnes et al 2002 jaynes 2015 jeong and bhattarai 2018 youssef et al 2018 often of these studies involve the use of agricultural system or agroecosystem models to explore the effects of a wide range of agricultural management practices on hydrology nutrient fate and transport and crop growth and yield models provide time and cost effective alternatives to field experiments and serve as useful tools for evaluating agricultural practices effects over a longer period where experiment alone proves to be impractical thorp et al 2007 youssef and skaggs 2006 the two commonly used models for evaluating a wide range of management practices to curtail no3 n losses from artificially drained agricultural lands across the midwestern corn belt of the united states are rzwqm2 ahuja et al 2000 and drainmod skaggs 1978 drainmod nii youssef et al 2005 rzwqm2 root zone water quality model is a one dimension field scale model that simulates hydrology nutrient and pesticide fate and transport crop growth and agricultural management practice components within and below the crop root zone of a unit area ahuja et al 2000 ma et al 2005 2007 drainmod drainmod nii is a field scale process based model that simulates hydrology and c and n dynamics respectively in drained agricultural lands under a wide range of soil climatic conditions and management practices skaggs and chescheir 2003 skaggs 1978 youssef and skaggs 2006 youssef et al 2005 in recent years an effort has been made to develop a robust agroecosystem model by implementing either a new model or integrating existing models to supplement field experimentation with agroecosystem models when new models are developed or two existing models are integrated to form a new integrated model testing and evaluation become critical ale et al 2013 du et al 2017 adequate evaluation of earlier established models or newly developed models provides better insight into models capability and limitations and helps to improve the model for future research and model credibility thorp et al 2009 in addition comparing the performance of one agroecosystem model with another similar model helps determine the reliability of such models in making reasonable predictions that can be valuable for agricultural management decisions such comparisons are useful to contrast the strengths and weaknesses of each model help in improving the computational processes and enable users to select an appropriate model for an intended purpose thorp et al 2009 evaluated drainmod nii performance to simulate n dynamics for different n application rates under corn soybean agricultural system and compared simulation results with the rzwqm dssat model for the same measured datasets their finding showed that the two models mainly differed in their simulations of soybean n fixation plant n uptake and net n mineralization similarly du et al 2017 used 16 year field experiment data to compare the performance of drainmod nii with rzwqm2 in predicting no3 n concentration and losses at nine n application rates and found drainmod nii performance slightly better in simulating subsurface drainage and no3 n concentration and loss compared to rzwqm2 youssef et al 2018 compared drainmod nii predictions of water and nitrogen budgets for the corn soybean agricultural system under controlled drainage conditions with rzwqm2 results across 48 sites of the midwestern u s their find showed that both the mode predicted similar trends across the region but rzwqm2 predicted higher drainage volumes and no3 n losses under controlled drainage condition compared to drainmod nii these studies focused on how two agroecosystem models perform in predicting hydrology and n dynamics under different management practices and soil and climatic conditions however the drainmod nii model used in these comparison studies lacks a crop growth module compared to rzwqm2 which limitation from the missing component in simulating agricultural systems influences the model prediction in previous work jeong and bhattarai 2018 made an effort to understand the effects of n management alternatives on no3 losses and crop yield using 8 years of extensive field datasets and the rzwqm2 model they used the illinois nutrient loss reduction strategies inlrs iepa and idoa 2015 for managing the n fertilizer application rate to the maximum return to nitrogen mrtn rate along with the other six n application rates and three alternative n application timings to explore alternative n management strategies this study focuses on evaluating the management scenarios used in the previous study to assess the performance of the newly integrated drainmod dssat negm et al 2014 model and determine agreement disagreement between two models in predicting hydrology n dynamics and crop yield this study is the first to use information collected at the site to evaluate the drainmod dssat model the objectives of this study are i to evaluate drainmod dssat using the 8 year dataset from an experimental field with corn soybean rotation under conventional free subsurface drainage and no tillage system ii to compare the drainmod dssat model performance to that of the rzwqm 2 model previously evaluated using the same measured dataset jeong and bhattarai 2018 and iii to compare n management scenarios simulated by drainmod dssat with previous rzwqm2 results of jeong and bhattarai 2018 to determine the influence of these model selection on n management decisions when field experimentation alone is inapplicable 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description the study site is located in vermillion county of east central illinois 39 59 10 0 n 87 43 24 0 w fig 1 according to usda nrcs united states department of agriculture natural resources conservation services soil survey report the soil at the study site is predominantly characterized as sabina silt loam usda taxonomic class fine smectitic and mesic aeric epiaqualfs with 0 5 2 organic content in the surface layer and considered as somewhat poorly drained soil usda nrcs 2009 although several sites were established for long term water quality monitoring research a monitoring dataset from site e from 1993 to 2000 was used for this study the site has a drained area of 7 56 acres with tile drains installed approximately 1 02 m deep on average and spaced 28 m apart the landowners made all the agricultural management decisions and the information on fertilizer application rates methods and timing and crop yields were compiled by researchers in the department of agricultural and biological engineering at the university of illinois table s1 kalita et al 2006 the site was under corn soybean rotation with the no till condition during corn growing seasons fertilizer nitrogen was applied in the spring before planting and as a side dress application later in the spring no nitrogen fertilizer was applied during soybean growing seasons mitchell et al 2000 the drainage flow was continuously monitored using palmer bowlus flumes and data loggers at the drainage outlet for water quality monitoring water samples were collected bi weekly using a grab sampling method and additional samples were collected automatically by the auto samplers when the tile was flowing the collected water samples were analyzed for nitrate n concentration using the hydrazine sulfate reduction method 2 2 model description 2 2 1 drainmod dssat drainmod dssat is a newly integrated comprehensive agroecosystem model developed to simulated hydrology biogeochemical and crop growth and yield under different agricultural management practices and soil and climatic conditions this integrated model comprises three widely used models i drainmod skaggs 1978 water management model for simulating water and heat flow ii drainmod nii youssef et al 2005 companion model of drainmod for simulating the effects of agricultural management practices on soil carbon c and nitrogen n dynamics iii ceres maize jones et al 1986 and cropgro soybean jones et al 1986 of dssat v4 0 hoogenboom et al 2004 a suite of deterministic crop models for simulating effects of crop genetics climate and soil moisture and fertility conditions on plant phenological development and growth briefly drainmod simulates hydrologic variables infiltration subsurface drainage evapotranspiration water table depth surface runoff seepage soil water distribution in the unsaturated zone using one dimensional soil water balance at mid point between two parallel drains at each time step hourly and daily skaggs 1978 skaggs et al 2012 in the model the infiltration rate is computed using the green ampt equation green and ampt 1911 and surface runoff occurs after the ponded water on the soil surface exceeds the user defined depressional storage the model computes drainage rates using the steady state hooghdoudt equation bouwer and van schilfgaarde 1963 when the water table is below the soil surface and the kirkham equation kirkham 1957 under ponded condition potential evapotranspiration pet is either calculated by the model using the thornthwaite 1957 method or calculated separately by the user and provide to the model as input the model also simulates the effects of soil freezing thawing and snow accumulation and melt on hydrologic predictions in cold climates luo et al 2000 drainmod nii youssef et al 2005 simulates a detailed soil n cycle based on a one dimensional advection dispersion reaction equation the model simulates three soil n pools nitrate nitrogen no3 n ammoniacal nitrogen nhx n and organic nitrogen on the nhx n pool is set optional in the model so it may be ignored when soil and environmental conditions do not favor its accumulation in the soil if the nhx n pool is ignored the model simulates mineral n similar to the brevé et al 1997 the n transformation processes considered in the model simulates atmospheric deposition n fixation by legumes plant n uptake application of mineral n fertilizers and on sources plant residues animal waste n mineralization immobilization nitrification denitrification ammonia volatilization n losses subsurface drainage vertical and lateral seepage and surface runoff the sub model adapted from the century model parton et al 1987 of drainmod nii simulates soil c dynamics that considers three soil organic matter som pools active slow and passive youssef et al 2005 for further detail on draimod drainmod nii readers are referred to skaggs 1978 skaggs et al 2012 and youssef et al 2005 the ceres maize crop module uses similar principles applied in ceres crop models described by ritchie et al 1998 to simulate corn growth development and yield cropgro soybean simulates the growth and yield of soybean it is a process oriented model and considers crop carbon balance crop and soil n balance and soil water balance the details on crop modules and their simulation processes can be found in the dssat related literature boote et al 1998 hoogenboom et al 2004 jones et al 1986 drainmod dssat integration allows full data transfer and feedback between the individual models drainmod reads input parameters on a daily time step and calls drainmod nii for model initialization and parameterization of c and n dynamics on the first day of the crop growing season the crop module called for initialization and set up a new plant life cycle during the crop growing season drainmod provides the crop model with daily soil water content soil temperature weather data maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation and potential evapotranspiration pet and drainmod nii provides available soil n for plant uptake the crop modules then convert drainmod predicted pet into pt0 potential plant transpiration using the light extinction coefficient and simulated lai the actual daily root water uptake is either equal to or less than drainmod calculated et if the root water uptake is not sufficient the crop model uses two stress factors swfac and turfac to compute the stress on plant growth and development after the crop module completes crop growth simulation it returns the effective rooting depth and actual plant n uptake to drainmod and drainmod nii to complete soil water and n balance simulation for the day and update soil water and n profile for the next day of the simulation respectively on the last day of the growing period the crop model provides drainmod nii with unharvested biomass above and below the ground and related n contents for residue recycling during the non growing season simulation becomes limited to soil water and n balance components 2 2 2 rzwqm2 rzwqm2 is a field scale agroecosystem model that simulates the effect of agricultural management practices on crop production and soil and water quality ahuja et al 2000 ma et al 2012 it is a one dimensional model and consists of physical soil chemical nutrient pesticide plant growth and management processes the model contains plant growth modules from dssat crop modules for 22 field crops the crop growth n balance and pesticide modules run on a daily time step whereas soil water soil heat transfer and surface energy balance modules use sub hourly time step the model can simulate a soil profile up to 30 m deep with a single crop grown at any given time and accommodate up to 200 events for each management practice including tillage planting dates fertilization manure application etc for further details on the model readers may refer to ahuja et al 2000 and ma et al 2012 2 3 drainmod dssat and rzwqm2 comparison drainmod and drainmod nii are not fully integrated and have only a graphical user friendly windows interface designed to execute drainmod for hydrology and call drainmod nii for simulating c and n dynamics the integration of dssat with drainmod and drainmod nii is created in a single shell under which data transfer and feedback are established on a daily time step negm 2011 with regard to the model design and integration both models integrate hydrology nutrient and crop growth simulations on a daily time step however drainmod dssat and rzwm2 differ in their simulation methods for et soil water distribution and water storage on the soil surface drainmod dssat simulates surface water storage whereas rzwqm2 does not drainmod dssat uses a temperature based thornthwaite 1948 equation to compute potential evapotranspiration pet whereas rzwqm2 uses the shuttleworth wallace double layer form of the original penman monteith et model farahani and decoursey 2000 drainmod dssat simulates soil water contents in saturated and unsaturated zones and uses richards s equation for two dimensional flow rzwqm2 uses a numerical solution of richards s equation to compute soil water redistribution to simulate subsurface drainage flow drainmod dssat uses the steady state hooghoudt equation when the water table is below the soil surface and when the soil surface is under ponded condition it uses kirkham s equation rzwqm2 employs only the steady state hooghoudt equation to compute water flux to the subsurface drains both models use the darcy equation to calculate seepage and the green and ampt equation for infiltration the c n dynamics in drainmod dssat is simulated by drainmod nii based on the century model by parton et al 1987 whereas rzwmq2 uses omni organic matter and nitrogen module developed by shaffer et al 2000 drainmod nii simulates one microbial pool that acts only on the surface residue it also simulates two above ground and two below ground residue pools all of which interact in the nutrient cycling algorithm on the other hand rzwqm2 simulates three microbial pools that act within the layers of the soil profile and it simulates two below ground residue pools in rzwqm2 the surface residue is quantified and incorporated but is not considered in the nutrient cycling algorithm the solute transport through the soil profile is estimated with an advection dispersion reaction equation in drainmod nii whereas rzwqm2 uses sequential partial piston displacement and mixing method 2 4 model parameterization and initialization drainmod dssat requires several input parameters including soil weather and management practices to simulate hydrological and biogeochemical processes the drainage system design parameters used for this site are presented in table 1 for this study the same weather dataset used by jeong and bhattarai 2018 was used soil data was referenced from the nrcs soil survey report for vermillion county il and jeong and bhattarai 2018 in the previous work with rzwqm2 jeong and bhattarai 2018 simulated a seven layer soil profile for this site but drainmod accepts only a five layer soil profile thus the number of soil layers was reduced from that used for rzwqm2 by combining the soil layers with the most similar properties using similar approach described thorp et al 2009 and the drainmod utilities input file preparation program was used to prepare soil file water retention characteristics were based on that from the previous calibration of rzwqm2 therefore no further adjustment was made on the relationships for volume drained and upward flux versus water table depth similarly saturated hydraulic conductivity values from jeong and bhattarai 2018 were used to initialize the model and adjustments were made within a reasonable range during the model calibration process the soil temperature parameters were referenced from singh et al 2020 who recently used drainmod dssat for a nearby site for drainmod dssat simulation management inputs for tillage and fertilizer were set according to actual field practices over the study period the major n transport and transformation and som parameters for drainmod dssat used for this study are presented in table 2 the field was under no tillage condition during the entire period and therefore the no tillage option was used in addition the fertilizer was applied only during the corn years the model was set to recycle plant roots and shoots back into the soil after harvest the concentration of no3 n and nh4 n in the rainwater was set 1 4 mg l 1 and 0 4 mg l 1 respectively same as jeong and bhattarai 2018 and were obtained from the national atmospheric deposition program nadp gay 2008 the crop growth models ceres maize and cropgro soybean require a number of crop specific parameters to simulate plant growth and development in response to variation in the environmental conditions in this study we used previously calibrated crop growth parameters table s2 by jeong and bhattarai 2018 for ceres maize and cropgro soybean for the crop yield simulation jeong and bhattarai 2018 adjusted crop growth parameters to improve the rzwqm2 performance during the model calibration process those adjustments include the duration of the juvenile phase p1 duration of reproductive phase p5 and potential kernel number g2 for corn and the critical short day length csdl and maximum weight per seed wtpsd for soybean in this study we used crop growth parameters from jeong and bhattarai 2018 without any further modifications 2 5 model calibration and evaluation to calibrate and evaluate the model the measured dataset was partitioned into two units in the same way as the previous study with rzwqm2 jeong and bhattarai 2018 the data from the period 1993 1996 was used for model calibration and the dataset from the period 1997 2000 was used for model validation each partitioned period covered two sets of corn soybean rotation likewise a warm up period from1990 1992 was used for model initialization the hydrologic component calibration was performed by adjusting a few parameters to improve error metrics between the measured drainage flow and simulated drainage flow the hydrologic calibration focused mainly on adjusting the lateral hydraulic conductivity of soil layers and maximum surface storage the model calibration for nutrient components primarily focused on parameter adjustments for the longitudinal dispersivity denitrification rate and soc transformation to improve error metrics between simulated and measured n leaching losses no calibration was performed for crop growth and yield similar to jeong and bhattarai 2018 the criteria used for model calibration and validation followed both statistical and graphical approaches the performance of the drainmod dssat was evaluated with the observed data of tile flow tile no3 n loss and crop yields using nash sutcliffe efficiency e ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 root mean square error observations standard deviation ratio rsr singh et al 2004 percent bias pbias the index of agreement d willmott et al 1985 and the normalized root mean square error nrmse loague and green 1991 on monthly time scale the model performance was considered to be satisfactory

10 good if 10 nrmse 20 fair if 20 nrmse 30 and poor if nrmse 30 jamieson et al 1991 the graphical method helped assess anomalies in the simulated values and check overall model performance over the period of 8 years the graphical comparison of measured and simulated values performed using time series and scatter plots the statistical comparison of measured and simulated values was evaluated

validation of drainmod dssat management scenarios tested by jeong and bhattarai 2018 presented in table 3 were simulated using drainmod dssat and the results from both the models were compared the n application rates evaluated include base n application rate of 150 kg n ha 1 mrtn maximum return to nitrogen rate of 193 kg n ha 1 and reduced n application rate by 10 50 of the base rate the n application timing followed the recommendation from the illinois nutrient loss reduction strategies report iepa and idoa 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of model performance 3 1 1 hydrology the annual water balance simulated by the drainmod dssat and rzwqm2 model and model performance evaluation for monthly drain flow for the calibration and validation period is presented in table 4 overall drainmod dssat simulated monthly hydrologic response satisfactorily over the period of 1993 2000 with nse rsr and pbias of 0 68 0 56 and 2 2 respectively according to model evaluation guidelines suggested by skaggs et al 2012 and moriasi et al 2007 the simulated monthly drainage flow for calibration and validation periods were ranged satisfactory to good with nse rsr and pbias of 0 62 and 0 77 0 61 and 0 48 and 0 7 and 6 3 respectively table 4 in contrast rzwqm2 simulated monthly drainage flow from 1993 to 2000 with nse rsr and pbias of 0 55 0 67 and 7 respectively the monthly drainage simulations for rzwqm2 were satisfactory for both calibration and validation period with nse rsr and pbias of 0 56 and 0 51 0 66 and 0 69 and 2 and 14 0 respectively this result indicates that the drainage flow simulated by drainmod dssat was in closer agreement with the observations than the rzwqm2 simulations the precipitation amount ranged from 74 1 cm in 2000 to 131 5 cm in 1993 the difference in the reported precipitation values used as input in drainmod dssat versus rzwqm2 is due to rounding errors in the formatting of the model input files the annual simulated drainage flow followed the precipitation patterns over the 8 year study period with a minimum drain flow of 7 8 cm in 2000 and a maximum of 38 4 cm in 1993 during the calibration period drainmod dssat overestimated drainage flow by 1 and rzwqm2 underestimated drainage flow by 2 whereas during the validation period the models underestimated drainage flow by 6 and 14 respectively the annual et simulated by drainmod dssat ranged from 49 7 cm in 1997 to 66 3 cm in 1998 with rzwqm2 the simulated et ranged from 39 4 cm in 1996 to 77 7 cm in 1999 the deviation in both models simulated et is due to the difference in et calculation methods adopted in both the models and the monthly adjustment factors used for the thornthwaite method in drainmod dssat the overall et balance over 8 years simulated by drainmod dssat and rzwqm2 were around 60 and 59 of total precipitation respectively the partitioning of modeled annual et was found consistent with fang et al 2012 and thorp et al 2007 for nearby sites and within the range of 60 69 as reported by sanford and selnick 2013 for central illinois drainmod dssat simulated runoff ranged from 0 0 cm in 2000 to 28 4 cm in 1998 whereas rzwqm2 simulated runoff ranged from 1 3 cm in 1999 to 23 4 cm in 1998 the annual simulated seepage by drainmod dssat and rzwqm2 ranged from 7 7 cm in 1999 to 9 1 cm in 1993 and 7 6 cm in 2000 to 23 cm in 1993 respectively the overall simulated water balance by both the models over the period of 8 years was very similar to some variation in average surface runoff amount and seepage rate the average difference in the simulated surface runoff and seepage between drainmod dssat and rzwqm2 was 4 6 cm and 6 1 cm respectively this deviation in the surface runoff and seepage predictions attributed to maximum surface storage and soil temperature affecting the infiltration rate during winter months in drainmod dssat however both models over predicted the surface runoff compared to the measured surface runoff from 1993 to 1998 which only accounts for 2 5 of total precipitation algoazany et al 2007 the change in simulated soil water storage ranged from 2 2 cm 1993 to 0 4 cm 1999 with drainmod dssat and 19 8 cm 1999 to 22 5 cm 2000 with rzwqm2 over the 8 year period the average variation in the soil water storage was 0 4 cm with drainmod dssat and 0 1 cm with rzwqm2 this variation in the soil water storage and other components was similar to that of thorp et al 2007 2009 and du et al 2017 the comparison of measured and simulated drainage flow fig 2 showed that drainmod dssat simulated drainage flow in good agreement with measured drainage flow compared to rzwqm2 simulated drainage flow a paired two sample student s t test showed that the simulated monthly drainage flows were not significantly different p 0 70 and p 0 314 at 95 confidence interval for drainmod dssat and rzwqm2 respectively from the measured drainage flows the monthly distribution of measured and predicted drainage flow by both the models fig 3 over the period of 1993 2000 showed that drainmod dssat simulated drainage flow closely follows the measured monthly drainage mainly during winter months december march compared to rzwqm2 similarly drainmod dssat under predicted the distribution of drainage flow derived from rzwqm2 during crop growing months june august the distribution of monthly drainage from september to november was similar for both the models 3 1 2 nitrogen dynamics the annual n balance for calibration and validation period and model performance evaluation for monthly n losses for drainmod dssat and rzwqm2 are summarized in table 5 overall drainmod dssat performed satisfactorily in simulating monthly no3 n losses over the period of 8 years with nse rsr and pbias of 0 60 0 63 11 3 respectively the statistical goodness of fit parameters nse rsr and pbias for the calibration and validation period were found 0 57 and 0 64 0 65 and 0 60 22 and 6 and 0 87 and 0 90 respectively rzwqm2 simulated monthly no3 n losses with nse rsr and pbias of 0 62 0 61 and 16 6 respectively the nse rsr and pbias for calibration and validation period was 0 6 and 0 51 0 63 and 0 69 and 15 and 18 respectively the model performance results indicated a similar prediction by both models the two plant based pathways for n input considered by both the models are n fixation and residue incorporation since both the models use cropgro soybean to simulate the soybean n fixation the difference in the simulated n fixation and soybean n uptake by both the models was small the total n fixation by the legume plants over an 8 year period simulated by drainmod dssat was 860 8 kg n ha 1 whereas rzwqm2 predicted 888 2 kg n ha 1 the other plant based pathways like n input residue incorporation demonstrated a substantial difference between the two models drainmod dssat does not directly account for n addition to the soil through residue incorporation but rather estimates it using the relationship described by youssef et al 2005 the estimated n addition to the soil through residue incorporation by drainmod dssat was 669 kg n ha 1 over 8 years whereas rzwqm2 simulated 776 kg n ha 1 of n addition to the soil through residue incorporation the simulated result showed a difference of 106 kg n ha 1 in n input through residue incorporation between the two models the n input through residue incorporation estimated for drainmod dssat was found consistently small in all corn years compared to rzwqm2 this can be attributed to the highly sensitive ceres maize radiation use efficiency of the rzwqm2 which affects the root mass growth and ultimately the amount of root assimilated n later released during root decomposition thorp et al 2009 both models simulated similar n addition to the soil through precipitation the major pathways for soil n loss are denitrification drainage leaching surface runoff and plant n uptake drainmod dssat simulated an average annual denitrification rate of 21 3 kg n ha 1 188 kg n ha 1 over the entire period of simulation which was substantially higher than the rzwqm2 simulated average annual denitrification rate of 8 5 kg n ha 1 67 7 kg n ha 1 over the entire simulation period however the predicted denitrification rates by both models were found to be consistent with previous studies du et al 2017 thorp et al 2009 youssef et al 2018 rzwqm2 predicted small denitrification of 6 5 kg n ha 1 in 1993 1 kg n ha 1 in 1994 and 3 kg n ha 1 in 1998 compared to drainmod dssat predictions of 28 1 20 5 and 32 7 kg n ha 1 respectively drainmod dssat simulated higher denitrification may be attributed to higher soil n availability due to smaller seepage losses rzwqm2 predicted higher n loss through seepage which ranges from 11 8 kg n ha 1 to 40 6 kg n ha 1 the average annual n loss through seepage predicted by rzwqm2 was found 24 7 kg n ha 1yr 1 n whereas drainmod dssat predicted only 7 9 kg n ha 1yr 1 drainmod dssat simulated low seepage of soil water resulting in reduced n loss through seepage and higher soil water content which may have caused enhance microbial activity that leads to higher denitrification prediction by the model the anaerobic condition in a shallow soil profile which favors denitrification rate is expected to increase with an increase in soil water content youssef et al 2018 likewise n leaching losses simulated by drainmod dssat and rzwqm2 was 92 3 kg n ha 1 and 87 2 kg n ha 1 respectively the comparison between monthly measured and simulated results fig 2 showed that both models underpredicted n leaching losses 11 and 20 respectively the simulated n losses due to surface runoff by drainmod dssat was 50 more than that simulated by rzwqm2 this variation in n losses was mainly associated with higher surface runoff simulated by drainmod dssat the simulated plant n uptake over the period of 8 year by drainmod dssat was 1851 7 kg n ha 1 which was slightly low compared to rzwqm2 simulated plant n uptake of 1994 6 kg n ha 1 the plant n uptake simulation by drainmod dssat was affected by the low n addition through crop residue incorporation higher denitrification and higher n leaching and runoff losses the net mineralization amount simulated by drainmod dssat and rzwqm2 was 648 9 kg n ha 1 and 751 5 kg n ha 1 respectively the overall change in soil n over the entire simulation period was 69 0 kg n ha 1 for drainmod dssat and 1 6 kg n ha 1 for rzwqm2 the difference in soil n balance simulated by both the models mostly affected due to differences in residue incorporation and denitrification rates thorp et al 2009 also reported a substantial difference in soil n balance simulated by drainmod nii and rzwqm dssat the monthly distribution of no3 n losses presented in fig 3 shows a similar distribution pattern as that of drainage flow drainmod dssat simulated monthly no3 n losses during winter months november march closely follows the distribution of measured values compared to rzwqm2 likewise drainmod dssat simulated monthly no3 n losses during the crop growing period april october also closely followed the measured values compared to rzwqm2 exception in may when the model predicted wider no3 n losses distribution 3 1 3 crop yield the measured and predicted crop yield and model performance of drainmod dssat and rzwqm2 in simulating crop yield are presented in table 6 drainmod dssat simulated corn yield using previous crop growth parameters was found in close agreement with measured corn yield and rzwqm2 simulated crop yield the newly integrated drainmod dssat model possesses the same ability as rzwqm2 to simulate the crop growth and yield response under different soil and climatic conditions the average measured corn yield over the entire simulation period was 8 94 mg ha 1 and the drainmod dssat simulated average corn yield of 8 92 mg ha 1 whereas rzwqm2 simulated 9 06 mg ha 1 both models simulated soybean yield was found similar over the entire period with an average yield of 2 95 mg ha 1 drainmod dssat maintains an excellent performance nrmse 10 in predicting the crop yields with nrmse pbias and d of 8 40 0 60 and 1 respectively over an 8 year study period the nrmse pbias and d for calibration and validation were 9 8 and 6 1 1 90 and 0 5 and 0 99 and 1 0 respectively these results were compared with rzwqm2 simulation results and found very comparable the overall performance of rzwqm2 in simulating crop yield was found very good with nrmse pbias and d of 9 70 0 50 and 1 respectively the nrmse pbias and d for calibration and validation period were 6 35 and 2 99 0 and 1 1 and 0 99 and 0 99 respectively a scatterplot fig 2 was used to visualize the relationship between measured and simulated yield as well as compare the model performance of both the models which suggest that both the model were able to simulate crop yield accurately 3 2 comparison of management strategies in the previous work jeong and bhattarai 2018 assessed the effects of n fertilizer rates and timing on nitrate loss and crop yield using rzwqm2 we used the same scenarios used in that study to evaluate the influence of the model selection on agricultural management decisions 3 2 1 response to n application rate seven different n rates simulated using evaluated drainmod dssat and compared with rzwmq2 results these include base rate 150 kg n ha 1 mrtn rate 193 kg n ha 1 90 base rate 135 kg n ha 1 80 base rate 120 kg n ha 1 70 base rate 105 kg n ha 1 60 base rate 90 kg n ha 1 and 50 base rate 75 kg n ha 1 drainmod dssat and rzwqm2 simulation results fig 4 showed decreased n leaching losses and corn yield as the n application rate decreased and vice versa compared to rzwqm2 drainmod dssat predicted small n leaching losses with varying n application rates however the simulated corn yield by both the model with varying n application rates was found similar when the base rate of 150 kg n ha 1 was decreased to 135 kg n ha 1 90 base rate drainmod dssat simulated a decrease in n leaching losses and corn yield by 2 3 and 0 5 respectively for the same scenario rzwqm2 simulated a decrease in n leaching losses and corn yield by 5 7 and 0 9 respectively these results were found very comparable between both the models however when the n application rate was increased by about 29 from 150 kg n ha 1 to 193 kg n ha 1 mrtn rate drainmod dssat simulated an increase in n leaching losses and corn yield by 3 9 and 3 7 respectively whereas rzwqm2 simulated increase of 29 8 and 1 9 respectively similarly when the n application rate was reduced by 50 from 150 kg n ha 1 to 75 kg n ha 1 50 base rate drainmod dssat predicted a decrease of n leaching losses and corn yield by 6 and 11 9 respectively whereas rzwqm2 showed decreased in n leaching losses and corn yield by 14 1 and 13 9 respectively although both the model showed increasing or decreasing n losses and corn yield with an increase or decrease in n application rates the rzwqm2 model simulation showed higher variation in n losses compared to drainmod dssat to understand why drainmod dssat simulated less n loss compared to rzwqm2 when n application rate increased from 150 kg n ha 1 to 193 kg n ha 1 and n application rate reduced from 150 kg n ha 1 to 75 kg n ha 1 we investigated plant n uptake denitrification rates and net n mineralization output of drainmod dssat we found that for 193 kg n ha 1 n application rate drainmod dssat simulated an increase in plant n uptake and denitrification rate in corn years by 11 and 7 respectively and reduced net n mineralization by 32 the decreases in mineralization rate were due to reduced n input amount and reduced amount of residue biomass in corn years carpenter boggs et al 2000 gollany et al 2004 further in corn years n loss through surface runoff increased by 5 whereas n loss through surface runoff increased by 1 in soybean years similarly we found that with a reduced n application rate of 75 kg n ha 1 the plant n uptake and denitrification were decreased by 21 and 51 respectively in corn years the model simulated n loss reduction through surface runoff by 9 in corn years and 2 in soybean years also net mineralization was increased by 32 in corn years for low rate n application 3 2 2 response to n application timing to explore the effects of n application timings on n loss and corn yield four n application timings were simulated in drainmod dssat and simulation results were compared with rzwqm2 as shown in fig 5 base 30 70 split between spring pre plant and side dressing fsd 40 fall 10 spring pre plant and 50 side dressing fs 50 fall and 50 spring pre plant and s 100 spring pre plant were simulated for each n application rates from period 1993 2000 drainmod dssat simulation results showed a small variation in the n loss and corn yield between n application timings compared to rzwqm2 results fig 5 the results obtained from drainmod dssat showed percentage change in the n loss and corn yield with varying n rate and timing ranging from 4 9 5 and 13 4 17 9 respectively whereas rzwqm2 simulation showed a variation of 27 0 38 6 in n loss and 15 3 22 9 in corn yield with varying n application rate and timing to understand why drainmod dssat simulated less n loss and corn yield we examined the yearly nitrogen output of drainmod dssat for different n timings we found that the partitioning of n losses was mostly affected due to higher n loss through surface runoff and denitrification rates due to change in soil temperature and plant n uptake changes due to change in soil n storage although the simulated n losses and crop yield by both the models vary in quantity both the model agrees with each other in making similar recommendations both models suggest that 30 70 n split application in spring pre plant and side dressing can reduce n losses and increase corn yield compared to fsd fs and s application timings one disagreement between both models was corn yield results for fs and s application timings for each n application rate drainmod dssat showed a decrease in corn yield with fs 50 50 split n application compared to other n application timings whereas rzwqm2 showed a decrease in corn yield with s 100 spring pre plant n application compared to other n application timings however both the model suggest that fs would result in higher n loss than other n application schedules 4 conclusions this study evaluated the newly integrated agroecosystem model drainmod dssat in a no tilled subsurface drained field located in east central illinois and compared its performance in simulating hydrology n losses and yield with rzwmq2 results for the same measured experimental dataset previously studied by jeong and bhattarai 2018 further the evaluated model was used to simulate different n application rates and timing scenarios and compared results with rzwqm2 to examine the influence of model selection on n management decisions overall drainmod dssat performed satisfactorily in simulating water and n budget and maintained excellent performance in simulating crop yield the comparison between drainmod dssat and rzwqm2 showed that both the models exhibit potential in reasonably quantifying the hydrology nutrient dynamics and crop yield for an agricultural system with varying management practices simulations of no3 n losses by drainmod dssat for different n rates and timing differ only in quantity compared to rzwqm2 but both models resulted in the same conclusion the simulation of corn yield by drainmod dssat under different n application rates was found closely comparable with rzwqm2 however drainmod dssat simulated lower corn yield for fs application timing compared to other n application timings whereas rzwqm2 simulated lower corn yield for s application timing compared to other timings in addition both the models suggest that split n application between spring pre plant and side dressing in corn years could be beneficial in reducing n losses without affecting corn yield although both the models provided the same conclusion on n management strategies this study provides one evidence that we should be cautious in using only one model to conclude that a particular agricultural management strategy can yield some quantitative environmental effects such as how much no3 n losses can be reduced or how much corn yield is increased besides this study demonstrates that both drainmod dssat and rzwqm2 are reliable agroecosystem models in achieving the overall effects of changing the n application rates and timings on no3 n losses and the crop yield declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9561,daytime transpiration is driven by evaporative demand vapor pressure deficit vpd and radiative energy dominantly accounting for daily transpiration t recent modeling approaches recommend weighing vpd for diurnal cycle of t using radiation to predict t as opposed to using daily mean vpd this proposition requires field evaluation so that diurnal patterns of water use are represented fairly in this research hourly t was measured concurrently for irrigated maize sorghum and soybean in a dry sub humid climate various vpd conditioning approaches available to the user that differed in measurement frequency spectral sampling and weighing strategies were evaluated to explain variance in t the locally derived radiation based weighing coefficient frac showed substantial variability with mean estimates of 0 61 annual and 0 58 growing season which were lower than the classically recommended tanner sinclair coefficient 0 75 the use of a constant frac value for weighing vpd was suboptimal to dynamic weighing of vpd for each day accounting for day to day variability this is primarily because of considerable nighttime water use tn demonstrated values that were 6 16 of t across the three crops tn was driven by wind speed and vpd during nighttime hours these field observations of tn hold implications for un suitability of radiation based weighing procedures which assume no tn diurnally weighted vpd was suboptimal to using daily mean vpd as the former does not account for dark period vpd additionally reference evapotranspiration eto the standardized metric of crop water use was either negative or zero for nocturnal periods when tn 0 and thus failed to appropriately represent tn a variable of transpiration based on daily mean vpd and total daily radiation was the most effective in explaining t variance in all crops with increasing asymmetry between daytime and nighttime warming and aridity it becomes increasingly important to appropriately precondition vpd data to predict t caution should be exercised while using radiation weighted vpd in crops environments and seasons with non negligible tn keywords nighttime transpiration water use dark transpiration weighing coefficients nighttime warming 1 introduction water loss transpiration or t in plants through water vapor and energy exchange process between plant stomata and surrounding environment is an unavoidable consequence of stomatal opening for photosynthetic carbon fixation it plays significant role in determining plant response to environmental variables plant physiology agronomy and plant science hydrology climate science and in many other scientific disciplines transpiration rather than evapotranspiration is the actual true or more relevant contributor to dry matter assimilation and crop productivity evaporation on the other hand is an unbeneficial use of water resources and does not contribute to plant growth development or productivity in most cases plant productivity is quantified and presented as a function of evapotranspiration rather than transpiration because quantification of transpiration rates separately is an extremely difficult time consuming and expensive task that requires expert personnel thus in most cases the magnitude of evaporative loss evaporation and transpiration together is lumped into the evapotranspiration category when quantifying and expressing plant water use the processes of stomatal opening and thus t have been commonly assumed to be limited to the daytime hours the assumption of complete stomatal closure during nighttime is regarded in line with the optimal stomatal behavior theories which state that plants strive to maximize carbon gain while minimizing t cowan and farquhar 1977 farquhar 1973 however advances in measurement of t via sap flux monitoring gas exchange and lysimetry have shown incomplete stomatal closure or non negligible nocturnal t tn for a wide range of plant species snyder et al 2003 oren et al 1999 fisher et al 2007 benyon 1999 bucci et al 2004 daley and phillips 2006 scholz et al 2007 burgess et al 1998 dawson et al 2007 donovan et al 1999 hogg and hurdle 1997 marks and lechowicz 2007 oishi et al 2008 ward et al 2008 caird et al 2007a coupel ledru et al 2016 forster 2014 o keefe 2016 rogiers et al 2009 resco de dios et al 2019 duursma et al 2019 pfautsch et al 2011 while most of the literature focuses on tn for woody shrubs timber plantations and forests tn in agricultural crops has received decent attention abdel aziz et al 1964 green et al 1989 caird et al 2007b fuentes et al 2013 resco de dios et al 2016 even et al 2018 sadok and tamang 2019 richards et al 1986 rawson and clarke 1988 schoppach et al 2014 among these studies tn values ranged from 8 to 55 of daytime t schoppach et al 2020 tn is especially important in managed agricultural ecosystems where water management and irrigation strategies rely on replacing crop evapotranspiration or soil moisture deficits moreover genetic variability in tn is being used as a breeding target to improve water use efficiency wue and dry matter productivity coupel ledru et al 2016 schoppach et al 2020 especially under drought and severe heat stress environments conditions the strong evidence of tn being a significant proportion of daily t demands revisiting the meteorological predictors often used to estimate t global observations show asymmetric warming trends peng et al 2004 sillmann et al 2013 screen 2014 where nighttime temperatures tmin are increasing at a rate that is 1 4 times than that of daytime temperatures tmax this asymmetric day night warming will consequently affect diurnal patterns of t especially tn in the light of this newly realized increased importance of tn and nighttime warming meteorological drivers of t must be recalibrated accordingly besides radiation vapor pressure deficit vpd has been well documented as the major drivers of t penman 1948 tanner and sinclair 1983 sinclair et al 1984 monteith 1995 oren et al 1999 wang et al 2012 schoppach and sadok 2012 wang et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 massmann et al 2019 due to its control on stomatal behavior via stomatal conductance and carbon water coupling zhou et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 grossiord et al 2020 vpd averaged within a temporal period is the most common way of using it in formulations of t and wue as demonstrated by some of the pioneering researchers on the subject monteith 1965 dewit 1958 tanner and sinclair 1983 this strategy is acceptable at shorter time intervals minutes however vpd variability might be an issue at longer time intervals hours and days as most applications require daily t estimation an appropriate value of daily vpd is required to predict t among the limited work on determining this daily vpd value tanner and sinclair 1983 and more recently sinclair and ghanem 2020 suggested the use of a vpd term weighted on a daily basis to reflect the distribution of t through the daily cycle however this strategy needs to be evaluated locally for its effectiveness to predict t meinke et al 1997 abbate et al 2004 ghanem et al 2020 especially in the light of increasing evidence of i non negligible contribution of tn in t and ii asymmetric nighttime warming observed sap flux technology based transpiration data present an opportunity to evaluate these vpd weighing strategies for best representation of t variability and can be a viable tool to better understand the derivers of nighttime t under different environmental conditions the questions related to nighttime t and its dynamics and major drivers are even more critical for irrigated agroecosystems and semi arid to dry subhumid climates for example major cropping systems in the midwestern united states are maize 9 8 million acres 3 97 million ha soybean 5 1 million acres 2 06 million ha and sorghum 0 15 million acres 61 000 ha according to usda usda 2021 and there exists limited to no knowledge on their tn dynamics a significant portion of these croplands is irrigated usda 2018 and thus characterization of tn has implications for the region s irrigation and water management especially in the context of climate change strong asymmetric warming has been confirmed for midwestern united states i e nebraska for all the seasons especially summer kukal and irmak 2016 irmak et al 2012 owing to increased atmospheric moisture content due to increase in irrigated land area thus in this research we aim to use concurrently observed sap flux based hourly t data across maize soybean and sorghum to determine tn patterns as well as how these patterns lead to varying success of vpd weighing strategies commonly available to estimate t the specific objectives of this research were to i determine comparative rates of tn as proportion of daily t concurrently for maize sorghum and soybean crops ii assess relative effectiveness of vpd derived using different approaches varying by measurement frequency spectral sampling and weighing strategies to explain t variance and iii evaluate the implications of tn contribution to t on vpd conditioning approaches and iii recommend best performing vpd temporal aggregation and weighing strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 research site characteristics field research was conducted in the irmak research laboratory irl advanced

irrigation management field experiments were conducted during 2016 and 2017 growing seasons for maize zea mays l soybean glycine max l merr and grain sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench and this research used the 2016 growing season data these crops are the major row crops in the state with a total of 6 1 million hectares harvested in 2020 the three crops were grown adjacently in the 13 5 ha field by dividing the field in the n s direction all crops were subject to homogenous soil conditions we also ensured that soil and crop management practices were uniform for all crops to an extent that the management also reflected regional grower level management the agronomic management practices including planting emergence and harvesting dates plant density etc are provided for each crop in kukal

algorithms we also applied pesticide and fungicide to all crops uniformly as needed kukal and irmak 2020a 2020b we ensured that crops never undergo water stress and hence optimum growth conditions were maintained this necessitated continuous monitoring of soil moisture which was accomplished using john deere jd field connect probes john deere water san marcos california usa a multi depth

water status obtained from the jd soil moisture sensors during the 2016 growing season a total of 254 mm 286 mm and 286 mm of irrigation was applied to maize sorghum and soybean respectively 2 3 field

the method has been extensively employed in agronomic row crop species zhang et al 2016 zhao and ji 2016 the sap flow sensors are noninvasive and estimate the sap flow velocity in a small length of plant stem as the difference between the power input to a film heater and the combination of conduction heat loss and heat storage two different types of sgb sensors dynamax inc houston tx usa that varied by their gauge diameters sgb 19 for maize and grain sorghum and sga 5 for soybean were installed on the second internode from the soil surface on 4 representative plants in each crop the plants were selected so that they are representative of growth characteristics plant height and morphological area stem diameters with healthy and actively growing plants of the rest of the field table 1 the stem diameters major and minor axis for all monitored plants were measured using a vernier caliper for input into the dynagage s program for computation of sap flow and intermediate variables the sensors were installed after a certain level of vegetative growth for the stem to have sufficient structural strength to support the sensor prior to installation the leaf sheath on the installation section of the stem was removed and the stem was lubricated using a natural oil post installation the sensors were wrapped by aluminum sheets to shield the sensors from moisture from rainfall and dew and any radiation interactions that can confound sensor operation there was no wetting of the canopy or sensors due to irrigation as sdi system delivers the water and nutrients directly to the crop

measurements cohen et al 1993 zeggaf et al 2008 xiao et al 2016 sauer et al 2007 bufon et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 the measurement uncertainty as represented by plant to plant sap flow difference among 4 plants in this research was within an acceptable range for example on doy 224 one of the days with the highest tn measured across all crops daily total sap flow volume measured for 4 individual plants was within 9 7 7 1 and 6 3 of each other for maize sorghum and soybean respectively not all these inter plant difference can be interpreted as errors uncertainties as these individual plants had certain variation in stem diameters which translated into differences in sap volume the sf g h 1 was divided by density of water 1 g cm 3 and crop specific plant populations plants m 2 to calculate crop specific transpiration rates mm h 1 the plant populations were sampled in multiple linear transects in each crop and were 7 3 22 2 and 28 2 plants m 2 for maize soybean and sorghum respectively 2 3 2 meteorological measurements all meteorological variables including minimum and maximum air temperatures tmax and tmin respectively relative humidity rh wind speed u and incoming shortwave radiation rs were continuously measured on hourly basis at an automated weather data network station managed by the high plains regional climate center hprcc at the experimental site the hprcc collected datasets are intended for agricultural applications and thus monitoring sites are located in vegetated areas in contrast to other networks that are typically located in urban developed areas or airports air temperatures and relative humidity are measured by hprcc at a height of 2 m while wind speed is measured at a height of 3 m and was consequently converted to 2 m using formulations provided in jensen and allen 2016 the hprcc has a vigorous automatic and routine procedure in place for data quality and integrity checks for days with erroneous and or missing data in addition incoming photosynthetically active radiation par was measured using a point quantum sensor apogee instruments inc logan utah usa installed in the experimental field which measured par portion of the electromagnetic spectrum 400 700 nm par was measured in units of quantum flux μmol m 1 s 1 which was converted to energy units using a conversion value of 4 57 μmol j 1 the quantum flux sensor was frequently maintained to be clean from any unwanted foreign material covering the optical sensor such as dust soil particles plant material residue etc hourly vapor pressure deficit vpd and grass reference evapotranspiration eto were computed using standard methodologies outlined in jensen and allen 2016 it should be noted that the vpd forms employed in this research represent ambient air vpd in leaf level plant physiological applications leaf to air vpd is commonly employed rather than ambient air vpd as the leaf temperature can deviate from air temperature however in canopy level investigations practitioners commonly use ambient air vpd to represent the drying power of the atmosphere assuming that intercellular air spaces inside leaves remain saturated with water vapor grossiord et al 2020 farquhar and raschke 1978 jones and higgs 1980 the rs data was also used to classify t into nocturnal and daytime t using the rule that if rs was less than 6 w m 2 for a given hour the t during that hour was considered tn all the variables were computed for the period 1991 2019 and data for the experimental period 2016 was subset 2 4 vpd weighing strategies vpd was used in eight different ways differing by measurement frequency spectral sampling and weighing strategies these vpd formulations and their computations are detailed here a vpd from measured hourly mean th and rhh vpda with this formulation daily mean vpd was calculated as average of 24 hour mean vpd during the day hourly vpd vpda was calculated as the difference in saturated es a and actual vapor pressure ea a the data inputs for these calculations are hourly mean air temperature th and relative humidity rhh 1 vpd a t 100 hr t 2400 hr e s a e a a 24 where a mean across 100 2400 h represent a daily mean

frequency of weather variables is on a daily timestep daily mean vpd can also be calculated directly using daily values of tmax tmin and rhmean termed as vpdb the following steps describe computation

the hourly vpd computed in a was scaled using hourly rs values this approach assumes that contribution of hourly t to daily t was proportional to the rs received during each hour rsh in the day 9 vpd c vpd w rs i 0 n vpd a r sh i 0 n r sh d vpd weighted using par vpdd this approach uses the same assumption as in c but a different spectral sampling of the em spectrum was used i e par was used instead of rs par is the visible component of the em spectrum or global rs actually available for photosynthesis and reflects conversion from solar energy to chemical energy thus it is hypothesized that it can better represent t patterns than rs 10 vpd d vpd w par i 0 n vpd a par i 0 n par e vpd weighted using tanner sinclair coefficient vpde daily weighted vpd based on rs vpdc or vpdw rs can be expressed as the following as suggested by tanner and sinclair 1983 11 vpd w rs frac e o t max e o t min based on measurements in madison wi tanner and sinclair 1983 suggested that frac which is a weighing parameter 0 frac 1 would have a value of 0 75 the higher the value of frac the higher the value of vpd so a frac of 0 5 means the vpdw rs represents the mean daily value thus based on this conceptualization the vpd weighted using tanner sinclair coefficient which is frac 0 75 is defined as 12 vpd e vpd w ts 0 75 e o t max e o t min f vpd weighted using locally derived frac vpdf this vpd variant is based on a locally derived value of frac at the experimental site using hourly and daily long term 29 years 1991 2019 meteorological records at the experimental site we calculated the long term mean frac as 13 frac w local i 0 n vpd a r sh i 0 n r sh e o t max e o t min this locally derived frac frac local was used in the following equation to quantify daily vpd g variable of transpiration based on vpda vta vpd and rs being the two major controls of t these two critical variables can be combined as a product of the two this index has been referred to as variable of transpiration in the literature du et al 2011 shin ichi et al 2006 köstner et al 1992 chen et al 2014 thus this variable of transpiration or vta is computed as the product of vpda and total rs received during the day as 14 vt a vpd a r s h variable of transpiration based on vpdb vtb vtb is computed similarly to vta except that it uses vpd from daily tmin tmax and rh vpdb instead of vpda 15 vt b vpd b r s 3 results 3 1 magnitude of tn relative to daily t concurrent hourly t was measured in maize sorghum and soybean during doy 201 230 within the longer experimental period and tn as percent of daily t computed fig s1 in the appendix during this period tn ranged from 1 8 to 15 1 of daily t for maize 0 8 16 2 for sorghum and 0 5 6 2 for soybean fig 1 the average tn for the observational period was 6 9 6 1 and 3 0 of daily t for maize sorghum and soybean respectively substantial day to day variability was encountered in tn as percent of daily t in all crops with coefficients of variation of 43 60 and 53 in maize sorghum and soybean respectively the day to day variation in contribution of tn to daily t is due to diurnal patterns of meteorological drivers in addition to crop specific characteristics the contribution of tn to daily t is a reasonably strong function of ratio of nocturnal eto to daily eto fig s2 in the appendix this implies that the segmentation of total daily eto into day and night components well explains the day to day variation in segmentation of total daily t into day and night components 3 2 how effectively does asce eto reflect tn asce eto is a standardized well accepted and recommended combination aerodynamic and energy terms of the surface energy balance based indicator of atmospheric evaporative demand and is extensively applied for water use determination in irrigation practices and in many other applications to quantify water evaporative loss component of the hydrologic balance however during nocturnal hours eto estimates can be problematic it is evident in fig 1 that eto as percent of daily eto is often sub zero negative or zero as assumed hypothetical reference conditions do not exist during nocturnal periods and eto calculated for nocturnal periods does not satisfy the atmospheric evaporative demand above the reference surface investigating the 29 year long term 1991 2019 weather and eto records n 254 208 at the experimental site we observed that 24 and 10 of the days had negative and zero nocturnal sum eto respectively fig s3a in the appendix within the growing season may 1st sept 30th records n 106 488 33 and 3 of the days had negative and zero nocturnal sum eto respectively fig s3a in the appendix these negative values can be a consequence of i condensation of vapor during periods of early morning dew or ii uncertainties in some parameter estimates such as net radiation and assumptions in the combination approach however sap flow datasets indicate significant t during the hours when eto was negative or zero fig 1 thus it is likely that the environmental variables that drive t during daytime hours do not have the same or similar influence on the magnitude of tn for days with positive nocturnal eto values tn was substantially higher than eto values especially for maize and sorghum fig 1 in the long term 1991 2019 records at the experimental site nocturnal eto was as high as 86 of daily eto with a mean of 6 5 when not negative or zero fig s3b in the appendix during the growing season months however the maximum value of nocturnal eto recorded was 53 with a mean value of 3 7 when not negative or zero thus around two thirds of the calendar year as well as growing season shows positive or non zero nocturnal eto however even when nocturnal eto was positive it was not a satisfactory or a strong predictor of tn fig 2b r2 ranged from 0 08 to 0 62 daytime eto however did not suffer from these weaknesses and demonstrated strong ability in predicting daytime t fig 2a r2 ranged from 0 73 to 0 94 in light of these observations it can be ascertained that nocturnal eto fails to represent observed tn patterns owing to weaknesses in the physical assumptions of the combination based penman monteith approach this is true both for days when nocturnal eto 0 as well as nocturnal eto 0 3 3 influence of vpd and wind speed on nocturnal water use meteorological variables such as vpd and u2 can have reasonably high values during nocturnal hours when no radiative energy or light is available for example within the observation period of doy 181 263 31 14 and 1 of vpd records during the nocturnal hours were greater than 0 25 kpa 0 5 kpa and 1 0 kpa respectively similarly 90 51 14 and 3 of u2 records during the nocturnal hours showed values greater than 1 m s 1 2 m s 1 4 m s 1 and 6 m s 1 respectively fig s4b in the appendix nocturnal u2 was roughly at par with daytime u2 fig s4a in the appendix hourly tn for all three crops was positively influenced by vpd during the respective hourly intervals with soybean showing the strongest correlation among the three crops fig 3a the same relationships were also observed when these relationships investigated at daily scale fig 3b due to aggregation of hourly vpd to nocturnal mean vpd the correlations were slightly stronger with less uncertainty wind speed also showed positive relationships with tn at both hourly fig 4a and daily intervals fig 4b aggregation of u2 from hourly to nocturnal mean substantially improved the relationships across the three crops similar to what was observed for vpd soybean tn showed the highest correlation with u2 higher wind speeds cause additional removal of moisture from air surrounding the canopy increasing the capacity of the air to carry more moisture and allow a greater loss of water thus although u2 is not directly used in formulation of vpd vpd is physically associated and indirectly influenced by u2 3 4 temporal aggregation of vpd no clear distinction can be made among vpda and vpdb in the long term daily time series during 1991 2019 fig s5 and s6 in the appendix however for the experimental period doy 182 262 in 2016 on average vpdb was 16 greater than vpda fig 5 implying that the use of tmax tmin and mean rh to represent daily vpd resulted in overestimation of hourly mean conditions across the day however this behavior can vary temporally depending on day to day variability in local weather patterns and diurnal distribution of vpd no systematic pattern of under or overestimation was found among vpda and vpdb in the long term 1991 2019 datasets use of vpda yielded slightly stronger correlation with t than use of vpdb in maize r2 of 0 81 vs 0 79 for vpda and vpdb respectively and soybean r2 of 0 63 vs 0 59 for vpda and vpdb respectively as evident from figs 6a b and 7a b however both approaches resulted in the same r2 when regressed with sorghum t fig 8a b 3 5 radiation based diurnally weighted vpd 3 5 1 radiation weighted vpd and nocturnal atmospheric aridity diurnal weighing of vpd and its formulation eq 9 amplifies the contribution of vpd during the brighter hours towards daily vpd likewise it also relatively dampens the contribution of vpd under relatively darker not entirely dark hours this light based weighing of vpd increases the minimum maximum range of vpdc and vpdd relative to vpda and vpdb fig 5 fig s7 in the appendix the use of vpdc and vpdd was not advantageous in predicting t in maize fig 6c d or soybean fig 7c d as compared with simply using vpda and vpdb fig 6a b fig 7a b a slight improvement in correlation r2 of 0 81 vs 0 79 was observed for sorghum fig 8c d vpdc and vpdd are theoretically superior vpd forms as they correct observed vpd for diurnal radiation distribution however they also completely ignore vpd during the nocturnal hours when rs and par equate to zero vpda and vpdb however based on daily average conditions have some merit due to equal weightage assignment of nocturnal vpd as daytime vpd 3 5 2 rs versus par for diurnal weighing of vpd par at the experimental site has been quantified at 45 of rs using concurrent measurements of both across three years kukal and irmak 2020b use of par to diurnally weigh vpd vpdd was not advantageous to the use of rs for the same vpdc the r2 did not change at all when vpdc and vpdd were used to estimate sorghum t fig 8c d or soybean t fig 7c d as a matter of fact using vpdd yielded slightly lower r2 than vpdc when regressed against maize t fig 6c d 3 5 3 locally derived coefficient for diurnal weighing of vpd daily frac at the experimental site during 1991 2019 was subject to wide variability demonstrating the entire range of possible values i e 0 1 a minor fraction 2 of the frac time series showed values 1 which are rare but have been shown to be possible ghanem et al 2020 when a moving average of frac within a window two weeks before and after each day was calculated fig 9 the variability was minimized considerably when datasets from entire calendar years were compiled mean frac was 0 61 with a standard deviation of 0 21 when datasets from only the growing season may 1 september 30 were considered the mean frac was 0 57 with a standard deviation of 0 17 frac was also found to be seasonally variable albeit with substantial variability fig 10a the maximum value of frac was observed in june at 0 65 while the lowest value was observed in january at 0 48 generally a cyclic pattern of high frac in summers and low frac in winters was apparent fig 10a the values of frac can be interpreted using the equivalency of vpdf on days with frac 0 50 to vpda implying that a frac of 0 50 means vpdf represents the mean daily value of vpd higher the value of fracd higher the value of vpdf frac does not account for nocturnal vpd as all nocturnal vpd values are multiplied by 0 value of rs during nocturnal hours nevertheless daily value of frac can roughly indicate how dominant tn is relative to daily t days which have a smaller frac were seen to have a greater proportion of tn in daily t and vice versa fig s8 in the appendix during the experimental period the lowest and the highest frac values observed were 0 04 doy 184 and 0 95 doy 206 respectively figs 11 and b and 11c present diurnal distributions of vpd rs and crop t during days with low extreme high extreme and normal frac values respectively the low extreme frac is characteristic of a day with low evaporative demand eto 0 6 mm d 1 low vpd 0 09 kpa and low rs 757 w m 2 these meteorological conditions were especially atypical for daylight hours in july however nocturnal conditions showed substantially high vpd resulting in nocturnal eto being 25 of daily eto and maize tn being 42 of daily t on the other hand high extreme of frac is characteristic of a day when both vpd and rs show their maximum values representative of a cloudless day and vpd and rs show complete synchrony in their diurnal trends fig 11b the synchrony allows for amplification of the maximum vpd value using the maximum rs value during the day on a day that shows the same frac as the growing season mean 0 58 both rs and vpd show their maximum values as on a cloudless day fig 11c with the exception of the synchrony that was evident in fig 11b the ascent and descent curves of diurnal vpd are lagged behind that of rs fig 11c this asynchrony of diurnal vpd and rs at the experimental site might be problematic for application of the rs based diurnal vpd weighing the extent of variability in diurnal magnitudes distribution and synchrony in rs and vpd is evident from the fact that the same month july comprises of days doys 184 206 and 249 with these contrasting characteristics that are translated into contrasting frac values the use of frac to weigh vpd vpdf is a convenient alternative to dynamically weighing each day s vpd using rs vpdc however given the possible day to day variability in frac fig 11a b c using a constant frac even when locally derived might present some tradeoffs in its effectiveness ideally vpdf fig s9 in the appendix should replicate vpdc fig s7 in the appendix however that is unlikely due to the considerable variability in frac on daily monthly and yearly scales fig 10 during the experimental period it was observed that vpdf resulting from the stable assumption of frac 0 61 did not perfectly follow vpdc but did result in achieving a mean degree of weighing fig 5 owing to the non stationary behavior of frac vpdf explained a suboptimal degree of variance in t than vpdc for all crops fig 6c f fig 7c f fig 8c f however use of frac allows for an empirically based and convenient strategy for diurnal weighing of vpd especially when vpd and rs data is unavailable or inaccessible at hourly time steps 3 5 4 evaluation of the tanner sinclair coefficient for diurnal weighing of vpd for most of the days vpde derived from the tanner sinclair coefficient frac 0 75 showed the highest values among all the vpd forms figs s5 and s10 in the appendix observing the performance of vpde to follow vpdc at the experimental site in the long term fig s11d in the appendix we find that slope of vpde vs vpdc is closest to 1 however it is subject to a greater root mean squared error than vpdf in terms of explaining variance in t use of vpde is equivalent to that of using vpdf figs 6e 7e 8e as their formulations only differ by a constant 0 61 vs 0 75 thus while the concept given by tanner and sinclair 1983 is fit the coefficient needs to be recalibrated site specifically using monthly mean frac values fig 10 for weighing vpd did result in a slightly better agreement with vpdc than using a constant annual frac 0 61 or growing season frac 0 58 in the long term fig s11 in the appendix a larger rmse 0 36 was observed among vpd weighed using frac 0 58 and vpdc for the growing season datasets than using frac 0 61 for the entire calendar year 3 6 variability of transpiration based on atmospheric aridity and radiative energy vpdc vpde and vpdf use rs for adjusting vpd for diurnal radiant energy distribution with the adjustment being a normalizing one multiplying and consequently dividing by rs or par this procedure leads to incorporation of relative timing and intensity of radiant energy into the vpd term in order to amplify and dampen the role of vpd based on available energy in doing so the direct impact of rs on water use is not accounted for and rightly so however vpd and rs can be combined in a way that fulfils two objectives i directly account for impact of radiant energy on t and ii account for nocturnal vpd otherwise ignored in rs based diurnal weighing of vpd the variable of transpiration is a product of daily mean vpd either vpda or vpdb and sum of rs for that day the distribution of daily vta and vtb during the experimental period as well as during 1991 2019 are shown in fig s12 in the appendix since this multiplication operation is used on daily scale not hourly the impact of nocturnal vpd is embedded in the vt consequently resulting in improved performance the use of vta and vtb resulted in most explanation of variance in t than all the vpd forms in maize fig 6 g h soybean fig 7 g h and sorghum fig 8 g h again as seen before the use of vpdb to compute vt vtb results in inferior performance relative to vta this is a consequence of the loss in temporal resolution of vpd estimations when using maximum and minimum t and rh 4 discussion 4 1 underlying basis for tn observations of incomplete stomatal closure during nighttime have been made as early as late 1800 s however the physiological mechanisms behind tn are not well understood but there are several potential hypothesis to explain tn these include water leakage through the cuticle or cuticular transpiration rawson and clarke 1988 coupel ledru et al 2016 barbour et al 2005 genetic variation in nighttime stomatal conductance stomatal density abaxial adaxial surface responses caird et al 2007a environmental conditions such as nighttime vpd atmospheric mixing photoperiod length and light intensity rawson and clarke 1988 rogiers and clarke 2013 schoppach et al 2014 response to water availability and abscisic acid aba rawson and clarke 1988 and nutrient availability howard and donovan 2007 both positive and negative impacts of tn have been proposed for example tn allows for enhanced nutrient uptake scholz et al 2007 dissolved oxygen delivery to tissues in woody species daley and phillips 2006 prevents excessive leaf turgor donovan et al 2001 enhances daytime carbon gain and water use efficiency in semi arid environments for some breeding lines schoppach et al 2014 and enhances radiation use efficiency resco de dios et al 2016 in contrast evidence also suggests higher contribution of tn to t during drought claverie et al 2018 exacerbating negative impacts in rainfed environments tn also allows for a air pollutant eg ozone uptake by plants resulting in both positive and negative impacts takahashi et al 2005 keller and häsler 1984 b influences on oxygen isotope signatures of within canopy co2 barbour et al 2005 c hindrance of hydraulic redistribution and equilibration among plant water potential and wettest soil layer in the root zone during the night donovan et al 2001 irrespective of net tradeoffs of these impacts tn cannot be ignored for its role on the overall water balance in maize sorghum soybean and other crops investigated in the literature thus appropriate water balance accounting necessitates that tn and consequently its meteorological drivers during nighttime are given due weightage from a surface energy budget standpoint for tn to happen latent heat should be consumed for vaporization meaning that tn should have a signature in the nighttime distribution of net radiation into latent heat sensible heat and ground heat flux our broader research investigations at the experimental site allowed for evaluating whether this was true or not surface energy budget components were being measured for the same sorghum field during 2016 and beyond using bowen ratio energy balance irmak et al 2010 the latent heat datasets from this investigation were analyzed at hourly scales during the period overlapping sap flow measurements doy 201 230 while this data will not be discussed at length it was revealed that latent heat of vaporization during nocturnal hours was oftentimes negative which means that the exchange of energy was endothermic representing consumption of energy by the system for tn to happen the total nocturnal sums ranged from 3 kj m 2 to 683 kj m 2 during the observation period doy 201 230 although these magnitudes represent evaporation from both soil and crop there has been additional evidence of nighttime water losses recorded from continuous hourly flux measurements at the same experimental site using surface energy budget technique irmak 2011 reported seasonal average nighttime evapotranspiration losses of 0 19 in 2005 and 0 11 mm night 1 in 2006 losses of 0 50 mm or more were reported on 7 8 nights per growing season and resulted in seasonal total nocturnal evapotranspiration of 31 mm in 2005 and 16 mm in 206 these nocturnal evaporative losses driven by vpd and wind speed also translated into decreased sensible heat flux irmak 2011 and thus modification of nighttime bowen ratio these observations rooted in surface energy budgeting are independent evidence of nocturnal latent heat consumption that allows for tn 4 2 should vpd be weighted using rs conditioning of datasets of meteorological drivers in a way that they are aligned with diurnal cycle of crop water use has recently received attention sinclair and ghanem 2020 ghanem et al 2020 as plant based t prediction approaches are revisited and encouraged sinclair et al 2014 recently sinclair and ghanem 2020 proposed plant based predictions of canopy t based on the original work by dewit 1958 and tanner and sinclair 1983 herein they suggested that the vpd employed should be weighted on a daily basis to reflect the distribution of t through the daily cycle they also suggested that the use of a daily mean vpd in water use determinations such as the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 is erroneous and that a weighted vpd value be used instead midday t rates account for a dominant proportion of daily t when vpd is the highest during the day which is the underlying reason for encouraging the use of rs weighted vpd while this is a theoretically justified stance there does not exist a fair comparison among these strategies weighing vs no weighing using observed crop t data this research framework with measured t data in three field crops allowed for comparative evaluation of what temporal aggregation strategy results in explaining day to day variance in crop t calibration of vpd using rs allows to reflect the temporally dynamic atmospheric aridity conditions that drive t while this strategy is useful for assigning a brightness feature to the vpd distribution it also completely ignores the vpd dynamics during the hours in dark hours rs 0 this is suboptimal given that tn in maize sorghum and soybean was showed to be as high as 6 2 16 2 on certain days during the experimental period tn was found to be influenced by vpd and u even under dark conditions this tendency of overlooking the meteorological drivers of nocturnal t makes the rs based weighing strategies ineffective to predict or explain t variability especially on days and in crops where tn is a non negligible proportion of daily t a parallel comparison of rs weighted vpd and daily mean vpd showed that the former performed relatively inferior to the latter in explaining observed t variance in field crops in the light of non significant observations of tn rs based weighing strategies are incapable of achieving that in contrast we find that in scenarios where tn is significant a simplistic daily mean vpd is the most suitable vpd form given the fact that vpd at each hour is given identical weightage 4 3 tn and diurnal asymmetry in weather trends observational evidence for asymmetric day and night specific heat and aridity trends underscore the critical nature of tn and its drivers for our agroecosystems there exists sufficient evidence to establish that trends in nocturnal heat and aridity can be highly contrasting to those during daytime both globally peng et al 2004 sillmann et al 2013 screen 2014 sadok and jagadish 2020 and locally kukal and irmak 2016 irmak et al 2012 at the experimental site long term trend analysis of growing season mean tmax and tmin fig s13 in the appendix suggests that nights are warming at roughly twice 1 8 times that rate 0 31 c decade 1 as days 0 17 c decade 1 similarly growing season mean nocturnal vpd shows a negative trend 0 04 kpa decade 1 that is roughly twice 1 9 times that of daytime vpd 0 02 kpa decade 1 although this particular site shows a decrease in growing season mean vpd both day and night during 1991 2019 large scale analyses of past and projected vpd datasets reveals a continental scale increase in vpd ficklin and novick 2017 higher nocturnal vpd will not only increase tn but will also increase daytime t rates schoppach and sadok 2013 due to altered plant hydraulic conductance and aquaporin activity in addition to the direct impacts from higher daytime vpd thus future climate conditions will make it even more challenging to ignore tn and nocturnal vpd when considering crop water use 4 4 takeaways for vpd conditioning tn and nighttime meteorological drivers may not be as significant or attention worthy for certain crops seasons environments and intended applications in these scenarios rs based weighing strategies are valid and should be recommended to predict and model water use recently there has been some progress in estimating plant transpiration by relaying on fundamental physiological and physical descriptors of canopy water use efficiency sinclair and ghanem 2020 within this approach the vpd term has been defined by the authors as a radiation weighted vpd as this approach is relatively fundamental and simple to execute and avoids the need for meteorological approximations such as the two step approach it is likely that it will see increased use in research and practice in that case radiation weighted vpd data will be instrumental for efficient use within this approach to do so several different data scenarios and strategies are available to the user when hourly data on vpd and rs are available the user should dynamically weigh each day s vpd to deduce vpdc eq 9 this strategy might be somewhat computationally intensive but results in better performance convenient weighing approaches that use a constant frac value are relatively easier to execute relying only on eo tmax eo tmin and a constant frac value when no information on locally suitable frac is available t s coefficient frac 0 75 can be usable although with caution being an environment specific assumption we find that locally derived frac is a better performing tool to weigh vpd than the t s coefficient future research should focus on local deduction and assessment of frac in water sensitive agroecosystems and its spatial and temporal behavior such as that accomplished by ghanem et al 2020 in diverse environments of france among the limited observations of frac globally it has demonstrated substantial instability across locations and seasons table 1 lists mean estimates of frac available in the literature mean frac estimates from this research represent the lowest values amongst all the global estimations implying that for south central nebraska the need for diurnal weighing is lower than in these ecosystems frac is closer to 0 50 5 conclusions using hourly measurements of sap flux it was revealed that tn in field crops was non negligible and ranged from 6 to 16 of daily t across maize soybean and sorghum in absence of rs tn was driven by wind and atmospheric aridity conditions during the night for these periods of non negligible tn eto was either negative or zero failing to represent nocturnal water vapor exchange upon evaluating multiple vpd conditioning options available we found that the recently recommended rs based weighing of vpd suggested by sinclair and ghanem 2020 ignored tn and thus showed suboptimal performance in explaining t variance considering tn magnitudes observed a daily mean vpd performed better than rs weighted vpd local frac values suitable for diurnal weighing were also developed from long term hourly weather records at the site which showed substantial variability with mean estimates of 0 61 annual and 0 58 growing season and were lower than what has been suggested by tanner and sinclair 1983 i e 0 75 a dynamic vpd weighing strategy for each day accounting for day to day variability performed better than a constant frac based vpd weighing strategy a variable of transpiration based on the product of daily mean vpd and total daily radiation was the most effective in explaining t variance in all crops the performance statistics deduced by testing different conditioning approaches in actual field conditions aid in selection of the best practices to be followed for predicting t in crops environments and seasons with non negligible tn declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9561,daytime transpiration is driven by evaporative demand vapor pressure deficit vpd and radiative energy dominantly accounting for daily transpiration t recent modeling approaches recommend weighing vpd for diurnal cycle of t using radiation to predict t as opposed to using daily mean vpd this proposition requires field evaluation so that diurnal patterns of water use are represented fairly in this research hourly t was measured concurrently for irrigated maize sorghum and soybean in a dry sub humid climate various vpd conditioning approaches available to the user that differed in measurement frequency spectral sampling and weighing strategies were evaluated to explain variance in t the locally derived radiation based weighing coefficient frac showed substantial variability with mean estimates of 0 61 annual and 0 58 growing season which were lower than the classically recommended tanner sinclair coefficient 0 75 the use of a constant frac value for weighing vpd was suboptimal to dynamic weighing of vpd for each day accounting for day to day variability this is primarily because of considerable nighttime water use tn demonstrated values that were 6 16 of t across the three crops tn was driven by wind speed and vpd during nighttime hours these field observations of tn hold implications for un suitability of radiation based weighing procedures which assume no tn diurnally weighted vpd was suboptimal to using daily mean vpd as the former does not account for dark period vpd additionally reference evapotranspiration eto the standardized metric of crop water use was either negative or zero for nocturnal periods when tn 0 and thus failed to appropriately represent tn a variable of transpiration based on daily mean vpd and total daily radiation was the most effective in explaining t variance in all crops with increasing asymmetry between daytime and nighttime warming and aridity it becomes increasingly important to appropriately precondition vpd data to predict t caution should be exercised while using radiation weighted vpd in crops environments and seasons with non negligible tn keywords nighttime transpiration water use dark transpiration weighing coefficients nighttime warming 1 introduction water loss transpiration or t in plants through water vapor and energy exchange process between plant stomata and surrounding environment is an unavoidable consequence of stomatal opening for photosynthetic carbon fixation it plays significant role in determining plant response to environmental variables plant physiology agronomy and plant science hydrology climate science and in many other scientific disciplines transpiration rather than evapotranspiration is the actual true or more relevant contributor to dry matter assimilation and crop productivity evaporation on the other hand is an unbeneficial use of water resources and does not contribute to plant growth development or productivity in most cases plant productivity is quantified and presented as a function of evapotranspiration rather than transpiration because quantification of transpiration rates separately is an extremely difficult time consuming and expensive task that requires expert personnel thus in most cases the magnitude of evaporative loss evaporation and transpiration together is lumped into the evapotranspiration category when quantifying and expressing plant water use the processes of stomatal opening and thus t have been commonly assumed to be limited to the daytime hours the assumption of complete stomatal closure during nighttime is regarded in line with the optimal stomatal behavior theories which state that plants strive to maximize carbon gain while minimizing t cowan and farquhar 1977 farquhar 1973 however advances in measurement of t via sap flux monitoring gas exchange and lysimetry have shown incomplete stomatal closure or non negligible nocturnal t tn for a wide range of plant species snyder et al 2003 oren et al 1999 fisher et al 2007 benyon 1999 bucci et al 2004 daley and phillips 2006 scholz et al 2007 burgess et al 1998 dawson et al 2007 donovan et al 1999 hogg and hurdle 1997 marks and lechowicz 2007 oishi et al 2008 ward et al 2008 caird et al 2007a coupel ledru et al 2016 forster 2014 o keefe 2016 rogiers et al 2009 resco de dios et al 2019 duursma et al 2019 pfautsch et al 2011 while most of the literature focuses on tn for woody shrubs timber plantations and forests tn in agricultural crops has received decent attention abdel aziz et al 1964 green et al 1989 caird et al 2007b fuentes et al 2013 resco de dios et al 2016 even et al 2018 sadok and tamang 2019 richards et al 1986 rawson and clarke 1988 schoppach et al 2014 among these studies tn values ranged from 8 to 55 of daytime t schoppach et al 2020 tn is especially important in managed agricultural ecosystems where water management and irrigation strategies rely on replacing crop evapotranspiration or soil moisture deficits moreover genetic variability in tn is being used as a breeding target to improve water use efficiency wue and dry matter productivity coupel ledru et al 2016 schoppach et al 2020 especially under drought and severe heat stress environments conditions the strong evidence of tn being a significant proportion of daily t demands revisiting the meteorological predictors often used to estimate t global observations show asymmetric warming trends peng et al 2004 sillmann et al 2013 screen 2014 where nighttime temperatures tmin are increasing at a rate that is 1 4 times than that of daytime temperatures tmax this asymmetric day night warming will consequently affect diurnal patterns of t especially tn in the light of this newly realized increased importance of tn and nighttime warming meteorological drivers of t must be recalibrated accordingly besides radiation vapor pressure deficit vpd has been well documented as the major drivers of t penman 1948 tanner and sinclair 1983 sinclair et al 1984 monteith 1995 oren et al 1999 wang et al 2012 schoppach and sadok 2012 wang et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 massmann et al 2019 due to its control on stomatal behavior via stomatal conductance and carbon water coupling zhou et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 grossiord et al 2020 vpd averaged within a temporal period is the most common way of using it in formulations of t and wue as demonstrated by some of the pioneering researchers on the subject monteith 1965 dewit 1958 tanner and sinclair 1983 this strategy is acceptable at shorter time intervals minutes however vpd variability might be an issue at longer time intervals hours and days as most applications require daily t estimation an appropriate value of daily vpd is required to predict t among the limited work on determining this daily vpd value tanner and sinclair 1983 and more recently sinclair and ghanem 2020 suggested the use of a vpd term weighted on a daily basis to reflect the distribution of t through the daily cycle however this strategy needs to be evaluated locally for its effectiveness to predict t meinke et al 1997 abbate et al 2004 ghanem et al 2020 especially in the light of increasing evidence of i non negligible contribution of tn in t and ii asymmetric nighttime warming observed sap flux technology based transpiration data present an opportunity to evaluate these vpd weighing strategies for best representation of t variability and can be a viable tool to better understand the derivers of nighttime t under different environmental conditions the questions related to nighttime t and its dynamics and major drivers are even more critical for irrigated agroecosystems and semi arid to dry subhumid climates for example major cropping systems in the midwestern united states are maize 9 8 million acres 3 97 million ha soybean 5 1 million acres 2 06 million ha and sorghum 0 15 million acres 61 000 ha according to usda usda 2021 and there exists limited to no knowledge on their tn dynamics a significant portion of these croplands is irrigated usda 2018 and thus characterization of tn has implications for the region s irrigation and water management especially in the context of climate change strong asymmetric warming has been confirmed for midwestern united states i e nebraska for all the seasons especially summer kukal and irmak 2016 irmak et al 2012 owing to increased atmospheric moisture content due to increase in irrigated land area thus in this research we aim to use concurrently observed sap flux based hourly t data across maize soybean and sorghum to determine tn patterns as well as how these patterns lead to varying success of vpd weighing strategies commonly available to estimate t the specific objectives of this research were to i determine comparative rates of tn as proportion of daily t concurrently for maize sorghum and soybean crops ii assess relative effectiveness of vpd derived using different approaches varying by measurement frequency spectral sampling and weighing strategies to explain t variance and iii evaluate the implications of tn contribution to t on vpd conditioning approaches and iii recommend best performing vpd temporal aggregation and weighing strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 research site characteristics field research was conducted in the irmak research laboratory irl advanced

irrigation management field experiments were conducted during 2016 and 2017 growing seasons for maize zea mays l soybean glycine max l merr and grain sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench and this research used the 2016 growing season data these crops are the major row crops in the state with a total of 6 1 million hectares harvested in 2020 the three crops were grown adjacently in the 13 5 ha field by dividing the field in the n s direction all crops were subject to homogenous soil conditions we also ensured that soil and crop management practices were uniform for all crops to an extent that the management also reflected regional grower level management the agronomic management practices including planting emergence and harvesting dates plant density etc are provided for each crop in kukal and irmak 2020a 2020b we sufficiently fertilized all crops based on the soil sampling determined residual nitrogen n in each plot university of nebraska lincoln crop specific n recommendation algorithms we also applied pesticide and fungicide to all crops uniformly as needed kukal and irmak 2020a 2020b we ensured that crops never undergo water stress and hence optimum growth conditions were maintained this necessitated continuous monitoring of soil moisture which was accomplished using john deere jd field connect probes john deere water san marcos california usa a multi depth capacitance probe the constituent capacitance sensors represent soil layers of 0 0 15 m 0 15 0 25 m 0 25 0 40 m 0 40 0 75 m and 0 75 1 20 m respectively we installed 4 6 probes immediately after plants emerged and the probe was installed in the inter plant spacing we used 4 6 probes per crop proportional to the plot area irrigation timing and amounts were determined based on the average soil water status obtained from the jd soil moisture sensors during the 2016 growing season a total of 254 mm 286 mm and 286 mm of irrigation was applied to maize sorghum and soybean respectively 2 3 field measurements 2 3 1 sap flow measurements sap flow sf sensors in the three crops were deployed to measure the t based on the heat balance method sakuratani 1981 in addition to tree and shrub species the method has been extensively employed in agronomic row crop species zhang et al 2016 zhao and ji 2016 the sap flow sensors are noninvasive and estimate the sap flow velocity in a small length of plant stem as the difference between the power input to a film heater and the combination of conduction heat loss and heat storage two different types of sgb sensors dynamax inc houston tx usa that varied by their gauge diameters sgb 19 for maize and grain sorghum and sga 5 for soybean were installed on the second internode from the soil surface on 4 representative plants in each crop the plants were selected so that they are representative of growth characteristics plant height and morphological area stem diameters with healthy and actively growing plants of the rest of the field table 1 the stem diameters major and minor axis for all monitored plants were measured using a vernier caliper for input into the dynagage s program for computation of sap flow and intermediate variables the sensors were installed after a certain level of vegetative growth for the stem to have sufficient structural strength to support the sensor prior to installation the leaf sheath on the installation section of the stem was removed and the stem was lubricated using a natural oil post installation the sensors were wrapped by aluminum sheets to shield the sensors from moisture from rainfall and dew and any radiation interactions that can confound sensor operation there was no wetting of the canopy or sensors due to irrigation as sdi system delivers the water and nutrients directly to the crop root zone with no soil surface wetting the sensors were connected to a flow32 1 k datalogger system dynamax inc houston tx usa to record sap flow g h 1 one 60 min intervals sap flux sensors that are installed carefully as recommended by the manufacturer dynamax 2005 and while following all the best practices ensuring shading of the gauge ensuring gauge not too close to the ground appropriately cleaning the stem ensuring complete shielding of the gauge preventing condensation intrusion into sensor ensuring correct fit with expanding stem girth regular maintenance shall produce reliable measurements cohen et al 1993 zeggaf et al 2008 xiao et al 2016 sauer et al 2007 bufon et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 the measurement uncertainty as represented by plant to plant sap flow difference among 4 plants in this research was within an acceptable range for example on doy 224 one of the days with the highest tn measured across all crops daily total sap flow volume measured for 4 individual plants was within 9 7 7 1 and 6 3 of each other for maize sorghum and soybean respectively not all these inter plant difference can be interpreted as errors uncertainties as these individual plants had certain variation in stem diameters which translated into differences in sap volume the sf g h 1 was divided by density of water 1 g cm 3 and crop specific plant populations plants m 2 to calculate crop specific transpiration rates mm h 1 the plant populations were sampled in multiple linear transects in each crop and were 7 3 22 2 and 28 2 plants m 2 for maize soybean and sorghum respectively 2 3 2 meteorological measurements all meteorological variables including minimum and maximum air temperatures tmax and tmin respectively relative humidity rh wind speed u and incoming shortwave radiation rs were continuously measured on hourly basis at an automated weather data network station managed by the high plains regional climate center hprcc at the experimental site the hprcc collected datasets are intended for agricultural applications and thus monitoring sites are located in vegetated areas in contrast to other networks that are typically located in urban developed areas or airports air temperatures and relative humidity are measured by hprcc at a height of 2 m while wind speed is measured at a height of 3 m and was consequently converted to 2 m using formulations provided in jensen and allen 2016 the hprcc has a vigorous automatic and routine procedure in place for data quality and integrity checks for days with erroneous and or missing data in addition incoming photosynthetically active radiation par was measured using a point quantum sensor apogee instruments inc logan utah usa installed in the experimental field which measured par portion of the electromagnetic spectrum 400 700 nm par was measured in units of quantum flux μmol m 1 s 1 which was converted to energy units using a conversion value of 4 57 μmol j 1 the quantum flux sensor was frequently maintained to be clean from any unwanted foreign material covering the optical sensor such as dust soil particles plant material residue etc hourly vapor pressure deficit vpd and grass reference evapotranspiration eto were computed using standard methodologies outlined in jensen and allen 2016 it should be noted that the vpd forms employed in this research represent ambient air vpd in leaf level plant physiological applications leaf to air vpd is commonly employed rather than ambient air vpd as the leaf temperature can deviate from air temperature however in canopy level investigations practitioners commonly use ambient air vpd to represent the drying power of the atmosphere assuming that intercellular air spaces inside leaves remain saturated with water vapor grossiord et al 2020 farquhar and raschke 1978 jones and higgs 1980 the rs data was also used to classify t into nocturnal and daytime t using the rule that if rs was less than 6 w m 2 for a given hour the t during that hour was considered tn all the variables were computed for the period 1991 2019 and data for the experimental period 2016 was subset 2 4 vpd weighing strategies vpd was used in eight different ways differing by measurement frequency spectral sampling and weighing strategies these vpd formulations and their computations are detailed here a vpd from measured hourly mean th and rhh vpda with this formulation daily mean vpd was calculated as average of 24 hour mean vpd during the day hourly vpd vpda was calculated as the difference in saturated es a and actual vapor pressure ea a the data inputs for these calculations are hourly mean air temperature th and relative humidity rhh 1 vpd a t 100 hr t 2400 hr e s a e a a 24 where a mean across 100 2400 h represent a daily mean value es a and ea a are calculated as 2 e s a 0 6108 exp 17 27 t h t h 237 3 3 e a a rh h 100 0 6108 exp 17 27 t h t h 237 3 b vpd from daily tmin tmax and rh vpdb when measurement and or reporting frequency of weather variables is on a daily timestep daily mean vpd can also be calculated directly using daily values of tmax tmin and rhmean termed as vpdb the following steps describe computation of various steps involved in this formulation 4 vpd b e s b e a b 5 e o t max 0 6108 exp 17 27 t max t max 237 3 6 e o t min 0 6108 exp 17 27 t min t min 237 3 where eo tmin saturation vapor pressure

the hourly vpd computed in a was scaled using hourly rs values this approach assumes that contribution of hourly t to daily t was proportional to the rs received during each hour rsh in the day 9 vpd c vpd w rs i 0 n vpd a r sh i 0 n r sh d vpd weighted using par vpdd this approach uses the same assumption as in c but a different spectral sampling of the em spectrum was used i e par was used instead of rs par is the visible component of the em spectrum or global rs actually available for photosynthesis and reflects conversion from solar energy to chemical energy thus it is hypothesized that it can better represent t patterns than rs 10 vpd d vpd w par i 0 n vpd a par i 0 n par e vpd weighted using tanner sinclair coefficient vpde daily weighted vpd based on rs vpdc or vpdw rs can be expressed as the following as suggested by tanner and sinclair 1983 11 vpd w rs frac e o t max e o t min based on measurements in madison wi tanner and sinclair 1983 suggested that frac which is a weighing parameter 0 frac 1 would have a value of 0 75 the higher the value of frac the higher the value of vpd so a frac of 0 5 means the vpdw rs represents the mean daily value thus based on this conceptualization the vpd weighted using tanner sinclair coefficient which is frac 0 75 is defined as 12 vpd e vpd w ts 0 75 e o t max e o t min f vpd weighted using locally derived frac vpdf this vpd variant is based on a locally derived value of frac at the experimental site using hourly and daily long term 29 years 1991 2019 meteorological records at the experimental site we calculated the long term mean frac as 13 frac w local i 0 n vpd a r sh i 0 n r sh e o t max e o t min this locally derived frac frac local was used in the following equation to quantify daily vpd g variable of transpiration based on vpda vta vpd and rs being the two major controls of t these two critical variables can be combined as a product of the two this index has been referred to as variable of transpiration in the literature du et al 2011 shin ichi et al 2006 köstner et al 1992 chen et al 2014 thus this variable of transpiration or vta is computed as the product of vpda and total rs received during the day as 14 vt a vpd a r s h variable of transpiration based on vpdb vtb vtb is computed similarly to vta except that it uses vpd from daily tmin tmax and rh vpdb instead of vpda 15 vt b vpd b r s 3 results 3 1 magnitude of tn relative to daily t concurrent hourly t was measured in maize sorghum and soybean during doy 201 230 within the longer experimental period and tn as percent of daily t computed fig s1 in the appendix during this period tn ranged from 1 8 to 15 1 of daily t for maize 0 8 16 2 for sorghum and 0 5 6 2 for soybean fig 1 the average tn for the observational period was 6 9 6 1 and 3 0 of daily t for maize sorghum and soybean respectively substantial day to day variability was encountered in tn as percent of daily t in all crops with coefficients of variation of 43 60 and 53 in maize sorghum and soybean respectively the day to day variation in contribution of tn to daily t is due to diurnal patterns of meteorological drivers in addition to crop specific characteristics the contribution of tn to daily t is a reasonably strong function of ratio of nocturnal eto to daily eto fig s2 in the appendix this implies that the segmentation of total daily eto into day and night components well explains the day to day variation in segmentation of total daily t into day and night components 3 2 how effectively does asce eto reflect tn asce eto is a standardized well accepted and recommended combination aerodynamic and energy terms of the surface energy balance based indicator of atmospheric evaporative demand and is extensively applied for water use determination in irrigation practices and in many other applications to quantify water evaporative loss component of the hydrologic balance however during nocturnal hours eto estimates can be problematic it is evident in fig 1 that eto as percent of daily eto is often sub zero negative or zero as assumed hypothetical reference conditions do not exist during nocturnal periods and eto calculated for nocturnal periods does not satisfy the atmospheric evaporative demand above the reference surface investigating the 29 year long term 1991 2019 weather and eto records n 254 208 at the experimental site we observed that 24 and 10 of the days had negative and zero nocturnal sum eto respectively fig s3a in the appendix within the growing season may 1st sept 30th records n 106 488 33 and 3 of the days had negative and zero nocturnal sum eto respectively fig s3a in the appendix these negative values can be a consequence of i condensation of vapor during periods of early morning dew or ii uncertainties in some parameter estimates such as net radiation and assumptions in the combination approach however sap flow datasets indicate significant t during the hours when eto was negative or zero fig 1 thus it is likely that the environmental variables that drive t during daytime hours do not have the same or similar influence on the magnitude of tn for days with positive nocturnal eto values tn was substantially higher than eto values especially for maize and sorghum fig 1 in the long term 1991 2019 records at the experimental site nocturnal eto was as high as 86 of daily eto with a mean of 6 5 when not negative or zero fig s3b in the appendix during the growing season months however the maximum value of nocturnal eto recorded was 53 with a mean value of 3 7 when not negative or zero thus around two thirds of the calendar year as well as growing season shows positive or non zero nocturnal eto however even when nocturnal eto was positive it was not a satisfactory or a strong predictor of tn fig 2b r2 ranged from 0 08 to 0 62 daytime eto however did not suffer from these weaknesses and demonstrated strong ability in predicting daytime t fig 2a r2 ranged from 0 73 to 0 94 in light of these observations it can be ascertained that nocturnal eto fails to represent observed tn patterns owing to weaknesses in the physical assumptions of the combination based penman monteith approach this is true both for days when nocturnal eto 0 as well as nocturnal eto 0 3 3 influence of vpd and wind speed on nocturnal water use meteorological variables such as vpd and u2 can have reasonably high values during nocturnal hours when no radiative energy or light is available for example within the observation period of doy 181 263 31 14 and 1 of vpd records during the nocturnal hours were greater than 0 25 kpa 0 5 kpa and 1 0 kpa respectively similarly 90 51 14 and 3 of u2 records during the nocturnal hours showed values greater than 1 m s 1 2 m s 1 4 m s 1 and 6 m s 1 respectively fig s4b in the appendix nocturnal u2 was roughly at par with daytime u2 fig s4a in the appendix hourly tn for all three crops was positively influenced by vpd during the respective hourly intervals with soybean showing the strongest correlation among the three crops fig 3a the same relationships were also observed when these relationships investigated at daily scale fig 3b due to aggregation of hourly vpd to nocturnal mean vpd the correlations were slightly stronger with less uncertainty wind speed also showed positive relationships with tn at both hourly fig 4a and daily intervals fig 4b aggregation of u2 from hourly to nocturnal mean substantially improved the relationships across the three crops similar to what was observed for vpd soybean tn showed the highest correlation with u2 higher wind speeds cause additional removal of moisture from air surrounding the canopy increasing the capacity of the air to carry more moisture and allow a greater loss of water thus although u2 is not directly used in formulation of vpd vpd is physically associated and indirectly influenced by u2 3 4 temporal aggregation of vpd no clear distinction can be made among vpda and vpdb in the long term daily time series during 1991 2019 fig s5 and s6 in the appendix however for the experimental period doy 182 262 in 2016 on average vpdb was 16 greater than vpda fig 5 implying that the use of tmax tmin and mean rh to represent daily vpd resulted in overestimation of hourly mean conditions across the day however this behavior can vary temporally depending on day to day variability in local weather patterns and diurnal distribution of vpd no systematic pattern of under or overestimation was found among vpda and vpdb in the long term 1991 2019 datasets use of vpda yielded slightly stronger correlation with t than use of vpdb in maize r2 of 0 81 vs 0 79 for vpda and vpdb respectively and soybean r2 of 0 63 vs 0 59 for vpda and vpdb respectively as evident from figs 6a b and 7a b however both approaches resulted in the same r2 when regressed with sorghum t fig 8a b 3 5 radiation based diurnally weighted vpd 3 5 1 radiation weighted vpd and nocturnal atmospheric aridity diurnal weighing of vpd and its formulation eq 9 amplifies the contribution of vpd during the brighter hours towards daily vpd likewise it also relatively dampens the contribution of vpd under relatively darker not entirely dark hours this light based weighing of vpd increases the minimum maximum range of vpdc and vpdd relative to vpda and vpdb fig 5 fig s7 in the appendix the use of vpdc and vpdd was not advantageous in predicting t in maize fig 6c d or soybean fig 7c d as compared with simply using vpda and vpdb fig 6a b fig 7a b a slight improvement in correlation r2 of 0 81 vs 0 79 was observed for sorghum fig 8c d vpdc and vpdd are theoretically superior vpd forms as they correct observed vpd for diurnal radiation distribution however they also completely ignore vpd during the nocturnal hours when rs and par equate to zero vpda and vpdb however based on daily average conditions have some merit due to equal weightage assignment of nocturnal vpd as daytime vpd 3 5 2 rs versus par for diurnal weighing of vpd par at the experimental site has been quantified at 45 of rs using concurrent measurements of both across three years kukal and irmak 2020b use of par to diurnally weigh vpd vpdd was not advantageous to the use of rs for the same vpdc the r2 did not change at all when vpdc and vpdd were used to estimate sorghum t fig 8c d or soybean t fig 7c d as a matter of fact using vpdd yielded slightly lower r2 than vpdc when regressed against maize t fig 6c d 3 5 3 locally derived coefficient for diurnal weighing of vpd daily frac at the experimental site during 1991 2019 was subject to wide variability demonstrating the entire range of possible values i e 0 1 a minor fraction 2 of the frac time series showed values 1 which are rare but have been shown to be possible ghanem et al 2020 when a moving average of frac within a window two weeks before and after each day was calculated fig 9 the variability was minimized considerably when datasets from entire calendar years were compiled mean frac was 0 61 with a standard deviation of 0 21 when datasets from only the growing season may 1 september 30 were considered the mean frac was 0 57 with a standard deviation of 0 17 frac was also found to be seasonally variable albeit with substantial variability fig 10a the maximum value of frac was observed in june at 0 65 while the lowest value was observed in january at 0 48 generally a cyclic pattern of high frac in summers and low frac in winters was apparent fig 10a the values of frac can be interpreted using the equivalency of vpdf on days with frac 0 50 to vpda implying that a frac of 0 50 means vpdf represents the mean daily value of vpd higher the value of fracd higher the value of vpdf frac does not account for nocturnal vpd as all nocturnal vpd values are multiplied by 0 value of rs during nocturnal hours nevertheless daily value of frac can roughly indicate how dominant tn is relative to daily t days which have a smaller frac were seen to have a greater proportion of tn in daily t and vice versa fig s8 in the appendix during the experimental period the lowest and the highest frac values observed were 0 04 doy 184 and 0 95 doy 206 respectively figs 11 and b and 11c present diurnal distributions of vpd rs and crop t during days with low extreme high extreme and normal frac values respectively the low extreme frac is characteristic of a day with low evaporative demand eto 0 6 mm d 1 low vpd 0 09 kpa and low rs 757 w m 2 these meteorological conditions were especially atypical for daylight hours in july however nocturnal conditions showed substantially high vpd resulting in nocturnal eto being 25 of daily eto and maize tn being 42 of daily t on the other hand high extreme of frac is characteristic of a day when both vpd and rs show their maximum values representative of a cloudless day and vpd and rs show complete synchrony in their diurnal trends fig 11b the synchrony allows for amplification of the maximum vpd value using the maximum rs value during the day on a day that shows the same frac as the growing season mean 0 58 both rs and vpd show their maximum values as on a cloudless day fig 11c with the exception of the synchrony that was evident in fig 11b the ascent and descent curves of diurnal vpd are lagged behind that of rs fig 11c this asynchrony of diurnal vpd and rs at the experimental site might be problematic for application of the rs based diurnal vpd weighing the extent of variability in diurnal magnitudes distribution and synchrony in rs and vpd is evident from the fact that the same month july comprises of days doys 184 206 and 249 with these contrasting characteristics that are translated into contrasting frac values the use of frac to weigh vpd vpdf is a convenient alternative to dynamically weighing each day s vpd using rs vpdc however given the possible day to day variability in frac fig 11a b c using a constant frac even when locally derived might present some tradeoffs in its effectiveness ideally vpdf fig s9 in the appendix should replicate vpdc fig s7 in the appendix however that is unlikely due to the considerable variability in frac on daily monthly and yearly scales fig 10 during the experimental period it was observed that vpdf resulting from the stable assumption of frac 0 61 did not perfectly follow vpdc but did result in achieving a mean degree of weighing fig 5 owing to the non stationary behavior of frac vpdf explained a suboptimal degree of variance in t than vpdc for all crops fig 6c f fig 7c f fig 8c f however use of frac allows for an empirically based and convenient strategy for diurnal weighing of vpd especially when vpd and rs data is unavailable or inaccessible at hourly time steps 3 5 4 evaluation of the tanner sinclair coefficient for diurnal weighing of vpd for most of the days vpde derived from the tanner sinclair coefficient frac 0 75 showed the highest values among all the vpd forms figs s5 and s10 in the appendix observing the performance of vpde to follow vpdc at the experimental site in the long term fig s11d in the appendix we find that slope of vpde vs vpdc is closest to 1 however it is subject to a greater root mean squared error than vpdf in terms of explaining variance in t use of vpde is equivalent to that of using vpdf figs 6e 7e 8e as their formulations only differ by a constant 0 61 vs 0 75 thus while the concept given by tanner and sinclair 1983 is fit the coefficient needs to be recalibrated site specifically using monthly mean frac values fig 10 for weighing vpd did result in a slightly better agreement with vpdc than using a constant annual frac 0 61 or growing season frac 0 58 in the long term fig s11 in the appendix a larger rmse 0 36 was observed among vpd weighed using frac 0 58 and vpdc for the growing season datasets than using frac 0 61 for the entire calendar year 3 6 variability of transpiration based on atmospheric aridity and radiative energy vpdc vpde and vpdf use rs for adjusting vpd for diurnal radiant energy distribution with the adjustment being a normalizing one multiplying and consequently dividing by rs or par this procedure leads to incorporation of relative timing and intensity of radiant energy into the vpd term in order to amplify and dampen the role of vpd based on available energy in doing so the direct impact of rs on water use is not accounted for and rightly so however vpd and rs can be combined in a way that fulfils two objectives i directly account for impact of radiant energy on t and ii account for nocturnal vpd otherwise ignored in rs based diurnal weighing of vpd the variable of transpiration is a product of daily mean vpd either vpda or vpdb and sum of rs for that day the distribution of daily vta and vtb during the experimental period as well as during 1991 2019 are shown in fig s12 in the appendix since this multiplication operation is used on daily scale not hourly the impact of nocturnal vpd is embedded in the vt consequently resulting in improved performance the use of vta and vtb resulted in most explanation of variance in t than all the vpd forms in maize fig 6 g h soybean fig 7 g h and sorghum fig 8 g h again as seen before the use of vpdb to compute vt vtb results in inferior performance relative to vta this is a consequence of the loss in temporal resolution of vpd estimations when using maximum and minimum t and rh 4 discussion 4 1 underlying basis for tn observations of incomplete stomatal closure during nighttime have been made as early as late 1800 s however the physiological mechanisms behind tn are not well understood but there are several potential hypothesis to explain tn these include water leakage through the cuticle or cuticular transpiration rawson and clarke 1988 coupel ledru et al 2016 barbour et al 2005 genetic variation in nighttime stomatal conductance stomatal density abaxial adaxial surface responses caird et al 2007a environmental conditions such as nighttime vpd atmospheric mixing photoperiod length and light intensity rawson and clarke 1988 rogiers and clarke 2013 schoppach et al 2014 response to water availability and abscisic acid aba rawson and clarke 1988 and nutrient availability howard and donovan 2007 both positive and negative impacts of tn have been proposed for example tn allows for enhanced nutrient uptake scholz et al 2007 dissolved oxygen delivery to tissues in woody species daley and phillips 2006 prevents excessive leaf turgor donovan et al 2001 enhances daytime carbon gain and water use efficiency in semi arid environments for some breeding lines schoppach et al 2014 and enhances radiation use efficiency resco de dios et al 2016 in contrast evidence also suggests higher contribution of tn to t during drought claverie et al 2018 exacerbating negative impacts in rainfed environments tn also allows for a air pollutant eg ozone uptake by plants resulting in both positive and negative impacts takahashi et al 2005 keller and häsler 1984 b influences on oxygen isotope signatures of within canopy co2 barbour et al 2005 c hindrance of hydraulic redistribution and equilibration among plant water potential and wettest soil layer in the root zone during the night donovan et al 2001 irrespective of net tradeoffs of these impacts tn cannot be ignored for its role on the overall water balance in maize sorghum soybean and other crops investigated in the literature thus appropriate water balance accounting necessitates that tn and consequently its meteorological drivers during nighttime are given due weightage from a surface energy budget standpoint for tn to happen latent heat should be consumed for vaporization meaning that tn should have a signature in the nighttime distribution of net radiation into latent heat sensible heat and ground heat flux our broader research investigations at the experimental site allowed for evaluating whether this was true or not surface energy budget components were being measured for the same sorghum field during 2016 and beyond using bowen ratio energy balance irmak et al 2010 the latent heat datasets from this investigation were analyzed at hourly scales during the period overlapping sap flow measurements doy 201 230 while this data will not be discussed at length it was revealed that latent heat of vaporization during nocturnal hours was oftentimes negative which means that the exchange of energy was endothermic representing consumption of energy by the system for tn to happen the total nocturnal sums ranged from 3 kj m 2 to 683 kj m 2 during the observation period doy 201 230 although these magnitudes represent evaporation from both soil and crop there has been additional evidence of nighttime water losses recorded from continuous hourly flux measurements at the same experimental site using surface energy budget technique irmak 2011 reported seasonal average nighttime evapotranspiration losses of 0 19 in 2005 and 0 11 mm night 1 in 2006 losses of 0 50 mm or more were reported on 7 8 nights per growing season and resulted in seasonal total nocturnal evapotranspiration of 31 mm in 2005 and 16 mm in 206 these nocturnal evaporative losses driven by vpd and wind speed also translated into decreased sensible heat flux irmak 2011 and thus modification of nighttime bowen ratio these observations rooted in surface energy budgeting are independent evidence of nocturnal latent heat consumption that allows for tn 4 2 should vpd be weighted using rs conditioning of datasets of meteorological drivers in a way that they are aligned with diurnal cycle of crop water use has recently received attention sinclair and ghanem 2020 ghanem et al 2020 as plant based t prediction approaches are revisited and encouraged sinclair et al 2014 recently sinclair and ghanem 2020 proposed plant based predictions of canopy t based on the original work by dewit 1958 and tanner and sinclair 1983 herein they suggested that the vpd employed should be weighted on a daily basis to reflect the distribution of t through the daily cycle they also suggested that the use of a daily mean vpd in water use determinations such as the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 is erroneous and that a weighted vpd value be used instead midday t rates account for a dominant proportion of daily t when vpd is the highest during the day which is the underlying reason for encouraging the use of rs weighted vpd while this is a theoretically justified stance there does not exist a fair comparison among these strategies weighing vs no weighing using observed crop t data this research framework with measured t data in three field crops allowed for comparative evaluation of what temporal aggregation strategy results in explaining day to day variance in crop t calibration of vpd using rs allows to reflect the temporally dynamic atmospheric aridity conditions that drive t while this strategy is useful for assigning a brightness feature to the vpd distribution it also completely ignores the vpd dynamics during the hours in dark hours rs 0 this is suboptimal given that tn in maize sorghum and soybean was showed to be as high as 6 2 16 2 on certain days during the experimental period tn was found to be influenced by vpd and u even under dark conditions this tendency of overlooking the meteorological drivers of nocturnal t makes the rs based weighing strategies ineffective to predict or explain t variability especially on days and in crops where tn is a non negligible proportion of daily t a parallel comparison of rs weighted vpd and daily mean vpd showed that the former performed relatively inferior to the latter in explaining observed t variance in field crops in the light of non significant observations of tn rs based weighing strategies are incapable of achieving that in contrast we find that in scenarios where tn is significant a simplistic daily mean vpd is the most suitable vpd form given the fact that vpd at each hour is given identical weightage 4 3 tn and diurnal asymmetry in weather trends observational evidence for asymmetric day and night specific heat and aridity trends underscore the critical nature of tn and its drivers for our agroecosystems there exists sufficient evidence to establish that trends in nocturnal heat and aridity can be highly contrasting to those during daytime both globally peng et al 2004 sillmann et al 2013 screen 2014 sadok and jagadish 2020 and locally kukal and irmak 2016 irmak et al 2012 at the experimental site long term trend analysis of growing season mean tmax and tmin fig s13 in the appendix suggests that nights are warming at roughly twice 1 8 times that rate 0 31 c decade 1 as days 0 17 c decade 1 similarly growing season mean nocturnal vpd shows a negative trend 0 04 kpa decade 1 that is roughly twice 1 9 times that of daytime vpd 0 02 kpa decade 1 although this particular site shows a decrease in growing season mean vpd both day and night during 1991 2019 large scale analyses of past and projected vpd datasets reveals a continental scale increase in vpd ficklin and novick 2017 higher nocturnal vpd will not only increase tn but will also increase daytime t rates schoppach and sadok 2013 due to altered plant hydraulic conductance and aquaporin activity in addition to the direct impacts from higher daytime vpd thus future climate conditions will make it even more challenging to ignore tn and nocturnal vpd when considering crop water use 4 4 takeaways for vpd conditioning tn and nighttime meteorological drivers may not be as significant or attention worthy for certain crops seasons environments and intended applications in these scenarios rs based weighing strategies are valid and should be recommended to predict and model water use recently there has been some progress in estimating plant transpiration by relaying on fundamental physiological and physical descriptors of canopy water use efficiency sinclair and ghanem 2020 within this approach the vpd term has been defined by the authors as a radiation weighted vpd as this approach is relatively fundamental and simple to execute and avoids the need for meteorological approximations such as the two step approach it is likely that it will see increased use in research and practice in that case radiation weighted vpd data will be instrumental for efficient use within this approach to do so several different data scenarios and strategies are available to the user when hourly data on vpd and rs are available the user should dynamically weigh each day s vpd to deduce vpdc eq 9 this strategy might be somewhat computationally intensive but results in better performance convenient weighing approaches that use a constant frac value are relatively easier to execute relying only on eo tmax eo tmin and a constant frac value when no information on locally suitable frac is available t s coefficient frac 0 75 can be usable although with caution being an environment specific assumption we find that locally derived frac is a better performing tool to weigh vpd than the t s coefficient future research should focus on local deduction and assessment of frac in water sensitive agroecosystems and its spatial and temporal behavior such as that accomplished by ghanem et al 2020 in diverse environments of france among the limited observations of frac globally it has demonstrated substantial instability across locations and seasons table 1 lists mean estimates of frac available in the literature mean frac estimates from this research represent the lowest values amongst all the global estimations implying that for south central nebraska the need for diurnal weighing is lower than in these ecosystems frac is closer to 0 50 5 conclusions using hourly measurements of sap flux it was revealed that tn in field crops was non negligible and ranged from 6 to 16 of daily t across maize soybean and sorghum in absence of rs tn was driven by wind and atmospheric aridity conditions during the night for these periods of non negligible tn eto was either negative or zero failing to represent nocturnal water vapor exchange upon evaluating multiple vpd conditioning options available we found that the recently recommended rs based weighing of vpd suggested by sinclair and ghanem 2020 ignored tn and thus showed suboptimal performance in explaining t variance considering tn magnitudes observed a daily mean vpd performed better than rs weighted vpd local frac values suitable for diurnal weighing were also developed from long term hourly weather records at the site which showed substantial variability with mean estimates of 0 61 annual and 0 58 growing season and were lower than what has been suggested by tanner and sinclair 1983 i e 0 75 a dynamic vpd weighing strategy for each day accounting for day to day variability performed better than a constant frac based vpd weighing strategy a variable of transpiration based on the product of daily mean vpd and total daily radiation was the most effective in explaining t variance in all crops the performance statistics deduced by testing different conditioning approaches in actual field conditions aid in selection of

replications laid in a randomized block design the ratio of the first gcs to the second gcs in fodder yield ranged from 1 10 to 4 55 which was similar to the ratio of the first gcs to the third gcs in fodder yield ranged from 1 14 to 4 59 although rainfall the length of growing season and agdd were different during the two or three gcss the highest fodder yield was obtained from the first gcs in one year and reached the highest level in the second growing year and maintained a similar level in the subsequent years although rainfall the length of growing season and agdd varied during the five year periods fodder yield was affected by both the rainfall in the gcs and the available soil moisture prior to the gcs compared to fp the increase of evapotranspiration for mcs bf and pf was 11 61 and 63 mm respectively fodder yield for bf and pf increased by 28 and 33 respectively fodder yield for mcs maintained the same level as that for fp evapotranspiration increased and fodder yield decreased as ridge width increased the optimum ridge width for mcs bf and pf was 29 39 and 37 cm respectively across five years future study should focus on alfalfa crop rotation to mitigate soil

mulching material alfalfa fodder yield growing cutting stage 1 introduction the hydrology of semiarid regions can be characterized as having short duration intense rainfall followed by long periods of drought additionally high intensity rainfalls usually produce serious surface runoff and soil erosion in late summer and early autumn and pose a challenge to subsistence farmers in these regions jia et al 2009 this is as a result of lack of species diversity low vegetation coverage and agricultural production chen et al 2015 according to the soil water balance principle on fields enhancing soil water storage requires the reduction of surface runoff the increasement of infiltration and the downgrading of evaporation from the soil jia et al 2006 therefore subsistence farmers in these areas have constructed and developed several rainwater harvesting technologies to increase soil water availability for sustainable agricultural production ridge furrow rainwater harvesting rfrwh is usually constructed with alternate parallel ridges and furrows aligned along topographical contours on slightly sloping land 20º to satisfy the water requirements of crops trees adham et al 2016a wang et al 2015 ridge furrow rainwater harvesting is characterized as easy installation management and adaption by farmers low energy requirements and low cost maintenance for improving rainwater utilization zhou et al 2009 mulched arc shaped ridges can typically serve as rainwater harvesting zones while non mulched or mulched furrows between ridges can typically serve as planting zones gosar et al 2010 gosar and baričevič et al 2011 the successful design of rfrwh incorporates runoff with light rainfall in furrows and reducing water loss and soil erosion during intensive rainfall events this method induces and collects runoff from ridges and stores conserves it thus doubling rainfall and runoff in furrows in semiarid regions troin et al 2012 gan et al 2013 this indigenous technology is common and widely accepted by smallholder farmers in this area ridge furrow rainwater harvesting is designed and constructed to catch as much of runoff as possible in a specific precipitation region to minimize drought risk adham et al 2016b there is a tradeoff between wide ridge width which increases runoff volume and wide furrow width which increases planting area ridge furrow rainwater harvesting must balance crop water requirement in furrows and runoff from ridges which are mainly dependent on the local precipitation regime climatic zoning and climate changes influence design and planting of rfrwh jasrotia et al 2009 wide ridge width usually can lead to increased runoff collection and great single plant productivity but lower planting area and land productivity and even ridge overtopping and ridge failure during intense rainstorms while narrow ridge width can lead to reduction in soil water content and single plant productivity but great planting area the ridge furrow ratio regulates plant water requirements and exploits precipitation potential production wang et al 2015 understanding the ratio of planting areas to rainwater harvesting areas can provide insight into rfrwh design and can help farmers to build an optimal rfrwh alfalfa medicago sativa l is a dominant pasture crop largely planted in semiarid regions due to its high level of crude protein content fodder yield drought resistance and adapts well to various climatic and soil conditions jia et al 2009 the plant has been widely used in vegetation restoration in semiarid regions because it grows rapidly protects the soil surface from erosion and adds nitrogen to the soil li et al 2007 alfalfa roots play a vital role in binding and stabilizing soil particles against soil erosion moreover alfalfa covers the ground surface longer than other crops and may effectively reduce erosion by water and wind in spring and autumn jia et al 2006 the plant is a summer active species with a deep root system sometimes growing to a depth of more than 15 m to extract water deep within soil profile and to maintain high transpiration rates fan et al 2016 alfalfa is recognized as having the highest water requirement compared to other agronomic crops mccallum et al 2001 the high productivity and high transpiration rates of alfalfa increase soil water storage deficits and lead to a distinctive and permanent dry layer within the root zone after consecutive years of alfalfa production montazar and sadeghi 2008 the soil water content at the dry layer tends to be near the wilting point thus water scarcity is the main factor restricting alfalfa growth the distinctive and permanent dry layer would lead to further ecological deterioration the water consumption and soil water deficit tend to increase as alfalfa stand age increases long term soil desiccation significantly reduces alfalfa fodder quality and yield causing soil degradation by worsening deep soil water shortage hindering or slowing down soil water exchange between top and bottom soil layers sun et al 2018 therefore it is important to assess the soil compensation potential of rfrwh in alfalfa cultivation by in these regions to mitigate soil desiccation maintain high alfalfa fodder yield and extend alfalfa stand age it is necessary to determine the response of alfalfa fodder yield to the length of growing season growing degree days and rainfall in different gcss and to optimize rfrwh cultivation period ridge width and mulching material based on soil water storage evapotranspiration and alfalfa fodder yield optimized design and planting are essential for the successful implementation of rfrwh in this region adham et al 2016c developed a model at the sub catchment level to assist in increased understanding of hydrological processes in rainwater harvesting systems for various scenarios ren 2010 found that rfrwh increased maize yield for growing season rainfall totals ranging from 230 to 440 mm and decreased maize yield for growing season rainfall totals above 440 mm rainwater use efficiency strongly depends on rainfall pattern and distribution there are a very limited number of studies focused on analyzing alfalfa yields in response to rainfall the length of growing season and accumulated growing degree day agdd in different gcss with rfrwh we hypothesized that fodder yield would increase as the length of growing season growing degree days and rainfall during growing season increased fig 1 therefore the aim of the present study was to 1 explore fodder yield changes associated with rainfall cutting times and stand age 2 select suitable mulching material and to optimize ridge width for rfrwh 2 materials and methods 2 1 climate and soil characteristics this study was conducted from 2012 to 2016 during the alfalfa growing seasons at dingxi arid meteorology and ecological environment experimental station of the institute of arid meteorology of china meteorological administration the station 35 35 n 104 37 e is located in southwest of anding district dingxi city gansu province china the experimental site is part of the loess plateau with an altitude of 1896 7 m an average annual rainfall of approximately 385 3 mm and an annual pan evaporation of approximately 1445 mm mean annual air temperature maximum and minimum air temperatures are 7 2 c 25 9 c july and 13 0 c january respectively the soil at this experimental site is a loess like loam developed from wind accumulated loess physicochemical properties of the soil in the experimental plots were measured before experiments the high rate of potassium fertilizer application contributes to the high total potassium content 23 10 g kg 1 in the soil in northwest china he et al 2015 the physicochemical properties of the soil are presented in table 1 the surface of the experimental site is flat and characterized as a typical hilly surrounding landscape 2 2 precipitation and air temperature monthly and annual precipitation and air temperature from 2012 to 2016 at the experimental site were compared to the means for the period 1971 2016 46 years in fig 2 the annual precipitation from 2012 to 2016 was 478 9 492 8 457 2 298 2 and 312 0 mm respectively while the alfalfa growing season precipitation april october from 2012 to 2016 was 442 6 466 2 430 8 262 3 and 288 9 mm respectively compared to long term 46 year average 385 3 mm 2012 2013 and 2014 were wet years while 2015 and 2016 were dry years the maximum air temperature and the minimum air temperature from 2012 to 2016 were greater than the long term 46 year means except for the maximum air temperature in 2012 the increase of the maximum annual air temperature from 2013 to 2016 was 1 4 0 6 1 8 and 2 3 c respectively compared to the long term mean while the increase of the maximum alfalfa growing season air temperature from 2012 to 2016 was 0 5 0 9 0 4 1 3 and 2 2 c respectively the increase of the minimum annual air temperature from 2012 to 2016 was 1 1 1 6 1 6 1 9 and 1 8 c respectively compared to the long term mean while the increase of the minimum alfalfa growing season air temperature from 2012 to 2016 was 1 8 1 7 1 6 1 1 and 2 0 c respectively 2 3 experimental design soil surface grading was implemented in parallel ridges and furrows for each plot of ridge furrow rainwater harvesting the experiment consisted of 10 treatments 3 ridge widths 3 ridge mulching materials flat planting fp as control with three replications laid in a randomized block design three ridge widths of 30 45 and 60 cm at a furrow width of 60 cm were allocated for all treatments the three ridge mulching materials consisted of plastic film bio degradable film and manually compacted soil respectively treatments were abbreviated as mcs bf and pf for ridges with manually compacted soil mulched with bio degradable film and plastic film respectively a ridge height of 20 cm combined with a slope angle of 40 and an arched ridge surface was used ridges were mulched with plastic and bio degradable films with their edges buried in 3 5 cm of soil along the base of the ridges manually compacted soil was banked after spring thaw and became soil crust later after rainfalls the thickness of the plastic film and the bio degradable mulching film was 0 008 mm mulched ridges served as rainwater harvesting zones whereas the non mulched furrows served as planting zones each plot of rfrwh measured 10 m long and 3 0 4 2 m wide and had 4 ridges and 3 furrows while each plot of the fp measured 10 m long and 3 6 m wide without ridges and furrows 2 4 field management the ridges were manually banked up with soil on the site after the soil was completely thawed from 20 march to 1 april 2012 prior to sowing in order to make the ridges smooth before mulching the clods on the ridges were broken into pieces with spades ridges for bf and pf were mulched with plastic and bio degradable films between 2 and 4 april soil on ridges for mcs was manually compacted with flat wooden boards whereas furrows were leveled as planting belts the configuration of ridges and furrows were maintained and used in subsequent alfalfa growing seasons the procedure of ridge mulching for pf and bf was repeated from 2 to 9 april from 2013 to 2016 mcs was maintained and care was taken during weeding to avoid soil crust disturbance on ridges a basal fertilizer containing 150 kg n ha 1 41 kg p ha 1 and 39 kg k ha 1 was spread evenly over furrows and then plowed into the soil at a depth of 20 25 cm before sowing in 2012 the seed of local alfalfa cultivar no 3 gannong was sown at a depth of 2 3 cm into the soil at a seed rate of 22 5 kg ha 1 based on furrow area in rfrwh and all plot surfaces in fp on 10th april 2012 total planting area in each rfrwh plot was 18 m2 10 m length 0 6 m width 3 furrows with 12 rows of alfalfa total planting area in each fp plot was 36 m2 3 6 width 10 m length with 24 rows of alfalfa no irrigation fertilizers and pesticides were applied to alfalfa during the subsequent growing seasons we controlled weeds manually three times during each growing season from 2012 to 2016 harvesting of alfalfa was done manually twice in the first year 2012 and three times in the subsequent years 2 5 sampling and measurements 2 5 1 meteorological data mean daily air temperature and rainfall from 2012 to 2016 were obtained from an automatic weather station ws std1 england which is 100 200 m away from the experimental site whereas data before 2012 was obtained from the dingxi meteorological station which is 4 6 km away from the experimental site 2 5 2 soil moisture and bulk density during the alfalfa growing seasons soil samples were collected with a hand held auger and soil moisture was determined by the oven drying method at a depth of 200 cm during the study period 5 years with an increment of 20 cm at the middle of the furrow in each alfalfa production plot at around 10 days interval including pre sowing or green up and after harvesting as well as the regular measurements the soil water content was measured approximately 24 h after each rainfall event greater than 5 mm meanwhile soil sample was not taken and soil moisture was not measured under ridges to avoid soil crust disturbance the bulk density was determined by a volume 100 cm3 cylinder with three replications a randomly located series of soil sample were collected in each plot to avoid sampling at the same location and to minimize disturbing soil layers after completing sampling activities the sampling holes were immediately filled with soil to avoid rainwater infiltration deep into soil 2 5 3 fodder yield at initial flowering stage between 1 and 25 flowering and senescence fodder yield was determined by measuring the dry weight of aboveground biomass alfalfa was manually cut with sickles near soil surface for all plots the freshly harvested alfalfa was weighed immediately after cutting about 3 4 kg sample was taken from the freshly harvested alfalfa and was dried in an oven at 105 c for 1 h and then at 75 c until reaching a constant weight final fodder yield kg ha 1 was calculated based on the land areas of ridges and furrows 2 5 4 calculation water balance can be used as a tool to analyze the effect of precipitation on alfalfa forage in rfrwh eq 1 the water balance equation presents the values of inflow outflow and the change in soil water storage on fields ridley et al 2001 jasrotia et al 2009 percolation was negligible as the groundwater table is too deep for plants to access in the semiarid loess plateau

the length of growing season of the second gcs was the shortest except that the length of growing season of the third gcs was the longest in 2016 the length of growing season of the first gcs ranged from 70 d to 90 d while that of the second gcs ranged from 40 d to 69 d and that of the third gcs ranged from 64 d to 87 d the change of agdd was similar to that of the length of growing season the agdd of the first gcs ranged from 546 7 c to 1576 5 c while that of the second gcs ranged from 512 2 c to 1003 7 c and that of the third gcs ranged from 569 2 c to 1108 4 c 3 2 actual

significant compared to fp the increase of average actual evapotranspiration during alfalfa growing seasons was 6 9 17 35 59 89 40 59 and 90 mm respectively for mcs30 mcs45 mcs60 bf30 bf45 bf60 pf30 pf45 and pf60 while it was 11 61 and 63 mm for mcs bf and pf cumulative response across five years 3 3 fodder yield changing with cutting time and year fodder yield as a function of cutting time or year is shown in fig 3 the ratio of the first gcs to the second gcs in fodder yield ranged from 1 10 to 4 55 which was similar to the ratio of the first gcs to the third gcs in fodder yield ranged from 1 14 to 4 59 although rainfall the length of growing season and agdds were different between the two or three gcss over five years the fodder yields in the first gcs were always higher than that in the second gcs and the third gcs and the fodder yields in the second gcs were similar to that in the third gcs the results illustrated that alfalfa forage has a low response to the rainfall of the gcs fodder yield in rfrwh reached its maximum around 7371 12104 kg ha 1 in the second growing year 2013 and maintained a similar level in the subsequent years the average fodder yield among treatments in rfrwh from 2012 to 2016 was 4080 9934 9559 9973 and 10755 kg ha 1 respectively fodder yields in rfrwh maintained a high level for more than five years 3 4 fodder yield response to mulching material and ridge width statistical analysis showed that the effect of treatments on fodder yield was significant only in 2012 and 2013 and the effect of actual evapotranspiration on fodder yield was significant only in 2014 and 2016 table 4 the effect of rainfall on fodder yield was significant from 2012 to 2016 these results showed that rainfall had higher f value than actual evapotranspiration in 2012 2013 2015 and 2016 except for 2014 the results meant rainfall has more effect on fodder yield than actual evapotranspiration alfalfa grew slowly in the first cultivated year and then grew normally in the subsequent years fodder yield decreased as ridge width increased fig 4 over 5 years fodder yield in pf and bf was significantly p 0 05 higher than that in mcs and fp no significant difference was found between bf and pf or between bf and fp fodder yield for mcs30 mcs45 bf30 bf45 bf60 pf30 pf45 and pf60 increased by 5 1 35 29 20 41 35 and 24 respectively but decreased by 6 for mcs60 compared to fp fodder yield for bf and pf increased by 28 and 33 respectively fodder yield in mcs maintained the same level as that in fp 3 5 optimum ridge width a quadratic relationship between annual total fodder yields and ridge widths was established using the data derived from 2012 to 2016 during alfalfa growing seasons table 5 the fodder yield is y and the ridge width is x the ridge width of mcs30 bf30 or pf30 mcs45 bf45 or pf45 mcs60 bf60 or pf60 and fp are 30 45 60 and 0 cm respectively the optimum ridge width for mcs bf and pf was determined by the extreme value analysis of these quadratic equations the optimum ridge width curve exhibited a positive value for mcs in 2014 and 2015 and a negative value in 2012 2013 and 2016 the coefficient of determination r2 for mcs was 0 9013 in 2014 and 0 8240 in 2015 the optimum ridge width curve exhibited a positive value for bf and pf from 2012 to 2016 the coefficient of determination for bf ranged from 0 5172 to 0 9440 respectively while it for pf ranged from 0 7588 to 0 9432 the regression equations indicated that the optimum ridge width for mcs bf and pf was 29 39 and 37 cm respectively across five years optimized ridge width is particularly important for farmers to get the highest fodder yield 4 discussion 4 1 fodder yield alfalfa potential production is severely limited by low and irregular precipitation and high evapotranspiration zhou et al 2009 2011 alfalfa consumes more water than other crops and excessive long term water consumption and inadequate precipitation can cause soil desiccation formation in deep soil layers in arid and semiarid regions wang et al 2011 2012 the present study attempted to ascertain the effects of rainfall the length of growing season and agdd in different gcss on fodder yield in a semiarid region this study indicated that the length of growing season and agdd of alfalfa changed with cutting time and stand age these parameters for the first gcs were usually the longest whereas these parameters for the second gcs were the shortest fodder yield is more sensitive to rainfall than actual evapotranspiration rainfall was the most important environmental factor limiting alfalfa survived growth and production the ratio of the first gcs to the second gcs in fodder yield was similar to that of the first gcs to the third gcs in fodder yield high rainfall the length of growing season and agdd of one gcs did not mean high fodder yield the results indicated fodder yield was affected by both the rainfall in the gcs and the available soil water storage prior to the gcs one of the reasons is that alfalfa is a deep rooted legume alfalfa can absorb deep soil moisture in furrow and beneath ridge profile from other gcss another reason is that a certain amount of nutrients was stored in alfalfa roots in the gcs which is used for leaves and stems formation in subsequent gcss li et al 2007 found that a high rainfall could be stored in deep soil and be taken up by alfalfa in subsequent gcss in northern california hanson et al 1989 found that the low response of fodder yield to applied water in the first gcs due to the stored moisture in deep soil from precipitation in winter and spring the study indicated that the fodder yield in rfrwh reached the maximum in the first gcs in one year and peaked in the second year 2013 jia et al 2009 found that fodder yield reached a maximum in the 7th year in conventional alfalfa cultivation without ridges and furrows followed by a small fluctuating decrease over the next eight years the results suggested that the appropriate stand age of alfalfa was greater than five years considering the maximum average fodder yield under rfrwh 4 2 actual evapotranspiration water use efficiency wue is defined as the ratio of alfalfa fodder yield to water lost through evapotranspiration increase of wue has become increasingly important in semiarid and arid regions because of the high risk of drought condition and rapid depletion of water resources accurate quantification of et in the field is crucial in enhancing wue and protecting environment and water quality ridge furrow rainwater harvesting is designed to collect runoff from ridges and to channel runoff and rainfall into furrows and to enhance soil water infiltration and water availability to crops ridge mulching can reduce soil evaporation thereby causing soil water to be transpired through plants biazin et al 2012 a number of studies confirmed that rfrwh can improve the soil water content in the rooting zone hence substantially reducing non productive soil water losses zhou et al 2009 jia et al 2006 previous research wang et al 2015 found that the average annual runoff coefficient was 16 19 65 77 and 70 79 respectively for mcs bf and pf for the same treatments the threshold rainfall needed to produce runoff was 4 2 4 3 2 8 3 0 and 2 8 2 9 mm respectively alfalfa plants have a high drought resistance and adapt well to environmental changes because the plants go into dormancy with drought stress and other negative environmental conditions and survive after these environmental conditions recover montazar and sadeghi 2008 alfalfa production usually leads to desiccation of deep soil layers after planting for several years jia et al 2009 this desiccation would negatively impact alfalfa production ridley et al 2001 the result in our experiment indicated that actual evapotranspiration in pf and bf was significantly p 0 05 greater than that in mcs and fp and no significant difference of actual evapotranspiration was found between pf and bf or between mcs and fp the higher runoff coefficient of pf and bf leads to greater soil moisture which leads to higher actual evapotranspiration compared to mcs and fp at the same time actual evapotranspiration significantly increased as ridge width increased this result confirmed that rfrwh would improve soil water content and mitigate the formation of dried soil layers in rootzone especially for pf or bf with wide ridges 4 3 optimum ridge width the selection of rfrwh cultivation period ridge width and mulching material is one of the key challenges in development of rfrwh this study indicated that fodder yield in pf and bf was significantly p 0 05 greater than that in mcs and fp but no significant difference of fodder yield was found between pf and bf or between mcs and fp these results demonstrated that there were similar increases in fodder yield between ridges mulched with bio degradable film and ridges mulched with plastic film the bio degradable film can be tilled into soil after harvesting and would be degraded by the action of soil organisms thus saving labor and disposal costs but the cost of bio degradable film was higher than that of plastic film there is a tradeoff between wide ridge width which increases soil water moisture and single plant productivity and narrow ridge width which increases planting area and land productivity an optimum ridge width can be obtained by calculating fodder yields as a function of ridge width the results indicated that the optimum ridge width for mcs bf and pf was 29 39 and 37 cm respectively across five years liniger et al 2011 found that the ratio of rainwater collection area to cultivated area varied between 2 1 10 1 the results should satisfy tradeoff between achieving high fodder yield and runoff which is highly dependent on rainfall conditions in this region other factors of basic criteria when choosing the optimum ridge width are soil type texture and saturated hydraulic conductivity plant species slope economic benefit lifestyle and labor adham et al 2016a the occurrence of soil desiccation is a result of excessive depletion in deep soil water by high water utilization crops and insufficient precipitation over a long period of time jia et al 2019 soil desiccation alters the hydraulic properties of soil and adversely affects subsequent crop cultivation the soil water consumption of plants generally depends on plant species stand age planting density and annual precipitation compared to shallow root crops such as potato and wheat alfalfa usually utilizes more soil water numerous studies have shown that rotation of alfalfa with shallow deep annual crops may recover soil water wang et al 2011 huang et al 2021 therefore timely alfalfa crop rotation could compensate soil water deficit and mitigate soil desiccation in semiarid regions 5 conclusion based on fodder yield and climate conditions in five consecutive growing seasons in ridge furrow rainwater harvesting the highest fodder yield was obtained from the first growing cutting stage in one year and reached its highest level in the second stand year and maintained a similar level in the subsequent years fodder yield was affected by both the rainfall in the growing cutting stage and the available soil water storage prior to the growing cutting stage the bio degradable film can be used as an environmentally friendly mulching material in rfrwh without considering its high cost the optimum ridge width for ridges with manually compacted soil ridges mulched with bio degradable film and ridges mulched with plastic film was 29 39 and 37 cm respectively across five years the optimum ridge widths had a high security as the rainfall conditions are considered in this region declaration of

mulching material alfalfa fodder yield growing cutting stage 1 introduction the hydrology of semiarid regions can be characterized as having short duration intense rainfall followed by long periods of drought additionally high intensity rainfalls usually produce serious surface runoff and soil erosion in late summer and early autumn and pose a challenge to subsistence farmers in these regions jia et al 2009 this is as a result of lack of species diversity low vegetation coverage and agricultural production chen et al 2015 according to the soil water balance principle on fields enhancing soil water storage requires the reduction of surface runoff the increasement of infiltration and the downgrading of evaporation from the soil jia et al 2006 therefore subsistence farmers in these areas have constructed and developed several rainwater harvesting technologies to increase soil water availability for sustainable agricultural production ridge furrow rainwater harvesting rfrwh is usually constructed with alternate parallel ridges and furrows aligned along topographical contours on slightly sloping land 20º to satisfy the water requirements of crops trees adham et al 2016a wang et al 2015 ridge furrow rainwater harvesting is characterized as easy installation management and adaption by farmers low energy requirements and low cost maintenance for improving rainwater utilization zhou et al 2009 mulched arc shaped ridges can typically serve as rainwater harvesting zones while non mulched or mulched furrows between ridges can typically serve as planting zones gosar et al 2010 gosar and baričevič et al 2011 the successful design of rfrwh incorporates runoff with light rainfall in furrows and reducing water loss and soil erosion during intensive rainfall events this method induces and collects runoff from ridges and stores conserves it thus doubling rainfall and runoff in furrows in semiarid regions troin et al 2012 gan et al 2013 this indigenous technology is common and widely accepted by smallholder farmers in this area ridge furrow rainwater harvesting is designed and constructed to catch as much of runoff as possible in a specific precipitation region to minimize drought risk adham et al 2016b there is a tradeoff between wide ridge width which increases runoff volume and wide furrow width which increases planting area ridge furrow rainwater harvesting must balance crop water requirement in furrows and runoff from ridges which are mainly dependent on the local precipitation regime climatic zoning and climate changes influence design and planting of rfrwh jasrotia et al 2009 wide ridge width usually can lead to increased runoff collection and great single plant productivity but lower planting area and land productivity and even ridge overtopping and ridge failure during intense rainstorms while narrow ridge width can lead to reduction in soil water content and single plant productivity but great planting area the ridge furrow ratio regulates plant water requirements and exploits precipitation potential production wang et al 2015 understanding the ratio of planting areas to rainwater harvesting areas can provide insight into rfrwh design and can help farmers to build an optimal rfrwh alfalfa medicago sativa l is a dominant pasture crop largely planted in semiarid regions due to its high level of crude protein content fodder yield drought resistance and adapts well to various climatic and soil conditions jia et al 2009 the plant has been widely used in vegetation restoration in semiarid regions because it grows rapidly protects the soil surface from erosion and adds nitrogen to the soil li et al 2007 alfalfa roots play a vital role in binding and stabilizing soil particles against soil erosion moreover alfalfa covers the ground surface longer than other crops and may effectively reduce erosion by water and wind in spring and autumn jia et al 2006 the plant is a summer active species with a deep root system sometimes growing to a depth of more than 15 m to extract water deep within soil profile and to maintain high transpiration rates fan et al 2016 alfalfa is recognized as having the highest water requirement compared to other agronomic crops mccallum et al 2001 the high productivity and high transpiration rates of alfalfa increase soil water storage deficits and lead to a distinctive and permanent dry layer within the root zone after consecutive years of alfalfa production montazar and sadeghi 2008 the soil water content at the dry layer tends to be near the wilting point thus water scarcity is the main factor restricting alfalfa growth the distinctive and permanent dry layer would lead to further ecological deterioration the water consumption and soil water deficit tend to increase as alfalfa stand age increases long term soil desiccation significantly reduces alfalfa fodder quality and yield causing soil degradation by worsening deep soil water shortage hindering or slowing down soil water exchange between top and bottom soil layers sun et al 2018 therefore it is important to assess the soil compensation potential of rfrwh in alfalfa cultivation by in these regions to mitigate soil desiccation maintain high alfalfa fodder yield and extend alfalfa stand age it is necessary to determine the response of alfalfa fodder yield to the length of growing season growing degree days and rainfall in different gcss and to optimize rfrwh cultivation period ridge width and mulching material based on soil water storage evapotranspiration and alfalfa fodder yield optimized design and planting are essential for the successful implementation of rfrwh in this region adham et al 2016c developed a model at the sub catchment level to assist in increased understanding of hydrological processes in rainwater harvesting systems for various scenarios ren 2010 found that rfrwh increased maize yield for growing season rainfall totals ranging from 230 to 440 mm and decreased maize yield for growing season rainfall totals above 440 mm rainwater use efficiency strongly depends on rainfall pattern and distribution there are a very limited number of studies focused on analyzing alfalfa yields in response to rainfall the length of growing season and accumulated growing degree day agdd in different gcss with rfrwh we hypothesized that fodder yield would increase as the length of growing season growing degree days and rainfall during growing season increased fig 1 therefore the aim of the present study was to 1 explore fodder yield changes associated with rainfall cutting times and stand age 2 select suitable mulching material and to optimize ridge width for rfrwh 2 materials and methods 2 1 climate and soil characteristics this study was conducted from 2012 to 2016 during the alfalfa growing seasons at dingxi arid meteorology and ecological environment experimental station of the institute of arid meteorology of china meteorological administration the station 35 35 n 104 37 e is located in southwest of anding district dingxi city gansu province china the experimental site is part of the loess plateau with an altitude of 1896 7 m an average annual rainfall of approximately 385 3 mm and an annual pan evaporation of approximately 1445 mm mean annual air temperature maximum and minimum air temperatures are 7 2 c 25 9 c july and 13 0 c january respectively the soil at this experimental site is a loess like loam developed from wind accumulated loess physicochemical properties of the soil in the experimental plots were measured before experiments the high rate of potassium fertilizer application contributes to the high total potassium content 23 10 g kg 1 in the soil in northwest china he et al 2015 the physicochemical properties of the soil are presented in table 1 the surface of the experimental site is flat and characterized as a typical hilly surrounding landscape 2 2 precipitation and air temperature monthly and annual precipitation and air temperature from 2012 to 2016 at the experimental site were compared to the means for the period 1971 2016 46 years in fig 2 the annual precipitation from 2012 to 2016 was 478 9 492 8 457 2 298 2 and 312 0 mm respectively while the alfalfa growing season precipitation april october from 2012 to 2016 was 442 6 466 2 430 8 262 3 and 288 9 mm respectively compared to long term 46 year average 385 3 mm 2012 2013 and 2014 were wet years while 2015 and 2016 were dry years the maximum air temperature and the minimum air temperature from 2012 to 2016 were greater than the long term 46 year means except for the maximum air temperature in 2012 the increase of the maximum annual air temperature from 2013 to 2016 was 1 4 0 6 1 8 and 2 3 c respectively compared to the long term mean while the increase of the maximum alfalfa growing season air temperature from 2012 to 2016 was 0 5 0 9 0 4 1 3 and 2 2 c respectively the increase of the minimum annual air temperature from 2012 to 2016 was 1 1 1 6 1 6 1 9 and 1 8 c respectively compared to the long term mean while the increase of the minimum alfalfa growing season air temperature from 2012 to 2016 was 1 8 1 7 1 6 1 1 and 2 0 c respectively 2 3 experimental design soil surface grading was implemented in parallel ridges and furrows for each plot of ridge furrow rainwater harvesting the experiment consisted of 10 treatments 3 ridge widths 3 ridge mulching materials flat planting fp as control with three replications laid in a randomized block design three ridge widths of 30 45 and 60 cm at a furrow width of 60 cm were allocated for all treatments the three ridge mulching materials consisted of plastic film bio degradable film and manually compacted soil respectively treatments were abbreviated as mcs bf and pf for ridges with manually compacted soil mulched with bio degradable film and plastic film respectively a ridge height of 20 cm combined with a slope angle of 40 and an arched ridge surface was used ridges were mulched with plastic and bio degradable films with their edges buried in 3 5 cm of soil along the base of the ridges manually compacted soil was banked after spring thaw and became soil crust later after rainfalls the thickness of the plastic film and the bio degradable mulching film was 0 008 mm mulched ridges served as rainwater harvesting zones whereas the non mulched furrows served as planting zones each plot of rfrwh measured 10 m long and 3 0 4 2 m wide and had 4 ridges and 3 furrows while each plot of the fp measured 10 m long and 3 6 m wide without ridges and furrows 2 4 field management the ridges were manually banked up with soil on the site after the soil was completely thawed from 20 march to 1 april 2012 prior to sowing in order to make the ridges smooth before mulching the clods on the ridges were broken into pieces with spades ridges for bf and pf were mulched with plastic and bio degradable films between 2 and 4 april soil on ridges for mcs was manually compacted with flat wooden boards whereas furrows were leveled as planting belts the configuration of ridges and furrows were maintained and used in subsequent alfalfa growing seasons the procedure of ridge mulching for pf and bf was repeated from 2 to 9 april from 2013 to 2016 mcs was maintained and care was taken during weeding to avoid soil crust disturbance on ridges a basal fertilizer containing 150 kg n ha 1 41 kg p ha 1 and 39 kg k ha 1 was spread evenly over furrows and then plowed into the soil at a depth of 20 25 cm before sowing in 2012 the seed of local alfalfa cultivar no 3 gannong was sown at a depth of 2 3 cm into the soil at a seed rate of 22 5 kg ha 1 based on furrow area in rfrwh and all plot surfaces in fp on 10th april 2012 total planting area in each rfrwh plot was 18 m2 10 m length 0 6 m width 3 furrows with 12 rows of alfalfa total planting area in each fp plot was 36 m2 3 6 width 10 m length with 24 rows of alfalfa no irrigation fertilizers and pesticides were applied to alfalfa during the subsequent growing seasons we controlled weeds manually three times during each growing season from 2012 to 2016 harvesting of alfalfa was done manually twice in the first year 2012 and three times in the subsequent years 2 5 sampling and measurements 2 5 1 meteorological data mean daily air temperature and rainfall from 2012 to 2016 were obtained from an automatic weather station ws std1 england which is 100 200 m away from the experimental site whereas data before 2012 was obtained from the dingxi meteorological station which is 4 6 km away from the experimental site 2 5 2 soil moisture and bulk density during the alfalfa growing seasons soil samples were collected with a hand held auger and soil moisture was determined by the oven drying method at a depth of 200 cm during the study period 5 years with an increment of 20 cm at the middle of the furrow in each alfalfa production plot at around 10 days interval including pre sowing or green up and after harvesting as well as the regular measurements the soil water content was measured approximately 24 h after each rainfall event greater than 5 mm meanwhile soil sample was not taken and soil moisture was not measured under ridges to avoid soil crust disturbance the bulk density was determined by a volume 100 cm3 cylinder with three replications a randomly located series of soil sample were collected in each plot to avoid sampling at the same location and to minimize disturbing soil layers after completing sampling activities the sampling holes were immediately filled with soil to avoid rainwater infiltration deep into soil 2 5 3 fodder yield at initial flowering stage between 1 and 25 flowering and senescence fodder yield was determined by measuring the dry weight of aboveground biomass alfalfa was manually cut with sickles near soil surface for all plots the freshly harvested alfalfa was weighed immediately after cutting about 3 4 kg sample was taken from the freshly harvested alfalfa and was dried in an oven at 105 c for 1 h and then at 75 c until reaching a constant weight final fodder yield kg ha 1 was calculated based on the land areas of ridges and furrows 2 5 4 calculation water balance can be used as a tool to analyze the effect of precipitation on alfalfa forage in rfrwh eq 1 the water balance equation presents the values of inflow outflow and the change in soil water storage on fields ridley et al 2001 jasrotia et al 2009 percolation was negligible as the groundwater table is too deep for plants to access in the semiarid loess plateau region li et al 2006 2008 jia et al 2009 total actual evapotranspiration et mm for alfalfa growing seasons was calculated using the following formula li et al 2006 1 et p p re h 1 h 2 sws 1 sws 2 where p mm represents precipitation of different gcss of alfalfa mm re is average annual runoff coefficient for ridges with manually compacted soil or mulched bio degradable film or plastic film h1 cm

1994 values of tmax and tmin were constrained to be tb as 4 if tmax tb tmax tb if tmin tb tmin tb agdd was computed as 5 a gdd i 1 n gdd i where n is the number of days after planting 2 5 5 statistical analysis the effects of treatment on actual evapotranspiration and the effects of treatment rainfall and actual evapotranspiration on fodder yield were analyzed using comparison of means

rainfall the length of growing season the span of time from starting growing including sowing to the following harvesting and agdd of different gcss is shown in table 2 rainfall the length of growing season and agdd of different gcss changed each year rainfall had higher variability than the length of growing season and agdd the length of growing season of the first gcs usually was the longest and the length of growing season of the second gcs was the shortest except that the length of growing season of the third gcs was the longest in 2016 the length of growing season of the first gcs ranged from 70 d to 90 d while that of the second gcs ranged from 40 d to 69 d and that of the third gcs ranged from 64 d to 87 d the change of agdd was similar to that of the length of growing season the agdd of the first gcs ranged from 546 7 c to 1576 5 c while that of the second gcs ranged from 512 2 c to 1003 7 c and that of the third gcs ranged from 569 2 c to 1108 4 c 3 2 actual evapotranspiration at different growing cutting stages the extended length of growing season and accumulated growing degree days of gcss led to high actual evapotranspiration table 3 actual evapotranspiration changed with cutting time and year with no trend evidence during alfalfa growing seasons in most cases actual evapotranspiration significantly increased as ridge width increased actual evapotranspiration in pf and bf was significantly p 0 05 higher than that in mcs and fp and the difference of actual evapotranspiration between pf and bf or between mcs and fp was not significant compared to fp the increase of average actual evapotranspiration during alfalfa growing seasons was 6 9 17 35 59 89 40 59 and 90 mm respectively for mcs30 mcs45 mcs60 bf30 bf45 bf60 pf30 pf45 and pf60 while it was 11 61 and 63 mm for mcs bf and pf cumulative response across five years 3 3 fodder yield changing with cutting time and year fodder yield as a function of cutting time or year is shown in fig 3 the ratio of the first gcs to the second gcs in fodder yield ranged from 1 10 to 4 55 which was similar to the ratio of the first gcs to the third gcs in fodder yield ranged from 1 14 to 4 59 although rainfall the length of growing season and agdds were different between the two or three gcss over five years the fodder yields in the first gcs were always higher than that in the second gcs and the third gcs and the fodder yields in the second gcs were similar to that in the third gcs the results illustrated that alfalfa forage has a low response to the rainfall of the gcs fodder yield in rfrwh reached its maximum around 7371 12104 kg ha 1 in the second growing year 2013 and maintained a similar level in the subsequent years the average fodder yield among treatments in rfrwh from 2012 to 2016 was 4080 9934 9559 9973 and 10755 kg ha 1 respectively fodder yields in rfrwh maintained a high level for more than five years 3 4 fodder yield response to mulching material and ridge width statistical analysis showed that the effect of treatments on fodder yield was significant only in 2012 and 2013 and the effect of actual evapotranspiration on fodder yield was significant only in 2014 and 2016 table 4 the effect of rainfall on fodder yield was significant from 2012 to 2016 these results showed that rainfall had higher f value than actual evapotranspiration in 2012 2013 2015 and 2016 except for 2014 the results meant rainfall has more effect on fodder yield than actual evapotranspiration alfalfa grew slowly in the first cultivated year and then grew normally in the subsequent years fodder yield decreased as ridge width increased fig 4 over 5 years fodder yield in pf and bf was significantly p 0 05 higher than that in mcs and fp no significant difference was found between bf and pf or between bf and fp fodder yield for mcs30 mcs45 bf30 bf45 bf60 pf30 pf45 and pf60 increased by 5 1 35 29 20 41 35 and 24 respectively but decreased by 6 for mcs60 compared to fp fodder yield for bf and pf increased by 28 and 33 respectively fodder yield in mcs maintained the same level as that in fp 3 5 optimum ridge width a quadratic relationship between annual total fodder yields and ridge widths was established using the data derived from 2012 to 2016 during alfalfa growing seasons table 5 the fodder yield is y and the ridge width is x the ridge width of mcs30 bf30 or pf30 mcs45 bf45 or pf45 mcs60 bf60 or pf60 and fp are 30 45 60 and 0 cm respectively the optimum ridge width for mcs bf and pf was determined by the extreme value analysis of these quadratic equations the optimum ridge width curve exhibited a positive value for mcs in 2014 and 2015 and a negative value in 2012 2013 and 2016 the coefficient of determination r2 for mcs was 0 9013 in 2014 and 0 8240 in 2015 the optimum ridge width curve exhibited a positive value for bf and pf from 2012 to 2016 the coefficient of determination for bf ranged from 0 5172 to 0 9440 respectively while it for pf ranged from 0 7588 to 0 9432 the regression equations indicated that the optimum ridge width for mcs bf and pf was 29 39 and 37 cm respectively across five years optimized ridge width is particularly important for farmers to get the highest fodder yield 4 discussion 4 1 fodder yield alfalfa potential production is severely limited by low and irregular precipitation and high evapotranspiration zhou et al 2009 2011 alfalfa consumes more water than other crops and excessive long term water consumption and inadequate precipitation can cause soil desiccation formation in deep soil layers in arid and semiarid regions wang et al 2011 2012 the present study attempted to ascertain the effects of rainfall the length of growing season and agdd in different gcss on fodder yield in a semiarid region this study indicated that the length of growing season and agdd of alfalfa changed with cutting time and stand age these parameters for the first gcs were usually the longest whereas these parameters for the second gcs were the shortest fodder yield is more sensitive to rainfall than actual evapotranspiration rainfall was the most important environmental factor limiting alfalfa survived growth and production the ratio of the first gcs to the second gcs in fodder yield was similar to that of the first gcs to the third gcs in fodder yield high rainfall the length of growing season and agdd of one gcs did not mean high fodder yield the results indicated fodder yield was affected by both the rainfall in the gcs and the available soil water storage prior to the gcs one of the reasons is that alfalfa is a deep rooted legume alfalfa can absorb deep soil moisture in furrow and beneath ridge profile from other gcss another reason is that a certain amount of nutrients was stored in alfalfa roots in the gcs which is used for leaves and stems formation in subsequent gcss li et al 2007 found that a high rainfall could be stored in deep soil and be taken up by alfalfa in subsequent gcss in northern california hanson et al 1989 found that the low response of fodder yield to applied water in the first gcs due to the stored moisture in deep soil from precipitation in winter and spring the study indicated that the fodder yield in rfrwh reached the maximum in the first gcs in one year and peaked in the second year 2013 jia et al 2009 found that fodder yield reached a maximum in the 7th year in conventional alfalfa cultivation without ridges and furrows followed by a small fluctuating decrease over the next eight years the results suggested that the appropriate stand age of alfalfa was greater than five years considering the maximum average fodder yield under rfrwh 4 2 actual evapotranspiration water use efficiency wue is defined as the ratio of alfalfa fodder yield to water lost through evapotranspiration increase of wue has become increasingly important in semiarid and arid regions because of the high risk of drought condition and rapid depletion of water resources accurate quantification of et in the field is crucial in enhancing wue and protecting environment and water quality ridge furrow rainwater harvesting is designed to collect runoff from ridges and to channel runoff and rainfall into furrows and to enhance soil water infiltration and water availability to crops ridge mulching can reduce soil evaporation thereby causing soil water to be transpired through plants biazin et al 2012 a number of studies confirmed that rfrwh can improve the soil water content in the rooting zone hence substantially reducing non productive soil water losses zhou et al 2009 jia et al 2006 previous research wang et al 2015 found that the average annual runoff coefficient was 16 19 65 77 and 70 79 respectively for mcs bf and pf for the same treatments the threshold rainfall needed to produce runoff was 4 2 4 3 2 8 3 0 and 2 8 2 9 mm respectively alfalfa plants have a high drought resistance and adapt well to environmental changes because the plants go into dormancy with drought stress and other negative environmental conditions and survive after these environmental conditions recover montazar and sadeghi 2008 alfalfa production usually leads to desiccation of deep soil layers after planting for several years jia et al 2009 this desiccation would negatively impact alfalfa production ridley et al 2001 the result in our experiment indicated that actual evapotranspiration in pf and bf was significantly p 0 05 greater than that in mcs and fp and no significant difference of actual evapotranspiration was found between pf and bf or between mcs and fp the higher runoff coefficient of pf and bf leads to greater soil moisture which leads to higher actual evapotranspiration compared to mcs and fp at the same time actual evapotranspiration significantly increased as ridge width increased this result confirmed that rfrwh would improve soil water content and mitigate the formation of dried soil layers in rootzone especially for pf or bf with wide ridges 4 3 optimum ridge width the selection of rfrwh cultivation period ridge width and mulching material is one of the key challenges in development of rfrwh this study indicated that fodder yield in pf and bf was significantly p 0 05 greater than that in mcs and fp but no significant difference of fodder yield was found between pf and bf or between mcs and fp these results demonstrated that there were similar increases in fodder yield between ridges mulched with bio degradable film and ridges mulched with plastic film the bio degradable film can be tilled into soil after harvesting and would be degraded by the action of soil organisms thus saving labor and disposal costs but the cost of bio degradable film was higher than that of plastic film there is a tradeoff between wide ridge width which increases soil water moisture and single plant productivity and narrow ridge width which increases planting area and land productivity an optimum ridge width can be obtained by calculating fodder yields as a function of ridge width the results indicated that the optimum ridge width for mcs bf and pf was 29 39 and 37 cm respectively across five years liniger et al 2011 found that the ratio of rainwater collection area to cultivated area varied between 2 1 10 1 the results should satisfy tradeoff between achieving high fodder yield and runoff which is highly dependent on rainfall conditions in this region other factors of basic criteria when choosing the optimum ridge width are soil type texture and saturated hydraulic conductivity plant species slope economic benefit lifestyle and labor adham et al 2016a the occurrence of soil desiccation is a result of excessive depletion in deep soil water by high water utilization crops and insufficient precipitation over a long period of time jia et al 2019 soil desiccation alters the hydraulic properties of soil and adversely affects subsequent crop cultivation the soil water consumption of plants generally depends on plant species stand age planting density and annual precipitation compared to shallow root crops such as potato and wheat alfalfa usually utilizes more soil water numerous studies have shown that rotation of alfalfa with shallow deep annual crops may recover soil water wang et al 2011 huang et al 2021 therefore timely alfalfa crop rotation could compensate soil water deficit and mitigate soil desiccation in semiarid regions 5 conclusion based on fodder yield and climate conditions in five consecutive growing seasons in ridge furrow rainwater harvesting the highest fodder yield was obtained from the first growing cutting stage in one year and reached its highest level in the second stand year and maintained a similar level in the subsequent years fodder yield was affected by both the rainfall in the growing cutting stage and the available soil water storage prior to the growing cutting stage the bio degradable film can be used as an environmentally friendly mulching material in rfrwh without considering its high cost the optimum ridge width for ridges with manually compacted soil ridges mulched with bio degradable film and ridges mulched with plastic film was 29 39 and 37 cm respectively across five years the optimum ridge widths had a high security as the rainfall conditions are considered in this region declaration of

9563,special hydrological structures coupled with rainfall and agricultural activities have great impacts on water quality in karst areas high frequency hydro chemical dual nitrate isotopes and a bayesian mixing model siar were employed to investigate the effect of heavy rainfall events on nitrogen patterns in surface and underground streams and explore the implications for nitrogen pollution prevention in a typical karst agricultural catchment in southwest china the results showed that no3 n was relatively high in both surface and underground streams and the average value in surface stream was two times higher than in underground stream the lowest no3 n of underground stream was found in the falling limb of the hydrograph according to source apportionment by siar chemical fertilizer was the dominant nitrate source in the study area which contributed 52 81 and 29 78 of nitrate in surface stream and underground stream respectively the highest dissolved inorganic nitrogen flux and no3 n in surface stream was 5 7 times and 2 4 times higher respectively than in underground stream over the same period which suggested that surface runoff rather than underground stream was the main route of rapid nitrogen loss in the karst catchment during heavy rainfall events reasonably planning the fertilization time and optimizing nitrogen fertilizer use should be considered to decrease nitrogen loss from farmland rational use of a widespread karst underground conduit system to reduce water nitrogen content may also be a potential method for achieving nitrogen removal keywords nitrate patterns karst agricultural catchment rainfall events nitrate isotopes sources apportionment 1 introduction nitrogen one of the most important nutrient elements has historically played a vital role in global agriculture industry and population growth galloway et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 however extensive use of nitrogen changed the natural nitrogen cycle resulting in leaving most inland water bodies in the world with varying degrees of nitrogen pollution gao et al 2019 over the past century the delivery of nitrogen from land to rivers has increased from 3 4 to 6 4 1010 kg year while nitrogen export by rivers to the ocean has increased by more than 90 beusen et al 2016 nitrate the main nitrogen species in rivers has discharged into the aquatic system in excess and posed serious threats to human health and aquatic ecosystems which was first reported in the middle of the last century comly 1945 nitrate management has always been fundamental and important work in water environment protection especially in karst areas with a thin soil layer rapid water flow and fragile eco environment li et al 2021 the karst landscape covers approximately one fifth of the world s ice free land area and provides drinking water resources for a quarter of the world s population ford et al 2019 southwest china has one of the largest continuous karst areas in the world covering nearly 14 of china s land area wang et al 2004 2019 due to the thin soil layer and the unique geomorphology and structure of karsts rapid water and pollutants exchange between surface stream and underground stream promote the transport of nutrients and aggravate local water pollution problems li et al 2021 some karst areas have experienced significant environmental degradation in recent decades such as rocky desertification the process by which soil and vegetation covered areas evolve into rocky landscape and water eutrophication the phenomenon of water pollution caused by an excessive content of nutrients such as n and p in the water wang et al 2004 2019 previous studies have shown that rainfall and agricultural activities are the two major factors driving high nitrogen concentration in the global karst ecosystems van geer et al 2016 van der grift et al 2016 li et al 2020 for example by using high frequency nitrate sensing and stable isotope tracing in the houzhai catchment of southwest china researchers found that most nitrogen was exported in the wet season furthermore more than 90 of nitrate was exported from the headwater catchments within the first two months of the wet season yue et al 2019 2020 therefore nitrogen management and water environment protection at catchment scale should mainly focus on nitrogen export and source apportionment during rainfall events understanding nitrogen export patterns and information on sources in surface and subterranean streams is essential for the reduction of water nitrogen pollution in the karst catchment the combined use of hydrochemistry hydrological information and dual nitrate isotopes δ15n and δ18o has proved a good method of nitrogen pattern analysis and nitrate source apportionment in aquatic systems xue et al 2009 el gaouzi et al 2013 mueller et al 2016 for example wet deposition by rainfall wd chemical fertilizer cf soil organic nitrogen son and manure and sewage m s are the four main potential nitrate sources in a given catchment liu et al 2006 kendall et al 2007 nitrate derived wd usually has low δ15n values and high δ18o values which can be observed to make a significant contribution in urban systems buda and dewalle 2009 yang and toor 2016 but less of a contribution in karst agricultural catchments kim et al 2015 wang et al 2018 chemical fertilizer son and m s are the main nitrate sources present in the different hydrological processes found in different land use catchments peterson et al 2002 jiang et al 2009 mueller et al 2016 xia et al 2018 husic et al 2020 a previous study in a karst surface river found that cf son and m s were the main nitrate sources which varied with discharge during rainfall events wang et al 2020 chemical fertilizer was to be the dominant nitrate source in shallow groundwater and the catchment spring outlet which contributed up to 80 during heavy rainfall events yue et al 2019 additionally nitrogen pattern in the surface stream or the underground stream of karst areas was explored and it has been agreed that the heavy rainfall events are the critical period for nitrogen transport paul et al 2015 yue et al 2019 2020 wang et al 2020 however there is still limited understanding of the different nitrogen patterns in karstic streams during heavy rainfall events and the potential environmental effect to investigate the effect of heavy rainfall events on nitrogen patterns in agricultural surface and underground streams and explore the implications for the protection of karst water quality high frequency surface stream and underground stream samples were collected synchronously at a typical karst agricultural catchment in southwest china during heavy rainfall events the objectives of the present study are 1 to understand the nitrogen patterns in karst surface and underground streams during heavy rainfall events 2 to identify the main sources of nitrates and their contribution proportion in karst surface and underground streams 3 to explore the implications of variation of nitrogen patterns during heavy rainfall events for the prevention of nitrogen pollution in the fragile karst ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study catchment the study catchment of chenqi cq 26 15 20 26 16 9 n 105 46 3 105 46 50 e with an area of 1 25 km2 is located in the puding karst critical zone observatory in southwest china fig 1 this catchment has well developed underground conduit systems and features surrounding conical hills separated by star shaped valleys qin et al 2021 the two main landforms in the cq catchment are steep hillslopes 0 88 km2 and depressions 0 37 km2 with elevations ranging from 1514 to 1340 m and from 1340 to 1310 m above sea level respectively geological strata in the cq catchment include quaternary soil limestone of the guanling formation of the middle triassic dolostone and marlite chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 the cq catchment is located in a subtropical wet monsoonal climate zone with an annual rainfall that ranges from 732 to 1770 mm rainfall events occur predominantly in the wet season may to october when they contribute over 80 of the average annual rainfall zeng et al 2020a the annual rainfall in 2018 was 1161 mm the cultivated farmland including dry land and paddy fields in the depression of the catchment covers 17 of total land use while natural vegetation developed areas and bare rock occupy the other 83 qin et al 2020 yue et al 2020 the main crops in the cq catchment are corn rapeseed rice and vegetables urea compound fertilizers and organic fertilizers are the most commonly used fertilizers and intensive fertilization mainly takes place from mid may to early june each year surface stream only occur during heavy rainfall events and a perennial underground stream the outlet of groundwater and three sinkholes in the catchment supply irrigation water for farmlands 2 2 sample collection high frequency sampling was conducted at the outlet of the cq catchment surface and underground streams during two rainfall events from june 11 15 2018 seventy two underground stream samples were collected by auto sampler tc 8000e ii china with the time interval varying from one to two hours covering the entire water level fluctuation process during the two rainfall events fourteen surface stream samples were collected manually every one to two hours from the occurring surface stream all water samples were collected in duplicate in clean and dry bottles on site filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane within 24 h after returning to the laboratory and stored in a refrigerator at 4 until analysis 2 3 chemical analyses of water samples at the sampling point dissolved oxygen concentration do electrical conductivity ec water temperature t and the ph of surface stream samples were measured in the field by a portable multiple parameter sensor wtw multi 3630 german hydrochemistry parameters of the underground stream

analyzer skalar sans plus systems and the dual isotopes δ15n and δ18o of nitrate and nitrite were determined using the denitrifying bacteria method mcilvin and casciotti 2011 specifically no3 and no2 were converted to n2o by denitrifying bacteria pseudomonas chlororaphis subsp aureofaciens atcc 13985 and then analyzed with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer isoprime gv uk in the state key laboratory of environment geochemistry chinese academy of science four international standards usgs 32 usgs 34 usgs 35 and iaea no 3 were used for δ15n and δ18o analysis calibration the analytical

instantaneous discharge 2 f ci qi where ci and qi represent the din concentration of a sample collected at time i and discharge at time i respectively 2 4 bayesian isotope mixing models stable isotope analysis in r language siar was developed based on a bayesian mixing model to calculate the contribution of different sources of a single sample data point or group sample data points parnell et al 2010 four potential nitrate sources wd n 10 son n 16 cf n 6 and m s n 5 were collected from the cq catchment the siar is described by the following equations 3 x ij k 1 k f k s jk c jk ε ij 4 s jk n μ

normally distributed with the mean 0 and the standard deviation σj a more detailed description of siar can be found in other papers parnell et al 2010 2013 3 results 3 1 variations of the hydrological and hydrochemical parameters normally there is no surface runoff and the discharge at the underground stream sampling site is usually kept at q 13 10 3 m3 s 1 after two rainfall events 48 3 mm on june 11 and june 12 within 24 h fig 2 the discharge peak of the underground stream reached 110 10 3 m3 s 1 and 154 10 3 m3 s 1 respectively while the discharge peak of the surface stream reached 126 10 3 m3 s 1 and 370 10 3 m3 s 1 respectively dissolved oxygen ranging from 5 3 to 6 9 mg l 1 of the underground stream has the same trend as q during the sampling period whereas ec has the opposite trend to q with values ranging from 396 to 548 μs cm 1 fig 3 the values of ec and do of the surface stream ranged from 404 to 485 μs cm 1 and 6 5 8 1 mg l 1 respectively in contrast to ec and do ph remained relatively stable during the sampling period with the mean values of the surface stream and the underground stream recorded at 7 8 0 1 and 7 4 0 1 respectively 3 2 time series of nitrogen concentration during rainfall events nitrate was the main form of nitrogen in karst water samples during the study periods accounting for 96 and 78 of the total dissolved inorganic nitrogen in the underground stream and the surface stream respectively the no3 n of the surface stream ranged from 3 9 to 9 9 mg l 1 fig 4 with high values being detected in the first period of sampling the surface stream p ⅰ s and low values in the second period of sampling the surface stream p ⅱ s similar to no3 n no2 n of the surface stream has high mean values of 1 21 0 60 mg l 1 in p ⅰ s and remained at 0 11 0 64 mg l 1 in p ⅱ s in contrast low nh4 n values were observed in p ⅰ s and had the highest value 2 38 mg l 1 in the first samples of p ⅱ s then decreased with discharge no3 n of samples in the first period of sampling the underground stream p ⅰ g had mean values of 3 7 2 2 mg l 1 there was a sharp decrease of no3 n with a rapid discharge increase early in the second period of sampling the underground stream p ⅱ g then fluctuated regularly ranging from 1 7 to 4 3 mg l 1 both no2 n and nh4 n were low in all samples of underground stream taken during the sampling periods nearly all at the low detectable limit figs s1 and s2 3 3 temporal variations of nitrate isotopic signatures the dual nitrate isotope δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values of underground stream ranged from 0 5 to 6 6 and 1 9 2 2 respectively fig s3 the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 showed similar fluctuations to no3 n during the sampling period which was to decrease first and then increase during the second event fig 5 in contrast the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values of the surface stream varied over a small range during rainfall events with mean values of 1 0 0 9 and 0 2 0 6 respectively among the four potential nitrate sources wd had the lowest average δ15n value 7 2 and the highest average δ18o value 60 8 while m s had the highest average δ15n 14 5 the average and standard deviation of all sources can be found in our previously published papers wang et al 2020 yue et al 2020 3 4 nitrate source proportions and din flux during heavy rainfall events based on the siar results four nitrate sources contribution were found to have varied dynamically during the sampling period wet deposition contributed equally 4 to underground and surface streams in contrast cf was the dominant nitrate source with the proportional contribution to the surface and underground streams ranging from 52 to 81 and 29 78 respectively soil organic nitrogen was found to be the second major nitrate source in the present catchment contributing 10 23 of the total nitrate to the surface stream and 12 33 to the underground stream manure and sewage derived nitrate in surface runoff kept stable at 10 10 3 and has a contribution proportion ranging from 8 to 32 in the underground stream there was a wide variation in din flux between the underground and surface streams the highest flux rates in the surface and underground streams were 2606 mg s 1 and 459 mg s 1 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 nitrogen patterns in surface and underground stream during rainfall events due to the existence of the highly developed underground conduit system the karst system stores part of the rain water at the initial period of a wet season which can raise the water table in the karst aquifer and then contributes to surface flow jourde et al 2006 peng et al 2018 in addition where soil pore space and karst fissures were pre filled with water from previous rainfall the surface flow may also occur during low intensity rainfall events during a continuous rainfall period jourde et al 2006 this is why the surface stream appeared later than the underground stream in the same rainfall events and the response of discharge to rainfall in p ⅰ s was faster than that in p ⅱ s in the cq catchment fig 2 in the present study extremely high no3 n near the drinking water limit 10 mg l 1 set by the chinese surface water environmental quality standards gb3838 2002 was detected in p ⅰ s which showed little variation with discharge no3 n in p ⅱ s was lower than that found in p ⅰ s near the no3 n in p ⅰ g and increased a little when surface runoff was about to disappear the last two samples nitrate patterns in the underground stream were different in two continuous rainfall events fig 6 previous studies found that nitrogen in water was affected by the dilution by rainwater during rainfall events huebsch et al 2014 paul et al 2015 but no dilution was found in p ⅰ s and p ⅰ g one potential reason was that the accumulated nitrogen in the soil and the underground conduit system before a rainfall event was maintained in relatively high no3 n in the catchment groundwater outlet water in p ⅰ g as the stored nitrate was squeezed out the subsequent rainfall event caused dilution to no3 n in p ⅱ g after rainfall events the nitrogen that has been transported over long distances and the nitrogen that accumulated and leached into the underground stream near the outlet was kept relatively high no3 n in the low water level period yue et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 according to previous field observations in the cq catchment surface runoff only occurs a few times during any one year peng and wang 2012 compared with other landscapes as the two typical characteristics of the karst the complex underground conduit systems and high conical slopes create the unique hydrological pathway slopes and lead to the rapid generation and regression of surface runoff aquilina et al 2006 fu et al 2016 jourde et al 2006 zhang et al 2019 le mesnil et al 2020 a previous study found that the nitrogen in the surface stream mainly originated from the top layer of farmland soil in valleys vegetable fields paddy fields corn fields etc soil in valleys liu et al 2020 nevertheless nitrogen in the catchment outlet underground stream mainly originated from accumulated nitrogen in the soil and the shallow underground stream yue et al 2020 thus the varied nitrogen patterns between two streams in a karstic catchment during rainfall events depended on their transport path and hydrologic processes 4 2 sources of nitrate in stormwater runoff the stored nitrogen in the soil and underground conduit systems was altered by nitrogen transformation such as denitrification before being flushed into the water before rainfall events kellman et al 2003 nitrogen transformation occurring during rainfall events usually has little effect on nitrate concentration and isotope values owing to the lesser residence time sebestyen et al 2008 in this study low δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values in surface and underground streams suggested that the effect of nitrogen transformation on nitrate concentration and isotope values was negligible their isotopic signatures can represent nitrogen sources information in the two streams during rainfall events generally wd and cf have low δ15n no3 values near 0 4 to 4 the difference is that δ18o no3 in wd has extremely high values 40 soil organic nitrogen derived nitrate has δ15n no3 values ranging from 2 to 8 while m s usually contains both high no3 n and δ15n no3 values 6 25 liu et al 2006 kendall et al 2007 the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values in the cq catchment indicate that cf was the main nitrate source in the surface stream while cf and son were potential nitrate sources in the underground stream during the sampling period fig s3 previous studies demonstrated that wd was the derived nitrate source in stormwater runoff in forest and urban systems during rainfall events buda and dewalle 2009 yang and toor 2016 baral et al 2018 sebestyen et al 2019 wet deposition collected from the cq catchment has low no3 n 0 4 mg l 1 and high δ18o no3 values 50 zeng et al 2020b and contributed less than 10 of the nitrate in the karst agricultural catchment surface stream during rainfall events wang et al 2020 a similar low wd contribution was found in this study and wd was the least contributing nitrate source in both the surface and underground streams figs 7 and 8 with the exodus of the rural population and the improvement of local agricultural modernization the percentage of manure used as farmland fertilizer has been sharply reduced oliver et al 2020 in this study m s makes a low contribution to surface runoff fig 7a and has a relatively high contribution 32 to the underground stream at the beginning and end of rainfall event fig 8a son dominated nitrate source was reported in the catchment where forest or grass is the main land use type inamdar and mitchell 2007 hu et al 2019 nevertheless in karst agricultural catchments with thin soil layers son is not the main source of nitrogen in water kim et al 2015 the nitrogen sources quantification present in karstic catchments also found a similar result wherein only 10 of nitrate in karst waters during high a discharge period derived from son a high son contribution was mainly observed in the low discharge period of heavy rainfall events when the highest contribution proportions in surface and underground streams were 23 and 33 respectively widely used cf increases the farmland s yield of grain and it also promotes nitrogen and phosphorus losses during rainfall events from the agricultural lands to the surrounding waters causing eutrophication francesco et al 2020 particularly in karst areas where the groundwater and surface stream can be exchanged quickly chemical fertilizers such as urea compound fertilizers and organic fertilizers had been used intensively on the farmland in the cq catchment before the sampling period yue et al 2020 the subsequent rainfall accelerated nitrogen transportation and resulted in cf contributing most of the nitrate in the underground and surface streams with the highest proportion of up to 80 detected during the high discharge period as a major driving force in nitrogen transport rainwater flushes nitrogen from topsoil to surface runoff and squeezes the stored nitrogen out from the underground conduit system into the groundwater husic et al 2020 li et al 2020 gorski and zimmer 2021 four nitrate sources contribution varied with discharge during the sampling period due to its low contribution proportion wd did not fluctuate with discharge change the contribution of son and m s to both surface and underground streams showed a similar trend with discharge their proportion was relatively high at the beginning of rainfall events and gradually decreased with the increase of discharge figs 7 and 8 in contrast as the dominant nitrate source the proportion of cf was positively correlated with the discharge of surface waters r2 0 66 p 0 05 and underground waters r2 0 84 p 0 01 in contrast to the variation of nitrate sources in the surface stream nitrogen in the underground stream was been affected by both the nitrogen transport process and the complex karst conduit system li et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 the variation of nitrate sources showed a longer periodicity in this study just like the hydrological variation of the underground stream overall nitrate source apportionment by isotope mixing models provided key sources and their transportation paths in karst agricultural catchments 4 3 potential ways of achieving karst water quality protection based on nitrate source apportionment china has the largest population in the world and consumes nearly 30 of the world s nitrogen fertilizers to feed its people yu et al 2019 many areas are facing the pervasive threat of high nitrogen concentration in waters due to the excessive application of fertilizers as in the karst areas in southwest china gao et al 2020 qin et al 2022 according to the results of the calculation of the proportion of source contribution by siar either in the surface stream or the underground stream cf was the dominant nitrate source found during a heavy rainfall event therefore from the perspective of nitrate sources management in the karst agricultural catchment the critical factor in controlling nitrogen loss lies with controlling the cf loss from farmlands fertilizer use efficiency in guizhou province including the cq catchment is lower than in eastern china and other developed countries tan et al 2015 bai et al 2021 which is primarily due to the special hydrogeological structure of the karst and the crude fertilization methods of local farmers optimizing nitrogen fertilizer use increasing the amount of slow release fertilizer with a longer fertilization effect instead of cf use and an appropriate amount of straw application are also practices that can reduce nitrogen loss from farmland and protect inland water quality li et al 2017a b tang et al 2022 underground water in the cq catchment is the stable water source for those downstream rivers the dengzhan and houzhai rivers throughout the year while surface water is only drained downstream during a heavy rainfall event high no3 n above the threshold limit value 10 mg l 1 of drinking water was detected in the dengzhan and houzhai rivers the lower reaches of the studied catchment during heavy rainfall events yue et al 2019 wang et al 2020 compared to the no3 n and din export fluxes from the cq catchment by surface and underground streams the high no3 n in the lower reaches was mainly dominated by surface stream transportation the highest value of din flux in the surface stream is 5 7 times higher than it was in the underground stream fig s4 the underground stream was the main route for catchment nitrogen export in the dry season and wet season when there is no rainfall to produce surface runoff however surface stream was the main nitrogen export during the high discharge period of heavy rainfall events which made for a sharp rise in the nitrogen export rate thus the key to reducing the nitrogen loss from surface runoff is to reasonably plan fertilization times and avoid rough fertilization previous studies found that cf was the major nitrate source in underground stream stored in the karst underground system and modified by denitrification before rainfall events husic et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 an underground stream with a lower nitrogen concentration is discharged through a catchment underground water outlet when rainfall occurs in this study the highest no3 n in the underground stream was one half lower than the highest no3 n in the surface stream the results of previous studies and this study confirmed that the well developed underground conduit system in karst areas may remove part of nitrogen by nitrogen process therefore rational use of underground conduit systems to reduce nitrogen content in water may also be a potential method for karst water quality protection water quality protection is a difficult and prolonged task especially in karst areas where underground stream and surface stream are interconnected agricultural activities such as fertilization are the dominant factor in nitrogen pollution in karst areas li et al 2020 ricci et al 2022 water quality protection is inseparable from the sustainable development of agriculture li et al 2021 in the long run with socio economic development and agricultural modernization new farming models including family industrial farming will replace the traditional smallholder farming to substantially improve the efficiency of fertilizer and reduce agricultural nitrogen pollution in karst areas pan et al 2017 sun et al 2022 yu et al 2021 however there is still a long way to go for underdeveloped karst areas to achieve a win win model for agriculture development and ecological environmental protection whether in theory or practice 5 conclusion in this study nitrogen patterns and the sources from the agricultural streams in southwest china were studied by dual nitrate isotopes and high frequency hydro chemical compositions of surface and underground streams this research shed light on the issue of preventing nitrogen pollution in karst waters different nitrogen patterns were detected in underground and surface streams due to differences in nitrate transport pathways and nitrate sources the highest no3 n of both underground and surface streams in the first period of a heavy rainfall event was higher than in the second period due to the nitrogen accumulation before rainfall source apportionment by a bayesian isotope mixing model suggested that cf was the dominant nitrate source which contributed most of the nitrate in both the surface stream 71 8 and the underground stream 51 16 the highest din flux and no3 n values in the surface stream were 5 7 times and 2 4 times higher respectively than those found in the underground stream during the same period indicating that the surface stream rather than the underground stream was the primary reason for high nitrogen concentration in karst rivers according to the variation of nitrate sources and din flux in surface stream and underground stream reasonable planning of the time of fertilization and optimization of the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied were proposed to decrease the nitrogen loss from farmland into the surrounding waters the widespread underground conduit system in the karst area is a hotspot for nitrogen consuming processes such as denitrification and it may be a potential method for nitrogen removal furthermore karst water quality protection is inseparable from the sustainable development of agriculture in the long run declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

9563,special hydrological structures coupled with rainfall and agricultural activities have great impacts on water quality in karst areas high frequency hydro chemical dual nitrate isotopes and a bayesian mixing model siar were employed to investigate the effect of heavy rainfall events on nitrogen patterns in surface and underground streams and explore the implications for nitrogen pollution prevention in a typical karst agricultural catchment in southwest china the results showed that no3 n was relatively high in both surface and underground streams and the average value in surface stream was two times higher than in underground stream the lowest no3 n of underground stream was found in the falling limb of the hydrograph according to source apportionment by siar chemical fertilizer was the dominant nitrate source in the study area which contributed 52 81 and 29 78 of nitrate in surface stream and underground stream respectively the highest dissolved inorganic nitrogen flux and no3 n in surface stream was 5 7 times and 2 4 times higher respectively than in underground stream over the same period which suggested that surface runoff rather than underground stream was the main route of rapid nitrogen loss in the karst catchment during heavy rainfall events reasonably planning the fertilization time and optimizing nitrogen fertilizer use should be considered to decrease nitrogen loss from farmland rational use of a widespread karst underground conduit system to reduce water nitrogen content may also be a potential method for achieving nitrogen removal keywords nitrate patterns karst agricultural catchment rainfall events nitrate isotopes sources apportionment 1 introduction nitrogen one of the most important nutrient elements has historically played a vital role in global agriculture industry and population growth galloway et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 however extensive use of nitrogen changed the natural nitrogen cycle resulting in leaving most inland water bodies in the world with varying degrees of nitrogen pollution gao et al 2019 over the past century the delivery of nitrogen from land to rivers has increased from 3 4 to 6 4 1010 kg year while nitrogen export by rivers to the ocean has increased by more than 90 beusen et al 2016 nitrate the main nitrogen species in rivers has discharged into the aquatic system in excess and posed serious threats to human health and aquatic ecosystems which was first reported in the middle of the last century comly 1945 nitrate management has always been fundamental and important work in water environment protection especially in karst areas with a thin soil layer rapid water flow and fragile eco environment li et al 2021 the karst landscape covers approximately one fifth of the world s ice free land area and provides drinking water resources for a quarter of the world s population ford et al 2019 southwest china has one of the largest continuous karst areas in the world covering nearly 14 of china s land area wang et al 2004 2019 due to the thin soil layer and the unique geomorphology and structure of karsts rapid water and pollutants exchange between surface stream and underground stream promote the transport of nutrients and aggravate local water pollution problems li et al 2021 some karst areas have experienced significant environmental degradation in recent decades such as rocky desertification the process by which soil and vegetation covered areas evolve into rocky landscape and water eutrophication the phenomenon of water pollution caused by an excessive content of nutrients such as n and p in the water wang et al 2004 2019 previous studies have shown that rainfall and agricultural activities are the two major factors driving high nitrogen concentration in the global karst ecosystems van geer et al 2016 van der grift et al 2016 li et al 2020 for example by using high frequency nitrate sensing and stable isotope tracing in the houzhai catchment of southwest china researchers found that most nitrogen was exported in the wet season furthermore more than 90 of nitrate was exported from the headwater catchments within the first two months of the wet season yue et al 2019 2020 therefore nitrogen management and water environment protection at catchment scale should mainly focus on nitrogen export and source apportionment during rainfall events understanding nitrogen export patterns and information on sources in surface and subterranean streams is essential for the reduction of water nitrogen pollution in the karst catchment the combined use of hydrochemistry hydrological information and dual nitrate isotopes δ15n and δ18o has proved a good method of nitrogen pattern analysis and nitrate source apportionment in aquatic systems xue et al 2009 el gaouzi et al 2013 mueller et al 2016 for example wet deposition by rainfall wd chemical fertilizer cf soil organic nitrogen son and manure and sewage m s are the four main potential nitrate sources in a given catchment liu et al 2006 kendall et al 2007 nitrate derived wd usually has low δ15n values and high δ18o values which can be observed to make a significant contribution in urban systems buda and dewalle 2009 yang and toor 2016 but less of a contribution in karst agricultural catchments kim et al 2015 wang et al 2018 chemical fertilizer son and m s are the main nitrate sources present in the different hydrological processes found in different land use catchments peterson et al 2002 jiang et al 2009 mueller et al 2016 xia et al 2018 husic et al 2020 a previous study in a karst surface river found that cf son and m s were the main nitrate sources which varied with discharge during rainfall events wang et al 2020 chemical fertilizer was to be the dominant nitrate source in shallow groundwater and the catchment spring outlet which contributed up to 80 during heavy rainfall events yue et al 2019 additionally nitrogen pattern in the surface stream or the underground stream of karst areas was explored and it has been agreed that the heavy rainfall events are the critical period for nitrogen transport paul et al 2015 yue et al 2019 2020 wang et al 2020 however there is still limited understanding of the different nitrogen patterns in karstic streams during heavy rainfall events and the potential environmental effect to investigate the effect of heavy rainfall events on nitrogen patterns in agricultural surface and underground streams and explore the implications for the protection of karst water quality high frequency surface stream and underground stream samples were collected synchronously at a typical karst agricultural catchment in southwest china during heavy rainfall events the objectives of the present study are 1 to understand the nitrogen patterns in karst surface and underground streams during heavy rainfall events 2 to identify the main sources of nitrates and their contribution proportion in karst surface and underground streams 3 to explore the implications of variation of nitrogen patterns during heavy rainfall events for the prevention of nitrogen pollution in the fragile karst ecosystems 2 materials

china fig 1 this catchment has well developed underground conduit systems and features surrounding conical hills separated by star shaped valleys qin et al 2021 the two main landforms in the cq catchment are steep hillslopes 0 88 km2 and depressions 0 37 km2 with elevations ranging from 1514 to 1340 m and from 1340 to 1310 m above sea level respectively geological strata in the cq catchment

climate zone with an annual rainfall that ranges from 732 to 1770 mm rainfall events occur predominantly in the wet season may to october when they contribute over 80 of the average annual rainfall zeng et al 2020a the annual rainfall in 2018 was 1161 mm the cultivated farmland including dry land and paddy fields in the depression of the catchment covers 17 of total land use while natural vegetation developed areas and bare rock occupy the other 83 qin et al 2020 yue et al 2020 the main crops in the cq catchment are corn rapeseed rice and vegetables urea compound fertilizers and organic fertilizers are the most commonly used fertilizers and intensive fertilization mainly takes place from mid may to early june each year surface stream only occur during heavy rainfall events and a perennial underground stream the outlet of groundwater and three sinkholes in the catchment supply irrigation water for farmlands 2 2 sample collection high frequency sampling was conducted at the outlet of the cq catchment surface and underground streams during two rainfall events from june 11 15 2018 seventy two underground stream samples were collected by auto sampler tc 8000e ii china with the time interval varying from one to two hours covering the entire water level fluctuation process during the two rainfall events fourteen surface stream samples were collected manually every one to two hours from the occurring surface stream all water samples were collected in duplicate in clean and dry bottles on site filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane within 24 h after

and hydrochemical parameters normally there is no surface runoff and the discharge at the underground stream sampling site is usually kept at q 13 10 3 m3 s 1 after two rainfall events 48 3 mm on june 11 and june 12 within 24 h fig 2 the discharge peak of the underground stream reached 110 10 3 m3 s 1 and 154 10 3 m3 s 1 respectively while the discharge peak of the surface stream reached 126 10 3 m3 s 1 and 370 10 3 m3 s 1 respectively dissolved oxygen ranging from 5 3 to 6 9 mg l 1 of the underground stream has the same trend as q during the sampling period whereas ec has the opposite trend to q with values ranging from 396 to 548 μs cm 1 fig 3 the values of ec and do of the surface stream ranged from 404 to 485 μs cm 1 and 6 5 8 1 mg l 1 respectively in contrast to ec and do ph remained relatively stable during the sampling period with the mean values of the surface stream and the underground stream recorded at 7 8 0 1 and 7 4 0 1 respectively 3 2 time series of nitrogen concentration during rainfall events nitrate was the main form of nitrogen in karst water samples during the study periods accounting for 96 and 78 of the total dissolved inorganic nitrogen in the underground stream and the surface stream respectively the no3 n of the surface stream ranged from 3 9 to 9 9 mg l 1 fig 4 with high values being detected in the first period of sampling the surface stream p ⅰ s and low values in the second period of sampling the surface stream p ⅱ s similar to no3 n no2 n of the surface stream has high mean values of 1 21 0 60 mg l 1 in p ⅰ s and remained at 0 11 0 64 mg l 1 in p ⅱ s in contrast low nh4 n values were observed in p ⅰ s and had the highest value 2 38 mg l 1 in the first samples of p ⅱ s then decreased with discharge no3 n of samples in the first period of sampling the underground stream p ⅰ g had mean values of 3 7 2 2 mg l 1 there was a sharp decrease of no3 n with a rapid discharge increase early in the second period of sampling the underground stream p ⅱ g then fluctuated regularly ranging from 1 7 to 4 3 mg l 1 both no2 n and nh4 n were low in all samples of underground stream taken during the sampling periods nearly all at the low detectable limit figs s1 and s2 3 3 temporal variations of nitrate isotopic signatures the dual nitrate isotope δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values of underground stream ranged from 0 5 to 6 6 and 1 9 2 2 respectively fig s3 the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 showed similar fluctuations to no3 n during the sampling period which was to decrease first and then increase during the second event fig 5 in contrast the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values of the surface stream varied over a small range during rainfall events with mean values of 1 0 0 9 and 0 2 0 6 respectively among the four potential nitrate sources wd had the lowest average δ15n value 7 2 and the highest average δ18o value 60 8 while m s had the highest average δ15n 14 5 the average and standard deviation of all sources can be found in our previously published papers wang et al 2020 yue et al 2020 3 4 nitrate source proportions and din flux during heavy rainfall events based on the siar results four nitrate sources contribution were found to have varied dynamically during the sampling period wet deposition contributed equally 4 to underground and surface streams in contrast cf was the dominant nitrate source with the proportional contribution to the surface and underground streams ranging from 52 to 81 and 29 78 respectively soil organic nitrogen was found to be the second major nitrate source in the present catchment contributing 10 23 of the total nitrate to the surface stream and 12 33 to the underground stream manure and sewage derived nitrate in surface runoff kept stable at 10 10 3 and has a contribution proportion ranging from 8 to 32 in the underground stream there was a wide variation in din flux between the underground and surface streams the highest flux rates in the surface and underground streams were 2606 mg s 1 and 459 mg s 1 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 nitrogen patterns in surface and underground stream during rainfall events due to the existence of the highly developed underground conduit system the karst system stores part of the rain water at the initial period of a wet season which can raise the water table in the karst aquifer and then contributes to surface flow jourde et al 2006 peng et al 2018 in addition where soil pore space and karst fissures were pre filled with water from previous rainfall the surface flow may also occur during low intensity rainfall events during a continuous rainfall period jourde et al 2006 this is why the surface stream appeared later than the underground stream in the same rainfall events and the response of discharge to rainfall in p ⅰ s was faster than that in p ⅱ s in the cq catchment fig 2 in the present study extremely high no3 n near the drinking water limit 10 mg l 1 set by the chinese surface water environmental quality standards gb3838 2002 was detected in p ⅰ s which showed little variation with discharge no3 n in p ⅱ s was lower than that found in p ⅰ s near the no3 n in p ⅰ g and increased a little when surface runoff was about to disappear the last two samples nitrate patterns in the underground stream were different in two continuous rainfall events fig 6 previous studies found that nitrogen in water was affected by the dilution by rainwater during rainfall events huebsch et al 2014 paul et al 2015 but no dilution was found in p ⅰ s and p ⅰ g one potential reason was that the accumulated nitrogen in the soil and the underground conduit system before a rainfall event was maintained in relatively high no3 n in the catchment groundwater outlet water in p ⅰ g as the stored nitrate was squeezed out the subsequent rainfall event caused dilution to no3 n in p ⅱ g after rainfall events the nitrogen that has been transported over long distances and the nitrogen that accumulated and leached into the underground stream near the outlet was kept relatively high no3 n in the low water level period yue et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 according to previous field observations in the cq catchment surface runoff only occurs a few times during any one year peng and wang 2012 compared with other landscapes as the two typical characteristics of the karst the complex underground conduit systems and high conical slopes create the unique hydrological pathway slopes and lead to the rapid generation and regression of surface runoff aquilina et al 2006 fu et al 2016 jourde et al 2006 zhang et al 2019 le mesnil et al 2020 a previous study found that the nitrogen in the surface stream mainly originated from the top layer of farmland soil in valleys vegetable fields paddy fields corn fields etc soil in valleys liu et al 2020 nevertheless nitrogen in the catchment outlet underground stream mainly originated from accumulated nitrogen in the soil and the shallow underground stream yue et al 2020 thus the varied nitrogen patterns between two streams in a karstic catchment during rainfall events depended on their transport path and hydrologic processes 4 2 sources of nitrate in stormwater runoff the stored nitrogen in the soil and underground conduit systems was altered by nitrogen transformation such as denitrification before being flushed into the water before rainfall events kellman et al 2003 nitrogen transformation occurring during rainfall events usually has little effect on nitrate concentration and isotope values owing to the lesser residence time sebestyen et al 2008 in this study low δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values in surface and underground streams suggested that the effect of nitrogen transformation on nitrate concentration and isotope values was negligible their isotopic signatures can represent nitrogen sources information in the two streams during rainfall events generally wd and cf have low δ15n no3 values near 0 4 to 4 the difference is that δ18o no3 in wd has extremely high values 40 soil organic nitrogen derived nitrate has δ15n no3 values ranging from 2 to 8 while m s usually contains both high no3 n and δ15n no3 values 6 25 liu et al 2006 kendall et al 2007 the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values in the cq catchment indicate that cf was the main nitrate source in the surface stream while cf and son were potential nitrate sources in the underground stream during the sampling period fig s3 previous studies demonstrated that wd was the derived nitrate source in stormwater runoff in forest and urban systems during rainfall events buda and dewalle 2009 yang and toor 2016 baral et al 2018 sebestyen et al 2019 wet deposition collected from the cq catchment has low no3 n 0 4 mg l 1 and high δ18o no3 values 50 zeng et al 2020b and contributed less than 10 of the nitrate in the karst agricultural catchment surface stream during rainfall events wang et al 2020 a similar low wd contribution was found in this study and wd was the least contributing nitrate source in both the surface and underground streams figs 7 and 8 with the exodus of the rural population and the improvement of local agricultural modernization the percentage of manure used as farmland fertilizer has been sharply reduced oliver et al 2020 in this study m s makes a low contribution to surface runoff fig 7a and has a relatively high contribution 32 to the underground stream at the beginning and end of rainfall event fig 8a son dominated nitrate source was reported in the catchment where forest or grass is the main land use type inamdar and mitchell 2007 hu et al 2019 nevertheless in karst agricultural catchments with thin soil layers son is not the main source of nitrogen in water kim et al 2015 the nitrogen sources quantification present in karstic catchments also found a similar result wherein only 10 of nitrate in karst waters during high a discharge period derived from son a high son contribution was mainly observed in the low discharge period of heavy rainfall events when the highest contribution proportions in surface and underground streams were 23 and 33 respectively widely used cf increases the farmland s yield of grain and it also promotes nitrogen and phosphorus losses during rainfall events from the agricultural lands to the surrounding waters causing eutrophication francesco et al 2020 particularly in karst areas where the groundwater and surface stream can be exchanged quickly chemical fertilizers such as urea compound fertilizers and organic fertilizers had been used intensively on the farmland in the cq catchment before the sampling period yue et al 2020 the subsequent rainfall accelerated nitrogen transportation and resulted in cf contributing most of the nitrate in the underground and surface streams with the highest proportion of up to 80 detected during the high discharge period as a major driving force in nitrogen transport rainwater flushes nitrogen from topsoil to surface runoff and squeezes the stored nitrogen out from the underground conduit system into the groundwater husic et al 2020 li et al 2020 gorski and zimmer 2021 four nitrate sources contribution varied with discharge during the sampling period due to its low contribution proportion wd did not fluctuate with discharge change the contribution of son and m s to both surface and underground streams showed a similar trend with discharge their proportion was relatively high at the beginning of rainfall events and gradually decreased with the increase of discharge figs 7 and 8 in contrast as the dominant nitrate source the proportion of cf was positively correlated with the discharge of surface waters r2 0 66 p 0 05 and underground waters r2 0 84 p 0 01 in contrast to the variation of nitrate sources in the surface stream nitrogen in the underground stream was been affected by both the nitrogen transport process and the complex karst conduit system li et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 the variation of nitrate sources showed a longer periodicity in this study just like the hydrological variation of the underground stream overall nitrate source apportionment by isotope mixing models provided key sources and their transportation paths in karst agricultural catchments 4 3 potential ways of achieving karst water quality protection based on nitrate source apportionment china has the largest population in the world and consumes nearly 30 of the world s nitrogen fertilizers to feed its people yu et al 2019 many areas are facing the pervasive threat of high nitrogen concentration in waters due to the excessive application of fertilizers as in the karst areas in southwest china gao et al 2020 qin et al 2022 according to the results of the calculation of the proportion of source contribution by siar either in the surface stream or the underground stream cf was the dominant nitrate source found during a heavy rainfall event therefore from the perspective of nitrate sources management in the karst agricultural catchment the critical factor in controlling nitrogen loss lies with controlling the cf loss from farmlands fertilizer use efficiency in guizhou province including the cq catchment is lower than in eastern china and other developed countries tan et al 2015 bai et al 2021 which is primarily due to the special hydrogeological structure of the karst and the crude fertilization methods of local farmers optimizing nitrogen fertilizer use increasing the amount of slow release fertilizer with a longer fertilization effect instead of cf use and an appropriate amount of straw application are also practices that can reduce nitrogen loss from farmland and protect inland water quality li et al 2017a b tang et al 2022 underground water in the cq catchment is the stable water source for those downstream rivers the dengzhan and houzhai rivers throughout the year while surface water is only drained downstream during a heavy rainfall event high no3 n above the threshold limit value 10 mg l 1 of drinking water was detected in the dengzhan and houzhai rivers the lower reaches of the studied catchment during heavy rainfall events yue et al 2019 wang et al 2020 compared to the no3 n and din export fluxes from the cq catchment by surface and underground streams the high no3 n in the lower reaches was mainly dominated by surface stream transportation the highest value of din flux in the surface stream is 5 7 times higher than it was in the underground stream fig s4 the underground stream was the main route for catchment nitrogen export in the dry season and wet season when there is no rainfall to produce surface runoff however surface stream was the main nitrogen export during the high discharge period of heavy rainfall events which made for a sharp rise in the nitrogen export rate thus the key to reducing the nitrogen loss from surface runoff is to reasonably plan fertilization times and avoid rough fertilization previous studies found that cf was the major nitrate source in underground stream stored in the karst underground system and modified by denitrification before rainfall events husic et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 an underground stream with a lower nitrogen concentration is discharged through a catchment underground water outlet when rainfall occurs in this study the highest no3 n in the underground stream was one half lower than the highest no3 n in the surface stream the results of previous studies and this study confirmed that the well developed underground conduit system in karst areas may remove part of nitrogen by nitrogen process therefore rational use of underground conduit systems to reduce nitrogen content in water may also be a potential method for karst water quality protection water quality protection is a difficult and prolonged task especially in karst areas where underground stream and surface stream are interconnected agricultural activities such as fertilization are the dominant factor in nitrogen pollution in karst areas li et al 2020 ricci et al 2022 water quality protection is inseparable from the sustainable development of agriculture li et al 2021 in the long run with socio economic development and agricultural modernization new farming models including family industrial farming will replace the traditional smallholder farming to substantially improve the efficiency of fertilizer and reduce agricultural nitrogen pollution in karst areas pan et al 2017 sun et al 2022 yu et al 2021 however there is still a long way to go for underdeveloped karst areas to achieve a win win model for agriculture development and ecological environmental protection whether in theory or practice 5 conclusion in this study nitrogen patterns and the sources from the agricultural streams in southwest china were studied by dual nitrate isotopes and high frequency hydro chemical compositions of surface and underground streams this research shed light on the issue of preventing nitrogen pollution in karst waters different nitrogen patterns were detected in underground and surface streams due to differences in nitrate transport pathways and nitrate sources the highest no3 n of both underground and surface streams in the first period of a heavy rainfall event was higher than in the second period due to the nitrogen accumulation before rainfall source apportionment by a bayesian isotope mixing model suggested that cf was the dominant nitrate source which contributed most of the nitrate in both the surface stream 71 8 and the underground stream 51 16 the highest din flux and no3 n values in the surface stream were 5 7 times and 2 4 times higher respectively than those found in the underground stream during the same period indicating that the surface stream rather than the underground stream was the primary reason for high nitrogen concentration in karst rivers according to the variation of nitrate sources and din flux in surface stream and underground stream reasonable planning of the time of fertilization and optimization of the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied were proposed to decrease the nitrogen loss from farmland into the surrounding waters the widespread underground conduit system in the karst area is a hotspot for nitrogen consuming processes such as denitrification and it may be a potential method for nitrogen removal furthermore karst water quality protection is inseparable from the sustainable development of agriculture in the long run declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

9564,the shortage of and intense competition for water and light are the main factors restricting the productivity of agroforestry systems in the loess plateau of western shanxi china the combination of soil mulch and irrigation in agroforestry systems can regulate the interspecific relationships and increase the productivity of the component crops however the effects of mulch and irrigation regimes on the photosynthetic physiological characteristics of the agroforestry system and its synergistic mechanisms are still unclear a 3 year experiment with two factors mulch and irrigation was conducted to investigate the effects of different mulch practices and irrigation levels on the photosynthetic characteristics growth indices and interspecific relationships of a fruit tree crop intercropping system an apple soybean intercropping system was selected as the research object and two mulch types straw mulch m1 and plastic mulch m2 and four maximum irrigation levels no irrigation w0 55 w1 70 w2 and 85 w3 field capacity fc were tested no mulch together with no irrigation was the control treatment ck the results showed that there was no photosynthetic siesta phenomenon in the intercropping system and the daily variations of the net photosynthetic rate pn and transpiration rate tr were unimodal the mean values for pn tr and leaf photosynthetic efficiency pue of the apple and soybean under the m2 treatment were generally higher than under the m1 treatment whereas tr and pue increased as the amount of irrigation increased in 2017 2018 the maximum mean pn values for both apple and soybean were observed under the m2w2 treatment whereas in 2019 they were observed under the m2w3 treatment the pn tr and leaf intrinsic water use efficiency wuei of soybean correlated positively with the distance from the trees whereas pue correlated negatively with it mulch and water replenishment increased apple shoot growth and the height leaf area index and yield of soybean especially under plastic mulch a principal components analysis found that the m2w2 treatment had the highest comprehensive benefits in 2017 2018 whereas in 2019 the highest were achieved with the m2w3 treatment therefore to optimize the photosynthetic efficiency and yield of the apple soybean intercropping system in the loess region of western shanxi we suggest a combination of plastic mulch and maximum irrigation of 70 fc in normal years but maximum irrigation should be increased to 85 fc in dry years keywords agroforestry mulch irrigation photosynthesis loess plateau 1 introduction agroforestry is a traditional and widely used method of land management in which perennial woody plants are purposefully planted on the same land as agricultural crops to achieve a variety of ecological and economic benefits lorenz and lal 2014 ehret et al 2015 pavlidis and tsihrintzis 2017 bado et al 2021 the apple malus pumila m is an important economic tree species in the loess region of western shanxi province china and young apple trees are suitable for interplanting with crops because the crown width is small and they demand little water or fertilizer apple and soybean glycine max l merr are a common combination in agroforestry systems in this region and their combination makes better use of water light and nutrient resources and improves land use efficiency than either crop alone peng et al 2009 yun et al 2012 sun et al 2018 however due to unevenly distributed and insufficient precipitation during the crop co growth period in the loess region of western shanxi province coupled with the large amount of soil water evaporation guo et al 2021 the competition for water between the fruit trees and understory crops in the critical growth period is fierce these factors together cause water stress which severely restricts the growth and development of the intercropped plants ling et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 and ultimately negatively affects the production benefits and economic benefits for farmers to alleviate this adverse effect water conservation and replenishment measures must be taken during the critical period of water deficit in the apple soybean intercropping system irrigation can directly moisten the root area of the crops to meet their water demand during the peak growth period of the apple soybean intercropping system tworkoski and glenn 2008 li et al 2017 however the high wind speed and solar radiation in the region promote the rapid evaporation of soil water leading to the waste of limited irrigation water and low water use efficiency therefore this system must be supplemented with additional irrigation based water retention measures to reduce water loss straw mulch and film mulch are the two most commonly used ground mulch measures and can reduce soil evaporation by providing an interface barrier improving the efficiency of soil water use while adjusting the soil temperature to promote plant growth cook et al 2006 yu et al 2018 vincent caboud et al 2019 in previous research we examined the interaction between roots and water in this intercropping system under different mulches and irrigation practices zheng et al 2021 we found that mulch and irrigation not only significantly promoted the root growth of both apple and soybean but also reduced their competition for underground resources this interaction between the underground parts of both species affected the growth of the aboveground parts thus affecting the benefit conferred upon the entire intercropping system the aboveground biomass of the intercropping system correlated positively with the length of the underground roots xia et al 2013 the study of an irrigated jujube wheat intercropping system zhang et al 2017 showed that the aboveground biomass and yield of the two intergrown crops were lower than those of corresponding monocultures because underground competition mutually inhibited the growth of the root systems of the component crops there are strongly positive and negative interactions in agroforestry systems sanchez 1995 and the addition of mulch and irrigation will make the interaction of aboveground parts in an agroforestry system even more complex however the interactions between the aboveground parts of agroforestry systems under conditions of mulch and irrigation are still unclear photosynthesis is the basis for the formation of the dry matter in plants and water is an important raw material of plant photosynthesis gaju et al 2016 so photosynthesis effectively reflects the responses of plants to different soil water conditions previous studies have shown that increasing the soil water content positively affected the photosynthetic performance of crops and was an important way to improve crop yields and water use efficiency in water deficient areas lamptey et al 2020 however the allocation of soil water in intercropping systems is the result of dynamic interactions between the plant roots and canopies and between the intercropping plants and the environment yin et al 2020 the allocation of soil water in intercropping systems is more complex than in monocropping systems especially when combined with soil mulch and irrigation moreover due to trees shade and changes in the photosynthetic characteristics of the understory crop the responses of the plants photosynthesis to water become very complex querné et al 2017 franco et al 2018 the photosynthesis of the component crops in an intercropping system is an important manifestation of the competition and complementary for aboveground resources wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 studied intercropping systems involving apricot trees planted with different crops and found that tree shade reduced the photosynthesis of the understory crops but the crops responded to shading by changing the economic traits of their leaves to increase light capture and the efficiency of light utilization the photosynthetic response of intercropping plants to the regulation of soil water is the key to disentangle the synergistic mechanisms of intercropping systems based on water retention and replenishment although zhou et al 2019 studied the response of the photosynthetic characteristics of the aboveground parts in an apple maize intercropping system under irrigation control after the introduction mulch as another variable both the root biomass and soil available water of the underground part increased and such changes fed back to the resource competition of the aboveground parts however our understanding of the interactions and mechanisms of the aboveground parts of plants under such combined measures is still incomplete therefore the main objectives of this study were 1 to analyze the effects of mulch and irrigation regimes on the photosynthesis and growth of apple and soybean plants in an intercropping system and 2 to optimize the management of the apple soybean intercropping system under mulch and irrigation regimes these data are essential for improving the benefits of the apple soybean intercropping system and provide a theoretical basis for optimizing the water regulation of intercropping systems in the loess plateau of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the study site was located in forest ecosystem studies national observation and research station jixian shanxi china 36 01 n 110 45 e which is located at the southern end of lvliang mountain and is a typical gully region of the loess plateau fig 1 it has a warm temperate continental climate with sufficient sunshine and the diurnal temperature range is large the annual average precipitation is 576 mm and more than 90 of the precipitation occurs in april october in this area the average annual potential evaporation is 1729 mm the average annual hours of sunshine is 2563 8 h the average annual temperature is 9 9 c and the accumulated temperature 10 c is 3358 c the precipitation during the growth period in 2017 2019 was 427 6 mm 398 0 mm and 326 3 mm respectively fig 2 according to the standard developed by shanxi institute of meteorological science 2017 and 2018 were normal years and 2019 was a dry year the soil type in the test orchard is cinnamon soil and the soil layer is deep and uniform the soil properties of 0 60 cm soil layer were as follows average field capacity fc 22 14 bulk density 1 38 g cm 3 ph 7 9 soil organic matter content 9 47 g kg 1 total nitrogen content 0 62 g kg 1 ammonium nitrogen content 0 62 mg kg 1 nitrate nitrogen content 5 91 mg kg 1 available potassium content 77 86 mg kg 1 and available phosphorus content 4 53 mg kg 1 2 2 experimental design the 3 year experiment was conducted in 2017 2019 in maziqu ji county shanxi province which is tableland of gully region at an altitude of 1150 m an apple soybean intercropping system was chosen as the research object since both apple and soybean are economic crops in the region the apple trees short branch red fuji were 5 year old in 2017 with an average height and crown diameter of 3 9 m and 3 4 m respectively the distance between two adjacent rows of tree was 5 m and the distance between trees within a row was 4 m because 5 7 year old apple trees produce only small amounts of low quality and low price fruit all flowers were removed throughout the trial to better ensure vegetative growth there were two apple trees in each test plot which was surrounded by ridges and covered an area of 14 m2 the soybean jindou no 35 were sown on april 12 in 2017 april 19 in 2018 and april 22 in 2019 the spacing of the soybean was 0 30 m 0 40 m and the distance between a tree row and the adjacent row of soybean was 0 9 m in 2017 to reduce the shade effect caused by the increasing canopy width the distance between from the border soybean row and tree row was changed to 1 m and the spacing of soybean was changed to 0 35 m 0 50 m in 2018 2019 fig 3 the base fertilizer consist of urea n 412 4 kg ha 1 calcium superphosphate p2o5 168 8 kg ha 1 and potassium sulfate k2o 168 8 kg ha 1 which was evenly applied before plowing a random block design of two factors soil mulch and irrigation was used in the experiment a total of eight combinations of mulch and irrigation treatments were set in the trial and the control treatment ck was set without mulch and irrigation each treatment was performed in three replicates with a total of 27 plots the soil was mulched with straw mulch m1 or plastic mulch m2 a 5 cm thick layer of straw mulch containing maize fragments of 5 10 cm in length was laid between the crop rows after the emergence of the soybean seedlings alternatively white plastic film with a thickness of 0 005 mm was placed over the ground before the soybean was sown two rows of soybean were planted in one plastic film belt with 60 cm and 70 cm width in 2017 and 2018 2019 respectively the four maximum irrigation levels were rain fed and no irrigation w0 55 w1 70 w2 and 85 w3 of the field capacity fc in the soil layer at 0 60 cm the depth of the planned wet layer was 60 cm since most of the fine roots in the young apple soybean intercropping system were distributed in that soil layer sun et al 2018 because the three main growth stages of apple tree fruit formation fruit expansion and maturity and soybean branching podding and filling basically coincide and the apple trees did not fruit during the whole experiment the growth stages of the intercropped soybean were taken as references irrigation was carried out when there was no effective rainfall for more than one week in the branching podding and filling stages all the irrigation events were performed after 16 00 h to avoid the period of maximum temperature and radiation during the critical stages of water demand in the soybean however no irrigation was applied during the podding stage in 2018 because there was sufficient precipitation the soil water content was measured in each treatment plot before irrigation and the irrigation quota was determined based on the difference between the measured soil water content and the target value sidika et al 2012 border irrigation was used to supply the water and the amount of irrigation was controlled with a water meter the time and quota of irrigation for each treatment are shown in table 1 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 soil water content measurement time domain reflectometry tdr probes trime pico iph imko ettlingen germany were used to measure the soil water content before irrigation at observation points set 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 m from the tree row at soil depths of 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 50 and 50 60 cm 2 3 2 photosynthetic parameters the net photosynthesis rates pn µmol m 2s 1 and transpiration rates tr mmol m 2s 1 of the apple and soybean leaves were measured with a portable photosynthetic system li 6400 li cor inc lincoln ne usa in clear and cloudless weather during the podding and filling stages jul 21 and aug 31 2017 jul 20 and sep 1 2018 and aug 5 and aug 29 2019 the photosynthetically active radiation par µmol m 2s 1 at this location was recorded at the same time measurements were made once every 2 h between 9 00 and 17 00 h typical standard new apple branches were selected and labeled at a vertical height of 1 5 2 0 m on the sunny side of each tree three healthy leaves were selected to measure the photosynthetic parameters and the leaf veins were avoided during measurements three soybean plants located 0 9 1 7 and 2 5 m from the trees in 2017 and 1 0 1 5 and 2 5 m from the trees in 2018 2019 were selected and labeled three middle leaves from the upper triple compound leaves of each tagged soybean plant were selected for measurement the measured photosynthetic parameters were used to calculate leaf intrinsic water use efficiency wuei and leaf photosynthetic efficiency pue and the calculation formulas are as follows zhang et al 2018 1 wuei pn tr 2 pue pn par 2 3 3 chlorophyll relative content spad the chlorophyll relative contents of the apple and soybean leaves were recorded with a hand held dual wavelength chlorophyll meter spad 502 minolta camera co ltd japan during the podding and filling stages the leaves and dates of measurement were same as those used for the photosynthetic parameter measurements the spad of a leaf was the mean value of upper middle and lower positions in the leaf and measurements were made avoiding major veins 2 3 4 growth indices and yield measurement during the filling stage of the soybean the height of the labeled soybean plants was measured with a tape measure the length width coefficient method was used to measure the leaf area of the soybean and the leaf area per unit land area was taken as the leaf area index lai wang et al 2014 three new branches were chosen per apple tree and their lengths measured with a tape measure the grain yield of the soybean was measured in the plots after maturation 2 4 data processing the formula for calculating the comprehensive score of each treatment by using principal component analysis pca is as follows 3 y a y 1 b y 2 where y is the comprehensive score of each treatment using pca involving soybean yield pn of soybean and apple soybean plant height and lai and apple new branch length two principal components were selected because the first and second principal components pc1 and pc2 can explained more than 80 variability y 1 and y 2 were the scores of the pc1 and pc2 of each treatment the a and b were the weight of the variance contribution rate of the pc1 and pc2 to the cumulative variance contribution rate of the extracted principal component 2 5 statistical analyses spss ver 20 0 spss inc chicago il usa was used to analyze the variance anova for the data the least significant difference lsd was used to detect the differences among photosynthetic parameters growth indices and yield of all treatments at the p 0 05 significance level the univariate general linear model was used to explore the effects of the year mulch irrigation mulch irrigation interaction and year mulch irrigation interaction on the variation of photosynthetic parameters and growth indices 3 results 3 1 the daily variations of photosynthetic parameters 3 1 1 apple the photosynthetic parameters of the apple leaves were mean values measured for the four irrigation levels at the fruit expansion and maturity stages as shown in fig 4 the daily variations in pn and tr of the apple leaves generally presented as unimodal curves in 2017 2019 with the highest value of pn appearing at 11 00 h whereas the highest value of tr appeared at 13 00 h however the pn in the ck treatment showed a bimodal curve in 2019 and the pn was slightly higher at 15 00 h than at 13 00 h in the 3 year experiment the pn under the m2 treatment was generally higher than under the m1 treatment and both of them were higher than that under the ck treatment the tr followed a similar pattern to the pn but the tr under the ck treatment was 5 6 higher than under the m1 treatment in 2019 the wuei and pue of the apple leaves showed similar v shaped curves under all treatments throughout the experiment period with the maximum and minimum values appearing at 9 00 and 13 00 h respectively in 2018 the wuei under the ck treatment was greater than under the m1 and m2 treatments but the opposite trends were observed in 2019 the trends in pue under the m1 and m2 treatments were very similar and greater than that under the ck treatment 3 1 2 soybean the photosynthetic parameters of the soybean leaves were mean values for the four irrigation levels at the podding and filling stages as shown in fig 5 the daily variations in the pn of soybean leaves generally displayed a unimodal curve with the maximum value at 11 00 h however under the m1 and ck treatments the pn displayed a bimodal curve with additional peaks at 15 00 h in 2019 the m2 treatment generally had the highest pn whereas the ck treatment had the lowest pn this phenomenon was particularly obvious in 2019 and the pn was 21 3 and 55 4 higher under the m2 treatment than under the m1 and ck treatments respectively the daily variations in tr were similar to those of pn and the maximum value of tr was observed at 13 00 h however the maximum tr under the ck treatment appeared at 11 00 h in 2019 earlier than under the combined treatment with mulch and irrigation in 2017 2018 the tr were 10 4 and 19 9 under the m2 treatment higher than under the m1 treatment whereas the tr of the m1 treatment was 12 8 higher than that of the m2 treatment in 2019 in general the pn and tr of soybean were larger than those of apple in 2017 2018 but decreased significantly and were smaller than those of apple in 2019 the wuei and pue of soybean leaves displayed approximately v shaped curves and the minimum values generally occurred at 13 00 h the wuei under the m1 treatment was generally greater than under the m2 treatment in 2017 2018 however the wuei under the m2 treatment was much higher than under the m1 treatment in 2019 the pue showed consistent results throughout the experiment and was maximum under the m2 treatment followed by the m1 treatment 3 2 the daily mean of photosynthetic parameters 3 2 1 apple the daily mean photosynthetic parameters of the apple and soybean leaves measured in the podding and filling stages are shown in table 2 mulch and irrigation combined produced significant increases in the daily mean pn and tr of apple leaves at the same irrigation level the daily mean values of pn tr and pue in apple leaves under the m2 treatment were generally significantly higher than under the m1 treatment in 2018 2019 the daily mean wuei was greater under the m1 treatment than under the m2 treatment in 2017 2018 but showed the opposite result in 2019 the daily mean pn under the m1 treatment correlated positively with the amount of irrigation during 2018 2019 the daily mean pn under the m2 treatment increased first and then decreased with the amount of irrigation in 2017 2018 but increased as the amount of irrigation increased in 2019 the daily mean tr and pue increased as the amount of irrigation increased in 2017 2018 the daily mean wuei correlated negatively with the amount of irrigation but the daily mean wuei of apple increased at first and then decreased as the amount of irrigation increased in 2019 the year mulch and irrigation had significant effects on pn tr wuei and pue of apple leaves throughout the experiment p 0 01 but the mulch irrigation interaction had no significant impact on pn p 0 05 3 2 2 soybean the combination of mulch and irrigation improved the photosynthesis of soybean leaves in the intercropping system the daily mean pn of soybean leaves was 8 07 27 83 1 91 26 45 and 9 45 73 21 higher when treated with mulch and irrigation than under the ck treatment during 2017 2019 respectively table 2 under the same level of irrigation the daily mean pn under the m2 treatment was significantly higher than under the m1 treatment indicating that photosynthesis was better promoted by plastic mulch than straw mulch the daily mean pn under the m1 treatment increased as the amount of irrigation increased while the correlation between pn and the amount of irrigation under the m2 treatment was the same as that of apple the daily mean tr and pue of the two types mulch treatment increased with the amount of irrigation increased in 2017 2018 the daily mean wuei under the m1 treatment was higher than under the m2 treatment and correlated negatively with the amount of irrigation however the daily mean wuei under the m2 treatment was significantly higher than under the m1 treatment in 2019 and there was no significant difference in the daily mean wuei among the different irrigation treatments during the whole experimental period the year mulch and irrigation had extremely significant effects on pn tr wuei and pue of soybean leaves p 0 01 but the mulch irrigation interaction had no significant impact on pn wuei and pue p 0 05 3 3 interspecific interactions of intercropping system the regression coefficients for pn tr wuei and pue in soybean leaves with distance from the trees were used to indicate the effects of the interactions of the intercropping system on soybean photosynthesis gao et al 2013 the higher absolute value of the regression coefficient indicated that the greater effect of the apple trees on soybean leaves photosynthesis in 2017 the regression coefficients for the four photosynthetic parameters of soybean leaves were generally not significant p 0 05 whereas in 2018 2019 the regression coefficients increased rapidly and were generally significant p 0 05 table 3 this showed that the effects of the apple trees on the photosynthesis of soybean leaves increased as the number of intercropping years increased the signs of the regression coefficients indicated that soybean pn tr and wuei increased with the distance from the trees whereas pue decreased with the distance from the tree in 2018 the regression coefficients for pn and tr under the m1 treatment were slightly higher than under the m2 treatment and the pn regression coefficients were greater under the combined mulch and irrigation treatments than under the ck treatment indicating that the combination of mulch and irrigation increased the adverse effect of the interspecific interaction on pn and the effect under straw mulch was greater than under plastic mulch in the dry year of 2019 the regression coefficients for pn tr and pue were generally correlated negatively with the amount of irrigation but these phenomena were not obvious in 2017 2018 these results indicated that increasing the amount of irrigation promoted pn tr and pue of soybean near tree rows more than in the middle rows during dry years 3 4 growth indices and yield the year mulch irrigation and their interactions had extremely significant effects on soybean height lai and yield and apple new branch length p 0 01 in fig 6 the two mulch treatments effectively improved the growth indices and yields of soybean and these improvements were particularly obvious for plastic mulch at a given level of irrigation the plant height lai and yield of the soybean and the new branch lengths of the apple under the m2 treatment were significantly greater than under the m1 treatment in 2017 2019 the apple new branch lengths and soybean yields under the m2 treatment were 28 80 42 22 and 16 22 34 05 higher than those under the m1 treatment respectively the soybean height under the m1 treatment initially increased and then decreased as the amount of irrigation increased in 2017 2018 whereas the variation under the m2 treatment did not differ significantly among different amounts of irrigation in 2018 however the soybean height under the two mulch treatments increased as the amount of irrigation increased in 2019 in 2017 2018 the maximum soybean yield under the two types of mulch occurred at the w2 irrigation level whereas in 2019 it was achieved at the w3 irrigation level there was a positive correlation between the soybean lai and the amount of irrigation and the maximum treatment for soybean lai was m2w3 throughout the whole trial the apple new branch lengths increased under the m1 treatment as the amount of irrigation increased however in 2017 and 2019 the corresponding values under the m2 treatment increased first and then decreased as the amount of irrigation increased and the maximum values were observed under the m2w2 treatment mulch and irrigation had no significant effect on spad of either apple and soybean and there was no significant difference in the spad values for apple and soybean p 0 05 3 5 comprehensive benefit analysis six indices soybean yield pn of soybean and apple soybean height soybean lai and the apple new branch length were examined to reflect the effects of mulch and irrigation on the comprehensive benefits of the apple soybean intercropping system with pca as shown in fig 7 pc1 and pc2 explained 48 39 and 32 04 80 18 and 9 14 and 81 64 and 12 38 of the total variation in 2017 2019 respectively with cumulative explanatory contribution rates of more than 80 therefore two principal components were used as comprehensive variables to evaluate the benefits of the apple soybean intercropping system the loads of soybean height and apple new branch lengths were not significant in pc1 in 2017 but all six indices were all closely related to pc1 in 2018 2019 it can be seen from the comprehensive scores for each treatment that the comprehensive benefits of the apple soybean intercropping system under the m2 treatment were generally better than under the m1 treatment with the same irrigation conditions table 4 under the same mulch the comprehensive benefit of the intercropping system first increased and then decreased as the amount of irrigation increased in 2017 2018 but the comprehensive score correlated positively with the amount of irrigation in 2019 the highest comprehensive score for the combination of mulch and irrigation in the apple soybean intercropping system was m2w2 treatment in 2017 2018 whereas it was m2w3 treatment in 2019 4 discussion 4 1 effects of mulch and irrigation regimes on photosynthetic parameters water is one of the raw materials required for plant photosynthesis the control and regulation of soil water in intercropping systems is an effective method to improve the interspecific relationship and enhance the photosynthetic performance and productivity of the whole system li et al 2016 trail et al 2016 baghdadi et al 2021 in this study the photosynthesis of the apple soybean intercropping system was analyzed under the combined measures of mulch and irrigation in two growth stages with critical water demand we found that the daily variations in the pn and tr of the apple and soybean leaves showed unimodal curves without photosynthetic siesta phenomenon figs 4 and 5 however zhou et al 2019 found that the daily variations in the apple pn in an apple maize intercropping system under coupled water and fertilizer supplementation displayed a bimodal curve the reason for this discrepancy may be that mulch was used in the present study to reduce the effective evaporation of soil water yin et al 2018 meanwhile the water input precipitation and irrigation into the intercropping system was relatively high during the podding and filling stages in 2017 2018 and the soil water contents met the normal physiological needs of the apple leaves thus avoiding the photosynthetic siesta phenomenon the sparse precipitation and intense interspecific competition resulted in a shortage of soil water during the podding and filling stages in 2019 especially under the ck treatment no water conservation measures therefore different degrees of the photosynthetic siesta phenomenon were observed in the apple and soybean under the ck treatment at 13 00 h with the strongest radiation due to the impermeable physical barrier of polyethylene plastic film and its ability to reduce soil heat from spreading to the air in the form of long wave radiation plastic mulch had a better effect on increasing temperature and preserving moisture than straw mulch qin et al 2015 yu et al 2018 the more available water and suitable soil temperature which enhanced the physiological activities of the plants under the m2 treatment resulted in the higher pn and tr of apple and soybean under the m2 treatment than under the m1 treatment compared with straw mulch the plastic mulch showed better promoted the photosynthesis of apple and soybean however the tr was smaller under the m2 treatment than under the m1 treatment at the same level of irrigation in 2019 table 2 there were two main reasons for this abnormal phenomenon first the plastic mulch hindered the contact and infiltration of the partial precipitation into the soil especially in dry years second the soybean lai under the m2 treatment was significantly higher than under the m1 treatment fig 6 and plants with large lai had an obvious shade effect which led to a relatively low surface temperature of the leaves so water transpiration was reduced increased soil water was beneficial in increasing the pn of crops and this phenomenon was also confirmed in the pn values of apple and soybean under the m1 treatment however the maximum pn values for both apple and soybean under the m2 treatment was achieved at the w2 level in 2017 2018 excessive irrigation significantly increased the root biomass of apple and soybean and excessive irrigation intensified the interspecific competition for water zheng et al 2021 the pn of soybean decreased under the m2w3 treatment in response to the increased competition for resources and the increased shading intensity during the 3 year experiment the pue of the apple and soybean increased as the amount of irrigation increased table 2 indicating that appropriate water regulation measures can improve the productivity of an intercropping system by optimizing the physiological indices of the crop which increased the efficient utilization of light and heat resources in the intercropping system 4 2 effects of mulch and irrigation regimes on light competition and complementary the trees and crops in agroforestry systems have competitive and complementary effects on the sunlight above ground and the water resources below ground bouttier et al 2014 bayala and prieto 2019 wu et al 2020 therefore there are strong biological and physical interactions among the component plants of agroforestry systems bellow and nair 2003 qiao et al 2019 the regression coefficients for four photosynthetic indices and the distance from apple trees were used to evaluate the effects of interspecific interactions on the soybean photosynthetic indices in 2017 because the distribution ranges of the apple tree canopies and roots were small their influence on the aboveground and underground components of the soybean were limited thus the regression coefficients between the soybean photosynthetic indices and the distance from the apple trees were not significant table 3 in 2018 2019 the regression coefficients between the soybean pn and the distance from the apple trees were significant and positive indicating that the inhibitory effect of apple trees on the soybean photosynthetic rate weakened as the distance from the apple trees increased however zhou et al 2019 observed the opposite phenomenon insofar as the pn of maize decreased as its distance from the apple trees increased in an apple maize intercropping system the reason for this discrepancy was that maize is a long stalked crop and young apple trees had little shade effect on maize while the competition of maize leaves for sunlight was more serious better water and light conditions near the rows of trees resulted in less interspecific competition than intraspecies competition so the pn of maize was higher near the tree rows the regression coefficients for tr and wuei of soybean were similar to those for pn understory crops adapt to shade by changing the morphological characteristics and biochemical conditions of their leaves to enhance photosynthesis evans and poorter 2001 gagliardi et al 2015 franco et al 2018 shade also increases the proportion of diffuse light available to the crop leaves which is more conducive to photosynthesis than direct light alton et al 2007 zhang et al 2018 therefore the increased proportion of diffuse light and the changes in the morphological and biochemical characteristics of the soybean leaves led to the higher soybean pue under shade and it decreased with increasing distance from the trees because the water retention characteristics of plastic mulch were better than those of straw mulch more soil water was available to soybean under the m2 treatment than under the m1 treatment so the degree of niche separation in the underground apple and soybean roots under the plastic mulch was greater than under the straw mulch zheng et al 2021 this alleviated the water competition between the apple trees and soybean to a certain extent so the regression coefficients between pn or tr and the distance from the apple trees were slightly smaller under the m2 treatment than under the m1 treatment in 2018 the combination of mulch and irrigation increased the available soil water in normal years and the limitation of soil water stress on the photosynthesis of soybean adjacent to tree rows was greatly reduced unlike the ck treatment the main limiting factor in soybean adjacent to tree rows was shade so that the pn of soybean under shade was much lower than that in the middle rows therefore the pn regression coefficient for the combination of mulch and irrigation was greater than that for the ck treatment however water was the main competitive resource for apple and soybean in the intercropping system in the dry year 2019 and increased irrigation was a direct and effective way to alleviate this competition therefore the regression coefficients between the soybean pn and tr and the distance from the apple trees decreased as the amount of irrigation increased in this study we analyzed the interspecific interaction of apple soybean intercropping system by regression coefficient between soybean photosynthetic parameters and distance from the trees however the synergistic mechanisms of photosynthesis between apple and soybean under different mulch and irrigation regimes are not fully understood therefore much work needs to be done in further research such as additional measurement of photosynthetic and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters for the complex intercropping system 4 3 effects of mulch and irrigation regimes on growth indices and yield photosynthesis is an important process in the production of dry matter and about 90 of dry matter is formed by photosynthesis gaju et al 2016 li et al 2019 therefore the growth indices of apple tree and soybean were basically consistent with the changes in leaf pn although there was no significant difference in the spad of the apple and soybean leaves under each treatment the pn and lai values of the apple and soybean under the m2 treatment were higher than under the m1 treatment table 2 and fig 6 so the apple new branch lengths and the soybean yields under plastic mulch were significantly greater than under straw mulch this is an important reason why the comprehensive benefits of the m2 treatment were greater than those of the m1 treatment in 2017 2018 the yields of soybean first increased and then decreased as the amount of irrigation increased this was because although moderate irrigation promoted the production and accumulation of soybean dry matter excess water was not conducive to the migration of photosynthetic substances from vegetative organs to reproductive organs thus reducing both the yield and water use efficiency liu et al 2016 el shirbeny et al 2020 as a result the maximum yield of soybean under the two mulch treatments appeared at the w2 irrigation level in 2017 2018 the water demand of apple trees increased year by year and during the serious shortage of precipitation in 2019 the intense competition for water between the apple and soybean led to serious water stress on the soybean water shortage reduced the stomatal conductance and availability of co2 in the palisade tissues of crop leaves which reduced photosynthesis and the efficiency of light utilization zhou et al 2016 increased irrigation can enhance photosynthesis and dry matter accumulation in soybean so there was a positive correlation between soybean yield and the amount of irrigation in 2019 these reasons also explained why the comprehensive benefits of the apple soybean intercropping system reached maximum at the w2 irrigation level in 2017 2018 but reached maximum at the w3 irrigation level in 2019 in conclusion in normal years plastic mulch combined with 70 fc maximum irrigation was most suitable for a 5 7 year old apple soybean intercropping system in this region whereas in dry years the maximum irrigation should be increased to 85 fc 5 conclusions three years of field experiments showed that mulch and irrigation had significant effects on the pn tr wuei and pue of the apple and soybean in an intercropping system mulch and irrigation regimes improved the photosynthetic characteristics of apple soybean intercropping system and alleviated the competition between those species for light resources compared with straw mulch plastic mulch more effectively increased the pn tr and pue of apple and soybean the maximum values for pn and pue in both apple and soybean were observed under the m2w2 and m2w3 treatments in normal and dry years respectively mulch and irrigation regimes effectively increased the apple branch growth and soybean plant height lai and yield but excessive irrigation was detrimental to the accumulation of dry matter in soybean grain in normal years therefore superabundant irrigation should not be applied in normal years whereas irrigation should be increased in dry years plastic mulch was more conducive to the growth of crops because it better retained soil moisture and heat therefore to improve the overall benefits of a 5 7 year old apple soybean intercropping system and alleviate the interspecific competition for resources in the loess plateau of western shanxi we suggest that plastic mulch be combined with 70 fc maximum irrigation in normal years and that irrigation should be increased to 85 fc in dry years declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

9564,the shortage of and intense competition for water and light are the main factors restricting the productivity of agroforestry systems in the loess plateau of western shanxi china the combination of soil mulch and irrigation in agroforestry systems can regulate the interspecific relationships and increase the productivity of the component crops however the effects of mulch and irrigation regimes on the photosynthetic physiological characteristics of the agroforestry system and its synergistic mechanisms are still unclear a 3 year experiment with two factors mulch and irrigation was conducted to investigate the effects of different mulch practices and irrigation levels on the photosynthetic characteristics growth indices and interspecific relationships of a fruit tree crop intercropping system an apple soybean intercropping system was selected as the research object and two mulch types straw mulch m1 and plastic mulch m2 and four maximum irrigation levels no irrigation w0 55 w1 70 w2 and 85 w3 field capacity fc were tested no mulch together with no irrigation was the control treatment ck the results showed that there was no photosynthetic siesta phenomenon in the intercropping system and the daily variations of the net photosynthetic rate pn and transpiration rate tr were unimodal the mean values for pn tr and leaf photosynthetic efficiency pue of the apple and soybean under the m2 treatment were generally higher than under the m1 treatment whereas tr and pue increased as the amount of irrigation increased in 2017 2018 the maximum mean pn values for both apple and soybean were observed under the m2w2 treatment whereas in 2019 they were observed under the m2w3 treatment the pn tr and leaf intrinsic water use efficiency wuei of soybean correlated positively with the distance from the trees whereas pue correlated negatively with it mulch and water replenishment increased apple shoot growth and the height leaf area index and yield of soybean especially under plastic mulch a principal components analysis found that the m2w2 treatment had the highest comprehensive benefits in 2017 2018 whereas in 2019 the highest were achieved with the m2w3 treatment therefore to optimize the photosynthetic efficiency and yield of the apple soybean intercropping system in the loess region of western shanxi we suggest a combination of plastic mulch and maximum irrigation of 70 fc in normal years but maximum irrigation should be increased to 85 fc in dry years keywords agroforestry mulch irrigation photosynthesis loess plateau 1 introduction agroforestry is a traditional and widely used method of land management in which perennial woody plants are purposefully planted on the same land as agricultural crops to achieve a variety of ecological and economic benefits lorenz and lal 2014 ehret et al 2015 pavlidis and tsihrintzis 2017 bado et al 2021 the apple malus pumila m is an important economic tree species in the loess region of western shanxi province china and young apple trees are suitable for interplanting with crops because the crown width is small and they demand little water or fertilizer apple and soybean glycine max l merr are a common combination in agroforestry systems in this region and their combination makes better use of water light and nutrient resources and improves land use efficiency than either crop alone peng et al 2009 yun et al 2012 sun et al 2018 however due to unevenly distributed and insufficient precipitation during the crop co growth period in the loess region of western shanxi province coupled with the large amount of soil water evaporation guo et al 2021 the competition for water between the fruit trees and understory crops in the critical growth period is fierce these factors together cause water stress which severely restricts the growth and development of the intercropped plants ling et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 and ultimately negatively affects the production benefits and economic benefits for farmers to alleviate this adverse effect water conservation and replenishment measures must be taken during the critical period of water deficit in the apple soybean intercropping system irrigation can directly moisten the root area of the crops to meet their water demand during the peak growth period of the apple soybean intercropping system tworkoski and glenn 2008 li et al 2017 however the high wind speed and solar radiation in the region promote the rapid evaporation of soil water leading to the waste of limited irrigation water and low water use efficiency therefore this system must be supplemented with additional irrigation based water retention measures to reduce water loss straw mulch and film mulch are the two most commonly used ground mulch measures and can reduce soil evaporation by providing an interface barrier improving the efficiency of soil water use while adjusting the soil temperature to promote plant growth cook et al 2006 yu et al 2018 vincent caboud et al 2019 in previous research we examined the interaction between roots and water in this intercropping system under different mulches and irrigation practices zheng et al 2021 we found that mulch and irrigation not only significantly promoted the root growth of both apple and soybean but also reduced their competition for underground resources this interaction between the underground parts of both species affected the growth of the aboveground parts thus affecting the benefit conferred upon the entire intercropping system the aboveground biomass of the intercropping system correlated positively with the length of the underground roots xia et al 2013 the study of an irrigated jujube wheat intercropping system zhang et al 2017 showed that the aboveground biomass and yield of the two intergrown crops were lower than those of corresponding monocultures because underground competition mutually inhibited the growth of the root systems of the component crops there are strongly positive and negative interactions in agroforestry systems sanchez 1995 and the addition of mulch and irrigation will make the interaction of aboveground parts in an agroforestry system even more complex however the interactions between the aboveground parts of agroforestry systems under conditions of mulch and irrigation are still unclear photosynthesis is the basis for the formation of the dry matter in plants and water is an important raw material of plant photosynthesis gaju et al 2016 so photosynthesis effectively reflects the responses of plants to different soil water conditions previous studies have shown that increasing the soil water content positively affected the photosynthetic performance of crops and was an important way to improve crop yields and water use efficiency in water deficient areas lamptey et al 2020 however the allocation of soil water in intercropping systems is the result of dynamic interactions between the plant roots and canopies and between the intercropping plants and the environment yin et al 2020 the allocation of soil water in intercropping systems is more complex than in monocropping systems especially when combined with soil mulch and irrigation moreover due to trees shade and changes in the photosynthetic characteristics of the understory crop the responses of the plants photosynthesis to water become very complex querné et al 2017 franco et al 2018 the photosynthesis of the component crops in an intercropping system is an important manifestation of the competition and complementary for aboveground resources wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 studied intercropping systems involving apricot trees planted with different crops and found that tree shade reduced the photosynthesis of the understory crops but the crops responded to shading by changing the economic traits of their leaves to increase light capture and the efficiency of light utilization the photosynthetic response of intercropping plants to the regulation of soil water is the key to disentangle the synergistic mechanisms of intercropping systems based on water retention and replenishment although zhou et al 2019 studied the response of the photosynthetic characteristics of the aboveground parts in an apple maize intercropping system under irrigation control after the introduction mulch as another variable both the root biomass and soil available water of the underground part increased and such changes fed back to the resource competition of the aboveground parts however our understanding of the interactions and mechanisms of the aboveground parts of plants under such combined measures is still incomplete therefore the main objectives of this study were 1 to analyze the effects of mulch and irrigation regimes on the photosynthesis and growth of apple and soybean plants in an intercropping system and 2 to optimize the management of the apple soybean intercropping system under mulch and irrigation regimes these data are essential for improving the benefits of the apple soybean intercropping system and provide a theoretical basis for optimizing the water regulation of intercropping systems in the loess plateau of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the study site was located in forest ecosystem studies national observation and research station jixian shanxi china 36 01 n 110 45 e which is located at the southern end of lvliang mountain and is a typical gully region of the loess plateau fig 1 it has a warm temperate continental climate with sufficient sunshine and the diurnal temperature range is large the annual average precipitation is 576 mm and more than 90 of the precipitation occurs in april october in this area the average annual potential evaporation is 1729 mm the average annual hours of sunshine is 2563 8 h the average annual temperature is 9 9 c and the accumulated temperature 10 c is 3358 c the precipitation during the growth period in 2017 2019 was 427 6 mm 398 0 mm and 326 3 mm respectively fig 2 according to the standard developed by shanxi institute of meteorological science 2017 and 2018 were normal years and 2019 was a dry year the soil type in the test orchard is cinnamon soil and the soil layer is deep and uniform the soil properties of 0 60 cm soil layer were as follows average field capacity fc 22 14 bulk density 1 38 g cm 3 ph 7 9 soil organic matter content 9 47 g kg 1 total nitrogen content 0 62 g kg 1 ammonium nitrogen content 0 62 mg kg 1 nitrate nitrogen content 5 91 mg kg 1 available potassium content 77 86 mg kg 1 and available phosphorus content 4 53 mg kg 1 2 2 experimental design the 3 year experiment was conducted in 2017 2019 in maziqu ji county shanxi province which is tableland of gully region at an altitude of 1150 m an apple soybean intercropping system was chosen as the research object since both apple and soybean are economic crops in the region the apple trees short branch red fuji were 5 year old in 2017 with an average height and crown diameter of 3 9 m and 3 4 m respectively the distance between two adjacent rows of tree was 5 m and the distance between trees within a row was 4 m because 5 7 year old apple trees produce only small amounts of low quality and low price fruit all flowers were removed throughout the trial to better ensure vegetative growth there were two apple trees in each test plot which was surrounded by ridges and covered an area of 14 m2 the soybean jindou no 35 were sown on april 12 in 2017 april 19 in 2018 and april 22 in 2019 the spacing of the soybean was 0 30 m 0 40 m and the distance between a tree row and the adjacent row of soybean was 0 9 m in 2017 to reduce the shade effect caused by the increasing canopy width the distance between from the border soybean row and tree row was changed to 1 m and the spacing of soybean was changed to 0 35 m 0 50 m in 2018 2019 fig 3 the base fertilizer consist of urea n 412 4 kg ha 1 calcium superphosphate p2o5 168 8 kg ha 1 and potassium sulfate k2o 168 8 kg ha 1 which was evenly applied before plowing a random block design of two factors soil mulch and irrigation was used in the experiment a total of eight combinations of mulch and irrigation treatments were set in the trial and the control treatment ck was set without mulch and irrigation each treatment was performed in three replicates with a total of 27 plots the soil was mulched with straw mulch m1 or plastic mulch m2 a 5 cm thick layer of straw mulch containing maize fragments of 5 10 cm in length was laid between the crop rows after the emergence of the soybean seedlings alternatively white plastic film with a thickness of 0 005 mm was placed over the ground before the soybean was sown two rows of soybean were planted in one plastic film belt with 60 cm and 70 cm width in 2017 and 2018 2019 respectively the four maximum irrigation levels were rain fed and no irrigation w0 55 w1 70 w2 and 85 w3 of the field capacity fc in the soil layer at 0 60 cm the depth of the planned wet layer was 60 cm since most of the fine roots in the young apple soybean intercropping system were distributed in that soil layer sun et al 2018 because the three main growth stages of apple tree fruit formation fruit expansion and maturity and soybean branching podding and filling basically coincide and the apple trees did not fruit during the whole experiment the growth stages of the intercropped soybean were taken as references irrigation was carried out when there was no effective rainfall for more than one week in the branching podding and filling stages all the irrigation events were performed after 16 00 h to avoid the period of maximum temperature and radiation during the critical stages of water demand in the soybean however no irrigation was applied during the podding stage in 2018 because there was sufficient precipitation the soil water content was measured in each treatment plot before irrigation and the irrigation quota was determined based on the difference between the measured soil water content and the target value sidika et al 2012 border irrigation was used to supply the water and the amount of irrigation was controlled with a water meter the time and quota of irrigation for each treatment are shown in table 1 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 soil water content measurement time domain reflectometry tdr probes trime pico iph imko ettlingen germany were used to measure the soil water content before irrigation at observation points set 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 m from the tree row at soil depths of 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 50 and 50 60 cm 2 3 2 photosynthetic parameters the net photosynthesis rates pn µmol m 2s 1 and transpiration rates tr mmol m 2s 1 of the apple and soybean leaves were measured with a portable photosynthetic system li 6400 li cor inc lincoln ne usa in clear and cloudless weather during the podding and filling stages jul 21 and aug 31 2017 jul 20 and sep 1 2018 and aug 5 and aug 29 2019 the photosynthetically active radiation par µmol m 2s 1 at this location was recorded at the same time measurements were made once every 2 h between 9 00 and 17 00 h typical standard new apple branches were selected and labeled at a vertical height of 1 5 2 0 m on the sunny side of each tree three healthy leaves were selected to measure the photosynthetic parameters and the leaf veins were avoided during measurements three soybean plants located 0 9 1 7 and 2 5 m from the trees in 2017 and 1 0 1 5 and 2 5 m from the trees in 2018 2019 were selected and labeled three middle leaves from the upper triple compound leaves of each tagged soybean plant were selected for measurement the measured photosynthetic parameters were used to calculate leaf intrinsic water use efficiency wuei and leaf photosynthetic efficiency pue and the calculation formulas are as follows zhang et al 2018 1 wuei pn tr 2 pue pn par 2 3 3 chlorophyll relative content spad the chlorophyll relative contents of the apple and soybean leaves were recorded with a hand held dual wavelength chlorophyll meter spad 502 minolta camera co ltd japan during the podding and filling stages the leaves and dates of measurement were same as those used for the photosynthetic parameter measurements the spad of a leaf was the mean value of upper middle and lower positions in the leaf and measurements were made avoiding major veins 2 3 4 growth indices and yield measurement during the filling stage of the soybean the height of the labeled soybean plants was measured with a tape measure the length width coefficient method was used to measure the leaf area of the soybean and the leaf area per unit land area was taken as the leaf area index lai wang et al 2014 three new branches were chosen per apple tree and their lengths measured with a tape measure the grain yield of the soybean was measured in the plots after maturation 2 4 data processing the formula for calculating the comprehensive score of each treatment by using principal component analysis pca is as follows 3 y a y 1 b y 2 where y is the comprehensive score of each treatment using pca involving soybean yield pn of soybean and apple soybean plant height and lai and apple new branch length two principal components were selected because the first and second principal components pc1 and pc2 can explained more than 80 variability y 1 and y 2 were the scores of the pc1 and pc2 of each treatment the a and b were the weight of the variance contribution rate of the pc1 and pc2 to the cumulative variance contribution rate of the extracted principal component 2 5 statistical analyses spss ver 20 0 spss inc chicago il usa was used to analyze the variance anova for the data the least significant difference lsd was used to detect the differences among photosynthetic parameters growth indices and yield of all treatments at the p 0 05 significance level the univariate general linear model was used to explore the effects of the year mulch irrigation mulch irrigation interaction and year mulch irrigation interaction on the variation of photosynthetic parameters and growth indices 3 results 3 1 the daily variations of photosynthetic parameters 3 1 1 apple the photosynthetic parameters of the apple leaves were mean values measured for the four irrigation levels at the fruit expansion and maturity stages as shown in fig 4 the daily variations in pn and tr of the apple leaves generally presented as unimodal curves in 2017 2019 with the highest value of pn appearing at 11 00 h whereas the highest value of tr appeared at 13 00 h however the pn in the ck treatment showed a bimodal curve in 2019 and the pn was slightly higher at 15 00 h than at 13 00 h in the 3 year experiment the pn under the m2 treatment was generally higher than under the m1 treatment and both of them were higher than that under the ck treatment the tr followed a similar pattern to the pn but the tr under the ck treatment was 5 6 higher than under the m1 treatment in 2019 the wuei and pue of the apple leaves showed similar v shaped curves under all treatments throughout the experiment period with the maximum and minimum values appearing at 9 00 and 13 00 h respectively in 2018 the wuei under the ck treatment was greater than under the m1 and m2 treatments but the opposite trends were observed in 2019 the trends in pue under the m1 and m2 treatments were very similar and greater than that under the ck treatment 3 1 2 soybean the photosynthetic parameters of the soybean leaves were mean values for the four irrigation levels at the podding and filling stages as shown in fig 5 the daily variations in the pn of soybean leaves generally displayed a unimodal curve with the maximum value at 11 00 h however under the m1 and ck treatments the pn displayed a bimodal curve with additional peaks at 15 00 h in 2019 the m2 treatment generally had the highest pn whereas the ck treatment had the lowest pn this phenomenon was particularly obvious in 2019 and the pn was 21 3 and 55 4 higher under the m2 treatment than under the m1 and ck treatments respectively the daily variations in tr were similar to those of pn and the maximum value of tr was observed at 13 00 h however the maximum tr under the ck treatment appeared at 11 00 h in 2019 earlier than under the combined treatment with mulch and irrigation in 2017 2018 the tr were 10 4 and 19 9 under the m2 treatment higher than under the m1 treatment whereas the tr of the m1 treatment was 12 8 higher than that of the m2 treatment in 2019 in general the pn and tr of soybean were larger than those of apple in 2017 2018 but decreased significantly and were smaller than those of apple in 2019 the wuei and pue of soybean leaves displayed approximately v shaped curves and the minimum values generally occurred at 13 00 h the wuei under the m1 treatment was generally greater than under the m2 treatment in 2017 2018 however the wuei under the m2 treatment was much higher than under the m1 treatment in 2019 the pue showed consistent results throughout the experiment and was maximum under the m2 treatment followed by the m1 treatment 3 2 the daily mean of photosynthetic parameters 3 2 1 apple the daily mean photosynthetic parameters of the apple and soybean leaves measured in the podding and filling stages are shown in table 2 mulch and irrigation combined produced significant increases in the daily mean pn and tr of apple leaves at the same irrigation level the daily mean values of pn tr and pue in apple leaves under the m2 treatment were generally significantly higher than under the m1 treatment in 2018 2019 the daily mean wuei was greater under the m1 treatment than under the m2 treatment in 2017 2018 but showed the opposite result in 2019 the daily mean pn under the m1 treatment correlated positively with the amount of irrigation during 2018 2019 the daily mean pn under the m2 treatment increased first and then decreased with the amount of irrigation in 2017 2018 but increased as the amount of irrigation increased in 2019 the daily mean tr and pue increased as the amount of irrigation increased in 2017 2018 the daily mean wuei correlated negatively with the amount of irrigation but the daily mean wuei of apple increased at first and then decreased as the amount of irrigation increased in 2019 the year mulch and irrigation had significant effects on pn tr wuei and pue of apple leaves throughout the experiment p 0 01 but the mulch irrigation interaction had no significant impact on pn p 0 05 3 2 2 soybean the combination of mulch and irrigation improved the photosynthesis of soybean leaves in the intercropping system the daily mean pn of soybean leaves was 8 07 27 83 1 91 26 45 and 9 45 73 21 higher when treated with mulch and irrigation than under the ck treatment during 2017 2019 respectively table 2 under the same level of irrigation the daily mean pn under the m2 treatment was significantly higher than under the m1 treatment indicating that photosynthesis was better promoted by plastic mulch than straw mulch the daily mean pn under the m1 treatment increased as the amount of irrigation increased while the correlation between pn and the amount of irrigation under the m2 treatment was the same as that of apple the daily mean tr and pue of the two types mulch treatment increased with the amount of irrigation increased in 2017 2018 the daily mean wuei under the m1 treatment was higher than under the m2 treatment and correlated negatively with the amount of irrigation however the daily mean wuei under the m2 treatment was significantly higher than under the m1 treatment in 2019 and there was no significant difference in the daily mean wuei among the different irrigation treatments during the whole experimental period the year mulch and irrigation had extremely significant effects on pn tr wuei and pue of soybean leaves p 0 01 but the mulch irrigation interaction had no significant impact on pn wuei and pue p 0 05 3 3 interspecific interactions of intercropping system the regression coefficients for pn tr wuei and pue in soybean leaves with distance from the trees were used to indicate the effects of the interactions of the intercropping system on soybean photosynthesis gao et al 2013 the higher absolute value of the regression coefficient indicated that the greater effect of the apple trees on soybean leaves photosynthesis in 2017 the regression coefficients for the four photosynthetic parameters of soybean leaves were generally not significant p 0 05 whereas in 2018 2019 the regression coefficients increased rapidly and were generally significant p 0 05 table 3 this showed that the effects of the apple trees on the photosynthesis of soybean leaves increased as the number of intercropping years increased the signs of the regression coefficients indicated that soybean pn tr and wuei increased with the distance from the trees whereas pue decreased with the distance from the tree in 2018 the regression coefficients for pn and tr under the m1 treatment were slightly higher than under the m2 treatment and the pn regression coefficients were greater under the combined mulch and irrigation treatments than under the ck treatment indicating that the combination of mulch and irrigation increased the adverse effect of the interspecific interaction on pn and the effect under straw mulch was greater than under plastic mulch in the dry year of 2019 the regression coefficients for pn tr and pue were generally correlated negatively with the amount of irrigation but these phenomena were not obvious in 2017 2018 these results indicated that increasing the amount of irrigation promoted pn tr and pue of soybean near tree rows more than in the middle rows during dry years 3 4 growth indices and yield the year mulch irrigation and their interactions had extremely significant effects on soybean height lai and yield and apple new branch length p 0 01 in fig 6 the two mulch treatments effectively improved the growth indices and yields of soybean and these improvements were particularly obvious for plastic mulch at a given level of irrigation the plant height lai and yield of the soybean and the new branch lengths of the apple under the m2 treatment were significantly greater than under the m1 treatment in 2017 2019 the apple new branch lengths and soybean yields under the m2 treatment were 28 80 42 22 and 16 22 34 05 higher than those under the m1 treatment respectively the soybean height under the m1 treatment initially increased and then decreased as the amount of irrigation increased in 2017 2018 whereas the variation under the m2 treatment did not differ significantly among different amounts of irrigation in 2018 however the soybean height under the two mulch treatments increased as the amount of irrigation increased in 2019 in 2017 2018 the maximum soybean yield under the two types of mulch occurred at the w2 irrigation level whereas in 2019 it was achieved at the w3 irrigation level there was a positive correlation between the soybean lai and the amount of irrigation and the maximum treatment for soybean lai was m2w3 throughout the whole trial the apple new branch lengths increased under the m1 treatment as the amount of irrigation increased however in 2017 and 2019 the corresponding values under the m2 treatment increased first and then decreased as the amount of irrigation increased and the maximum values were observed under the m2w2 treatment mulch and irrigation had no significant effect on spad of either apple and soybean and there was no significant difference in the spad values for apple and soybean p 0 05 3 5 comprehensive benefit analysis six indices soybean yield pn of soybean and apple soybean height soybean lai and the apple new branch length were examined to reflect the effects of mulch and irrigation on the comprehensive benefits of the apple soybean intercropping system with pca as shown in fig 7 pc1 and pc2 explained 48 39 and 32 04 80 18 and 9 14 and 81 64 and 12 38 of the total variation in 2017 2019 respectively with cumulative explanatory contribution rates of more than 80 therefore two principal components were used as comprehensive variables to evaluate the benefits of the apple soybean intercropping system the loads of soybean height and apple new branch lengths were not significant in pc1 in 2017 but all six indices were all closely related to pc1 in 2018 2019 it can be seen from the comprehensive scores for each treatment that the comprehensive benefits of the apple soybean intercropping system under the m2 treatment were generally better than under the m1 treatment with the same irrigation conditions table 4 under the same mulch the comprehensive benefit of the intercropping system first increased and then decreased as the amount of irrigation increased in 2017 2018 but the comprehensive score correlated positively with the amount of irrigation in 2019 the highest comprehensive score for the combination of mulch and irrigation in the apple soybean intercropping system was m2w2 treatment in 2017 2018 whereas it was m2w3 treatment in 2019 4 discussion 4 1 effects of mulch and irrigation regimes on photosynthetic parameters water is one of the raw materials required for plant photosynthesis the control and regulation of soil water in intercropping systems is an effective method to improve the interspecific relationship and enhance the photosynthetic performance and productivity of the whole system li et al 2016 trail et al 2016 baghdadi et al 2021 in this study the photosynthesis of the apple soybean intercropping system was analyzed under the combined measures of mulch and irrigation in two growth stages with critical water demand we found that the daily variations in the pn and tr of the apple and soybean leaves showed unimodal curves without photosynthetic siesta phenomenon figs 4 and 5 however zhou et al 2019 found that the daily variations in the apple pn in an apple maize intercropping system under coupled water and fertilizer supplementation displayed a bimodal curve the reason for this discrepancy may be that mulch was used in the present study to reduce the effective evaporation of soil water yin et al 2018 meanwhile the water input precipitation and irrigation into the intercropping system was relatively high during the podding and filling stages in 2017 2018 and the soil water contents met the normal physiological needs of the apple leaves thus avoiding the photosynthetic siesta phenomenon the sparse precipitation and intense interspecific competition resulted in a shortage of soil water during the podding and filling stages in 2019 especially under the ck treatment no water conservation measures therefore different degrees of the photosynthetic siesta phenomenon were observed in the apple and soybean under the ck treatment at 13 00 h with the strongest radiation due to the impermeable physical barrier of polyethylene plastic film and its ability to reduce soil heat from spreading to the air in the form of long wave radiation plastic mulch had a better effect on increasing temperature and preserving moisture than straw mulch qin et al 2015 yu et al 2018 the more available water and suitable soil temperature which enhanced the physiological activities of the plants under the m2 treatment resulted in the higher pn and tr of apple and soybean under the m2 treatment than under the m1 treatment compared with straw mulch the plastic mulch showed better promoted the photosynthesis of apple and soybean however the tr was smaller under the m2 treatment than under the m1 treatment at the same level of irrigation in 2019 table 2 there were two main reasons for this abnormal phenomenon first the plastic mulch hindered the contact and infiltration of the partial precipitation into the soil especially in dry years second the soybean lai under the m2 treatment was significantly higher than under the m1 treatment fig 6 and plants with large lai had an obvious shade effect which led to a relatively low surface temperature of the leaves so water transpiration was reduced increased soil water was beneficial in increasing the pn of crops and this phenomenon was also confirmed in the pn values of apple and soybean under the m1 treatment however the maximum pn values for both apple and soybean under the m2 treatment was achieved at the w2 level in 2017 2018 excessive irrigation significantly increased the root biomass of apple and soybean and excessive irrigation intensified the interspecific competition for water zheng et al 2021 the pn of soybean decreased under the m2w3 treatment in response to the increased competition for resources and the increased shading intensity during the 3 year experiment the pue of the apple and soybean increased as the amount of irrigation increased table 2 indicating that appropriate water regulation measures can improve the productivity of an intercropping system by optimizing the physiological indices of the crop which increased the efficient utilization of light and heat resources in the intercropping system 4 2 effects of mulch and irrigation regimes on light competition and complementary the trees and crops in agroforestry systems have competitive and complementary effects on the sunlight above ground and the water resources below ground bouttier et al 2014 bayala and prieto 2019 wu et al 2020 therefore there are strong biological and physical interactions among the component plants of agroforestry systems bellow and nair 2003 qiao et al 2019 the regression coefficients for four photosynthetic indices and the distance from apple trees were used to evaluate the effects of interspecific interactions on the soybean photosynthetic indices in 2017 because the distribution ranges of the apple tree canopies and roots were small their influence on the aboveground and underground components of the soybean were limited thus the regression coefficients between the soybean photosynthetic indices and the distance from the apple trees were not significant table 3 in 2018 2019 the regression coefficients between the soybean pn and the distance from the apple trees were significant and positive indicating that the inhibitory effect of apple trees on the soybean photosynthetic rate weakened as the distance from the apple trees increased however zhou et al 2019 observed the opposite phenomenon insofar as the pn of maize decreased as its distance from the apple trees increased in an apple maize intercropping system the reason for this discrepancy was that maize is a long stalked crop and young apple trees had little shade effect on maize while the competition of maize leaves for sunlight was more serious better water and light conditions near the rows of trees resulted in less interspecific competition than intraspecies competition so the pn of maize was higher near the tree rows the regression coefficients for tr and wuei of soybean were similar to those for pn understory crops adapt to shade by changing the morphological characteristics and biochemical conditions of their leaves to enhance photosynthesis evans and poorter 2001 gagliardi et al 2015 franco et al 2018 shade also increases the proportion of diffuse light available to the crop leaves which is more conducive to photosynthesis than direct light alton et al 2007 zhang et al 2018 therefore the increased proportion of diffuse light and the changes in the morphological and biochemical characteristics of the soybean leaves led to the higher soybean pue under shade and it decreased with increasing distance from the trees because the water retention characteristics of plastic mulch were better than those of straw mulch more soil water was available to soybean under the m2 treatment than under the m1 treatment so the degree of niche separation in the underground apple and soybean roots under the plastic mulch was greater than under the straw mulch zheng et al 2021 this alleviated the water competition between the apple trees and soybean to a certain extent so the regression coefficients between pn or tr and the distance from the apple trees were slightly smaller under the m2 treatment than under the m1 treatment in 2018 the combination of mulch and irrigation increased the available soil water in normal years and the limitation of soil water stress on the photosynthesis of soybean adjacent to tree rows was greatly reduced unlike the ck treatment the main limiting factor in soybean adjacent to tree rows was shade so that the pn of soybean under shade was much lower than that in the middle rows therefore the pn regression coefficient for the combination of mulch and irrigation was greater than that for the ck treatment however water was the main competitive resource for apple and soybean in the intercropping system in the dry year 2019 and increased irrigation was a direct and effective way to alleviate this competition therefore the regression coefficients between the soybean pn and tr and the distance from the apple trees decreased as the amount of irrigation increased in this study we analyzed the interspecific interaction of apple soybean intercropping system by regression coefficient between soybean photosynthetic parameters and distance from the trees however the synergistic mechanisms of photosynthesis between apple and soybean under different mulch and irrigation regimes are not fully understood therefore much work needs to be done in further research such as additional measurement of photosynthetic and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters for the complex intercropping system 4 3 effects of mulch and irrigation regimes on growth indices and yield photosynthesis is an important process in the production of dry matter and about 90 of dry matter is formed by photosynthesis gaju et al 2016 li et al 2019 therefore the growth indices of apple tree and soybean were basically consistent with the changes in leaf pn although there was no significant difference in the spad of the apple and soybean leaves under each treatment the pn and lai values of the apple and soybean under the m2 treatment were higher than under the m1 treatment table 2 and fig 6 so the apple new branch lengths and the soybean yields under plastic mulch were significantly greater than under straw mulch this is an important reason why the comprehensive benefits of the m2 treatment were greater than those of the m1 treatment in 2017 2018 the yields of soybean first increased and then decreased as the amount of irrigation increased this was because although moderate irrigation promoted the production and accumulation of soybean dry matter excess water was not conducive to the migration of photosynthetic substances from vegetative organs to reproductive organs thus reducing both the yield and water use efficiency liu et al 2016 el shirbeny et al 2020 as a result the maximum yield of soybean under the two mulch treatments appeared at the w2 irrigation level in 2017 2018 the water demand of apple trees increased year by year and during the serious shortage of precipitation in 2019 the intense competition for water between the apple and soybean led to serious water stress on the soybean water shortage reduced the stomatal conductance and availability of co2 in the palisade tissues of crop leaves which reduced photosynthesis and the efficiency of light utilization zhou et al 2016 increased irrigation can enhance photosynthesis and dry matter accumulation in soybean so there was a positive correlation between soybean yield and the amount of irrigation in 2019 these reasons also explained why the comprehensive benefits of the apple soybean intercropping system reached maximum at the w2 irrigation level in 2017 2018 but reached maximum at the w3 irrigation level in 2019 in conclusion in normal years plastic mulch combined with 70 fc maximum irrigation was most suitable for a 5 7 year old apple soybean intercropping system in this region whereas in dry years the maximum irrigation should be increased to 85 fc 5 conclusions three years of field experiments showed that mulch and irrigation had significant effects on the pn tr wuei and pue of the apple and soybean in an intercropping system mulch and irrigation regimes improved the photosynthetic characteristics of apple soybean intercropping system and alleviated the competition between those species for light resources compared with straw mulch plastic mulch more effectively increased the pn tr and pue of apple and soybean the maximum values for pn and pue in both apple and soybean were observed under the m2w2 and m2w3 treatments in normal and dry years respectively mulch and irrigation regimes effectively increased the apple branch growth and soybean plant height lai and yield but excessive irrigation was detrimental to the accumulation of dry matter in soybean grain in normal years therefore superabundant irrigation should not be applied in normal years whereas irrigation should be increased in dry years plastic mulch was more conducive to the growth of crops because it better retained soil moisture and heat therefore to improve the overall benefits of a 5 7 year old apple soybean intercropping system and alleviate the interspecific competition for resources in the loess plateau of western shanxi we suggest that plastic mulch be combined with 70 fc maximum irrigation in normal years and that irrigation should be increased to 85 fc in dry years declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
