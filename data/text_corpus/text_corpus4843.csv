24215,in the agroecosystem surface crop residues are widely recognized as affecting many processes such as soil water dynamics crop growth nitrogen and carbon cycling for this reason developing models that simulate the effect of surface residues and their decomposition is crucial especially while modeling conservation agriculture to date even though many cropping systems and c oriented models differently simulate the evolution of surface residue biomass a comprehensive approach is still missing in this study we developed a new simulation module that explicitly simulates the decomposition of surface residues by including all the variables and processes that are relevant for agroecosystem s simulation this module has been later integrated into the armosa cropping system model to quantify the contribution of each parameter to the simulated outputs i e decomposed biomass a sensitivity analysis sa was conducted comparing the result with the apsim model used as a benchmark the sa was conducted on four different crop residues maize rye soybean and wheat over three different years in addition for each crop residue we verified whether parameters changed their relevance depending on the considered time period the most critical parameters of the new module reflected the importance of air temperature soil water content and residue biomass in the decomposition process the potential decomposition rate had minor importance highlighting that when setting crop specific values other environment related parameters are more relevant for the actual decomposition rate in the case of apsim model the potential decomposition rate and the optimum temperature for this process resulted in the first two ranks finally concordance coefficients were used to compare sa outputs compared to apsim the new model showed higher concordance passing from one crop residue to another even when comparing the different simulation periods within the same crop in summary this work presented a novelty in surface crop residue representation and provided a deep survey of the module behavior and characteristics keywords surface residues crop residues crop modeling sensitivity analysis conservation agriculture data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface crop residues represent a fraction of aboveground biomass lost by the crop through senescent organs or left on soil surface after harvest for main crops or termination for cover crop permanent soil cover with surface crop residues is one of the main principles of conservation agriculture fao 2016 thus deliberate leaving dead biomass on soil surface is an agronomic practice having a relevant impact on many processes surface residue presence influences soil water dynamics soil erosion dietrich et al 2019 and biodiversity thus promoting crop growth and yield fiorini et al 2020 moreover residue biomass retention and its subsequent decomposition affects nitrogen and organic carbon dynamics chaves et al 2021 stella et al 2019 robertson et al 2015 iqbal et al 2015 coppens et al 2007 guérif et al 2001 for these reasons the development of models that estimate simultaneously the decomposition of surface crop residues and their consequent transformation into soil organic matter along with the water and crop dynamics is crucial for a proper assessment of matter and energy flows in agroecosystems moreno cornejo et al 2014 another reason to specifically simulate surface residue degradation is the slower decomposition rate of this residue pool compared to the one incorporated into the soil douglas et al 1980 to date different cropping system models have been developed to simulate the decomposition of surface residues in response to pedoclimatic conditions and agronomic management besides the way they deal with the main environmental factors regulating the decomposition each model differently focuses on specific biochemical or physical characteristics of the process for example the epic model considers the residue biochemical structure through the lignin content splitting the residues into metabolic and structural compartments izaurralde et al 2006 williams et al 1984 the wepp model carefully describes the effect of tillage operations on surface residues and considers standing and laying residues as two independent pools alberts et al 1987 stics is mainly based on nitrogen availability as regulating factor of residue decomposition rate justes et al 2009 brisson et al 1998 while apsim developed and improved different approaches to model the slower decomposition of the upper part of the surface residue layer holzworth et al 2014 thorburn et al 2001 all the above mentioned models simulate several processes that directly involve surface residues representation such as residues water retention and evaporation and residue decomposition or are affected by residue presence c and n fluxes deriving from residue decomposition and residue soil covering effect on the other hand a more detailed simulation of residue decomposition is carried out by many c oriented models dietrich et al 2017 nendel et al 2011 bruun et al 2006 even though they can simulate the decomposition process in detail the fact that they usually do not simulate crop growth management operations tillage fertilization and irrigation as well as their effect on soil physico chemical properties makes them less suitable for assessing the contribution of residues to agroecosystem functioning to date despite the richness of processes and the diversity of algorithms employed by both cropping system and c oriented models a comprehensive approach for the simulation of surface residue decomposition is still missing thus we developed a new simulation module to enrich the agroecosystems simulation with surface residue decomposition thus including the following scenarios i main crop residues decomposition after harvest ii cover crop residues decomposition after mechanical termination or winterkill events iii senescent leaves accumulation decomposition during crop growth this last process is essential since senescent leaves represent a possible source of soil c rumpel 2011 and of n that persists on the soil for a significant time this module has been integrated and tested within the armosa cropping system model valkama et al 2020 perego et al 2013 models assessment based on sensitivity analysis sa should be performed before models calibration to quantify the contribution of each parameter to the simulated outputs richter et al 2010 furthermore sa is helpful to understand the behavior of the model itself confalonieri et al 2012 by identifying where i e for which parameters a reduction of uncertainty leads to the biggest reduction of the respective output uncertainty diel and franko 2020 this indicates where further efforts for data quality saltelli et al 2007 and for calibration shall be put to best use furthermore comparing sa results of different models highlights their agreements and dissimilarities and allows a deeper analysis of the studied process to our knowledge there is a lack of comparison studies among cropping system models that use different approaches to simulate surface residue decomposition therefore the objectives of this work were i to develop an integrated new module representing surface residue decomposition and assess it within the armosa model ii to assess the new module by analyzing its sensitivity to key parameters in a case study with different crop residues and seasons iii to compare the sensitivity analysis of the new module with that of the apsim model based on the same case study 2 materials and methods 2 1 the apsim approach apsim agricultural production systems simulator holzworth et al 2014 is a comprehensive model developed to simulate biophysical processes in agricultural systems decomposition of surface residues in apsim is implemented through the so called surfaceom module it models the kinetics of decomposition of organic materials left on soil surface until they are incorporated with tillage the module simulates the flow of c to soil pools following the decomposition of dead aboveground biomass meier and thorburn 2016 thorburn et al 2001 using a first order kinetics the actual decomposition rate of the flat mass per unit area is obtained by the potential decomposition rate unique for the whole mass and the factors 0 1 accounting for the limitations imposed by residue moisture temperature c n ratio and residue soil contact the moisture factor is estimated from the potential soil evaporation cumulated along the decomposition period the effect of temperature on residue decomposition is described based on the average air temperature while the cn limit factor is calculated for individual residue types lastly the residue soil contact factor operated where large amounts of surface residues are present reducing the overall rates of decomposition 2 2 the new surface residue decomposition module armosa analysis of cropping systems for management optimization and sustainable agriculture perego et al 2013 is a dynamic model that simulates cropping systems on a daily time step at a field scale the new surface residue decomposition module implemented in armosa fig 1 represents the most important processes regarding surface residue dynamics biomass partitioning between standing and laying residues decomposition and residue soil covering and their influence on surface water balance residue water retention and residue influence on soil evaporation and soil properties e g carbon and nitrogen balance all the equations of the module are reported in appendix a after crop harvest or cover crop termination the module simulates the actual decomposition rate of standing and flat residues separately the decomposition process is based on different potential decomposition rates pdrs for standing residue biomass pdrf for flat residue biomass and pdrf leaves specifically for leaves belonging to the flat biomass and is affected by environmental and management conditions the actual decomposition rate of each pool per unit area is calculated on a daily time step we adopted some key processes from the wepp model watershed erosion prediction project alberts et al 1987 for the simulation of 1 the partitioning of crop residues at harvest in standing and flat components based on crop and cutting height 2 the decomposition of the standing biomass as a function of rain and temperature and its conversion to the flat biomass due to the action of wind and snow 3 the soil covering level provided by standing and flat residues possibly affected by soil tillage operations the decomposition of the flat component of surface biomass follows the apsim approach in that the potential decomposition rate of surface residues is limited by air temperature c n ratio of the residues soil residues contact degree and soil moisture these regulating factors act separately on the actual decomposition rate of the three stand flat and leaves pools unlike apsim however the new module discriminates between leaf and stem biomass to account for their different susceptibility to decomposition the effect of soil moisture was modelled based on the armosa soil moisture simulation to be consistent with the algorithm already implemented for the residues incorporated into the soil carbon and nitrogen fluxes from surface residues decomposition are allocated into stable soil carbon and mineral soil nitrogen lastly the stics approach simulateur multidisciplinaire pour les cultures standard justes et al 2009 brisson et al 1998 was adopted for estimating residue water retention limited by incident rainfall and influenced by residue wettability assessing residue evaporation demand based on the flat residue soil cover and subsequently adjusting soil evaporation to fulfill the unsatisfied evaporation request 2 3 case study for sensitivity analysis the scenario used for sensitivity analysis spans between 2013 and 2017 and is based on a long term field experiment started in 2011 at the cerzoo research station in piacenza 45 00 18 0 n 9 42 12 7 e 68 m above sea level po valley northern italy the soil at the field site is a fine mixed mesic udertic haplustalfs soil survey staff 2014 main soil 0 30 cm properties before the beginning of the experiment were organic matter content 21 g kg 1 ph h2o 6 8 bulk density 1 36 g cm 3 sand 122 g kg 1 silt 462 g kg 1 clay 416 g kg 1 soil total n 1

of 14 2 c and annual rainfall of 778 mm last 20 years average daily weather inputs required by the models were obtained by the agri4cast resources portal biavetti et al 2014 briefly the crop sequence was a three year crop rotation maize zea mays l soybean glycine max l merr and winter wheat triticum aestivum subsp aestivum l rye secale cereale l was utilized as a cover crop after maize and winter wheat in a no tillage regime the experimental design was a randomized block with 4 replicates approximately two weeks before sowing the cash crop the cover crop was terminated by spraying glyphosate n phosphonomethyl glycine at the rate of 3 l ha 1 cash crop and cover crop residues after harvesting and termination respectively where left onto the soil surface without chopping in this experiment a residue biomass decomposition assessment was conducted on surface residue biomass of the cash crop and on the whole surface cover crop biomass the different residues biomasses were used to initialize the models under the present study thus the residue biomass from the harvest of the cash crop and from the termination of the cover crop represent the dependent variable on which the present study is based we will use the term surface residue biomass for the biomass laying on the soil surface regardless of its source i e harvest or termination once the following crop in the rotation was harvested the previous residues if still present on the surface because still not completely decomposed were removed from the soil and the new residues i e of the new crop just harvested were put on the soil surface more details about the whole experiment are available in boselli et al 2020 2 4 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis sa was carried out on the amount of decomposed residue biomass which is the dependent variable that is affected by all processes included in the new module therefore all the parameters involved in biomass decomposition were considered in the sensitivity analysis a complete parameter s list is reported in table 1 to better assess the role of the parameters on the decomposition dynamics under different pedo climatic conditions several sas were conducted on residues of all crops in the rotation in the periods of the year when they are on the soil surface in addition for each tested crop two timespans of decomposition hereafter reported as simulation periods were considered 1 the long simulation period lsp from crop harvest termination to the following crop harvest termination and 2 the short simulation period ssp that is half of the long simulation period and starts from the same crop harvest termination date the introduction of the lsp and ssp periods allowed us to detect possible patterns of parameter sensitivity in different stages of residue decomposition in fact the analysis of ssp and lsp can distinguish the parameters that are important only at the beginning of the decomposition process when the environmental conditions might be different compared to the end of lsp from the parameters that maintain their importance along the whole decomposition period for both the new module and apsim the total number of sas 10 was equal to the combination of the number of crops in the rotation i e maize rye soybean and wheat multiplied by the number of simulation periods lsp and ssp for each sa table 2 shows the specific crop residues under decomposition and the period of the year involved table 2 also shows the initial residue biomass at the beginning of each sa that was derived from boselli et al 2020 in addition a comparison among crop residues decomposing in a similar period of the year was done to better evaluate the role of environmental conditions on decomposition we have distinguished crop residues that decompose during the colder season winter or fall and residues that decompose during the warm season spring or summer fig 2 shows for each crop in the rotation the season of decomposition split by ssp and lsp allowing an easier comparison among crops sensitivity analysis requires setting the average and standard deviation of the parameters parameters values were derived from the literature table 1 when no data were available default or calibrated values were adopted standard deviation was set to 30 of the average for all parameters to prevent unrealistic values all parameter distributions were assumed to be normal confalonieri et al 2006 random variates of the same parameters were generated using the sampling technique for sensitivity analysis known as the morris method morris 1991 and further improved by campolongo et al 2004 this technique deals efficiently with models containing a large number of input parameters without relying upon strict assumptions about the model such as additivity or monotonicity of the input output relationship confalonieri et al 2006 the study of paleari et al 2021 highlighted that the morris method is a suitable alternative to more demanding sa methods e g sobol method when ranking parameters or discriminating between influential and non influential parameters the morris method is based on a systematic sampling of the multidimensional space defined by the possible values of the parameters to generate a random set of oat i e once at time experiments pianosi et al 2016 and identifying the few crucial parameters based on the distribution fi of the elementary effect associated with the i th input factor to estimate these quantities morris suggests sampling r elementary effects from each fi via an efficient design that constructs r trajectories of k 1 points in the input space each providing k elementary effects one per input factor for each model input x the elementary effect is defined as 1 d i x y x i x i 1 x i δ x i 1 x k y x δ where i x x1 xk as the k dimensional vector of model studied parameters xi ii all variables are rescaled in the 0 1 range iii xi can take only p the number of levels using the morris terminology discrete values in the set 0 1 p 1 1 p 2 1 and iv δ is a multiple of 1 p 1 the total cost of the experiment is thus r k 1 campolongo et al 2007 the morris method requires the choice of the number of trajectories sequences of points starting from a random base vector in which two consecutive elements differ only for one component and levels for both models the sensitivity analysis was run using 10 trajectories and 4 levels the method samples values of x from the hyperspace ω identified by an k dimensional p level grid and finally calculates the mean μ strength assessing the overall influence of the parameter on y x and its standard deviation σ spread estimating the totality of the higher order effects richter et al 2010 in this work μ is considered as absolute value μ as proposed by campolongo et al 2004 the μ value is successful in ranking parameters in order of importance and performs well when the goal is identifying non influential parameters confalonieri et al 2006 the second measure σ is useful to detect parameters involved in interaction with other parameters or whose effect is non linear saltelli et al 2004 with this convention the more dangerous i e sensitive parameters are in the top right quadrant of the σ versus μ plot danger zone where both sensitivity and strength are high confalonieri et al 2006 for the new module the sa was conducted using the armosa integrated feature that allows the model to easily interact with the salib external library herman and usher 2017 this library implements many sensitivity analysis methods including morris in the case of apsim the sensitivity package iooss et al 2021 was used to setting the grid for the sa i e a data frame with the combinations of parameters to be evaluated to use this package the complementary apsimx package miguez 2022 interface was utilized to set and run the sa the functions belonging to the apsimx package also allow the user to open inspect read and edit the simulation file apsim in addition this package allows editing the configuration files xml where the default setting of the parameters is stored the code used to set the sa is available as supplemental material supplemental material 1 2 5 statistical analysis to evaluate the agreement between the different sensitivity rankings within each model the top down concordance coefficient was applied which allows to emphasize the agreement among rankings assigned to important parameters through the transformation of original data into savage scores savage 1954 savage scores are calculated as follows 2 s i j 1 n 1 j where i is the rank assigned to the rank i th order statistic in a sample of size n the i th rank has been assigned to the different μ for each parameter in a single sa after the conversion into savage scores the kendall s coefficient of concordance was applied this coefficient of concordance can be used to measure the agreement among b sets of rankings when b 2 iman and conover 1987 it is also known as the top down correlation coefficient because of its sensitivity to agreement among the top ranks it can be computed as 3 c t 1 b 2 n s 1 i 1 n s i 2 b 2 n where s i is the sum of the savage scores assigned to the i th object taken over all b sets of rankings the coefficient of concordance is associated with a p value under the kendall null hypothesis that the p judges or raters i e set of sas produce independent rankings of the objects or subjects i e parameters to preserve the correct type i error siegel and castellan 1988 recommended the use of a permutation based table of critical values for c t only when the number of parameters is 7 when the number of parameters exceeds seven they recommended using the χ2 distribution approximation thus according to the parameters number the p value of each coefficient of concordance was obtained with the χ2 distribution for the new module 14 parameters evaluated and with the permutation based method for apsim 7 parameters evaluated legendre et al 2005 both the c t and the p values coefficients were automatically retrieved from all sets of ranks using the r package synchrony tarik 2019 using the ranking ties correction when necessary 3 results 3 1 models parameters similarities and differences between the new module and apsim the two modeling approaches i e the new module and apsim utilized different parameters to simulate surface residue biomass decomposition table 1 appendix a only five of them cnopt and cnslope accounting for the cn ratio of the residue biomass topt accounting for the optimal temperature for decomposition cfrt accounting for the area to mass ratio of residue biomass and bf crit accounting for the critical flat residue biomass above which the decomposition is slower are in common since they have the same biological meaning and role within the simulated process other parameters reflect the different approaches adopted starting from the potential decomposition rates the new module uses two different parameters one for leaves pdrf leaves and one for the rest of flat biomass pdrf these potential decomposition rates are further defined specifically for each crop the third potential decomposition rate pdrs was not used in this study because of the lack of standing residue apsim instead uses a single potential decomposition rate bf degr regardless the residue biomass component the limitation of biomass decomposition due to soil water is represented by four parameters in the new module swcmin swcoptmin swcoptmax maoptb and maopta eq 10a appendix a table 1 whereas only by one parameter cum eos max in apsim furthermore the new module uses the wettmulch and the convfct parameters to define the residue biomass water retention and to account for the effect of wind and snow on the standing residue biomass respectively other model parameters belonging to armosa are not included in this analysis because they are not directly related to decomposition and were left at their default value 3 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis results are described separately for the new module and for apsim within each of these approaches sa results are presented for each crop in the rotation table 2 3 2 1 new decomposition module implemented in armosa the results differed based on the crop and the period of the year in which residues decompose in the case of maize topt bf crit and swcmin had the highest effect on decomposition with no differences between ssp and lsp top right quadrant in fig 3 a 3b another important parameter involved in the process was cnopt while all the other parameters had μ equal or close to zero fig 3a 3b for rye a clear pattern was visible only in 2017 rye 2 fig 3i 3 l when the swcmin i e minimum residue water content for decomposition process expressed as a proportion of field water capacity showed constantly a more relevant effect than all the other parameters in 2015 i e rye 1 the same pattern appeared only in lsp fig 3d in ssp fig 3c instead bf crit and topt appeared in the top right quadrant together with swcmin the impact of these three parameters could be discriminated by ranking on the basis of σ topt maintained an essential role but its interactions with other parameters were low in the case of soybean topt still had the same importance as found in maize no other parameters had a significant influence on model outputs as indicated by low μ fig 3e 3f for wheat sa showed a clear pattern in ssp with swcmin covering the largest μ percentage compared to all the other parameters fig 3g values of μ decreased smoothly in lsp from right to left but with discontinuities allowing to distinguish the most influential parameters swcmin ranked first followed by bf crit topt swcoptmin and pdrf fig 3h a valuable indication of the sa results can be retrieved by averaging the savage scores paleari et al 2021 of the sensitivity metrics estimated for the different crops and simulation periods data not shown the average final ranking allowed us to identify the top parameters associated with surface residue decomposition regardless of the crop and of the period of decomposition starting from the most relevant the top five parameters were topt swcmin bf crit pdrf and pdrf leaves kendall s coefficient of concordance computed on the whole set of ten sas showed a high concordance value c t 0 86 p value 0 001 meaning that the ten different rankings significantly agreed in the definition of the most important parameters table 3 shows the coefficient of concordance and the associated p value among all the sas on average the concordance values within each crop between the short and long period were always high c t 98 99 table 3 and significant p value 0 05 these values reflected the high concordance of the top ranks within every single crop as shown in fig 3 even though some differences were found for parameters with lower importance i e lower values of μ based on the season during which the crop residue decomposition occurs fig 2 different crop residues can be compared maize residues mostly degraded in the same season as soybean indeed the two sa conducted in the two ssp had high concordance c t 0 96 p value 0 023 table 3 confirming the significant effect of topt and bf crit if we consider the lsp of the same crops the coefficient of concordance is still significantly high c t 0 97 p value 0 024 table 3 emphasizing again the importance of air temperature and residue biomass critical amount i e bf crit the critical level of flat residue biomass above which the decomposition is slower for the surface decomposition process in this specific crop rotation the wheat residues had the longest time of decomposition 262 days overall covering the soil differently from the other crop residues from late autumn to early summer seasons for this reason it seemed not reasonable to compare it with the other crops the two rye cover crops instead were terminated almost in the same period and their residues remained on the soil surface until the end of august thus the coefficients of concordance confirmed the relevance of the soil water content with swcmin being the most critical parameter on the surface decomposition process even if c t was lower compared to those above for the short simulation periods c t 0 93 p value 0 029 while for the long simulation period c t 0 92 p value 0 033 this is mainly due to the second and third positions alternately belonging to topt bf crit or pdrf in the parameter rankings of the two cover crops belonging to different parameters 3 2 2 the apsim model compared to armosa the apsim model has a lower number of parameters which cause a lower parameter overlapping in the diagnostic diagrams fig 4 as for maize sa outputs varied between the ssp and lsp the topt parameter clearly had an important role in the surface decomposition process in both simulation periods but the effect was variable for the other parameters fig 4a 4b in fact bf crit played a key role in the ssp while the potential decomposition rate bf degr assumed a crucial weight for the lsp all the other parameters i e cnopt cnslope cfrt and cum eos max even with lower values of σ also reported lower values of μ thus they were far away from the top right quadrant for the rye cover crop the results showed a similar parameters response between ssp and lsp within a single year but differences emerged when comparing 2015 i e rye 1 to 2017 i e rye 2 in 2015 the most critical parameter was the cum eos max which scored the highest value in both ssp and lsp fig 4c 4d in the second and third positions of the ranking we found the bf degr and cfrt varying between lsp and ssp all the other parameters have μ values close to zero not affecting the sa output in 2017 the most sensitive parameters remained the same as in 2015 but their ranks became considerably different the temperature had a significant effect on the decomposition process increasing the weight of the topt parameter in the sa analysis fig 4i 4 l the potential decomposition rate bf degr is in the middle of the diagram for both ssp and lsp always followed by cum eos max similar results have been observed also in soybean when topt had the most significant impact against all the other parameters fig 4e 4f in both simulation periods focusing on ssp the sa evidenced bf crit and bf degr as essential parameters affecting the decomposition process since they are located in the top right quadrant in the long period the weight of bf crit and bf degr is less evident and it is comparable with the weight of cnopt in lsp the clusters of these three last parameters can be easily distinguished for all the other parameters even though their impact is negligible wheat is the only crop heavily influenced by the bf degr parameter which is constantly at the top right angle of the diagram fig 4g 4h nevertheless the situation becomes different when comparing the ssp with lsp bf crit had a higher μ value in lsp with a high σ value too in ssp bf crit maintained high μ value but decreased the interaction with other parameters lower σ value in the bottom left quadrant the other parameters are less sensitive bf crit and topt had predominant roles in the lsp diagram compared to cnopt cnslope cfrt and cum eos max parameters averaging the savage scores of the sensitivity metrics estimated for the different crops and periods led to an averaged ranking data not shown the optimum temperature for decomposition topt led the rank followed by the potential decomposition rate bf degr the critical residue mass bf crit and the cumulative potential soil evaporation cum eos max kendall s coefficient of concordance computed on the whole set of ten sa was relatively low c t 0 43 the ten different rankings do not greatly agree with each other in defining the most critical parameters involved in the residue decomposition process even with a significative test p value 0 001 table 4 shows the coefficient of concordance and the associated p value between all the combinations of sa in apsim within each crop the concordance values between ssp and lsp were significant p 0 05 except for maize and with values almost stable around 90 table 4 these values reflected the high concordance of the top ranks within every single crop based on the season under which the crop residue decomposition occurs fig 2 as already shown with the new module implemented in armosa different crop residues can be compared to each other previously maize was compared with soybean since the decomposition season of residue was almost the same also in the case of apsim the two crop residues led to similar sa outputs both the comparisons between sa conducted on the short period i e maize s and soybean s and long period i e maize l and soybean l have high coefficients of concordance c t 0 95 and c t 0 82 respectively even if only the first was significant at the 5 threshold these coefficients revealed that topt bf crit and bf degr are the most influent parameters involved in the decomposition process of these crop residue it is also worth comparing the two cover crops i e rye 1 and rye 2 since their residues decompose in the same season and belong to the same crop species nevertheless for apsim the concordance coefficients were around 70 but not significant for the short and long period of decomposition p value 0 10 4 discussion performing a set of ten different analyses based on different crop residues simulation periods table 2 and different seasons during the year fig 2 allowed us to detect the sensitivity of the two models to the main parameters involved in surface residue decomposition moreover since the sa results change according to the duration of the simulation i e according to the value of the dependent variable at the last time step saltelli et al 2000 the definition of different simulation periods ssp and lsp for each crop was useful to better define the parameters role on residue decomposition kinetics in fact considering a single crop at the time i e increasing the simulation period allowed us to detect if some parameters maintained their sensitivity when moving from ssp to lsp differences between simulation periods may have happened because of the different conditions or because more rapid decomposition occurred during the early stages of the decomposition dorissant et al 2022 4 1 the impact of simulation periods the variation of parameter sensitivity between the two simulation periods within a single crop was usually lower in the new module higher coefficients of concordance than in apsim except for the rye 1 crop in this case the impact of topt and bf crit was higher in ssp than in lsp fig 3c probably before the summer period july and august 2015 when swcmin was by far the most relevant parameter moorhead et al 1996 the lower temperature and the initial amount of residues 2 85 mg ha 1 have contributed to slow the decomposition in the early stages thus impacting the sa output the parameters sensitivity under rye 2 was more homogeneous comparing ssp and lsp in fact the temperature during april and may was on average slightly greater compared to 2015 i e not strongly limiting the decomposition and especially the initial amount of residues 2 23 mg ha 1 was closer to the bf crit threshold 2 00 mg ha 1 comparing crop residues that decomposed in the same season the sensitivity analysis of the new module almost ended with the same parameter ranking as in the case of maize vs soybean or rye 1 vs rye 2 this is related to the high dependency of surface decomposition on the environmental factors rather than on biomass specific characteristics iqbal et al 2015 lee et al 2014 marinari et al 2015 sanaullah et al 2012 in apsim the sa concordance between short and long simulation periods within each crop was lower than in the new module in other words the apsim parameters reacted more to the simulation period increment regardless the crop residues considered this is evident by observing the sa results of maize c t 0 79 p value 0 1 table 4 and wheat c t 0 93 p value 0 012 table 4 shown in fig 3 in the case of maize the initial amount of residues 11 7 mg ha 1 probably had a more considerable impact on the ssp sa output compared to the analysis spread between 17 09 2014 and 28 04 2015 lsp this is confirmed by the mathematical implementation shared with armosa and reported in eq 13a appendix a when bf bf crit then the decomposition is reduced exponentially moving away from the harvest date i e increasing the duration of the decomposition the bf crit lost its importance as already noted with rye 1 with the new module favoring the temperature through topt and the potential decomposition rate bf degr limitations fig 4b in the case of wheat instead fig 4g 4h the role of bf crit together with topt became higher in the long compared to the short period this is probably due to the inclusion of the winter season in the long period that decreased the bf degr impact compared to the other parameters in other words when temperature does not limit decomposition as it frequently happens during the short period for wheat the potential decomposition rate bf degr is the parameter that limits the process the most ricciuto et al 2021 conversely in the long period most of the decomposition occurs during the coldest months of the year therefore the temperature interacts more with other parameters higher value of σ fig 4h as showed in this case with bf crit 4 2 most important parameters on residue decomposition 4 2 1 new decomposition module the highly significant coefficients of concordance for the whole set of ten sas highlighted the importance of the top ranking parameters specifically all the sas conducted with the new module indicated that topt and swcmin are the most influential parameters as confirmed by the average ranking the topt parameter reflects the optimum temperature for the activity of the microbial community that is primarily involved in residue decomposition averill and waring 2018 findeling et al 2007 whose importance is well recognized and gives the temperature a crucial role in the simulations of this process moorhead et al 1996 when the temperature is not the limiting factor the swcmin became the most influential parameter confirming that moisture limitation is also essential in this process coppens et al 2007 especially if the residues are left on the soil surface lee et al 2014 swcmin is related to soil water retention it defines the minimum residue water content for decomposition expressed as a proportion of field water capacity as expected this parameter limited the decomposition mainly for crop residues laying on the soil surface during the dry period such as in spring in rye or even partially in summer in wheat during the autumn winter period when soil water content is not limiting anymore the importance of this parameter became lower in maize or even roughly negligible in soybean in the new module approach swcmin is used in the moisture factor equation eq 10a appendix a representing the influence of soil water content on flat residue wetness and consequently on their decomposition rate in armosa this parameter is based on the soil water content while other modeling approaches are based on the biomass water content findeling et al 2007 even if the biomass water content rather than the soil water content is in principle more adequate the soil water content of the top layer appears to be a good proxy of surface residue water content in fact the mass adjacent to the soil tends to adsorb water and to be rewetted by the underneath soil layer iqbal et al 2015 in a phenomenon defined sponge effect kravchenko et al 2017 the role of the bf crit parameter i e the critical flat residue biomass above which the decomposition is slower in the new module is worth mentioning eight out of ten sas included it in the list of the first three most influencing parameters even though bf crit is not explicitly related to the crop biomass properties it is linked to the specific crop management for example in the cases of maize and wheat the high amount of surface residues found after the harvest is a direct consequence of a farmer management choice this parameter indirectly reflects the thickness of surface residue biomass suggesting that the more residue biomass the slower the decomposition process its importance was already reported by thorburn et al 2001 who stated that the upper mulch layer i e the layer that is not in contact with the soil has a negligible decomposition rate the response of the model to this situation i e when crop residue biomass is greater than 2 mg ha 1 table 1 bf crit is essential to avoid early overestimation of the carbon and nitrogen accumulation in soil due to the whole residue decomposition after a harvest termination event fang et al 2019 further model improvements may consider recent findings that demonstrated that the upper mulch layer slowly decomposes and that there is a gradient of moisture and decomposition rate dietrich et al 2019 we concluded that for the new module implemented in armosa an accurate estimation of topt swcmin and bf crit is needed to properly simulate the residue decomposition on the other hand it seems also reasonable to include the two potential decomposition rates pdrf and pdrf leaves within the set of most influential parameters nevertheless even if μ for these parameters was always not null they never appeared in the most critical top right quadrant fig 3 for the new module this is probably due to the large impact of the environmental factors on decomposition as indicated by topt and swcmin in addition the fact that different pdrf and pdrf leaves values were assigned to each crop table 1 did not overestimate or underestimate the maximum rate of residue decomposition i e making the parameters impacting more on the sa leaving the other parameters to drive this process 4 2 2 the apsim model looking at the general trends found in apsim the impact of the different parameters partially reflected what was found in the new module implemented in armosa we found topt and bf degr in the first two ranking positions in almost all apsim s sas most of the sas confirmed the high weight of these parameters except for the rye cover crop in 2015 rye 1 fig 4c 4d this behavior in 2015 probably reflects the low water availability during summer 180 mm of rainfall between 21 04 2015 and 28 08 2015 limiting surface decomposition through the cum eos max parameter more than other factors thus except for this specific situation the only parameter related to water availability cum eos max did not influence the output as swcmin did with the new module the apsim moisture factor considers the water availability using the cumulative potential soil evaporation and thus the critical cumulative evaporation cum eos max to depict the effect that dry residues decompose more slowly than wet residues dietrich et al 2019 therefore in this case a soil property has been used as a proxy for surface residue moisture contrary to the new module the apsim potential decomposition rate bf degr significantly impacted the sa output compared to the other parameters involved the assumption of a unique default value for the decomposition rate bf degr 0 1 kg m 2 day 1 in the apsim model undoubtedly impacted the sa results more than the crop specific rates employed in the new armosa module specific calibration of this parameter is necessary to properly calibrate the model another similarity in the behavior of the two approaches concerns the importance of bf crit this parameter is taken from the apsim equation that limits the decomposition based on the residue amount on the soil surface sharing the same equation the two models gave comparable weight to the limitation of the decomposition rate above a 2 mg ha 1 residue biomass threshold confirming that the models responded in the same way to the amount of crop residue as a general trend the two approaches gave comparable results for crop residue that share the same season of decomposition highlighting the impact of environmental conditions this agrees with francos et al 2003 and richter et al 2010 who stated that sensitivity analysis refers to specific conditions and it is not a general property of a model at least for the new module the high value of the concordance coefficient computed on the whole set of sas highlighted that some parameters are the most important regardless the specific conditions of the crop biomass the low plasticity value obtained for apsim l 0 14 describes a model with higher plasticity compared to the new module l 0 27 in other words apsim has more capability to react to an environmental change by altering the importance of its parameters confirming the lower value of concordance coefficients in the discussion above we highlighted that in the new module the topt and swcmin had always a great impact on the sas probably leading to a lower plasticity compared to apsim nevertheless situations like rye 1 or wheat comparing ssp and lsp in fig 3 still defined a module capable to change its parameters sensitivity to the environmental changes 5 conclusions with this work a new module has been developed to explicitly include surface residue pools in many relevant modeling processes in fact the implementation of this new module into armosa allowed to simulate many processes in which crop residues laying on the soil surface play a crucial role in water and nutrient cycling dynamics despite previous implementation of surface crop residue decomposition we developed a new module that simulates this process including all the important factors that give a complete representation of residue decomposition the apsim model was used as a benchmark this model was selected for its algorithm affinity to armosa and for being a cropping system model widely cited in the literature a sensitivity analysis was conducted for each crop residue under analysis i e maize rye soybean and wheat in the present sa we distinguished between long and short simulation periods with the advantage of recognizing if some parameters within single crop impacted on the decomposition process regardless the different environmental conditions the most important parameters in the new module reflected the impact of air temperature topt soil water content swcmin and residue biomass bf crit on the decomposition process the two decomposition rates pdrf and pdrf leaves had minor importance highlighting that when setting crop specific values other environment related parameters are more relevant for the actual decomposition rate the apsim model showed a lower concordance of sa results passing from a crop residue to another and even when comparing short and long simulation periods within the same crop for maize and wheat the sa output showed how the duration of the decomposition along different seasons could heavily influence the parameters impact as a general trend we always found topt and bf degr parameters in the first two rank positions in addition having assumed a unique default value for the decomposition rate bf degr could have impacted surface residue destiny more than the new module decomposition rates the outcome of this work allowed us to identify the most relevant parameters for a future work of the model calibration and to evaluate its behavior under variable conditions of the residue surface decomposition process credit authorship contribution statement tommaso tadiello conceptualization software

24215,in the agroecosystem surface crop residues are widely recognized as affecting many processes such as soil water dynamics crop growth nitrogen and carbon cycling for this reason developing models that simulate the effect of surface residues and their decomposition is crucial especially while modeling conservation agriculture to date even though many cropping systems and c oriented models differently simulate the evolution of surface residue biomass a comprehensive approach is still missing in this study we developed a new simulation module that explicitly simulates the decomposition of surface residues by including all the variables and processes that are relevant for agroecosystem s simulation this module has been later integrated into the armosa cropping system model to quantify the contribution of each parameter to the simulated outputs i e decomposed biomass a sensitivity analysis sa was conducted comparing the result with the apsim model used as a benchmark the sa was conducted on four different crop residues maize rye soybean and wheat over three different years in addition for each crop residue we verified whether parameters changed their relevance depending on the considered time period the most critical parameters of the new module reflected the importance of air temperature soil water content and residue biomass in the decomposition process the potential decomposition rate had minor importance highlighting that when setting crop specific values other environment related parameters are more relevant for the actual decomposition rate in the case of apsim model the potential decomposition rate and the optimum temperature for this process resulted in the first two ranks finally concordance coefficients were used to compare sa outputs compared to apsim the new model showed higher concordance passing from one crop residue to another even when comparing the different simulation periods within the same crop in summary this work presented a novelty in surface crop residue representation and provided a deep survey of the module behavior and characteristics keywords surface residues crop residues crop modeling sensitivity analysis conservation agriculture data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface crop residues represent a fraction of aboveground biomass lost by the crop through senescent organs or left on soil surface after harvest for main crops or termination for cover crop permanent soil cover with surface crop residues is one of the main principles of conservation agriculture fao 2016 thus deliberate leaving dead biomass on soil surface is an agronomic practice having a relevant impact on many processes surface residue presence influences soil water dynamics soil erosion dietrich et al 2019 and biodiversity thus promoting crop growth and yield fiorini et al 2020 moreover residue biomass retention and its subsequent decomposition affects nitrogen and organic carbon dynamics chaves et al 2021 stella et al 2019 robertson et al 2015 iqbal et al 2015 coppens et al 2007 guérif et al 2001 for these reasons the development of models that estimate simultaneously the decomposition of surface crop residues and their consequent transformation into soil organic matter along with the water and crop dynamics is crucial for a proper assessment of matter and energy flows in agroecosystems moreno cornejo et al 2014 another reason to specifically simulate surface residue degradation is the slower decomposition rate of this residue pool compared to the one incorporated into the soil douglas et al 1980 to date different cropping system models have been developed to simulate the decomposition of surface residues in response to pedoclimatic conditions and agronomic management besides the way they deal with the main environmental factors regulating the decomposition each model differently focuses on specific biochemical or physical characteristics of the process for example the epic model considers the residue biochemical structure through the lignin content splitting the residues into metabolic and structural compartments izaurralde et al 2006 williams et al 1984 the wepp model carefully describes the effect of tillage operations on surface residues and considers standing and laying residues as two independent pools alberts et al 1987 stics is mainly based on nitrogen availability as regulating factor of residue decomposition rate justes et al 2009 brisson et al 1998 while apsim developed and improved different approaches to model the slower decomposition of the upper part of the surface residue layer holzworth et al 2014 thorburn et al 2001 all the above mentioned models simulate several processes that directly involve surface residues representation such as residues water retention and evaporation and residue decomposition or are affected by residue presence c and n fluxes deriving from residue decomposition and residue soil covering effect on the other hand a more detailed simulation of residue decomposition is carried out by many c oriented models dietrich et al 2017 nendel et al 2011 bruun et al 2006 even though they can simulate the decomposition process in detail the fact that they usually do not simulate crop growth management operations tillage fertilization and irrigation as well as their effect on soil physico chemical properties makes them less suitable for assessing the contribution of residues to agroecosystem functioning to date despite the richness of processes and the diversity of algorithms employed by both cropping system and c oriented models a comprehensive approach for the simulation of surface residue decomposition is still missing thus we developed a new simulation module to enrich the agroecosystems simulation with surface residue decomposition thus including the following scenarios i main crop residues decomposition after harvest ii cover crop residues decomposition after mechanical termination or winterkill events iii senescent leaves accumulation decomposition during crop growth this last process is essential since senescent leaves represent a possible source of soil c rumpel 2011 and of n that persists on the soil for a significant time this module has been integrated and tested within the armosa cropping system model valkama et al 2020 perego et al 2013 models assessment based on sensitivity analysis sa should be performed before models calibration to quantify the contribution of each parameter to the simulated outputs richter et al 2010 furthermore sa is helpful to understand the behavior of the model itself confalonieri et al 2012 by identifying where i e for which parameters a reduction of uncertainty leads to the biggest reduction of the respective output uncertainty diel and franko 2020 this indicates where further efforts for data quality saltelli et al 2007 and for calibration shall be put to best use furthermore comparing sa results of different models highlights their agreements and dissimilarities and allows a deeper analysis of the studied process to our knowledge there is a lack of comparison studies among cropping system models that use different approaches to simulate surface residue decomposition therefore the objectives of this work were i to develop an integrated new module representing surface residue decomposition and assess it within the armosa model ii to assess the new module by analyzing its sensitivity to key parameters in a case study with different crop residues and seasons iii to compare the sensitivity analysis of the new module with that of the apsim model based on the same case study 2 materials and methods 2 1 the apsim approach apsim agricultural production systems simulator holzworth et al 2014 is a comprehensive model developed to simulate biophysical processes in agricultural systems decomposition of surface residues in apsim is implemented through the so called surfaceom module it models the kinetics of decomposition of organic materials left on soil surface until they are incorporated with tillage the module simulates the flow of c to soil pools following the decomposition of dead aboveground biomass meier and thorburn 2016 thorburn et al 2001 using a first order kinetics the actual decomposition rate of the flat mass per unit area is obtained by the potential decomposition rate unique for the whole mass and the factors 0 1 accounting for the limitations imposed by residue moisture temperature c n ratio and residue soil contact the moisture factor is estimated from the potential soil evaporation cumulated along the decomposition period the effect of temperature on residue decomposition is described based on the average air temperature while the cn limit factor is calculated for individual residue types lastly the residue soil contact factor operated where large amounts of surface residues are present reducing the overall rates of decomposition 2 2 the new surface residue decomposition module armosa analysis of cropping systems for management optimization and sustainable agriculture perego et al 2013 is a dynamic model that simulates cropping systems on a daily time step at a field scale the new surface residue decomposition module implemented in armosa fig 1 represents the most important processes regarding surface residue dynamics biomass partitioning between standing and laying residues decomposition and residue soil covering and their influence on surface water balance residue water retention and residue influence on soil evaporation and soil properties e g carbon and nitrogen balance all the equations of the module are reported in appendix a after crop harvest or cover crop termination the module simulates the actual decomposition rate of standing and flat residues separately the decomposition process is based on different potential decomposition rates pdrs for standing residue biomass pdrf for flat residue biomass and pdrf leaves specifically for leaves belonging to the flat biomass and is affected by environmental and management conditions the actual decomposition rate of each pool per unit area is calculated on a daily time step we adopted some key processes from the wepp model watershed erosion prediction project alberts et al 1987 for the simulation of 1 the partitioning of crop residues at harvest in standing and flat components based on crop and cutting height 2 the decomposition of the standing biomass as a function of rain and temperature and its conversion to the flat biomass due to the action of wind and snow 3 the soil covering level provided by standing and flat residues possibly affected by soil tillage operations the decomposition of the flat component of surface biomass follows the apsim approach in that the potential decomposition rate of surface residues is limited by air temperature c n ratio of the residues soil residues contact degree and soil moisture these regulating factors act separately on the actual decomposition rate of the three stand flat and leaves pools unlike apsim however the new module discriminates between leaf and stem biomass to account for their different susceptibility to decomposition the effect of soil moisture was modelled based on the armosa soil moisture simulation to be consistent with the algorithm already implemented for the residues incorporated into the soil carbon and nitrogen fluxes from surface residues decomposition are allocated into stable soil carbon and mineral soil nitrogen lastly the stics approach simulateur multidisciplinaire pour les cultures standard justes et al 2009 brisson et al 1998 was adopted for estimating residue water retention limited by incident rainfall and influenced by residue wettability assessing residue evaporation demand based on the flat residue soil cover and subsequently adjusting soil evaporation to fulfill the unsatisfied evaporation request 2 3 case study for sensitivity analysis the scenario used for sensitivity analysis spans between 2013 and 2017 and is based on a long term field experiment started in 2011 at the cerzoo

of 14 2 c and annual rainfall of 778 mm last 20 years average daily weather inputs required by the models were obtained by the agri4cast resources portal biavetti et al 2014 briefly the crop sequence was a three year crop rotation maize zea mays l soybean glycine max l merr and winter wheat triticum aestivum subsp aestivum l rye secale cereale l was utilized as a cover crop after maize and winter wheat in a no tillage regime the experimental design was a randomized block with 4 replicates approximately two weeks before sowing the cash crop the cover crop was terminated by spraying glyphosate n phosphonomethyl glycine at the rate of 3 l ha 1 cash crop and cover crop residues after harvesting and termination respectively where left onto the soil surface without chopping in this experiment a residue biomass decomposition assessment was conducted on surface residue biomass of the cash crop and on the whole surface cover crop biomass the different residues biomasses were used to initialize the models under the present study thus the residue biomass from the harvest of the cash crop and from the termination of the cover crop represent the dependent variable on which the present study is based we will use the term surface residue biomass for the biomass laying on the soil surface regardless of its source i e harvest or termination once the following crop in the rotation was harvested the previous residues if still present on the surface because still not completely decomposed were removed from the soil and the new residues i e of the new crop just harvested were put on the soil surface more details about the whole experiment are available in boselli et al 2020 2 4 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis sa was carried out on the amount of decomposed residue biomass which is the dependent variable that is affected by all processes included in the new module therefore all the parameters involved in biomass decomposition were considered in the sensitivity analysis a complete parameter s list is reported in table 1 to better assess the role of the parameters on the decomposition dynamics under different pedo climatic conditions several sas were conducted on residues of all crops in the rotation in the periods of the year when they are on the soil surface in addition for each tested crop two timespans of decomposition hereafter reported as simulation periods were considered 1 the long simulation period lsp from crop harvest termination to the following crop harvest termination and 2 the short simulation period ssp that is half of the long simulation period and starts from the same crop harvest termination date the introduction of the lsp and ssp periods allowed us to detect possible patterns of parameter sensitivity in different stages of residue decomposition in fact the analysis of ssp and lsp can distinguish the parameters that are important only at the beginning of the decomposition process when the environmental conditions might be different compared to the end of lsp from the parameters that maintain their importance along the whole decomposition period for both the new module and apsim the total number of sas 10 was equal to the combination of the number of crops in the rotation i e maize rye soybean and wheat multiplied by the number of simulation periods lsp and ssp for each sa table 2 shows the specific crop residues under decomposition and the period of the year involved table 2 also shows the initial residue biomass at the beginning of each sa that was derived from boselli et al 2020 in addition a comparison among crop residues decomposing in a similar period of the year was done to better evaluate the role of environmental conditions on decomposition we have distinguished crop residues that decompose during the colder season winter or fall and residues that decompose during the warm season spring or summer fig 2 shows for each crop in the rotation the season of decomposition split by ssp and lsp allowing an easier comparison among crops sensitivity analysis requires setting the average and standard deviation of the parameters parameters values were derived from the literature table 1 when no data were available default or calibrated values were adopted standard deviation was set to 30 of the average for all parameters to prevent unrealistic values all parameter distributions were assumed to be normal confalonieri et al 2006 random variates of the same parameters were generated using the sampling technique for sensitivity analysis known as the morris method morris 1991 and further improved by campolongo et al 2004 this technique deals efficiently with models containing a large number of input parameters without relying upon strict assumptions about the model such as additivity or monotonicity of the input output relationship confalonieri et al 2006 the study of paleari et al 2021 highlighted that the morris method is a suitable alternative to more demanding sa methods e g sobol method when ranking parameters or discriminating between influential and non influential parameters the morris method is based on a systematic sampling of the multidimensional space defined by the possible values of the parameters to generate a random set of oat i e once at time experiments pianosi et al 2016 and identifying the few crucial parameters based on the distribution fi of the elementary effect associated with the i th input factor to estimate these quantities morris suggests sampling r elementary effects from each fi via an efficient design that constructs r trajectories of k 1 points in the input space each providing k elementary effects one per input factor for each model input x the elementary effect is defined as 1 d i x y x i x i 1 x i δ x i 1 x k y

discrete values in the set 0 1 p 1 1 p 2 1 and iv δ is a multiple of 1 p 1 the total cost of the experiment is thus r k 1 campolongo et al 2007 the morris method requires the choice of the number of trajectories sequences of points starting from a random base vector in which two consecutive elements differ only for one component and levels for both models the sensitivity analysis was run using 10 trajectories and 4 levels the method samples values of x from the hyperspace ω identified by an k dimensional p level grid and finally calculates the mean μ strength assessing the overall influence of the parameter on y x and its standard deviation σ spread estimating the totality of the higher order effects richter et al 2010 in this work μ is considered as absolute value μ as proposed by campolongo et al 2004 the μ value is successful in ranking parameters in order of importance and performs well when the goal is identifying non influential parameters confalonieri et al 2006 the second measure σ is useful to detect parameters involved in interaction with other parameters or whose effect is non linear saltelli et al 2004 with this convention the more dangerous i e sensitive parameters are in the top right quadrant of the σ versus μ plot danger zone where both sensitivity and strength are high confalonieri et al 2006 for the new module the sa was conducted using the armosa integrated feature that allows the model to easily interact with the salib external library herman and usher 2017 this library implements many sensitivity analysis methods including morris in the case of apsim the sensitivity package iooss et al 2021 was used to setting the grid for the sa i e a data frame with the combinations of parameters to be evaluated to use this package the complementary apsimx package miguez 2022 interface was utilized to set and run the sa the functions belonging to the apsimx package also allow the user to open inspect read and edit the simulation file apsim in addition this package allows editing the configuration files xml where the default setting of the parameters is stored the code used to set the sa is available as supplemental material supplemental material 1 2 5 statistical analysis to evaluate the agreement between the different sensitivity rankings within each model the top down concordance coefficient was applied which allows to emphasize the agreement among rankings assigned to important parameters through the transformation of original data into savage scores savage 1954 savage scores are calculated as follows 2 s i j 1 n 1 j where i is the rank assigned to the rank i th order statistic in a sample of size n the i th rank has been assigned to the different μ for each parameter in a single sa after the conversion into savage scores the kendall s coefficient of concordance was applied this coefficient of concordance can be used to measure the agreement among b sets of rankings when b 2 iman and conover 1987 it is also known as the top down correlation coefficient because of its sensitivity to agreement among the top ranks it can be computed as 3 c t 1 b 2 n s 1 i 1 n s i 2 b 2 n where s i is the sum of the savage scores assigned to the i th object taken over all b sets of rankings the coefficient of concordance is associated with a p value under the kendall null hypothesis that the p judges or raters i e set of sas produce independent rankings of the objects or subjects i e parameters to preserve the correct type i error siegel and castellan 1988 recommended the use of a permutation based table of critical values for c t only when the number of parameters is 7 when the number of parameters exceeds seven they recommended using the χ2 distribution approximation thus according to the parameters number the p value of each coefficient of concordance was obtained with the χ2 distribution for the new module 14 parameters evaluated and with the permutation based method for apsim 7 parameters evaluated legendre et al 2005 both the c t and the p values coefficients were automatically retrieved from all sets of ranks using the r package synchrony tarik 2019 using the ranking ties correction when necessary 3 results 3 1 models parameters similarities and differences between the new module and apsim the two modeling approaches i e the new module and apsim utilized different parameters to simulate surface residue biomass decomposition table 1 appendix a only five of them cnopt and cnslope accounting for the cn ratio of the residue biomass topt accounting for the optimal temperature for decomposition cfrt accounting for the area to mass ratio of residue biomass and bf crit accounting for the critical flat residue biomass above which the decomposition is slower are in common since they have the same biological meaning and role within the simulated process other parameters reflect the different approaches adopted starting from the potential decomposition rates the new module uses two different parameters one for leaves pdrf leaves and one for the rest of flat biomass pdrf these potential decomposition rates are further defined specifically for each crop the third potential decomposition rate pdrs was not used in this study because of the lack of standing residue apsim instead uses a single potential decomposition rate bf degr regardless the residue biomass component the limitation of biomass decomposition due to soil water is represented by four parameters in the new module swcmin swcoptmin swcoptmax maoptb and maopta eq 10a appendix a table 1 whereas only by one parameter cum eos max in apsim furthermore the new module uses the wettmulch and the convfct parameters to define the residue biomass water retention and to account for the effect of wind and snow on the standing residue biomass respectively other model parameters belonging to armosa are not included in this analysis because they are not directly related to decomposition and were left at their default value 3 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis results are described separately for the new module and for apsim within each of these approaches sa results are presented for each crop in the rotation table 2 3 2 1 new decomposition module implemented in armosa the results differed based on the crop and the period of the year in which residues decompose in the case of maize topt bf crit and swcmin had the highest effect on decomposition with no differences between ssp and lsp top right quadrant in fig 3 a 3b another important parameter involved in the process was cnopt while all the other parameters had μ equal or close to zero fig 3a 3b for rye a clear pattern was visible only in 2017 rye 2 fig 3i 3 l when the swcmin i e minimum residue water content for decomposition process expressed as a proportion of field water capacity showed constantly a more relevant effect than all the other parameters in 2015 i e rye 1 the same pattern appeared only in lsp fig 3d in ssp fig 3c instead bf crit and topt appeared in the top right quadrant together with swcmin the impact of these three parameters could be discriminated by ranking on the basis of σ topt maintained an essential role but its interactions with other parameters were low in the case of soybean topt still had the same importance as found in maize no other parameters had a significant influence on model outputs as indicated by low μ fig 3e 3f for wheat sa showed a clear pattern in ssp with swcmin covering the largest μ percentage compared to all the other parameters fig 3g values of μ decreased smoothly in lsp from right to left but with discontinuities allowing to distinguish the most influential parameters swcmin ranked first followed by bf crit topt swcoptmin and pdrf fig 3h a valuable indication of the sa results can be retrieved by averaging the savage scores paleari et al 2021 of the sensitivity metrics estimated for the different crops and simulation periods data not shown the average final ranking allowed us to identify the top parameters associated with surface residue decomposition regardless of the crop and of the period of decomposition starting from the most relevant the top five parameters were topt swcmin bf crit pdrf and pdrf leaves kendall s coefficient of concordance computed on the whole set of ten sas showed a high concordance value c t 0 86 p value 0 001 meaning that the ten different rankings significantly agreed in the definition of the most important parameters table 3 shows the coefficient of concordance and the associated p value among all the sas on average the concordance values within each crop between the short and long period were always high c t 98 99 table 3 and significant p value 0 05 these values reflected the high concordance of the top ranks within every single crop as shown in fig 3 even though some differences were found for parameters with lower importance i e lower values of μ based on the season during which the crop residue decomposition occurs fig 2 different crop residues can be compared maize residues mostly degraded in the same season as soybean indeed the two sa conducted in the two ssp had high concordance c t 0 96 p value 0 023 table 3 confirming the significant effect of topt and bf crit if we consider the lsp of the same crops the coefficient of concordance is still significantly high c t 0 97 p value 0 024 table 3 emphasizing again the importance of air temperature and residue biomass critical amount i e bf crit the critical level of flat residue biomass above which the decomposition is slower for the surface decomposition process in this specific crop rotation the wheat residues had the longest time of decomposition 262 days overall covering the soil differently from the other crop residues from late autumn to early summer seasons for this reason it seemed not reasonable to compare it with the other crops the two rye cover crops instead were terminated almost in the same period and their residues remained on the soil surface until the end of august thus the coefficients of concordance confirmed the relevance of the soil water content with swcmin being the most critical parameter on the surface decomposition process even if c t was lower compared to those above for the short simulation periods c t 0 93 p value 0 029 while for the long simulation period c t 0 92 p value 0 033 this is mainly due to the second and third positions alternately belonging to topt bf crit or pdrf in the parameter rankings of the two cover crops belonging to different parameters 3 2 2 the apsim model compared to armosa the apsim model has a lower number of parameters which cause a lower parameter overlapping in the diagnostic diagrams fig 4 as for maize sa outputs varied between the ssp and lsp the topt parameter clearly had an important role in the surface decomposition process in both simulation periods but the effect was variable for the other parameters fig 4a 4b in fact bf crit played a key role in the ssp while the potential decomposition rate bf degr assumed a crucial weight for the lsp all the other parameters i e cnopt cnslope cfrt and cum eos max even with lower values of σ also reported lower values of μ thus they were far away from the top right quadrant for the rye cover crop the results showed a similar parameters response between ssp and lsp within a single year but differences emerged when comparing 2015 i e rye 1 to 2017 i e rye 2 in 2015 the most critical parameter was the cum eos max which scored the highest value in both ssp and lsp fig 4c 4d in the second and third positions of the ranking we found the bf degr and cfrt varying between lsp and ssp all the other parameters have μ values close to zero not affecting the sa output in 2017 the most sensitive parameters remained the same as in 2015 but their ranks became considerably different the temperature had a significant effect on the decomposition process increasing the weight of the topt parameter in the sa analysis fig 4i 4 l the potential decomposition rate bf degr is in the middle of the diagram for both ssp and lsp always followed by cum eos max similar results have been observed also in soybean when topt had the most significant impact against all the other parameters fig 4e 4f in both simulation periods focusing on ssp the sa evidenced bf crit and bf degr as essential parameters affecting the decomposition process since they are located in the top right quadrant in the long period the weight of bf crit and bf degr is less evident and it is comparable with the weight of cnopt in lsp the clusters of these three last parameters can be easily distinguished for all the other parameters even though their impact is negligible wheat is the only crop heavily influenced by the bf degr parameter which is constantly at the top right angle of the diagram fig 4g 4h nevertheless the situation becomes different when comparing the ssp with lsp bf crit had a higher μ value in lsp with a high σ value too in ssp bf crit maintained high μ value but decreased the interaction with other parameters lower σ value in the bottom left quadrant the other parameters are less sensitive bf crit and topt had predominant roles in the lsp diagram compared to cnopt cnslope cfrt and cum eos max parameters averaging the savage scores of the sensitivity metrics estimated for the different crops and periods led to an averaged ranking data not shown the optimum temperature for decomposition topt led the rank followed by the potential decomposition rate bf degr the critical residue mass bf crit and the cumulative potential soil evaporation cum eos max kendall s coefficient of concordance computed on the whole set of ten sa was relatively low c t 0 43 the ten different rankings do not greatly agree with each other in defining the most critical parameters involved in the residue decomposition process even with a significative test p value 0 001 table 4 shows the coefficient of concordance and the associated p value between all the combinations of sa in apsim within each crop the concordance values between ssp and lsp were significant p 0 05 except for maize and with values almost stable around 90 table 4 these values reflected the high concordance of the top ranks within every single crop based on the season under which the crop residue decomposition occurs fig 2 as already shown with the new module implemented in armosa different crop residues can be compared to each other previously maize was compared with soybean since the decomposition season of residue was almost the same also in the case of apsim the two crop residues led to similar sa outputs both the comparisons between sa conducted on the short period i e maize s and soybean s and long period i e maize l and soybean l have high coefficients of concordance c t 0 95 and c t 0 82 respectively even if only the first was significant at the 5 threshold these coefficients revealed that topt bf crit and bf degr are the most influent parameters involved in the decomposition process of these crop residue it is also worth comparing the two cover crops i e rye 1 and rye 2 since their residues decompose in the same season and belong to the same crop species nevertheless for apsim the concordance coefficients were around 70 but not significant for the short and long period of decomposition p value 0 10 4 discussion performing a set of ten different analyses based on different crop residues simulation periods table 2 and different seasons during the year fig 2 allowed us to detect the sensitivity of the two models to the main parameters involved in surface residue decomposition moreover since the sa results change according to the duration of the simulation i e according to the value of the dependent variable at the last time step saltelli et al 2000 the definition of different simulation periods ssp and lsp for each crop was useful to better define the parameters role on residue decomposition kinetics in fact considering a single crop at the time i e increasing the simulation period allowed us to detect if some parameters maintained their sensitivity when moving from ssp to lsp differences between simulation periods may have happened because of the different conditions or because more rapid decomposition occurred during the early stages of the decomposition dorissant et al 2022 4 1 the impact of simulation periods the variation of parameter sensitivity between the two simulation periods within a single crop was usually lower in the new module higher coefficients of concordance than in apsim except for the rye 1 crop in this case the impact of topt and bf crit was higher in ssp than in lsp fig 3c probably before the summer period july and august 2015 when swcmin was by far the most relevant parameter moorhead et al 1996 the lower temperature and the initial amount of residues 2 85 mg ha 1 have contributed to slow the decomposition in the early stages thus impacting the sa output the parameters sensitivity under rye 2 was more homogeneous comparing ssp and lsp in fact the temperature during april and may was on average slightly greater compared to 2015 i e not strongly limiting the decomposition and especially the initial amount of residues 2 23 mg ha 1 was closer to the bf crit threshold 2 00 mg ha 1 comparing crop residues that decomposed in the same season the sensitivity analysis of the new module almost ended with the same parameter ranking as in the case of maize vs soybean or rye 1 vs rye 2 this is related to the high dependency of surface decomposition on the environmental factors rather than on biomass specific characteristics iqbal et al 2015 lee et al 2014 marinari et al 2015 sanaullah et al 2012 in apsim the sa concordance between short and long simulation periods within each crop was lower than in the new module in other words the apsim parameters reacted more to the simulation period increment regardless the crop residues considered this is evident by observing the sa results of maize c t 0 79 p value 0 1 table 4 and wheat c t 0 93 p value 0 012 table 4 shown in fig 3 in the case of maize the initial amount of residues 11 7 mg ha 1 probably had a more considerable impact on the ssp sa output compared to the analysis spread between 17 09 2014 and 28 04 2015 lsp this is confirmed by the mathematical implementation shared with armosa and reported in eq 13a appendix a when bf bf crit then the decomposition is reduced exponentially moving away from the harvest date i e increasing the duration of the decomposition the bf crit lost its importance as already noted with rye 1 with the new module favoring the temperature through topt and the potential decomposition rate bf degr limitations fig 4b in the case of wheat instead fig 4g 4h the role of bf crit together with topt became higher in the long compared to the short period this is probably due to the inclusion of the winter season in the long period that decreased the bf degr impact compared to the other parameters in other words when temperature does not limit decomposition as it frequently happens during the short period for wheat the potential decomposition rate bf degr is the parameter that limits the process the most ricciuto et al 2021 conversely in the long period most of the decomposition occurs during the coldest months of the year therefore the temperature interacts more with other parameters higher value of σ fig 4h as showed in this case with bf crit 4 2 most important parameters on residue decomposition 4 2 1 new decomposition module the highly significant coefficients of concordance for the whole set of ten sas highlighted the importance of the top ranking parameters specifically all the sas conducted with the new module indicated that topt and swcmin are the most influential parameters as confirmed by the average ranking the topt parameter reflects the optimum temperature for the activity of the microbial community that is primarily involved in residue decomposition averill and waring 2018 findeling et al 2007 whose importance is well recognized and gives the temperature a crucial role in the simulations of this process moorhead et al 1996 when the temperature is not the limiting factor the swcmin became the most influential parameter confirming that moisture limitation is also essential in this process coppens et al 2007 especially if the residues are left on the soil surface lee et al 2014 swcmin is related to soil water retention it defines the minimum residue water content for decomposition expressed as a proportion of field water capacity as expected this parameter limited the decomposition mainly for crop residues laying on the soil surface during the dry period such as in spring in rye or even partially in summer in wheat during the autumn winter period when soil water content is not limiting anymore the importance of this parameter became lower in maize or even roughly negligible in soybean in the new module approach swcmin is used in the moisture factor equation eq 10a appendix a representing the influence of soil water content on flat residue wetness and consequently on their decomposition rate in armosa this parameter is based on the soil water content while other modeling approaches are based on the biomass water content findeling et al 2007 even if the biomass water content rather than the soil water content is in principle more adequate the soil water content of the top layer appears to be a good proxy of surface residue water content in fact the mass adjacent to the soil tends to adsorb water and to be rewetted by the underneath soil layer iqbal et al 2015 in a phenomenon defined sponge effect kravchenko et al 2017 the role of the bf crit parameter i e the critical flat residue biomass above which the decomposition is slower in the new module is worth mentioning eight out of ten sas included it in the list of the first three most influencing parameters even though bf crit is not explicitly related to the crop biomass properties it is linked to the specific crop management for example in the cases of maize and wheat the high amount of surface residues found after the harvest is a direct consequence of a farmer management choice this parameter indirectly reflects the thickness of surface residue biomass suggesting that the more residue biomass the slower the decomposition process its importance was already reported by thorburn et al 2001 who stated that the upper mulch layer i e the layer that is not in contact with the soil has a negligible decomposition rate the response of the model to this situation i e when crop residue biomass is greater than 2 mg ha 1 table 1 bf crit is essential to avoid early overestimation of the carbon and nitrogen accumulation in soil due to the whole residue decomposition after a harvest termination event fang et al 2019 further model improvements may consider recent findings that demonstrated that the upper mulch layer slowly decomposes and that there is a gradient of moisture and decomposition rate dietrich et al 2019 we concluded that for the new module implemented in armosa an accurate estimation of topt swcmin and bf crit is needed to properly simulate the residue decomposition on the other hand it seems also reasonable to include the two potential decomposition rates pdrf and pdrf leaves within the set of most influential parameters nevertheless even if μ for these parameters was always not null they never appeared in the most critical top right quadrant fig 3 for the new module this is probably due to the large impact of the environmental factors on decomposition as indicated by topt and swcmin in addition the fact that different pdrf and pdrf leaves values were assigned to each crop table 1 did not overestimate or underestimate the maximum rate of residue decomposition i e making the parameters impacting more on the sa leaving the other parameters to drive this process 4 2 2 the apsim model looking at the general trends found in apsim the impact of the different parameters partially reflected what was found in the new module implemented in armosa we found topt and bf degr in the first two ranking positions in almost all apsim s sas most of the sas confirmed the high weight of these parameters except for the rye cover crop in 2015 rye 1 fig 4c 4d this behavior in 2015 probably reflects the low water availability during summer 180 mm of rainfall between 21 04 2015 and 28 08 2015 limiting surface decomposition through the cum eos max parameter more than other factors thus except for this specific situation the only parameter related to water availability cum eos max did not influence the output as swcmin did with the new module the apsim moisture factor considers the water availability using the cumulative potential soil evaporation and thus the critical cumulative evaporation cum eos max to depict the effect that dry residues decompose more slowly than wet residues dietrich et al 2019 therefore in this case a soil property has been used as a proxy for surface residue moisture contrary to the new module the apsim potential decomposition rate bf degr significantly impacted the sa output compared to the other parameters involved the assumption of a unique default value for the decomposition rate bf degr 0 1 kg m 2 day 1 in the apsim model undoubtedly impacted the sa results more than the crop specific rates employed in the new armosa module specific calibration of this parameter is necessary to properly calibrate the model another similarity in the behavior of the two approaches concerns the importance of bf crit this parameter is taken from the apsim equation that limits the decomposition based on the residue amount on the soil surface sharing the same equation the two models gave comparable weight to the limitation of the decomposition rate above a 2 mg ha 1 residue biomass threshold confirming that the models responded in the same way to the amount of crop residue as a general trend the two approaches gave comparable results for crop residue that share the same season of decomposition highlighting the impact of environmental conditions this agrees with francos et al 2003 and richter et al 2010 who stated that sensitivity analysis refers to specific conditions and it is not a general property of a model at least for the new module the high value of the concordance coefficient computed on the whole set of sas highlighted that some parameters are the most important regardless the specific conditions of the crop biomass the low plasticity value obtained for apsim l 0 14 describes a model with higher plasticity compared to the new module l 0 27 in other words apsim has more capability to react to an environmental change by altering the importance of its parameters confirming the lower value of concordance coefficients in the discussion above we highlighted that in the new module the topt and swcmin had always a great impact on the sas probably leading to a lower plasticity compared to apsim nevertheless situations like rye 1 or wheat comparing ssp and lsp in fig 3 still defined a module capable to change its parameters sensitivity to the environmental changes 5 conclusions with this work a new module has been developed to explicitly include surface residue pools in many relevant modeling processes in fact the implementation of this new module into armosa allowed to simulate many processes in which crop residues laying on the soil surface play a crucial role in water and nutrient cycling dynamics despite previous implementation of surface crop residue decomposition we developed a new module that simulates this process including all the important factors that give a complete representation of residue decomposition the apsim model was used as a benchmark this model was selected for its algorithm affinity to armosa and for being a cropping system model widely cited in the literature a sensitivity analysis was conducted for each crop residue under analysis i e maize rye soybean and wheat in the present sa we distinguished between long and short simulation periods with the advantage of recognizing if some parameters within single crop impacted on the decomposition process regardless the different environmental conditions the most important parameters in the new module reflected the impact of air temperature topt soil water content swcmin and residue biomass bf crit on the decomposition process the two decomposition rates pdrf and pdrf leaves had minor importance highlighting that when setting crop specific values other environment related parameters are more relevant for the actual decomposition rate the apsim model showed a lower concordance of sa results passing from a crop residue to another and even when comparing short and long simulation periods within the same crop for maize and wheat the sa output showed how the duration of the decomposition along different seasons could heavily influence the parameters impact as a general trend we always found topt and bf degr parameters in the first two rank positions in addition having assumed a unique default value for the decomposition rate bf degr could have impacted surface residue destiny more than the new module decomposition rates the outcome of this work allowed us to identify the most relevant parameters for a future work of the model calibration and to evaluate its behavior under variable conditions of the residue surface decomposition process credit authorship contribution statement tommaso tadiello conceptualization software

24216,this study discussed the malaysian household consumer perception of domestic wastewater management from food waste moreover the solutions for wastewater flow rehabilitation were established based on the material flow analysis mfa model for malaysian household systems the research scope includes creating an allied scientific platform and introducing a socio material analysis approach for urban rural scale wastewater flow management in malaysia in this approach background information was collected from mental model mm observations on food flow this model showed malaysia s household agents current state of conduct beliefs and action supported by the mfa primary and secondary data the leading research detailed an mfa diagram framework and a questionnaire conducted with selected household respondents residing in urban and rural areas the study also contained in depth interviews with selected stakeholders who explained their views on the importance of understanding knowledge and social responsibility towards malaysia s integrated wastewater management system the solution developed identified a close gap to understand the context of ethnopedology literature and the empirical context in food wastewater flow management this idea is specific for households based on the object tool and subject perspectives keywords wastewater management household sector food flow mental model mm material flow analysis mfa malaysia data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction wastewater management involves indirect and direct mixing of domestic wastewater sources including sinks bathtubs toilets washing machines and kitchens business and industrial stormwater runoff and agricultural accordingly sustainability plays a crucial role in fulfiling safe water access for the nation s citizens food security environmental protection and economic growth for example mixed wastewater treatment changed from a linear to a cyclical economic model complementing existing policy directions including collaborative governance water resource sustainability and assurance liu et al 2021 takeda et al 2021 the wastewater flow management from food sources is dependant on the intensity of human food consumption for survival padeyanda et al 2015 and the challenge of closing the wastewater flow cycle downstream varies from time period to space location households are the primary contributors to domestic wastewater greywater and blackwater where most units have access to toilets or sewerage systems with sanitation in 2019 this group of households or families in malaysia contributed to 44 5 equivalent to 16 667 tonnes of food waste per day swcorp 2020 an initial pilot study of swcorp 2020 suggests that household consumers from urban areas potentially save food flow from becoming wastewater in a particular landscape most wastewater management from food flow sources is often disrupted by wastewater diversion crises such as water pollution sewerage overflow inappropriate residential renovations non revenue water food waste and others hence the solution must be explored and enhanced in innovation flows to its optimum momentum essentially the deteriorating performance of food wastewater flow is typically aggravated by two critical crises social structures and spreading environmental emissions across regional borders chang et al 2021 in 2018 the department of environment reported that malaysia s emissions include 304 kgtons of suspended solids load ssl 232 kgtons of biochemical oxygen demand bod and 75 kgtons of ammoniacal nitrogen load chai 2020 however there are challenges associated with the science based plan including technology integration into water services furthermore rural areas may lack centralised water treatment systems compared to urban areas resulting in increased wastewater leakage into bodies of water posing health risks to consumers lastly there is an urgent need to enhance science technology and innovation sti and research and development r d knowledge to improve the efficiency of water treatment plants and sewage systems the wastewater flow management system derived from food should be strongly linked to the possibility of administrative drawbacks when confronted with social political and economic issues these predicaments comprise the need to reorganise the water management regime and the extent to which various levels of government collaborate for example divergences in law enforcement and policy of the federal state or territory governments may result in several consequences including increased operational complexity and price volatility for water tariff schemes others include restrictions on intervention by industry players and water users followed by the strengthening of scientific platforms morris et al 2021 the enquiry combines the aforementioned social science components with a circular wastewater flow network demonstrating the vital requirement for the wastewater management system which generate sustainability periodically thus this study developed several critical components namely subject engagement the theme applied to items and a conceptual model framework for the socio value chain of food wastewater flows significantly various wastewater management issues must be addressed including the influence of pollution emissions the impact of economic political development environmental regulation and technological advancements followed by governance systems thus the following questions in this study are listed below rq1 what a material flow analysis mfa model be built to accurately identify the total distribution of wastewater flows from a food source by the household sector moreover how does the model mark the dynamic collaboration locations of different agent subject nodes in the mfa system chain rq2 how can a mental model mm be developed based on mapping the understanding of metacognition by interest groups to meet the basic requirements based on a socio ecological system rq3 how can the mfa and mms methods framework be applied to present a socio material flow model for a socio ecological system the remainder of this article is organised as follows part 2 summarises the research on the mm and mfa approaches part 3 describes the proposed model framework s workflow methodology and development procedures meanwhile part 4 explains the mfa model and covers the study s findings in detail beginning with the demonstrative layers of household wastewater cases in the food system ending with the food system itself additionally part 5 outlines the study s rationale and the final section summarises the work and provides recommendations for further research 2 literature review in the household sector wastewater system management typically involves daily domestic water discharge by blackwater the process includes domestic wastewater treatment via individual septic tanks and discharging greywater directly into the river light greywater emanates from bathroom sinks bathtubs and washbasins while dark greywater emanates from kitchens according to span 2020 malaysia s households comprise four family members producing approximately 135 000 litres of greywater annually with average daily water consumption of 226 litres furthermore it is stated that the average production of blackwater by the malaysian population is 6 million tons annually malaysia s domestic wastewater management provides strengths and weaknesses to stakeholders in conducting modification procedures according to their suitability by comparison domestic blackwater management exhibit significantly greater efficiency than greywater this situation occurs due to the primary water flow connected with sewerage pipes to receive treatment systems including communal septic tanks imhoff tanks oxidation ponds and mechanical plants at the secondary water flow level accordingly indah water konsortium iwk sdn bhd operates malaysia s wastewater treatment a national sewerage company with full service and maintenance rights since 1994 their service has covered multiple states except for sabah sarawak and several districts in johor in 2019 iwk successfully provided wastewater treatment services involving 6727 sewage treatment plants with 20 000 km of sewerage pipeline network 1189 pump stations with a population of 25 million the kitchen s greywater or random water are channelled to drains or discharged directly into drains or puddles potentially increasing environmental pollution if not treated properly filali et al 2022 compared to blackwater greywater s recovery capacity presents a significant disadvantage its recovery efficiency depends on external factors public awareness and internal factors regulations and laws in meeting natural based solutions for water systems the involvement of household users other players and local enforcers perceivably drive the strength acquisition to overcome weaknesses in the sustainable management of domestic wastewater periodically in malaysia approximately 38 per cent of public wastewater treatment plants are mechanical plants while the other 68 per cent are non mechanical plants that use connected services span 2020 however potential threats emerge such as pollution and loss of wastewater flow for disconnected system facilities especially in suburban and rural areas recent studies on domestic wastewater management focused on developing environmental decision support systems aiming to manage the wastewater supply chain in a sustainable and green economic circular manner the systems include life cycle assessment lca techniques geographic information systems gis techniques wasda cost benefit analysis cba data envelopment analysis dea and directional distance function ddf rashid and liu 2020 sabeen 2018 kamarudin et al 2016 the lca theoretical framework is created by tracking the load value of wastewater flows in a centralised wastewater treatment plant system linking it with the seasonal distribution of rainwater flow rashid and liu 2020 moreover the model is developed by selecting functional units and tightly regulating the indicators such as nutrients effluent and electricity usage to minimise environmental impacts several studies have examined wastewater management in malaysia s social environment munusami et al 2014 2017 the integrated gis tool assists iwk in effectively communicating with consumers regarding sewerage systems including bills infrastructure references and demonstrations idris et al 2021 other scholars conducted a literature review on the structure and costs of a sustainable centralised wastewater treatment plant ho et al 2021 sabeen et al 2018 it was reported that greater emphasis had been placed on developing a decision support system model for local cases to mitigate environmental degradation notably the local newspapers emphasise that appropriate research must be conducted to determine the wastewater elements and contaminants that must be treated first despite the current material flow balancing studies researchers have neglected to simulate the wastewater cycle chain system in malaysia s setting however several scholars created the mfa model for wastewater management systems in the malaysian context latifah et al 2020 ali et al 2013 shahbudin and kamal 2020 latifah and noor zalina 2011 according to the preceding discussions this study primarily focuses on moving the socio wastewater management framework for household wastewater from an existing perspective rather than exploring the complexity inherent in the dynamic model of the domestic wastewater chain it was discovered that the change in the aspects of technological science frequently contradicts the social dimensions of water scheme practitioners owing to the erratically disparate performance of the portfolios incurred by them consequently the socio flow materials mfa s technique was utilised to investigate organise and optimise the recovery efficiency of the traditional malaysian household wastewater chain 3 research methodology the proposed integrated conceptual framework in the current literature was tested using a combined method of quantitative and qualitative case studies zan et al 2020 prouty et al 2020 abdallah et al 2020 colella et al 2021 this paper aims to assist wastewater practitioners in examining challenges and strategies from various disciplines and systems fig 1 illustrates the mfa s methodology to examine the material flow link based on its mass perspective the materials include stocks inflows outflows processes imports and exports from a social perspective the materials comprise social networking within the wastewater governance system in other words the demand for a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary socio ecological system can close the knowledge gap associated with addressing various types of environmental sanitation management challenges following current standards notably the triangulated and empirical mfa s model is adequate to present the complicated variables in the wastewater metabolic system this study uses the enforcement of socio flow management knowledge based on a socio ecological concept to address the challenges and questions raised above using two methods a mfa is defined as the principle of mass equilibrium based on space and time in which quantitative processes and models are developed additionally data analyses are interpreted using stationary modelling and system policy scenarios amicarelli et al 2020 kullmann et al 2021 abualtaher and bar 2019 in recent years advances in mfa research have offered broader potential in implementing real life material flow footprints such as using the stock flow service sfs method and stock flow practice sfp nexus others include industrial ecology material flow cost accounting flux analysis and symbiosis industry haberl et al 2021 fei et al 2021 tran and herzig 2020 these models have been expanded from the original concept of mfa sfa involving heterotic disciplinary trajectory this idea provides more comprehensive feedback resulting from the combined response of the selected system drivers gregory and john 2019 b the mental model mm is an external reality picture provider based on the cohesion of collective knowledge of allies from individuals to provide a better understanding of the ecological social system kousoulis and goldie 2021 upreti et al 2021 kelsi et al 2021 in the context of effective environmental management the model assists policymakers in forecasting performance and exploring potential social sustainability for adoption accordingly establishing a cross epistemological framework can be crucial for solving internal problems of organisations perpetrators and external problems of materials this idea delivers a healthy socio scientific competition and further understanding the complexity of human dominated wastewater flow ecosystems while drawing critical conclusions vis à vis the success of their relationships 3 1 mfa method this paper utilises the core mfa methodology to study the balance level of wastewater flows from malaysia s households in this article the development of the mfa model framework consists of seven broad steps 1 choosing the system boundaries and temporal scale in the wastewater management system 2 collect and process priority data 3 develop a diagram framework for stocks and wastewater flows that considers a variety of uncertainties 4 identify flows related to use accumulation and release into the environment or each subsystem 5 analyse material flow data using stan 2 6 software 6 interpret the material flow results according to each stage of the wastewater coil chain and 7 make recommendations for wastewater cycle closure reclamation the mfa balancing approach is used in this study to simulate the calculation of the balance of entering outgoing import export and stock wastewater flows the supplemental section includes two tables refer table s1 and table s2 with attached parameters for wastewater flow calculations and sources for reference data collection including from department of environment malaysia doe 2020 department of irrigation and drainage did 2020 economic planning unit epu 2020 ipcc 2006 mhlg 2020 department of environment dos

the seven equations of the waste water balance model which are supported by the findings of numerous scholars including amann et al 2018 shahbudin and kamal 2020 and others and take into consideration the essential qualities of the household sector study scope scenario can be written as follows 1 w w h h m i o m 3 y r h h p o w u s e l c a p d a y where σ wwhh is total household wastewater from

map the system s elements frequently used to understand the causes and effects of the system s disruptions lamere et al 2020 this model was developed using a blurred cognitive map and qualitative analysis accordingly three key elements were identified based on previous literature surveys in malaysia previous mfa empirical models were also determined including issues with wastewater management from a domestic food source other issues discussed comprise causal relationships of positive or negative expectations regarding current food wastewater management the final issue outlines the formulations and recommendations for intervention strategies simulating wastewater management scenarios for short term and long term support oh et al 2018 table 1 illustrates the interview conducted with 37 specialists and non experts to obtain more accurate and consistent information the survey was conducted in the malay language and then translated to english following the completion of data collection in november 2020 we presented selected examples of the respondent s cognitive map depiction for each construct in the 4 3 results section this depiction is combined with the extraction of significant statements from the case study interview transcript during the first phase of the evaluation phase two of the evaluation involves the mfa s basic model framework development which contains vital elements shown in table 1 next the fcm and mfa hybrid techniques were tested using the mental modeler computer programme i e www mentalmondeler org for the following reasons this modelling software supports data consolidation that meets expectations suitable for resource planning and the environment white et al 2021 it supports the inclusion of various elements and stakeholder participation to function effectively in socio ecological systems aminpour et al 2020 finally the method is based on the learning and teaching concepts to explore test and verify the present gaps and conflicts tarnanen et al 2021 in this study other purposes of fcm usage are collecting individual models group model revision intervention development and advanced scenarios meanwhile the vague cognitive mapping method includes vertically and horizontally combining matrix adjacency and phyton codes with a substantial negative scale to produce strong positives these scales present values of 1 to 1 to display the element s cause effect relationships with the nodes of this study pérez teruel et al 2015 next the metric network measurement simplifies the final process by performing scenario analysis with a leaner and higher thinking system for instance respondents were asked to voice their formulations and opinions on improving the weaknesses of mixed domestic greywater management practices compared to blackwater simulated considerations revolve around how additional drivers would impact the closure of the wastewater round cycle in this study these drivers include centralised wastewater system treatment technology economic costs and socio political influences hence it is crucial to uncover the underlying beliefs of the subject group in the influence of decision making accordingly two separate models namely expert models and non expert models or civilian models should be developed to clarify the thought patterns that appear in the form of decision support jajac et al 2019 4 results and discussions 4 1 the case of food wastewater flow mfa based on the mfa work procedure by baccini and brunner 2012 the mfa model for domestic wastewater management is presented in fig 2 specifically the waste flow originated from food sources based on the scale of malaysia s households in 2020 fig 2 shows the balance of inflows and outflows of malaysia s domestic wastewater from the food source in 2020 by comparison the percentage differences in wastewater flow generation by urban and rural scale is 81 with 542 kt yr and 19 with 128 kt yr respectively two high intensity streams can be categorised as hot spot flows to be noted by stakeholders these streams include blackwater or effluent outflows and greywater or drain water flows with a percentage of 87 and 34 the diversion of the two streams will provide a closure for the broken wastewater cycle and a circular cycle that supports the national domestic wastewater management for a green circular concept table 2 presents the percentage of the flow load based on the breakdown of wastewater products including household sector communal and industrial sectors markets and agriculture however the consideration only includes calculating domestic wastewater flows into the household system this situation is because the statistics and qualitative data are primarily available in producing organic waste inputs into the household sector excretion composition and flowing water per capita or balance of selected materials or mass furthermore the annual statistics by iwk 2020 shows that wastewater flows entering the household sector system can carry other waste sources and liquid waste products however it does not include organic industrial and agricultural wastes contributing to an overall annual consumption of 55 per cent this trend is expected to change due to socio economic factors such as income and per capita consumption the uncertainty error value displayed in table 2 confirms the unknown factors concerning the trend and fig 2 changes above specifically this trend determines whether it is influenced by data collection factors empirical data measurement model validation or the dissolution of certain statistical information meanwhile the broadest black arrow lines in fig 3 show the residual water flow load the blackwater and greywater mixed into a septic tank or a sewer system by 2020 the household sector s substantial waste production and materials harvesting is 1621 kt yr concurrently the garbage disposal collection sent to the disposal site is 1135 kt yr using a proxy of 8 2 million households i e private and personal households they contributed to 670 42 kt yr of domestic wastewater thus the total household contribution of food wastewater to groundwater after receiving treatment is 46 with a value of 302 5 kt yr this data assumes the post treated compost recycling range and organic solid waste enters the agricultural sector at 5 to 10 iwk 2018 hence this result indicates the last recorded wastewater outflow at 17 or 116 kt yr notably it is vital to reduce the load of nutrients resources and other pollutants in the environment the study recorded the most significant loss of wastewater flow into the garbage disposal site and environmental body at 37 or 241 kt yr in the waste collection accordingly wastewater restoration can reduce overall nutrients energy and resources imports in the study area by approximately 38 this approach involves diverting wastes as a biosolid product reducing wastes through a dietary diet separating greywater and blackwater mixtures and improving educational quality and policy planning the study outlined the figures of wastewater flow as stock of the waste disposal site and the household wastewater management subsystem hence these subsystems can be used as comparative indicators with other solutions encompassing the dimensions of space time and boundaries the medium approach is considered most suitable for calculating the footprint of domestic food or wastewater flow in urban and rural areas belevi 2002 by utilising this approach the study has collected considerable information regarding annual organic waste production followed by domestic water consumption and material replacement for resource recovery the conceptual models of wastewater flux development involve the simple inflow and outflow model where only the critical material flow is identified hence most of the unavailable data has led to significant uncertainty errors given that the data is ambiguous with background information leaks additionally the errors can be derived from the diversity of other subsystem processes and the availability of information sharing from certain municipal councils this study used space scales comprising external environmental and internal system boundaries i e agricultural sector trade commercial and economy additionally timescales or annual sequence is utilised where both scales potentially provide significant data accuracy especially if the gauss law s volatility range is between 5 and 25 furthermore the three way flow analysis i e inflows outflows and internal flows explains the distribution patterns of wastewater infiltration from the ratio of water consumption per population moreover the analysis outlines the production of domestic food wastes which form greywater baths stoves laundry water and blackwater infiltration faeces and urine subsequently the waste is discharged via the sewerage system s final passage or overflow into groundwater and rivers the research on household sanitation resource management is beneficial based on the conceptual nexus system of comparing traces and material loads for wastewater systems furthermore these systems utilise additional indicators such as nutrients energy resources and water demonstrated in recent studies asgharnejad et al 2021 xu et al 2020 negi and chandel 2021 nonetheless this research aims to calculate domestic wastewater flow from food sources based on the selected subsystem moreover an early warning system is aimed at the problems associated with the weak points and the potential for wastewater recovery in malaysia accordingly the proposed solution can facilitate the cycle efficiency rate for the metabolic mfa model comprising three primary outflow components these components are related to the domestic wastewater management system and the single output of untreated wastewater hence this idea supports the integration of food wastewater management to overcome the challenges stated above 1 solid sludge output flow for biosolid reuse the rate of biosolid production from sludge in malaysia is significant and is frequently used in organic fertiliser electricity plantation such as crop growing others include landscaping land reclamation and incineration this biosolid output will be useful for household users after this product goes through sludge drying treatment 2 the output flow of sludge liquid for bio effluent recycling this sewage liquid can be reused as non potable water used in the industrial and plantation sectors according to span 2020 local authorities have used iwk wastewater for landscape irrigation and nurseries notably households with no proper sewerage treatment system are prone to wastewater leakage contaminating the quality of water supply which leads to costly treatments hence this study supports the households by providing exposure to blackwater management education on an ongoing basis 3 sludge gas output flow for biogas production this mfa study excludes the scope of calculation for gas emissions generated from sludge biogas production is excellent potential in the context of green economy circulars thus the outflows will be continuously recognised and remain relevant for discussion in this article the anaerobic digestion of sludge produces methane and carbon dioxide that can be used to generate power heat and biofuels for example a sewage treatment plant will use recycled biogas for electricity generation sludge digestion tank heating solar systems and recycling for plant use 4 other food outflows into the environment untreated wastewater the rate of greywater production from household systems in malaysia is substantial this issue has not received significant attention due to the inadequate public awareness of the importance of greywater flow mustafa and hayder 2021 according to oh et al 2018 greywater can be treated via gravel or sand filtration followed by the flotation technique subsequently the treated water can be reused for gardening recreational irrigation or toilet water households in urban or densely populated areas significantly benefit from this method as they regularly face water storage issues nevertheless food waste solid filters and individual oil traps in household residential areas must be enhanced irrespective of the population scale 4 2 the case of food wastewater system with mm table 3 shows the mm results vis à vis household value chain on wastewater management derived from food sources this result includes its relationship with the developed three variables obtained from a concept map based questionnaire and face to face interviews the following results describe a perceived problem often associated with the households response to managing wastewater from domestic food residues next the potential impacts are interrelated concerning the domestic food wastewater generated risk options and its benefits to human health and the environment finally appropriate solutions are explained in managing wastewater flow from food sources 4 2 1 the mm theme variable results an agent s understanding of interaction conflicts in complex socio ecological systems requires appropriate action coordination douglas et al 2019 hence the associative approach entails the mm and mfa methods notably the mm results found that the stakeholder group fun valued the in depth mfa model sheets for wastewater flow after being displayed to them during the interviews table 3 shows that 98 per cent of non experts wanted to know and practise food waste recycling and reuse treated wastewater to support the domestic environmental conservation effort furthermore these groups perceive that continuous wastage carries long term risks in terms of safety assurance hence the two critical variables that fill this case study s socio and ecological gaps were identified wastewater management education and multi agent collaborative involvement 4 2 2 mm clustering results for experts and non experts fig 3 and fig 4 display the modelling results for the mixed wastewater management network and greywater from food sources this result involves three elements tools subjects and objects based on the experts and non experts mm expectations in fig 3 the first stage clustering by experts recognises the object and tool elements namely the technical themes for the wastewater treatment plant systems the economy and the environment meanwhile the second clustering includes the themes of politics and social systems experts perceive that the implication of r d overflows and technological factors affect the performance of wastewater treatment especially when it reaches the economic turning points and environmental quality development the experts views support the development of new business models initiated at the beginning of the transition stage for example the modification of aluminium sludge disposal regulations must be classified as scheduled residues while the effluent quality reclamation should be refined ultimately this idea enhances the domestic wastewater management system concurrently developing environmental sustainability furthermore the study addressed three challenges that increase the domestic wastewater flow through the extrapolated mapping of experts local cognitive data namely i additional assessment support tools i e the mfa approach ii understanding the supply of wastewater resources in current and future green circulars and iii wastewater surveillance strategies that must be co supervised substantially as shown in fig 4 non experts outline the first stage cluster geared towards social and economic themes meanwhile the second stage cluster encompasses the environmental governance political and technical themes notably the economic theme was rejected by all the respondents in this study in which variables were placed such as proposed tax and sewerage service tariff with a maximum payment of rm250 next the social theme that forms the first batch of issues highlights the transparency of stakeholders which is expected to provide a comprehensive solution this issue specifies their engagement in management from start to finish given these points the study suggests the intervention of a multi level technique namely the layered bottom up and top down approach outlined by prouty et al 2020 moreover this method is combined with the centralised and decentralised treatment system proposed by diana et al 2021 combining socio economic and environmental themes for domestic wastewater round cycle systems can be beneficial finally this study acknowledges non experts understanding of the system comprising the strength of emotional and cognitive components mapped at their peaks these components include comprehension norms beliefs experiences behaviours intentions and attitudes as a result this idea produces a weak social network in the material flow cycle therefore it is crucial to strengthen the subjective base of household consumers through various platforms and social networks securing a balance between wastewater and food flow the heterogeneous cognitive modelling above highlights the respondents thinking system in wastewater management this idea influences their understanding and expectations of various actions concerning the study s elements objects and tools for example the vital information identified summarises that the wastewater governance in this country exhibit differing complexities and levels of success this level can be situated at the upstream and downstream levels due to the different arrangements of their respective institutions accordingly the federal government assumes responsibilities regarding water resources for its policy matters and the state government for its sustainability meanwhile the national water resources council nwrc shoulders its governance and the national water services commission span for its industry supervision therefore experts and non expert have reached a consensus from their deliberations on achieving the final vision for the following i the prospects for supporting the recovery of household wastewater access product introduction promotion and service ii the prospects for involving stakeholders from the grassroots level and iii the prospects for strengthening existing policies and domestic food wastewater management policies according to the thematic variables stated in table 2 the informative excerpt may also be pertinent in supporting the vision of this study the mm formed through the participation of experts and non experts were found to produce significant uncertainty due to specific issues i the loss of unofficial and informal flow networks excluded from the mfa system and the commencement of working methods ii the context convergence of the space and time scale for wastewater flow is not targeted in the meso and micro context and iii the socio system of material flow based on household system chain alone usually contradict the mms development thus it may not reflect other regionalisation of wastewater management these situations potentially inhibit supportive decision making and make it challenging to determine simulated scenarios for alternative material flow case studies however the findings from this research should be perceived as a positive contribution to the database development and literature references notably the development procedures of the integrated framework can be expanded to identify closed land domestic wastewater feedback loops from other paradigms 4 3 the case of socio value chain of food wastewater flows the domestic wastewater management system is linked to various factors through several directions and flows which are context specific fig 5 illustrates general directions in which the domestic wastewater flow system from food sources derived from the mfa model is influenced by two variables namely object and subject from the mm the importance of understanding the player s interaction with the theme s conflicts in achieving solutions if the disturbances are shifted schürmann and beckerle 2020 in a targeted manner ultimately supporting the national sustainable development object and tool the mfa tool demands qualitative and quantitative triangulated data to present a balance of material and stock flow paths these paths are based on the behaviour and influence of interacting themes in the study system however the mfa tool could not present the correlation between its results and the object theme factors in actual terms accordingly the flow for each material state can convey ideas interpretations and interactions as objects of study this idea is achieved by determining the material load in each subsystem and ascertaining the cause of the variable stock coefficient next mapping the causes and effects with the mm techniques provides a more helpful solution for the theoretical and practical interventions including the theme factors under the socio ecological umbrella the researcher utilises an adaptive cycle model to optimise the findings on the tool mfa and objects themes and apply the four sub categories concepts these concepts include governance users resource and resource units in an inclusive framework in essence this approach comprehensively addresses the challenges of social sciences and pure science hukkinen 2014 dressel et al 2018 subject and tool the mfa tool successfully identified the interactions between the biophysical system and the subject fig 4 the first stage variables from the subject encompass household groups and the compromise between experts and non experts in presenting a dynamic complex and risky socio ecological processing for the wastewater system the most significant challenge at the beginning of this study was the ambiguous exposure of the mm variables specifically these variables must be standardised at the end of the study s narrative and semantic equivalence hence the relevance of material touch and subject experience were identified by creating the mfa model framework during the first step of the study subject tool object in summary the database contained in the mfa output has successfully improved the supplementary visualisation system for cognitive research this idea develops a sustainable management process and assists the decision making support system for domestic wastewater management notably the two method combination forged a more authentic data representation as a final review this study proposed a socio flow analytical framework of materials which magnifies the assessment of hotspots in the wastewater round cycle system this framework must include a simulated proxy model from the mfa system and its extrapolation with additional discipline areas moreover textual package sheets that can be understood easily contribute to continuous improvements in the teaching and learning system in the socio material flow literature this idea provides opportunities for extracting information and solving research problems in a competitive setting 5 conclusion and policy recommendations this study presents the measures for using the basic procedures from the combined of the mfa method and mental model method to assess the management of food wastewater from the malaysian household sector in a single year the study aims to provide insights to policymakers in drafting a transition strategy from conventional to good wastewater management governance principles in other states and regions in malaysia the nonlinear balance of the imbalanced literacy rate on wastewater recovery between societies and technical experts and regulators sends the signal and the perception that the provision of the same teaching and learning options does not produce positive results that support the clean wastewater transformation process therefore providing different planning options according to actors social profile scenarios will produce better alternative output for the various environmental impacts for example allowing a combination of bottom up and top down approaches to control the high discharge of wastewater especially in congested housing urban and industrial areas such as in food processing factories restaurant premises homes and other related locations the annual cumulative value for the discharge of household wastewater into the environment was recorded at 348 9 kton yr in the entire case study region thus applying the industrial symbiosis elements to assess the social technological and environmental aspects can increase the efficiency of energy carbon sludge and nutrient recovery and circular economy investment development in suburban and rural areas increasing the centralization level for the technical aspects such as distance and diameter for pump stations and linking them with the green awareness perception of local populations and professional body support can create opportunities and implications of purchase recovery contained in wastewater flows including struvite nitrogen fertilizer water energy and other purchase products open questions regarding the barriers that can impede the expansion of the mfa and sna combination testing in a household wastewater management scenario can be addressed in several points clearly non traditional stakeholders consisting of the private sector and civil society lack knowledge about the benefits of the decision making support approach because they prioritize compliance and usage of quality wastewater as well as financing the treatment cost of treated wastewater furthermore the capability of the decision support system hybrid method is easily acknowledged and accepted by non conventional stakeholders including policymakers the government academicians and registered ngos because they need to actively promote wastewater green reform and give official attention to the regulatory framework for rules and laws on this wastewater situation however the challenge is in developing a complete wastewater database encompassing the entire economic social psychological technical and environmental dimensions as well as the capability to extend this model framework to real cases every municipal council in malaysia has to make serious effort in domestic wastewater social research consistent with the technological innovation development to reduce the thought paradigm friction between social actors and technical actors thus reducing the potential wastewater loss at the national level in future studies the mfa sna framework presented here should be extended to the industrial wastewater sector and other water sources this is because this integrated approach can provide a shortcut solution for minor wastewater cases while saving the research cost and time advancements in simulation technology stochastic and hypothetical models can improve this study s specific limitations hence further studies can fill the gaps of this study based on the wastewater governance aspect the polycentric model testing of the wastewater mfa sna system offers extraordinary and regular advantages for implementation planning for the policies that could not be implemented for example policies on local compliance inexpensive wastewater treatment options and health and environmental education from the metaheuristic novel perspective the relationship effects of social actors status in the functional system knowledge domain and space temporal scale result in an inhibitory effect on better water pollution reduction scientific planning and provision of sanitation systems perhaps urine diversion technology for nutrient centring can be implemented by adopting basic measures to change the perceptions of households and the public through the preliminary steps of promoting technology and basic education on wastewater management with this increased confidence it is possible to implement this idea in malaysia in summary the proposed solution is to modify a collective knowledge delivery system for sustainable domestic wastewater management this idea is based on basic teaching learning concepts encouraging and automating manual tasks by households to perceptively handle wastewater and food wastes the complexity presented in the mfa model prompts the expert group to engage in collaborative processes such as efficient strategic negotiations multi agent from experts and non experts collaboration reduces the complexity of wastewater management by cross mapping the social ecological problems of waste flow based on the current situation ultimately the proposed solution develops the association of relevant parties taxpayers and the government additionally value is added

24216,this study discussed the malaysian household consumer perception of domestic wastewater management from food waste moreover the solutions for wastewater flow rehabilitation were established based on the material flow analysis mfa model for malaysian household systems the research scope includes creating an allied scientific platform and introducing a socio material analysis approach for urban rural scale wastewater flow management in malaysia in this approach background information was collected from mental model mm observations on food flow this model showed malaysia s household agents current state of conduct beliefs and action supported by the mfa primary and secondary data the leading research detailed an mfa diagram framework and a questionnaire conducted with selected household respondents residing in urban and rural areas the study also contained in depth interviews with selected stakeholders who explained their views on the importance of understanding knowledge and social responsibility towards malaysia s integrated wastewater management system the solution developed identified a close gap to understand the context of ethnopedology literature and the empirical context in food wastewater flow management this idea is specific for households based on the object tool and subject perspectives keywords wastewater management household sector food flow mental model mm material flow analysis mfa malaysia data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction wastewater management involves indirect and direct mixing of domestic wastewater sources including sinks bathtubs toilets washing machines and kitchens business and industrial stormwater runoff and agricultural accordingly sustainability plays a crucial role in fulfiling safe water access for the nation s citizens food security environmental protection and economic growth for example mixed wastewater treatment changed from a linear to a cyclical economic model complementing existing policy directions including collaborative governance water resource sustainability and assurance liu et al 2021 takeda et al 2021 the wastewater flow management from food sources is dependant on the intensity of human food consumption for survival padeyanda et al 2015 and the challenge of closing the wastewater flow cycle downstream varies from time period to space location households are the primary contributors to domestic wastewater greywater and blackwater where most units have access to toilets or sewerage systems with sanitation in 2019 this group of households or families in malaysia contributed to 44 5 equivalent to 16 667 tonnes of food waste per day swcorp 2020 an initial pilot study of swcorp 2020 suggests that household consumers from urban areas potentially save food flow from becoming wastewater in a particular landscape most wastewater management from food flow sources is often disrupted by wastewater diversion crises such as water pollution sewerage overflow inappropriate residential renovations non revenue water food waste and others hence the solution must be explored and enhanced in innovation flows to its optimum momentum essentially the deteriorating performance of food wastewater flow is typically aggravated by two critical crises social structures and spreading environmental emissions across regional borders chang et al 2021 in 2018 the department of environment reported that malaysia s emissions include 304 kgtons of suspended solids load ssl 232 kgtons of biochemical oxygen demand bod and 75 kgtons of ammoniacal nitrogen load chai 2020 however there are challenges associated with the science based plan including technology integration into water services furthermore rural areas may lack centralised water treatment systems compared to urban areas resulting in increased wastewater leakage into bodies of water posing health risks to consumers lastly there is an urgent need to enhance science technology and innovation sti and research and development r d knowledge to improve the efficiency of water treatment plants and sewage systems the wastewater flow management system derived from food should be strongly linked to the possibility of administrative drawbacks when confronted with social political and economic issues these predicaments comprise the need to reorganise the water management regime and the extent to which various levels of government collaborate for example divergences in law enforcement and policy of the federal state or territory governments may result in several consequences including increased operational complexity and price volatility for water tariff schemes others include restrictions on intervention by industry players and water users followed by the strengthening of scientific platforms morris et al 2021 the enquiry combines the aforementioned social science components with a circular wastewater flow network demonstrating the vital requirement for the wastewater management system which generate sustainability periodically thus this study developed several critical components namely subject engagement the theme applied to items and a conceptual model framework for the socio value chain of food wastewater flows significantly various wastewater management issues must be addressed including the influence of pollution emissions the impact of economic political development environmental regulation and technological advancements followed by governance systems thus the following questions in this study are listed below rq1 what a material flow analysis mfa model be built to accurately identify the total distribution of wastewater flows from a food source by the household sector moreover how does the model mark the dynamic collaboration locations of different agent subject nodes in the mfa system chain rq2 how can a mental model mm be developed based on mapping the understanding of metacognition by interest groups to meet the basic requirements based on a socio ecological system rq3 how can the mfa and mms methods framework be applied to present a socio material flow model for a socio ecological system the remainder of this article is organised as follows part 2 summarises the research on the mm and mfa approaches part 3 describes the proposed model framework s workflow methodology and development procedures meanwhile part 4 explains the mfa model and covers the study s findings in detail beginning with the demonstrative layers of household wastewater cases in the food system ending with the food system itself additionally part 5 outlines the study s rationale and the final section summarises the work and provides recommendations for further research 2 literature review in the household sector wastewater system management typically involves daily domestic water discharge by blackwater the process includes domestic wastewater treatment via individual septic tanks and discharging greywater directly into the river light greywater emanates from bathroom sinks bathtubs and washbasins while dark greywater emanates from kitchens according to span 2020 malaysia s households comprise four family members producing approximately 135 000 litres of greywater annually with average daily water consumption of 226 litres furthermore it is stated that the average production of blackwater by the malaysian population is 6 million tons annually malaysia s domestic wastewater management provides strengths and weaknesses to stakeholders in conducting modification procedures according to their suitability by comparison domestic blackwater management exhibit significantly greater efficiency than greywater this situation occurs due to the primary water flow connected with sewerage pipes to receive treatment systems including communal septic tanks imhoff tanks oxidation ponds and mechanical plants at the secondary water flow level accordingly indah water konsortium iwk sdn bhd operates malaysia s wastewater treatment a national sewerage company with full service and maintenance rights since 1994 their service has covered multiple states except for sabah sarawak and several districts in johor in 2019 iwk successfully provided wastewater treatment services involving 6727 sewage treatment plants with 20 000 km of sewerage pipeline network 1189 pump stations with a population of 25 million the kitchen s greywater or random water are channelled to drains or discharged directly into drains or puddles potentially increasing environmental pollution if not treated properly filali et al 2022 compared to blackwater greywater s recovery capacity presents a significant disadvantage its recovery efficiency depends on external factors public awareness and internal factors regulations and laws in meeting natural based solutions for water systems the involvement of household users other players and local enforcers perceivably drive the strength acquisition to overcome weaknesses in the sustainable management of domestic wastewater periodically in malaysia approximately 38 per cent of public wastewater treatment plants are mechanical plants while the other 68 per cent are non mechanical plants that use connected services span 2020 however potential threats emerge such as pollution and loss of wastewater flow for disconnected system facilities especially in suburban and rural areas recent studies on domestic wastewater management focused on developing environmental decision support systems aiming to manage the wastewater supply chain in a sustainable and green economic circular manner the systems include life cycle assessment lca techniques geographic information systems gis techniques wasda cost benefit analysis cba data envelopment analysis dea and directional distance function ddf rashid and liu 2020 sabeen 2018 kamarudin et al 2016 the lca theoretical framework is created by tracking the load value of wastewater flows in a centralised wastewater treatment plant system linking it with the seasonal distribution of rainwater flow rashid and liu 2020 moreover the model is developed by selecting functional units and tightly regulating the indicators such as nutrients effluent and electricity usage to minimise environmental impacts several studies have examined wastewater management in malaysia s social environment munusami et al 2014 2017 the integrated gis tool assists iwk in effectively communicating with consumers regarding sewerage systems including bills infrastructure references and demonstrations idris et al 2021 other scholars conducted a literature review on the structure and costs of a sustainable centralised wastewater treatment plant ho et al 2021 sabeen et al 2018 it was reported that greater emphasis had been placed on developing a decision support system model for local cases to mitigate environmental degradation notably the local newspapers emphasise that appropriate research must be conducted to determine the wastewater elements and contaminants that must be treated first despite the current material flow balancing studies researchers have neglected to simulate the wastewater cycle chain system in malaysia s setting however several scholars created the mfa model for wastewater management systems in the malaysian context latifah et al 2020 ali et al 2013 shahbudin and kamal 2020 latifah and noor zalina 2011 according to the preceding discussions this study primarily focuses on moving the socio wastewater management framework for household wastewater from an existing perspective rather than exploring the complexity inherent in the dynamic model of the domestic wastewater chain it was discovered that the change in the aspects of technological science frequently contradicts the social dimensions of water scheme practitioners owing to the erratically disparate performance of the portfolios incurred by them consequently the socio flow materials mfa s technique was utilised to investigate organise and optimise the recovery efficiency of the traditional malaysian household wastewater chain 3 research methodology the proposed integrated conceptual framework in the current literature was tested using a combined method of quantitative and qualitative case studies zan et al 2020 prouty et al 2020 abdallah et al 2020 colella et al 2021 this paper aims to assist wastewater practitioners in examining challenges and strategies from various disciplines and systems fig 1 illustrates the mfa s methodology to examine the material flow link based on its mass perspective the materials include stocks inflows outflows processes imports and exports from a social perspective the materials comprise social networking within the wastewater governance system in other words the demand for a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary socio ecological system can close the knowledge gap associated with addressing various types of environmental sanitation management challenges following current standards notably the triangulated and empirical mfa s model is adequate to present the complicated variables in the wastewater metabolic system this study uses the enforcement of socio flow management knowledge based on a socio ecological concept to address the challenges and questions raised above using two methods a mfa is defined as the principle of mass equilibrium based on space and time in which quantitative processes and models are developed additionally data analyses are interpreted using stationary modelling and system policy scenarios amicarelli et al 2020 kullmann et al 2021 abualtaher and bar 2019 in recent years advances in mfa research have offered broader potential in implementing real life material flow footprints such as using the stock flow service sfs method and stock flow practice sfp nexus others include industrial ecology material flow cost accounting flux analysis and symbiosis industry haberl et al 2021 fei et al 2021 tran and herzig 2020 these models have been expanded from the original concept of mfa sfa involving heterotic disciplinary trajectory this idea provides more comprehensive feedback resulting from the combined response of the selected system drivers gregory and john 2019 b the mental model mm is an external reality picture provider based on the cohesion of collective knowledge of allies from individuals to provide a better understanding of the ecological social system kousoulis and goldie 2021 upreti et al 2021 kelsi et al 2021 in the context of effective environmental management the model assists policymakers in forecasting performance and exploring potential social sustainability for adoption accordingly establishing a cross epistemological framework can be crucial for solving internal problems of organisations perpetrators and external problems of materials this idea delivers a healthy socio scientific competition and further understanding the complexity of human dominated wastewater flow ecosystems while drawing critical conclusions vis à vis the success of their relationships 3 1 mfa method this paper utilises the core mfa methodology to study the balance level of wastewater flows from malaysia s households in this article the development of the mfa model framework consists of seven broad steps 1 choosing the system boundaries and temporal scale in the wastewater management system 2 collect and process priority data 3 develop a diagram framework for stocks and wastewater flows that considers a variety of uncertainties 4 identify flows related to use accumulation and release into the environment or each subsystem 5 analyse material flow data using stan 2 6 software 6 interpret the material flow results according to each stage of the wastewater coil chain and 7 make recommendations for wastewater cycle closure reclamation the mfa balancing approach is used in this study to simulate the calculation of the balance of entering outgoing import export and stock wastewater flows the supplemental section includes two tables refer table s1 and table s2 with attached parameters for wastewater flow calculations and sources for reference data collection including from department of environment malaysia doe 2020 department of irrigation and drainage did 2020 economic planning unit epu 2020 ipcc 2006 mhlg 2020 department of environment dos

the seven equations of the waste water balance model which are supported by the findings of numerous scholars including amann et al 2018 shahbudin and kamal 2020 and others and take into consideration the essential qualities of the household sector study scope scenario can be written as follows 1 w w h h m i o m 3 y r h h p o w u s e l c a p d a y where σ wwhh is total household wastewater from domestic sources hh po and w po are household population connected to domestic sources in year and specific water use in domestic sources 2 w w h h i s t h h p o i s t w u s e l c a p d a y where σ

map the system s elements frequently used to understand the causes and effects of the system s disruptions lamere et al 2020 this model was developed using a blurred cognitive map and qualitative analysis accordingly three key elements were identified based on previous literature surveys in malaysia previous mfa empirical models were also determined including issues with wastewater management from a domestic food source other issues discussed comprise causal relationships of positive or negative expectations regarding current food wastewater management the final issue outlines the formulations and recommendations for intervention strategies simulating wastewater management scenarios for short term and long term support oh et al 2018 table 1 illustrates the interview conducted with 37 specialists and non experts to obtain more accurate and consistent information the survey was conducted in the malay language and then translated to english following the completion of data collection in november 2020 we presented selected examples of the respondent s cognitive map depiction for each construct in the 4 3 results section this depiction is combined with the extraction of significant statements from the case study interview transcript during the first phase of the evaluation phase two of the evaluation involves the mfa s basic model framework development which contains vital elements shown in table 1 next the fcm and mfa hybrid techniques were tested using the mental modeler computer programme i e www mentalmondeler org for the following reasons this modelling software supports data consolidation that meets expectations suitable for resource planning and the environment white et al 2021 it supports the inclusion of various elements and stakeholder participation to function effectively in socio ecological systems aminpour et al 2020 finally the method is based on the learning and teaching concepts to explore test and verify the present gaps and conflicts tarnanen et al 2021 in this study other purposes of fcm usage are collecting individual models group model revision intervention development and advanced scenarios meanwhile the vague cognitive mapping method includes vertically and horizontally combining matrix adjacency and phyton codes with a substantial negative scale to produce strong positives these scales present values of 1 to 1 to display the element s cause effect relationships with the nodes of this study pérez teruel et al 2015 next the metric network measurement simplifies the final process by performing scenario analysis with a leaner and higher thinking system for instance respondents were asked to voice their formulations and opinions on improving the weaknesses of mixed domestic greywater management practices compared to blackwater simulated considerations revolve around how additional drivers would impact the closure of the wastewater round cycle in this study these drivers include centralised wastewater system treatment technology economic costs and socio political influences hence it is crucial to uncover the underlying beliefs of the subject group in the influence of decision making accordingly two separate models namely expert models and non expert models or civilian models should be developed to clarify the thought patterns that appear in the form of decision support jajac et al 2019 4 results and discussions 4 1 the case of food wastewater flow mfa based on the mfa work procedure by baccini and brunner 2012 the mfa model for domestic wastewater management is presented in fig 2 specifically the waste flow originated from food sources based on the scale of malaysia s households in 2020 fig 2 shows the balance of inflows and outflows of malaysia s domestic wastewater from the food source in 2020 by comparison the percentage differences in wastewater flow generation by urban and rural scale is 81 with 542 kt yr and 19 with 128 kt yr respectively two high intensity streams can be categorised as hot spot flows to be noted by stakeholders these streams include blackwater or effluent outflows and greywater or drain water flows with a percentage of 87 and 34 the diversion of the two streams will provide a closure for the broken wastewater cycle and a circular cycle that supports the national domestic wastewater management for a green circular concept table 2 presents the percentage of the flow load based on the breakdown of wastewater products including household sector communal and industrial sectors markets and agriculture however the consideration only includes calculating domestic wastewater flows into the household system this situation is because the statistics and qualitative data are primarily available in producing organic waste inputs into the household sector excretion composition and flowing water per capita or balance of selected materials or mass furthermore the annual statistics by iwk 2020 shows that wastewater flows entering the household sector system can carry other waste sources and liquid waste products however it does not include organic industrial and agricultural wastes contributing to an overall annual consumption of 55 per cent this trend is expected to change due to socio economic factors such as income and per capita consumption the uncertainty error value displayed in table 2 confirms the unknown factors concerning the trend and fig 2 changes above specifically this trend determines whether it is influenced by data collection factors empirical data measurement model validation or the dissolution of certain statistical information meanwhile the broadest black arrow lines in fig 3 show the residual water flow load the blackwater and greywater mixed into a septic tank or a sewer system by 2020 the household sector s substantial waste production and materials harvesting is 1621 kt yr concurrently the garbage disposal collection sent to the disposal site is 1135 kt yr using a proxy of 8 2 million households i e private and personal households they contributed to 670 42 kt yr of domestic wastewater thus the total household contribution of food wastewater to groundwater after receiving treatment is 46 with a value of 302 5 kt yr this data assumes the post treated compost recycling range and organic solid waste enters the agricultural sector at 5 to 10 iwk 2018 hence this result indicates the last recorded wastewater outflow at 17 or 116 kt yr notably it is vital to reduce the load of nutrients resources and other pollutants in the environment the study recorded the most significant loss of wastewater flow into the garbage disposal site and environmental body at 37 or 241 kt yr in the waste collection accordingly wastewater restoration can reduce overall nutrients energy and resources imports in the study area by approximately 38 this approach involves diverting wastes as a biosolid product reducing wastes through a dietary diet separating greywater and blackwater mixtures and improving educational quality and policy planning the study outlined the figures of wastewater flow as stock of the waste disposal site and the household wastewater management subsystem hence these subsystems can be used as comparative indicators with other solutions encompassing the dimensions of space time and boundaries the medium approach is considered most suitable for calculating the footprint of domestic food or wastewater flow in urban and rural areas belevi 2002 by utilising this approach the study has collected considerable information regarding annual organic waste production followed by domestic water consumption and material replacement for resource recovery the conceptual models of wastewater flux development involve the simple inflow and outflow model where only the critical material flow is identified hence most of the unavailable data has led to significant uncertainty errors given that the data is ambiguous with background information leaks additionally the errors can be derived from the diversity of other subsystem processes and the availability of information sharing from certain municipal councils this study used space scales comprising external environmental and internal system boundaries i e agricultural sector trade commercial and economy additionally timescales or annual sequence is utilised where both scales potentially provide significant data accuracy especially if the gauss law s volatility range is between 5 and 25 furthermore the three way flow analysis i e inflows outflows and internal flows explains the distribution patterns of wastewater infiltration from the ratio of water consumption per population moreover the analysis outlines the production of domestic food wastes which form greywater baths stoves laundry water and blackwater infiltration faeces and urine subsequently the waste is discharged via the sewerage system s final passage or overflow into groundwater and rivers the research on household sanitation resource management is beneficial based on the conceptual nexus system of comparing traces and material loads for wastewater systems furthermore these systems utilise additional indicators such as nutrients energy resources and water demonstrated in recent studies asgharnejad et al 2021 xu et al 2020 negi and chandel 2021 nonetheless this research aims to calculate domestic wastewater flow from food sources based on the selected subsystem moreover an early warning system is aimed at the problems associated with the weak points and the potential for wastewater recovery in malaysia accordingly the proposed solution can facilitate the cycle efficiency rate for the metabolic mfa model comprising three primary outflow components these components are related to the domestic wastewater management system and the single output of untreated wastewater hence this idea supports the integration of food wastewater management to overcome the challenges stated above 1 solid sludge output flow for biosolid reuse the rate of biosolid production from sludge in malaysia is significant and is frequently used in organic fertiliser electricity plantation such as crop growing others include landscaping land reclamation and incineration this biosolid output will be useful for household users after this product goes through sludge drying treatment 2 the output flow of sludge liquid for bio effluent recycling this sewage liquid can be reused as non potable water used in the industrial and plantation sectors according to span 2020 local authorities have used iwk wastewater for landscape irrigation and nurseries notably households with no proper sewerage treatment system are prone to wastewater leakage contaminating the quality of water supply which leads to costly treatments hence this study supports the households by providing exposure to blackwater management education on an ongoing basis 3 sludge gas output flow for biogas production this mfa study excludes the scope of calculation for gas emissions generated from sludge biogas production is excellent potential in the context of green economy circulars thus the outflows will be continuously recognised and remain relevant for discussion in this article the anaerobic digestion of sludge produces methane and carbon dioxide that can be used to generate power heat and biofuels for example a sewage treatment plant will use recycled biogas for electricity generation sludge digestion tank heating solar systems and recycling for plant use 4 other food outflows into the environment untreated wastewater the rate of greywater production from household systems in malaysia is substantial this issue has not received significant attention due to the inadequate public awareness of the importance of greywater flow mustafa and hayder 2021 according to oh et al 2018 greywater can be treated via gravel or sand filtration followed by the flotation technique subsequently the treated water can be reused for gardening recreational irrigation or toilet water households in urban or densely populated areas significantly benefit from this method as they regularly face water storage issues nevertheless food waste solid filters and individual oil traps in household residential areas must be enhanced irrespective of the population scale 4 2 the case of food wastewater system with mm table 3 shows the mm results vis à vis household value chain on wastewater management derived from food sources this result includes its relationship with the developed three variables obtained from a concept map based questionnaire and face to face interviews the following results describe a perceived problem often associated with the households response to managing wastewater from domestic food residues next the potential impacts are interrelated concerning the domestic food wastewater generated risk options and its benefits to human health and the environment finally appropriate solutions are explained in managing wastewater flow from food sources 4 2 1 the mm theme variable results an agent s understanding of interaction conflicts in complex socio ecological systems requires appropriate action coordination douglas et al 2019 hence the associative approach entails the mm and mfa methods notably the mm results found that the stakeholder group fun valued the in depth mfa model sheets for wastewater flow after being displayed to them during the interviews table 3 shows that 98 per cent of non experts wanted to know and practise food waste recycling and reuse treated wastewater to support the domestic environmental conservation effort furthermore these groups perceive that continuous wastage carries long term risks in terms of safety assurance hence the two critical variables that fill this case study s socio and ecological gaps were identified wastewater management education and multi agent collaborative involvement 4 2 2 mm clustering results for experts and non experts fig 3 and fig 4 display the modelling results for the mixed wastewater management network and greywater from food sources this result involves three elements tools subjects and objects based on the experts and non experts mm expectations in fig 3 the first stage clustering by experts recognises the object and tool elements namely the technical themes for the wastewater treatment plant systems the economy and the environment meanwhile the second clustering includes the themes of politics and social systems experts perceive that the implication of r d overflows and technological factors affect the performance of wastewater treatment especially when it reaches the economic turning points and environmental quality development the experts views support the development of new business models initiated at the beginning of the transition stage for example the modification of aluminium sludge disposal regulations must be classified as scheduled residues while the effluent quality reclamation should be refined ultimately this idea enhances the domestic wastewater management system concurrently developing environmental sustainability furthermore the study addressed three challenges that increase the domestic wastewater flow through the extrapolated mapping of experts local cognitive data namely i additional assessment support tools i e the mfa approach ii understanding the supply of wastewater resources in current and future green circulars and iii wastewater surveillance strategies that must be co supervised substantially as shown in fig 4 non experts outline the first stage cluster geared towards social and economic themes meanwhile the second stage cluster encompasses the environmental governance political and technical themes notably the economic theme was rejected by all the respondents in this study in which variables were placed such as proposed tax and sewerage service tariff with a maximum payment of rm250 next the social theme that forms the first batch of issues highlights the transparency of stakeholders which is expected to provide a comprehensive solution this issue specifies their engagement in management from start to finish given these points the study suggests the intervention of a multi level technique namely the layered bottom up and top down approach outlined by prouty et al 2020 moreover this method is combined with the centralised and decentralised treatment system proposed by diana et al 2021 combining socio economic and environmental themes for domestic wastewater round cycle systems can be beneficial finally this study acknowledges non experts understanding of the system comprising the strength of emotional and cognitive components mapped at their peaks these components include comprehension norms beliefs experiences behaviours intentions and attitudes as a result this idea produces a weak social network in the material flow cycle therefore it is crucial to strengthen the subjective base of household consumers through various platforms and social networks securing a balance between wastewater and food flow the heterogeneous cognitive modelling above highlights the respondents thinking system in wastewater management this idea influences their understanding and expectations of various actions concerning the study s elements objects and tools for example the vital information identified summarises that the wastewater governance in this country exhibit differing complexities and levels of success this level can be situated at the upstream and downstream levels due to the different arrangements of their respective institutions accordingly the federal government assumes responsibilities regarding water resources for its policy matters and the state government for its sustainability meanwhile the national water resources council nwrc shoulders its governance and the national water services commission span for its industry supervision therefore experts and non expert have reached a consensus from their deliberations on achieving the final vision for the following i the prospects for supporting the recovery of household wastewater access product introduction promotion and service ii the prospects for involving stakeholders from the grassroots level and iii the prospects for strengthening existing policies and domestic food wastewater management policies according to the thematic variables stated in table 2 the informative excerpt may also be pertinent in supporting the vision of this study the mm formed through the participation of experts and non experts were found to produce significant uncertainty due to specific issues i the loss of unofficial and informal flow networks excluded from the mfa system and the commencement of working methods ii the context convergence of the space and time scale for wastewater flow is not targeted in the meso and micro context and iii the socio system of material flow based on household system chain alone usually contradict the mms development thus it may not reflect other regionalisation of wastewater management these situations potentially inhibit supportive decision making and make it challenging to determine simulated scenarios for alternative material flow case studies however the findings from this research should be perceived as a positive contribution to the database development and literature references notably the development procedures of the integrated framework can be expanded to identify closed land domestic wastewater feedback loops from other paradigms 4 3 the case of socio value chain of food wastewater flows the domestic wastewater management system is linked to various factors through several directions and flows which are context specific fig 5 illustrates general directions in which the domestic wastewater flow system from food sources derived from the mfa model is influenced by two variables namely object and subject from the mm the importance of understanding the player s interaction with the theme s conflicts in achieving solutions if the disturbances are shifted schürmann and beckerle 2020 in a targeted manner ultimately supporting the national sustainable development object and tool the mfa tool demands qualitative and quantitative triangulated data to present a balance of material and stock flow paths these paths are based on the behaviour and influence of interacting themes in the study system however the mfa tool could not present the correlation between its results and the object theme factors in actual terms accordingly the flow for each material state can convey ideas interpretations and interactions as objects of study this idea is achieved by determining the material load in each subsystem and ascertaining the cause of the variable stock coefficient next mapping the causes and effects with the mm techniques provides a more helpful solution for the theoretical and practical interventions including the theme factors under the socio ecological umbrella the researcher utilises an adaptive cycle model to optimise the findings on the tool mfa and objects themes and apply the four sub categories concepts these concepts include governance users resource and resource units in an inclusive framework in essence this approach comprehensively addresses the challenges of social sciences and pure science hukkinen 2014 dressel et al 2018 subject and tool the mfa tool successfully identified the interactions between the biophysical system and the subject fig 4 the first stage variables from the subject encompass household groups and the compromise between experts and non experts in presenting a dynamic complex and risky socio ecological processing for the wastewater system the most significant challenge at the beginning of this study was the ambiguous exposure of the mm variables specifically these variables must be standardised at the end of the study s narrative and semantic equivalence hence the relevance of material touch and subject experience were identified by creating the mfa model framework during the first step of the study subject tool object in summary the database contained in the mfa output has successfully improved the supplementary visualisation system for cognitive research this idea develops a sustainable management process and assists the decision making support system for domestic wastewater management notably the two method combination forged a more authentic data representation as a final review this study proposed a socio flow analytical framework of materials which magnifies the assessment of hotspots in the wastewater round cycle system this framework must include a simulated proxy model from the mfa system and its extrapolation with additional discipline areas moreover textual package sheets that can be understood easily contribute to continuous improvements in the teaching and learning system in the socio material flow literature this idea provides opportunities for extracting information and solving research problems in a competitive setting 5 conclusion and policy recommendations this study presents the measures for using the basic procedures from the combined of the mfa method and mental model method to assess the management of food wastewater from the malaysian household sector in a single year the study aims to provide insights to policymakers in drafting a transition strategy from conventional to good wastewater management governance principles in other states and regions in malaysia the nonlinear balance of the imbalanced literacy rate on wastewater recovery between societies and technical experts and regulators sends the signal and the perception that the provision of the same teaching and learning options does not produce positive results that support the clean wastewater transformation process therefore providing different planning options according to actors social profile scenarios will produce better alternative output for the various environmental impacts for example allowing a combination of bottom up and top down approaches to control the high discharge of wastewater especially in congested housing urban and industrial areas such as in food processing factories restaurant premises homes and other related locations the annual cumulative value for the discharge of household wastewater into the environment was recorded at 348 9 kton yr in the entire case study region thus applying the industrial symbiosis elements to assess the social technological and environmental aspects can increase the efficiency of energy carbon sludge and nutrient recovery and circular economy investment development in suburban and rural areas increasing the centralization level for the technical aspects such as distance and diameter for pump stations and linking them with the green awareness perception of local populations and professional body support can create opportunities and implications of purchase recovery contained in wastewater flows including struvite nitrogen fertilizer water energy and other purchase products open questions regarding the barriers that can impede the expansion of the mfa and sna combination testing in a household wastewater management scenario can be addressed in several points clearly non traditional stakeholders consisting of the private sector and civil society lack knowledge about the benefits of the decision making support approach because they prioritize compliance and usage of quality wastewater as well as financing the treatment cost of treated wastewater furthermore the capability of the decision support system hybrid method is easily acknowledged and accepted by non conventional stakeholders including policymakers the government academicians and registered ngos because they need to actively promote wastewater green reform and give official attention to the regulatory framework for rules and laws on this wastewater situation however the challenge is in developing a complete wastewater database encompassing the entire economic social psychological technical and environmental dimensions as well as the capability to extend this model framework to real cases every municipal council in malaysia has to make serious effort in domestic wastewater social research consistent with the technological innovation development to reduce the thought paradigm friction between social actors and technical actors thus reducing the potential wastewater loss at the national level in future studies the mfa sna framework presented here should be extended to the industrial wastewater sector and other water sources this is because this integrated approach can provide a shortcut solution for minor wastewater cases while saving the research cost and time advancements in simulation technology stochastic and hypothetical models can improve this study s specific limitations hence further studies can fill the gaps of this study based on the wastewater governance aspect the polycentric model testing of the wastewater mfa sna system offers extraordinary and regular advantages for implementation planning for the policies that could not be implemented for example policies on local compliance inexpensive wastewater treatment options and health and environmental education from the metaheuristic novel perspective the relationship effects of social actors status in the functional system knowledge domain and space temporal scale result in an inhibitory effect on better water pollution reduction scientific planning and provision of sanitation systems perhaps urine diversion technology for nutrient centring can be implemented by adopting basic measures to change the perceptions of households and the public through the preliminary steps of promoting technology and basic education on wastewater management with this increased confidence it is possible to implement this idea in malaysia in summary the proposed solution is to modify a collective knowledge delivery system for sustainable domestic wastewater management this idea is based on basic teaching learning concepts encouraging and automating manual tasks by households to perceptively handle wastewater and food wastes the complexity presented in the mfa model prompts the expert group to engage in collaborative processes such as efficient strategic negotiations multi agent from experts and non experts collaboration reduces the complexity of wastewater management by cross mapping the social ecological problems of waste flow based on the current situation ultimately the proposed solution develops the association of relevant parties taxpayers and the government additionally value is added

24217,exploring the complex interaction between algal growth and their photo physiology is of significant interest as it can further the understanding of harmful algal blooms to this end we investigate variations in cell abundance and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters during the algal bloom formation of prorocentrum shikokuense in the field and batch culture via the pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry furthermore based on the interaction between algal growth and its photo physiology status we develop a novel algal growth model incorporating cell growth delay the model parameters are estimated by fitting the experimental data of p shikokuense and validated by the experimental data of symbiodinium sp the experimental results show that the growth status and photosynthetic parameters of algal cells fluctuate in both field and laboratory experiments and that the photosynthetic parameters have a faster response than growth parameters according to the experimental and mathematical results the time delay between the slow growth of algae and the rapid change of photosynthetic parameters may be a physiological mechanism leading to the fluctuations in algal growth these results are significant for studying the relationship between phytoplankton growth dynamics and photosynthetic parameters and will help resource managers to predict and deepen the understanding of harmful algal blooms keywords algal bloom prorocentrum shikokuense chlorophyll fluorescence fluctuation model fitting data availability all data used in this study can be found in the manuscript and its supplementary materials 1 introduction in the east china sea ecs the species of dinoflagellates prorocentrum shikokuense formerly named p donghaiense shin et al 2019 gómez et al 2021 lu et al 2022 frequently forms harmful algal blooms habs in the late spring and early summer that last for weeks or months these habs have occurred annually since 2000 and have adverse effects on the coastal area from the estuary of changjiang river down to fujian province china lu et al 2022 chen and chen 2021 the frequency and severity of p shikokuense habs have resulted in significant ecological damages such as plankton community structure changes chai et al 2020 chen et al 2020 lin et al 2014 shen et al 2019 2022 furthermore these detrimental impacts of p shikokuense blooms include a decreased abundance of copepods good food organisms for fish accompanied by an increased abundance of small jellyfish which will inevitably affect the fishery resources leading to economic losses lin et al 2014 shen et al 2022 an outbreak of dinoflagellates blooms e g p shikokuense has been observed on the coast of ecs after the spring diatom blooms and is often accompanied by low orthophosphate p i levels kong et al 2016 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b a this is because dinoflagellates have strategies for assimilating and storing different resources as pools nitrogen phosphorus and trace elements kustka et al 2003 jiang et al 2019 qi et al 2013 while both diatoms and dinoflagellates can store polymers of p i the larger size of dinoflagellates may have a greater cell p i storage capacity allowing some dinoflagellates to maintain a relatively high growth rate under a low p i environment hou et al 2007 diaz et al 2008 in addition p shikokuense using organic forms of phosphorus is an important adaptive strategy under phosphorus limitation ou et al 2008 zhang et al 2019c significant evidence suggests that dissolved organic phosphorus is an important source of phytoplankton phosphorus in low p i areas mclaughlin et al 2013 wu et al 2000 remote sensing or field investigations have shown a very high abundance of p shikokuense in every bloom formation between may and june in the ecs since the year 2000 lin et al 2014 shen et al 2019 tao et al 2015 2017 lu et al 2022 therefore p shikokuense has been a key research species in the field of habs in the ecs during the last two decades lu et al 2022 photosynthesis affected by phosphorus is the dominant factor in algal growth and reproduction chlorophyll a chla concentration maximal quantum yield f v f m actual quantum yield f q f m efficiency of electron transport α and maximum relative electron transport rate retr max are important evaluation indexes of photosynthesis as they describe many photosynthetic characteristics f v f m indicate that the intrinsic light energy conversion efficiency of psii reaction center is measured after leaf dark adaptation for 20 min under non stress conditions the change of this parameter is very little and is not affected by species and growth conditions while under stress conditions the parameter decreases significantly xu et al 1992 f q f m reflects the actual light energy capture efficiency of the psii reaction center in the case of partial closure which is measured directly without dark adaptation several studies indicate that f v f m and f q f m are affected by environmental changes such as nutrition and light intensity and are directly related to the growth of algae misra et al 2012 shi et al 2016 wang et al 2018 over the past few decades quantification of chla concentration and algal cell abundance has been extensively used to detect bloom forming algal biomass however with the development of pulse amplitude modulated pam fluorometry schreiber et al 1986 1997 the use of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters to estimate photosynthetic performance and stress in algae is now widespread in phytoplankton physiology both in the laboratory and field studies falkowski and kolber 1995 higo et al 2017 lippemeier et al 2001 parkhill et al 2001 shen et al 2016 wang et al 2014 ma et al 2021 for example numerous studies have shown that in vivo fluorescence characteristics such as f v f m and f q f m of photosystem ii psii are altered significantly under environmental stress in the field and algal cultures this finding is especially pronounced in nitrogen and or phosphorus limited scenarios suggesting that f v f m and f q f m are good proxies of algal physiological status geider et al 1993 higo et al 2017 lippemeier et al 2001 2003 liu et al 2011 wang et al 2014 on the other hand some researches indicated that these chlorophyll fluorescence parameters can only be used as a diagnostic for unbalanced growth conditions e g nutrient starved and further results found that f v f m is not a good indicator to measure the physiological state of algae under sufficient nutrition condition parkhill et al 2001 kruskopf and flynn 2006 bergmann et al 2002 springer et al 2005 moreover the sensitivity of f v f m to nutrient limitation is different among algal species qi et al 2013 further studies indicated that f v f m has a species specific response to the different growth phases lópez sandoval et al 2014 therefore it is important to explore how chlorophyll fluorescence of phytoplankton responds to various environmental stresses in the fluctuating growth process of algae the variation trend of algal cell density can be characterized by oscillatory dynamics which widely exist in nature and can be observed in many systems such as aquatic ecosystems predator prey systems nervous systems and epidemiological systems esmaeili et al 2022 chaffee and kuske 2011 droop 1983 shen et al 2019 huisman et al 2006 photo physiology status as an indicator of algae density change has not been fully studied in the fluctuating growth of algae mathematical modeling is becoming increasingly important for describing the dynamic growth process of algae and predicting the development trend of algal blooms many researchers used mathematical models to study the dynamic growth process of algae and obtained significant results song et al 2019 studied the effects of seasonal light intensity and nutrient availability on algae fluctuation during an algal bloom in the bohai sea using a stoichiometric model heggerud et al 2020 used a stoichiometric model to study the specific mechanisms that drive the transient dynamics of an algal bloom considering the influence of environmental randomness zhao et al 2020 proposed and studied a stochastic algal growth model based on the model in song et al 2019 and obtained the threshold conditions that determine the persistence and extinction of algae in addition with the development of chlorophyll fluorescence dynamics several mechanistic models based on photosynthetic electron flow response to light have been widely applied eilers and peeters 1988 han 2002 garcía camacho et al 2012 gao et al 2018 these mechanistic photosynthetic models can better describe the phenomenon of photoacclimation photoinhibition and photodamage during photosynthesis straka and rittmann 2018 some researchers used biophysical models to study the productivity of microalgae culture systems to study the effect of photoinhibition on the productivity of algae in the runway pool culture system hartmann et al 2014 proposed a model considering both photosynthesis and growth dynamics of algae based on the droop han model hartmann et al 2014 nikolaou et al 2016 further studied the effect of photoacclimation on algal growth by considering the kinetics of pigment synthesis sun et al 2017 used a coupled biophysical model to explore the growth characteristics of p shikokuense under different irradiance and phosphorus limitation scenarios to the best of our knowledge few studies have carried out the fluctuations in cell density and photosynthetic parameters of algae during the long term culture process especially for p shikokuense therefore this paper intends to construct a novel mathematical model based on photosynthetic parameters to describe the variation trend of algal density in this paper we select p shikokuense a key bloom forming dinoflagellate species in ecs as the research object we hypothesize that the growth and photosynthetic parameters of p shikokuense will show a fluctuating trend in the field or batch culture and in order to adapt to the changes of physiological processes in different growth phases the fluctuation amplitude will gradually decrease to test this hypothesis we investigate the variations in bulk community values of cell abundance and its chlorophyll fluorescence parameters such as f q f m α and retr max via pam fluorometer during the outbreak of p shikokuense bloom in may 2016 in addition we estimate the same parameters for a batch culture of p shikokuense over 12 time points covering a 50 day period moreover to understand the relationship between algal growth and its photo physiology status we construct a mathematical model based on f q f m of psii and algal cell density the model are calibrated based on experimental data of p shikokuense and validated by the experimental data of symbiodinium sp the experimental and mathematical results provide a new insight to elucidate the mechanism of bloom formation and dissipation 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sample the field study area is found between dongtou and nanji islands located on the coast of zhejiang province china fig 1 according to the development of a bloom from may 9 to may 20 2016 phytoplankton water samples were collected at a total of 57 stations the station information phytoplankton sample collection species identification and cell number counting details can be seen in our previous work shen et al 2019 an aliquot of 50 ml surface seawater was separately sampled from each station to determine chla concentration f q f m and retr using the pulse amplitude modulated fluorometer phyto pam ed walz effeltrich germany according to the previous method shen et al 2019 the parameters α and retr max of the retr vs light curves were analyzed according to eilers and peeters 1988 the detection method of p i was according to jiang et al 2019 with minor modification 100 ml seawater was sampled underwater at 0 5 m and filtered by 0 45 μ m cellulose acetate membrane immediately and p i concentration was analyzed with phosphomolybdate blue spectrophotometry 2 2 laboratory experiment an axenic strain of p shikokuense gy h40 was purchased from shanghai guangyu biotechnology co ltd china the algal culture was maintained in f 2 medium guillard 1975 with sterile filtered 121 c 20 min 0 45 μ m millipore membranes seawater at a salinity of 30 the cultures ware kept at 20 1 c under a 14 10 h light dark cycle at a photon flux of 65 70 μ mol photons m 2 s 1 the initial p i concentration of these batch cultures is about 1 62 μ m the culture was routinely shaken twice daily until the cells reached the exponential growth phase to be used in the following experiments all the experiments were carried out with three biological repeats to explore the growth status of p shikokuense under long term culture conditions the batch cultures were grown in 600 ml of fresh f 2 media in 1000 ml flasks at an initial cell density of 7 3 1 0 6 cells l 1 the algal culture conditions are consistent with the pre experiments a 0 9 ml sample was collected and preserved in 0 1 ml lugol s solution and 0 1 ml samples were counted in a phytoplankton counter frame cc f beijing purity instrument co ltd china with an optical microscope eclipse 80i nikon japan at 0 2 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 and 50 days in addition the determination and calculation methods of the fluorescence parameters chla f q f m retr α and retr max and p i concentration followed as with the field samples by synchronous sampling 2 3 statistical analysis for the field sample data due to the non normal distribution of the data shapiro wilk test the differences in characteristics among the sample days are analyzed using the kruskal wallis test with dunn bonferroni post hoc tests ibm spss 22 0 for the laboratory experiment the data are presented as the mean se of triplicates which is normally distributed and with homogeneous variance levene tests statistical differences among the sample days are analyzed using one way anova followed by tukey s multiple range test the generalized additive model gam was used to evaluate the trend of cell abundance and fluorescence parameters over time fei et al 2022 li et al 2019 the gam model is constructed and calculated using the mgcv function library of the r package and the model selection is performed using the aic value the relationship function adopts gaussian distribution the smoothing function adopts an adaptive smoothing function based on p spline and the optimal function order is selected by automatic model simulation in addition generalized linear mixed model glmm was used to study the relationship between cell abundance and pam parameters bolker et al 2009 wang et al 2018 the total phytoplankton cell density was used as the response variable the chla f q f m α and retr max were used as predictor variables sampling sites are incorporated into the model as random effects p values 0 05 were considered significant all analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics 22 0 ibm spss software chicago usa and r 4 2 2 and all charts were generated using origin pro 2018 originlab northampton usa and matlab r2016b in addition the calculation of the dominance index y is according to sun et al 2003 2 4 derivation of the model to explore the relationship between the growth process of algae and its photo physiology status we propose a mathematical model to describe the interaction between the actual photochemical quantum yield of psii f q f m and the cell density of algae n f q f m can characterize the operational efficiency of psii in algal cells under a given photosynthetically active photon flux density this value provides a quantum yield to estimate the linear electron flux through psii baker and neil 2008 during photosynthesis the light energy absorbed by algal cells is mainly used for photochemical reactions and excessive excitation energy will be dissipated in the form of heat and fluorescence garcía camacho et al 2012 it is worth noting that photochemical reactions heat dissipation and chlorophyll fluorescence compete for energy consumption the actual photochemical quantum efficiency of algal cells characterizes the ratio of energy used for photochemical reactions to total absorbed light energy therefore the change of f q f m is composed of two aspects and the capture of light energy increases the energy available for photochemical reactions we assume that the rate of light energy captured by algal cells is proportional to the irradiance yielding r p k a i t where k a is the light absorption coefficient of algal cell and i t is the irradiance we treat i t as a periodic function with a light dark cycle of 14 10 h and photon flux of 65 70 μ mol photons m 2 s 1 with the increase of algal cell density the specific absorption cross section of algal cells will be reduced thereby reducing the light capture rate of the cell garcía camacho et al 2012 at the same time the absorption of light energy is also limited by the maximum actual photochemical quantum yield of algal cells for the convenience of model expression we use f to represent f q f m therefore the final form of light capture rate of algal cells is r p k a ξ ξ k 1 n 1 f f max i t where ξ is the cellular light absorption cross section k 1 is the self shading coefficient and f max is the maximum actual quantum yield of psii of algal cells additionally respiration has been long recognized as an integral part of the algae energy budget garcía camacho et al 2012 therefore energy loss due to algae respiration should be considered we assume that the energy loss due to respiration is proportional to f and the energy loss rate is r garcía camacho et al 2012 alijani et al 2015 thus we arrive at the following equation for the change in the actual quantum yield d f d t k a ξ ξ k 1 n 1 f f max i t r f for the process of algal growth we use the traditional monod equation to describe the relationship between the specific growth rate of algae μ and the actual photochemical quantum yield wang et al 2007 monod 1949 μ μ max f f k f where μ max is the maximum growth rate of algae and k f is the half saturation constant for algal growth compared with the changes of photosynthetic parameters of algae cell growth is a slow process therefore the time delay τ needed for the absorption of light energy to form new cells should be considered when exploring the growth process of algal cells garcía camacho et al 2012 hence at time t the final form of the specific growth rate of algae can be represented as μ t μ max f τ f τ k f here the notation f τ means f t τ we assume that the loss of algal cells due to natural death is proportional to cell density and the natural mortality rate is e we further assume that the loss of cell density caused by intraspecific competition is proportional to the square of cell density and the loss rate is b chen et al 2015 then the change of n can be expressed as d n d t μ max f τ f τ k f n e n b n 2 according to the above formulations we obtain a novel algal growth model 1 d n d t μ max f τ f τ k f monod equation n μ cell growth e n cell death b n 2 crowding loss d f d t k a ξ ξ k 1 n 1 f f max i t r p absorption of light energy r f energy loss due to respiration all parameters of the model are positive and their biological meanings are listed in table 1 3 results 3 1 fluctuation of growth during the process of p shikokuense bloom in the field during the investigation period the concentration of p i ranged from 0 06 to 2 96 μ m with an average of 0 56 μ m in the first three days may 9 may 10 and may 12 the average values were lower than those of other days p 0 05 fig 2a and the n p ratio was about 200 unpublished data indicating that this investigation area was phosphorus limited we analyzed the abundance and dominant species of phytoplankton in water samples during the investigation period from may 9 to may 20 2016 and that a typical p shikokuense bloom occurred the average abundance of total phytoplankton and p shikokuense respectively were 6 64 1 0 5 cells l 1 and 6 59 1 0 5 cells l 1 the dominance of p shikokuense was 0 82 this bloom process can be divided into three phases growth phase may 9 12 maintenance phase may 13 18 and dissipation phase may 19 20 fig 2b shen et al 2019 there are three troughs and two peaks during the process of this bloom in the phytoplankton abundance and perhaps more pronounced in p shikokuense abundance a similar trend is also found in chla concentration fig 2b shows the fluctuation of phytoplankton abundance and chla concentration where the values declined to the minimum values on may 12 and then increased significantly on may 13 and decreased again on may 14 it is worth noting that the substantial increase of chla and the large error bars on may 13 were due to the sharp increase in biomass at the site of nc1 the second peak was observed on may 17 and then these values declined until may 20 in addition the total phytoplankton and p shikokuense abundances are very close during the maintenance phase with a dominance of p shikokuense of 0 99 in addition we used the gam to evaluate the trend of cell abundance and fluorescence parameters over time the results showed that cell abundance and fluorescence parameters changed significantly with time fig 4 and table 2 as can be seen from fig 4 the gam results are consistent with the anova results the total phytoplankton abundance and chla concentration had the same change trend both experienced two peaks and finally showed a downward trend figs 4a and 4d it can be seen from the variation of the abundance of p shikokuense that this bloom is obviously divided into three stages which is consistent with the results of anova fig 4e 3 2 fluctuation of photosynthetic characteristics during the process of p shikokuense bloom in the field fig 3 and the gam fitting results figs 4b and 4c show that the fluctuating trend of f q f m and α is evident and consistent with that of the growth trend the values of f q f m and α displayed a slight increase on may 10 0 49 and 0 194 respectively and declined markedly on may 13 the values of f q f m and α increased significantly again and maintained a high level in the following days from may 14 to 18 and subsequently dropped to 0 28 and 0 119 respectively on may 19 and increased at the end of the investigation figs 3 and 4b a similar trend was also observed for retr max but when the values steadily declined after reaching the second peak on may 14 with a maximum of 290 3 figs 3 and 4f comparing the results of growth and photosynthetic parameters figs 2 and 3 we found that the higher the phytoplankton abundance the lower values of the photosynthetic parameters especially in retr max furthermore to verify the practicability of fluorescence parameters for estimating cell abundance in harmful algal blooms we used chla f q f m α and retr max fitting the glmms the results showed that all tested fluorescence parameters had significant effects on cell abundance table 3 therefore these parameters may be selected to construct the model of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and algal cell interactions 3 3 fluctuation of growth in p shikokuense laboratory experiment to aid in the characterization of the fluctuation mechanism of growth and photosynthetic parameters in the field we performed the growth experiment for the dominant species p shikokuense in the laboratory using batch culture for 50 days in the first half of the experiment day 0 20 the concentration of p i was high and the values exceeded 4 μ m except for the first two days indicating that the p i in water is not limited in the latter half of the experiment day 21 50 the values of p i were low indicating that the p shikokuense culture was under phosphorus limitation fig 5a as can be seen from fig 5b p shikokuense abundance and chla concentration showed an upward trend in volatility in the first 25 days and respectively obtained the maximum values of 6 67 1 0 7 cells l 1 and 1331 26 μ g l 1 on day 25 after day 25 the values displayed a significant decrease until day 40 or 45 and then increased slightly at the end of the experiment 3 4 fluctuation of photosynthetic characteristics in p shikokuense laboratory experiment we determine the photosynthetic parameters from the same time samples as the laboratory growth experiment fig 6 shows that f q f m α and retr max fluctuate and decrease gradually until the end of the experiment in detail retr max increased significantly p 0 05 in the first 2 days and obtained a maximum value of 285 4 on day 2 and then decreased in the next 3 days afterwards there were three obvious peaks on days 10 25 and 35 and finally reached a minimum value of 7 6 at the end of the experiment similar trends were observed in the other two parameters only the fluctuation amplitude of f q f m and α is not as prominent as that of retr max in the middle and later parts of the experiment 3 5 experimental data fitting model 1 is calibrated based on the experimental data of p shikokuense using the least square method and is implemented by the function fmincon in matlab r2016b the model fitting results and parameter values are shown in fig 7 and table 4 respectively in addition the model cost and relative error are calculated using the method in gao et al 2022 fig 7 shows that the fitted curve of model 1 fits the experimental data of n well with the model cost of 0 632 and relative error of 1 1707 for f q f m the model fits the overall trend of the experimental data well especially the first peak and the last 15 days the corresponding model cost and relative error are 0 9336 and 2 1483 respectively it is worth noting that the simulation curve has a small wave trend which indicates that the model can reproduce the diurnal periodic changes of algae photosynthesis in addition the model was validated by the experimental data of symbiodinium sp the initial cell density and phosphate concentration are 4 74 1 0 6 cells l 1 and 2 74 μ m respectively during the experiment the cultures were kept at a 12 12 h light dark cycle with the photon flux of 50 μ mol photons m 2 s 1 the other culture conditions are the same as in section 2 2 fig 8 shows a comparison between our simulation and experiment data the variations of cell density and actual quantum yield are shown in fig 8 a and 8 b it can be seen from the fitting results that the experimental data of symbiodinium sp can be well fitted by the trained model here the model parameter values from in table 4 only changed the irradiance i t and energy loss rate r combined with the calibration and validation results it shows that the model can well describe the interaction between photosynthetic parameters and cell density during algae growth 3 6 sensitivity analysis to provide a comprehensive understanding of the influence of the change of parameter values on the results of the model we perform a sensitivity analysis here the sensitivity system given by the partial derivatives of variables x n f of the model 1 is derived with respect to the parameters q k a μ max e b k 1 f max k f r the detail methods please see bortz and nelson 2004 sourav et al 2020 the parameter s baseline values are from table 4 the logarithmic sensitivity curves x q q x for all variables of model 1 are displayed in fig 9 from the logarithmic sensitivity solution curve the dynamic response of the model solution to parameter changes at different times can be obtained in addition we can also get the percentage change of the model solution caused when that parameter is doubled as can be seen from fig 9 the logarithmic sensitivity solution of all parameter show a fluctuation state in the early time and eventually reaches a steady state from the results of sensitivity analysis the maximum growth rate μ max the light absorption coefficient k a and the maximum actual quantum yield of photosystem ii f max have positive effects on the algal density and the other parameters have negative effects here μ max has the largest positive effect on cell density and e has the largest negative effect in contrast μ max has the most negative effect on the actual quantum yield and e has the most positive effect this may be due to the self shading effect as the density of algae increases the light energy captured by individual algae cells decreases so μ max has a negative effect it is worth noting that the logarithmic sensitivity solutions with respect to k 1 and r tend to the same steady state values over time indicating that the two parameters have similar effects on cell density and actual quantum yield when the system is stable interestingly k a has a positive effect on cell density and b has a negative effect both of them have a positive effect on actual quantum yield and the effects of the two parameters on actual quantum yield are similar when the system reaches a steady state 4 discussion this study exhibits the first attempt to compare the growth and photosynthetic parameters of a p shikokuense bloom batch culture at different time points throughout a bloom process growth cycle we aim to test the hypothesis that the values of algal abundance and photosynthetic parameters would fluctuate to suit the changes of intracellular biological processes these experimental results indicate that the growth and photosynthetic parameters of p shikokuense show a fluctuating phenomenon and that the photosynthetic parameters have a faster response than growth parameters according to the results of glmms fitted by photosynthetic parameters and cell abundance these photosynthetic parameters have significant effects on cell abundance therefore using the actual quantum yield and cell density as the research variables we proposed a novel algal growth model incorporating cell growth delay then the model was calibrated by the long term experimental data of p shikokuense and validated by the experimental data of symbiodinium sp based on the model calibration and verification results the model can better describe the interaction between cell density and photosynthetic parameters during the growth of algae it is worth noting that unlike the statistical model our model is a delay differential equation for the parameterized model when the initial value of variables is given the model has a unique solution curve therefore the model can predict the growth of algae based on the relevant data before the occurrence of habs and provide new insight for the early warning of habs combined with the critical threshold of biomass when habs occurs 4 1 fluctuation of growth and photosynthetic characteristics p shikokuense bloom in the field many studies have begun to focus on the application of pam technology to in situ determination of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters to assess the photosynthetic physiological status of algae during the blooming process rather than to record the changes of algal abundance merely for example some researches indicated that changes in photosynthetic characteristics e g f v f m could be a good indicator of algal bloom formation and succession in the field higo et al 2017 wang et al 2014 on the contrary springer et al 2005 found that the values of f v f m were consistently 0 6 0 8 during the bloom providing little evidence of photo physiological stress as would have been expected under nutrient limiting conditions the reason for these two different results may be due to differences in measurement systems and sampling intervals or differences in species growth status higo et al 2017 springer et al 2005 wang et al 2014 parkhill et al 2001 an additional mechanism was shown in detail by parkhill et al 2001 who indicated that f v f m is not a robust diagnostic for all nutrient stressed conditions because variable fluorescence can only be used as a diagnostic for nutrient starved unbalanced growth conditions to further examine this possibility we take daily sampling to limit the differences of measurement the glmms results showed that the variable chlorophyll fluorescence parameters are closely related to the abundance of algae table 3 and the presence of a time lag phenomenon figs 2b and 3 in addition our investigation results showed that the concentration of p i was deficient during the p shikokuense bloom fig 2a it is shown that the water body is in a phosphorus limited state when the dinoflagellate blooms occur but it is very difficult to determine whether algal cells are in unbalanced growth conditions during this stage later spring to early summer therefore we speculate that whether or not p i is acting as a stressor on algal cells may be more closely related to the photo physiological status furthermore the concentration of intracellular p i the total cellular p i including the intracellular p i and surface adsorbed p i where latter may account for 15 to 45 of total cellular p i in the different phases of blooms sañudo wilhelmy et al 2004 can be used as a good indicator to measure whether algal cells are under phosphorus stress our previous study found that intracellular p i is important to algal growth jiang et al 2019 gao et al 2022 and the photosynthetic phosphorylation level calvin cycle efficiency photosynthetic rate and block recycling of nadp and nadph will be inhibited by this limitation fredeen et al 1990 therefore further investigation of the exact mechanisms involved in intracellular p i and photo physiological parameters in the field is needed 4 2 fluctuation of growth and photosynthetic characteristics p shikokuense in the laboratory phosphorus is considered to be a common limiting factor for the growth of phytoplankton especially when blooms occur huang et al 2007 in this study phosphorus limitation clearly affected cell abundance and chla concentration after 25 days of culturing compared with the first 20 days in phosphorus sufficient conditions fig 5 during the experiment the concentration of p i was low in the first 2 days because the culture of p shikokuense was in a phosphorus starvation state the value of alkaline phosphatase was about 14000 fmol cell 1 h 1 unpublished data and a lot of p i were quickly absorbed in the cell surface a similar result was observed in our previous studies jiang et al 2019 however excessive p i was released into the water because it could not be absorbed and utilized before being exuded the concentration of p i increased on day 5 with a maximum value of 18 70 μ m in the medium although the p i concentration in the medium was low after the 20th day the algae continued to grow rapidly and the abundance and chla concentration continued to increase and began to decrease after 5 days fig 5 during the experiment from day 25 to day 40 the algal abundance decreased significantly followed by the values increasing again until the end of the experiment this has also been observed in other studies such as alexandium minutum lippemeier et al 2003 thalassirosira weissflogii liu et al 2011 in addition there was a small fluctuation of p shikokuense abundance in the first 25 days in p i sufficient conditions followed by a large fluctuation in the later 25 days in p i deficient condition by comparison chlorophyll fluorescence parameters have a faster response than that of algal growth during the experiment fig 6 furthermore there were obvious fluctuations in p shikokuense abundance and photosynthetic characteristics in particular we see fluctuations in retr max which clearly identified algal photo physiological status under different nutrient conditions although there are differing opinions about the use of these parameters as indicators for algal blooms under various environmental stressors kruskopf and flynn 2006 lippemeier et al 2001 liu et al 2011 parkhill et al 2001 this study showed a clear time delay relationship between the photosynthetic characteristics and the abundance of p shikokuense under various degrees of phosphorus limitation with the extension of culture time the concentration of p i decreased to a very low level in the last 25 days fig 5a indicating the cultures were under phosphorus limitation note that p shikokuense was not under nitrogen limitation because the growth of p shikokuense has little demand for nitrogen especially on nitrate which had concentrations still above 37 μ m after 33 days of culture when the initial nutrient was at a f 2 level shen and li 2016 the values of f q f m α and retr max fluctuated and decreased to 0 15 0 032 and 7 55 respectively at the end of the experiment fig 6 similar results have been observed in the harmful raphidophyte chattonella antiqua reported by qiu et al 2013 where they conducted the complete growth cycle culture experiment under different nutrient conditions the control group s results showed the f v f m value changes from 0 58 to 0 70 during the exponential phase from 0 16 to 0 55 during the stationary phase with some fluctuations and increased slightly during the decline phase the relative pattern of variation in f v f m in the nutrient limited group was similar to the control group there were many reasons for the fluctuation of photosynthetic parameters during the long time culture some studies suggested that the value of f v f m was overestimated because of the presence of photosynthetically non functional dead cells and cell detritus franklin et al 2009 however there is strong evidence that photosynthetic parameter values of some algae decrease under phosphorus stress liu et al 2011 qi et al 2013 and increase immediately after being supplemented lippemeier et al 2001 2003 therefore we believe that photosynthetic parameter values are the key to understanding whether the intracellular p i of algae is in a limited state 4 3 model fitting of experimental data of p shikokuense in this paper we establish a novel algal growth model incorporating growth delay based on the interaction between the actual quantum efficiency of photosynthesis and algal growth intuitive fitting results model cost and relative error show that the model can reproduce the changes in cell abundance and photo physiology status during p shikokuense culture it is worth noting that this model coupled the photo physiology status and growth state of algae which is similar to the models of hartmann et al 2014 and nikolaou et al 2016 compared with the models of hartmann et al 2014 and nikolaou et al 2016 our model is simpler and has fewer free parameters our model can directly describe the change of cell density based on the photosynthetic parameters of algae which makes the measurement of experimental data of model variables simpler and more convenient for model verification in addition the time delay between algal growth status and photo physiology status was incorporated this model can simulate the phenomenon of fluctuation of cell density and photo physiology status in the process of p shikokuense culture during the whole culture period the experimental data and the fitted curve of the model show a trend of large oscillatory variation fig 7 which may be caused by the delay between the slow growth of algae and the rapid change of photo physiology status the time delay may cause the system to lose stability and oscillation may occur when there is a phase change between the received signal and the response to the signal droop 1983 mackey and glass 1977 misra et al 2020 an et al 2019 melendez alvarez et al 2021 found that the feedback mechanism of cell growth can lead to the fluctuation of cell density through a molecular mathematical model combined with experimental data in this model we only consider the effect of the photo physiology status of algae on cell growth while the effect of limited nutrients e g phosphorus was ignored phosphorus plays an important role in the photosynthesis of phytoplankton such as the calvin cycle and regulation of some enzyme activity wang et al 2004 shen and li 2016 an interesting avenue of future work would be to incorporate the effects of phosphorus on algal growth and photo physiology status into the model an ecological stoichiometry model is a powerful tool for combining energy balance with various of nutrients in an ecosystem models based on ecological stoichiometry have been widely used to explore various ecological mechanisms such as predator prey systems algae daphnia interactions and nutrient uptake processes in phytoplankton peace and wang 2019 yuan et al 2020 davies and wang 2021 yan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 heggerud et al 2020 to describe the growth characteristics of algae more accurately the influence of limiting nutrients on algal growth can be further considered based on the model proposed in this paper combined with stoichiometric mechanisms lópez sandoval et al 2014 have shown that the size of the cell can affect the metabolic rate of the species for example the relationship between photosynthesis and cell size is unimodal with the highest rate measured in medium sized species therefore our model is unlikely to be applied to all algae species we need to combine the actual data to adjust the relevant model parameters according to the species specificity in order to be suitable for other habs species in addition we speculate that for species with close taxonomic status such as species of the same family or genus the applicability of the model is better due to the similarity of their ecological characteristics we validate the model with the data of symbiodinium sp and obtain good fitting results one possible reason is that p shikokuense and symbiodinium sp have similar taxonomic status in general combined with marine field data the established prediction model for specific phytoplankton species will help to effectively predict the outbreak of harmful algal blooms funding this work was supported by the

24217,exploring the complex interaction between algal growth and their photo physiology is of significant interest as it can further the understanding of harmful algal blooms to this end we investigate variations in cell abundance and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters during the algal bloom formation of prorocentrum shikokuense in the field and batch culture via the pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry furthermore based on the interaction between algal growth and its photo physiology status we develop a novel algal growth model incorporating cell growth delay the model parameters are estimated by fitting the experimental data of p shikokuense and validated by the experimental data of symbiodinium sp the experimental results show that the growth status and photosynthetic parameters of algal cells fluctuate in both field and laboratory experiments and that the photosynthetic parameters have a faster response than growth parameters according to the experimental and mathematical results the time delay between the slow growth of algae and the rapid change of photosynthetic parameters may be a physiological mechanism leading to the fluctuations in algal growth these results are significant for studying the relationship between phytoplankton growth dynamics and photosynthetic parameters and will help resource managers to predict and deepen the understanding of harmful algal blooms keywords algal bloom prorocentrum shikokuense chlorophyll fluorescence fluctuation model fitting data availability all data used in this study can be found in the manuscript and its supplementary materials 1 introduction in the east china sea ecs the species of dinoflagellates prorocentrum shikokuense formerly named p donghaiense shin et al 2019 gómez et al 2021 lu et al 2022 frequently forms harmful algal blooms habs in the late spring and early summer that last for weeks or months these habs have occurred annually since 2000 and have adverse effects on the coastal area from the estuary of changjiang river down to fujian province china lu et al 2022 chen and chen 2021 the frequency and severity of p shikokuense habs have resulted in significant ecological damages such as plankton community structure changes chai et al 2020 chen et al 2020 lin et al 2014 shen et al 2019 2022 furthermore these detrimental impacts of p shikokuense blooms include a decreased abundance of copepods good food organisms for fish accompanied by an increased abundance of small jellyfish which will inevitably affect the fishery resources leading to economic losses lin et al 2014 shen et al 2022 an outbreak of dinoflagellates blooms e g p shikokuense has been observed on the coast of ecs after the spring diatom blooms and is often accompanied by low orthophosphate p i levels kong et al 2016 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b a this is because dinoflagellates have strategies for assimilating and storing different resources as pools nitrogen phosphorus and trace elements kustka et al 2003 jiang et al 2019 qi et al 2013 while both diatoms and dinoflagellates can store polymers of p i the larger size of dinoflagellates may have a greater cell p i storage capacity allowing some dinoflagellates to maintain a relatively high growth rate under a low p i environment hou et al 2007 diaz et al 2008 in addition p shikokuense using organic forms of phosphorus is an important adaptive strategy under phosphorus limitation ou et al 2008 zhang et al 2019c significant evidence suggests that dissolved organic phosphorus is an important source of phytoplankton phosphorus in low p i areas mclaughlin et al 2013 wu et al 2000 remote sensing or field investigations have shown a very high abundance of p shikokuense in every bloom formation between may and june in the ecs since the year 2000 lin et al 2014 shen et al 2019 tao et al 2015 2017 lu et al 2022 therefore p shikokuense has been a key research species in the field of habs in the ecs during the last two decades lu et al 2022 photosynthesis affected by phosphorus is the dominant factor in algal growth and reproduction chlorophyll a chla concentration maximal quantum yield f v f m actual quantum yield f q f m efficiency of electron transport α and maximum relative electron transport rate retr max are important evaluation indexes of photosynthesis as they describe many photosynthetic characteristics f v f m indicate that the intrinsic light energy conversion efficiency of psii reaction center is measured after leaf dark adaptation for 20 min under non stress conditions the change of this parameter is very little and is not affected by species and growth conditions while under stress conditions the parameter decreases significantly xu et al 1992 f q f m reflects the actual light energy capture efficiency of the psii reaction center in the case of partial closure which is measured directly without dark adaptation several studies indicate that f v f m and f q f m are affected by environmental changes such as nutrition and light intensity and are directly related to the growth of algae misra et al 2012 shi et al 2016 wang et al 2018 over the past few decades quantification of chla concentration and algal cell abundance has been extensively used to detect bloom forming algal biomass however with the development of pulse amplitude modulated pam fluorometry schreiber et al 1986 1997 the use of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters to estimate photosynthetic performance and stress in algae is now widespread in phytoplankton physiology both in the laboratory and field studies falkowski and kolber 1995 higo et al 2017 lippemeier et al 2001 parkhill et al 2001 shen et al 2016 wang et al 2014 ma et al 2021 for example numerous studies have shown that in vivo fluorescence characteristics such as f v f m and f q f m of photosystem ii psii are altered significantly under environmental stress in the field and algal cultures this finding is especially pronounced in nitrogen and or phosphorus limited scenarios suggesting that f v f m and f q f m are good proxies of algal physiological status geider et al 1993 higo et al 2017 lippemeier et al 2001 2003 liu et al 2011 wang et al 2014 on the other hand some researches indicated that these chlorophyll fluorescence parameters can only be used as a diagnostic for unbalanced growth conditions e g nutrient starved and further results found that f v f m is not a good indicator to measure the physiological state of algae under sufficient nutrition condition parkhill et al 2001 kruskopf and flynn 2006 bergmann et al 2002 springer et al 2005 moreover the sensitivity of f v f m to nutrient limitation is different among algal species qi et al 2013 further studies indicated that f v f m has a species specific response to the different growth phases lópez sandoval et al 2014 therefore it is important to explore how chlorophyll fluorescence of phytoplankton responds to various environmental stresses in the fluctuating growth process of algae the variation trend of algal cell density can be characterized by oscillatory dynamics which widely exist in nature and can be observed in many systems such as aquatic ecosystems predator prey systems nervous systems and epidemiological systems esmaeili et al 2022 chaffee and kuske 2011 droop 1983 shen et al 2019 huisman et al 2006 photo physiology status as an indicator of algae density change has not been fully studied in the fluctuating growth of algae mathematical modeling is becoming increasingly important for describing the dynamic growth process of algae and predicting the development trend of algal blooms many researchers used mathematical models to study the dynamic growth process of algae and obtained significant results song et al 2019 studied the effects of seasonal light intensity and nutrient availability on algae fluctuation during an algal bloom in the bohai sea using a stoichiometric model heggerud et al 2020 used a stoichiometric model to study the specific mechanisms that drive the transient dynamics of an algal bloom considering the influence of environmental randomness zhao et al 2020 proposed and studied a stochastic algal growth model based on the model in song et al 2019 and obtained the threshold conditions that determine the persistence and extinction of algae in addition with the development of chlorophyll fluorescence dynamics several mechanistic models based on photosynthetic electron flow response to light have been widely applied eilers and peeters 1988 han 2002 garcía camacho et al 2012 gao et al 2018 these mechanistic photosynthetic models can better describe the phenomenon of photoacclimation photoinhibition and photodamage during photosynthesis straka and rittmann 2018 some researchers used biophysical models to study the productivity of microalgae culture systems to study the effect of photoinhibition on the productivity of algae in the runway pool culture system hartmann et al 2014 proposed a model considering both photosynthesis and growth dynamics of algae based on the droop han model hartmann et al 2014 nikolaou et al 2016 further studied the effect of photoacclimation on algal growth by considering the kinetics of pigment synthesis sun et al 2017 used a coupled biophysical model to explore the growth characteristics of p shikokuense under different irradiance and phosphorus limitation scenarios to the best of our knowledge few studies have carried out the fluctuations in cell density and photosynthetic parameters of algae during the long term culture process especially for p shikokuense therefore this paper intends to construct a novel mathematical model based on photosynthetic parameters to describe the variation trend of algal density in this paper we select p shikokuense a key bloom forming dinoflagellate species in ecs as the research object we hypothesize that the growth and photosynthetic parameters of p shikokuense will show a fluctuating trend in the field or batch culture and in order to adapt to the changes of physiological processes in different growth phases the fluctuation amplitude will gradually decrease to test this hypothesis we investigate the variations in bulk community values of cell abundance and its chlorophyll fluorescence parameters such as f q f m α and retr max via pam fluorometer during the outbreak of p shikokuense bloom in may 2016 in addition we estimate the same parameters for a batch culture of p shikokuense over 12 time points covering a 50 day period moreover to understand the relationship between algal growth and its photo physiology status we construct a mathematical model based on f q f m of psii and algal cell density the model are calibrated based on experimental data of p shikokuense and validated by the experimental data of symbiodinium sp the experimental and mathematical results provide a new insight to elucidate the mechanism of bloom formation and dissipation 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sample the field study area is found between dongtou and nanji islands located on the coast of zhejiang province china fig 1 according to the development of a bloom from may 9 to may 20 2016 phytoplankton water samples were collected at a total of 57 stations the station information phytoplankton sample collection species identification and cell number counting details can be seen in our previous work shen et al 2019 an aliquot of 50 ml surface seawater was separately sampled from each station to determine chla concentration f q f m and retr using the pulse amplitude modulated fluorometer phyto pam ed walz effeltrich germany according to the previous method shen et al 2019 the parameters α and retr max of the retr vs light curves were analyzed according to eilers and peeters 1988 the detection method of p i was according to jiang et al 2019 with minor modification 100 ml seawater was sampled underwater at 0 5 m and filtered by 0 45 μ m cellulose acetate membrane immediately and p i concentration was analyzed with phosphomolybdate blue spectrophotometry 2 2 laboratory experiment an axenic strain of p shikokuense gy h40 was purchased from shanghai guangyu biotechnology co ltd china the algal culture was maintained in f 2 medium guillard 1975 with sterile filtered 121 c 20 min 0 45 μ m millipore membranes seawater at a salinity of 30 the cultures ware kept at 20 1 c under a 14 10 h light dark cycle at a photon flux of 65 70 μ mol photons m 2 s 1 the initial p i concentration of these batch cultures is about 1 62 μ m the culture was routinely shaken twice daily until the cells reached the exponential growth phase to be used in the following experiments all the experiments were carried out with three biological repeats to explore the growth status of p shikokuense under long term culture conditions the batch cultures were grown in 600 ml of fresh f 2 media in 1000 ml flasks at an initial cell density of 7 3 1 0 6 cells l 1 the algal culture conditions are consistent with the pre experiments a 0 9 ml sample was collected and preserved in 0 1 ml lugol s solution and 0 1 ml

addition the determination and calculation methods of the fluorescence parameters chla f q f m retr α and retr max and p i concentration followed as with the field samples by synchronous sampling 2 3 statistical analysis for the field sample data due to the non normal distribution of the data shapiro wilk test the differences in characteristics among the sample days are analyzed using the kruskal wallis test with dunn bonferroni post hoc tests ibm spss 22 0 for the laboratory experiment the data are presented as the mean se of triplicates which is normally distributed and with homogeneous variance levene tests statistical differences among the sample days are analyzed using one way anova followed by tukey s multiple range test the generalized additive model gam was used to evaluate the trend of cell abundance and fluorescence parameters over time fei et al 2022 li et al 2019 the gam model is constructed and calculated using the mgcv function library of the r package and the model selection is performed using the aic value the relationship function adopts gaussian distribution the smoothing function adopts an adaptive smoothing function based on p spline and the optimal function order is selected by automatic model simulation in addition generalized linear mixed model glmm was used to study the relationship between cell abundance and pam parameters bolker et al 2009 wang et al 2018 the total phytoplankton cell density was used as the response variable the chla f q f m α and retr max were used as predictor variables sampling sites are incorporated into the model

origin pro 2018 originlab northampton usa and matlab r2016b in addition the calculation of the dominance index y is according to sun et al 2003 2 4 derivation of the model to explore the relationship between the growth process of algae and its photo physiology status we propose a mathematical model to describe the interaction between the actual photochemical quantum yield of psii f q f m and the cell density of algae n f q f m can characterize the operational efficiency of psii in algal cells under a given photosynthetically active photon flux density this value provides a quantum yield to estimate the linear electron flux through psii baker and neil 2008 during photosynthesis the light energy absorbed by algal cells is mainly used for photochemical reactions and excessive excitation energy will be dissipated in the form of heat and fluorescence garcía camacho et al 2012 it is worth noting that photochemical reactions heat dissipation and chlorophyll fluorescence compete for energy consumption the actual photochemical quantum efficiency of algal cells characterizes the ratio of energy used for photochemical reactions to total absorbed light energy therefore the change of f q f m is composed of two aspects and the capture of light energy increases the energy available for photochemical reactions we assume that the rate of light energy captured by algal cells is proportional to the irradiance yielding r p k a i t where k a is the light absorption coefficient of algal cell and i t is the irradiance we treat i t as a periodic function with a light dark cycle of 14 10 h and photon flux of 65 70 μ mol photons m 2 s 1 with the increase of algal cell density the specific absorption cross section of algal cells will be reduced thereby reducing the light capture rate of the cell garcía camacho et al 2012 at the same time the absorption of light energy is also limited by the maximum actual photochemical quantum yield of algal cells for the convenience of model expression we use f to represent f q f m therefore the final form of light capture rate of algal cells is r p k a ξ ξ k 1 n 1 f f max i t where ξ is the cellular light absorption cross section k 1 is the self shading coefficient and f max is the maximum actual quantum yield of psii of algal cells additionally respiration has been long recognized as an integral part of the algae energy budget garcía camacho et al 2012 therefore energy loss due to algae respiration should be considered we assume that the energy loss due to respiration is proportional to f and the energy loss rate is r garcía camacho et al 2012 alijani et al 2015 thus we arrive at the following equation for the change in the actual quantum yield d f d t k a ξ ξ k 1 n 1 f f max i t r f for the process of algal growth we use the traditional monod equation to describe the relationship between the specific growth rate of algae μ and the actual photochemical quantum yield wang et al 2007 monod 1949 μ μ max f f k f where μ max is the maximum growth rate of algae and k f is the half saturation constant for algal growth compared with the changes of photosynthetic parameters of algae cell growth is a slow process therefore the time delay τ needed for the absorption of light energy to form new cells should be considered when exploring the growth process of algal cells garcía camacho et al 2012 hence at time t the final form of the specific growth rate of algae can be represented as μ t μ max f τ f τ k f here the notation f τ means f t τ we assume that the loss of algal cells due to natural death is proportional to cell density and the natural mortality rate is e we further assume that the loss of cell density caused by intraspecific competition is proportional to the square of cell density and the loss rate is b chen et al 2015 then the change of n can be expressed as d n d t μ max f τ f τ k f n e n b n 2 according to the above formulations we obtain a novel algal growth model 1 d n d t μ

of the model are positive and their biological meanings are listed in table 1 3 results 3 1 fluctuation of growth during the process of p shikokuense bloom in the field during the investigation period the concentration of p i ranged from 0 06 to 2 96 μ m with an average of 0 56 μ m in the first three days may 9 may 10 and may 12 the average values were lower than those of other days p 0 05 fig 2a and the n p ratio was about 200 unpublished data indicating that this investigation area was phosphorus limited we analyzed the abundance and dominant species of phytoplankton in water samples during the investigation period from may 9 to may 20 2016 and that a typical p shikokuense bloom occurred the average abundance of total phytoplankton and p shikokuense respectively were 6 64 1 0 5 cells l 1 and 6 59 1 0 5 cells l 1 the dominance of p shikokuense was 0 82 this bloom process can be divided into three phases growth phase may 9 12 maintenance phase may 13 18 and dissipation phase may 19 20 fig 2b shen et al 2019 there are three troughs and two peaks during the process of this bloom in the phytoplankton abundance and perhaps more pronounced in p shikokuense abundance a similar trend is also found in chla concentration fig 2b shows the fluctuation of phytoplankton abundance and chla concentration where the values declined to the minimum values on may 12 and then increased significantly on may 13 and decreased again on may 14 it is worth noting that the substantial increase of chla and the large error bars on may 13 were due to the sharp increase in biomass at the site of nc1 the second peak was observed on may 17 and then these values declined until may 20 in addition the total phytoplankton and p shikokuense abundances are very close during the maintenance phase with a dominance of p shikokuense of 0 99 in addition we used the gam to evaluate the trend of cell abundance and fluorescence parameters over time the results showed that cell abundance and fluorescence parameters changed significantly with time fig 4 and table 2 as can be seen from fig 4 the gam results are consistent with the anova results the total phytoplankton abundance and chla concentration had the same change trend both experienced two peaks and finally showed a downward trend figs 4a and 4d it can be seen from the variation of the abundance of p shikokuense that this bloom is obviously divided into three stages which is consistent with the results of anova fig 4e 3 2 fluctuation of photosynthetic characteristics during the process of p shikokuense bloom in the field fig 3 and the gam fitting results figs 4b and 4c show that the fluctuating trend of f q f m and α is evident and consistent with that of the growth trend the values of f q f m and α displayed a slight increase on may 10 0 49 and 0 194 respectively and declined markedly on may 13 the values of f q f m and α increased significantly again and maintained a high level in the following days from may 14 to 18 and subsequently dropped to 0 28 and 0 119 respectively on may 19 and increased at the end of the investigation figs 3 and 4b a similar trend was also observed for retr max but when the values steadily declined after reaching the second peak on may 14 with a maximum of 290 3 figs 3 and 4f comparing the results of growth and photosynthetic parameters figs 2 and 3 we found that the higher the phytoplankton abundance the lower values of the photosynthetic parameters especially in retr max furthermore to verify the practicability of fluorescence parameters for estimating cell abundance in harmful algal blooms we used chla f q f m α and retr max fitting the glmms the results showed that all tested fluorescence parameters had significant effects on cell abundance table 3 therefore these parameters may be selected to construct the model of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and algal cell interactions 3 3 fluctuation of growth in p shikokuense laboratory experiment to aid in the characterization of the fluctuation mechanism of growth and photosynthetic parameters in the field we performed the growth experiment for the dominant species p shikokuense in the laboratory using batch culture for 50 days in the first half of the experiment day 0 20 the concentration of p i was high and the values exceeded 4 μ m except for the first two days indicating that the p i in water is not limited in the latter half of the experiment day 21 50 the values of p i were low indicating that the p shikokuense culture was under phosphorus limitation fig 5a as can be seen from fig 5b p shikokuense abundance and chla concentration showed an upward trend in volatility in the first 25 days and respectively obtained the maximum values of 6 67 1 0 7 cells l 1 and 1331 26 μ g l 1 on day 25 after day 25 the values displayed a significant decrease until day 40 or 45 and then increased slightly at the end of the experiment 3 4 fluctuation of photosynthetic characteristics in p shikokuense laboratory experiment we determine the photosynthetic parameters from the same time samples as the laboratory growth experiment fig 6 shows that f q f m α and retr max fluctuate and decrease gradually until the end of the experiment in detail retr max increased significantly p 0 05 in the first 2 days and obtained a maximum value of 285 4 on day 2 and then decreased in the next 3 days afterwards there were three obvious peaks on days 10 25 and 35 and finally reached a minimum value of 7 6 at the end of the experiment similar trends were observed in the other two parameters only the fluctuation amplitude of f q f m and α is not as prominent as that of retr max in the middle and later parts of the experiment 3 5 experimental data fitting model 1 is calibrated based on the experimental data of p shikokuense using the least square method and is implemented by the function fmincon in matlab r2016b the model fitting results and parameter values are shown in fig 7 and table 4 respectively in addition the model cost and relative error are calculated using the method in gao et al 2022 fig 7 shows that the fitted curve of model 1 fits the experimental data of n well with the model cost of 0 632 and relative error of 1 1707 for f q f m the model fits the overall trend of the experimental data well especially the first peak and the last 15 days the corresponding model cost and relative error are 0 9336 and 2 1483 respectively it is worth noting that the simulation curve has a small wave trend which indicates that the model can reproduce the diurnal periodic changes of algae photosynthesis in addition the model was validated by the experimental data of symbiodinium sp the initial cell density and phosphate concentration are 4 74 1 0 6 cells l 1 and 2 74 μ m respectively during the experiment the cultures were kept at a 12 12 h light dark cycle with the photon flux of 50 μ mol photons m 2 s 1 the other culture conditions are the same as in section 2 2 fig 8 shows a comparison between our simulation and experiment data the variations of cell density and actual quantum yield are shown in fig 8 a and 8 b it can be seen from the fitting results that the experimental data of symbiodinium sp can be well fitted by the trained model here the model parameter values from in table 4 only changed the irradiance i t and energy loss rate r combined with the calibration and validation results it shows that the model can well describe the interaction between photosynthetic parameters and cell density during algae growth 3 6 sensitivity analysis to provide a comprehensive understanding of the influence of the change of parameter values on the results of the model we perform a sensitivity analysis here the sensitivity system given by the partial derivatives of variables x n f of the model 1 is derived with respect to the parameters q k a μ max e b k 1 f max k f r the detail methods please see bortz and nelson 2004 sourav et al 2020 the parameter s baseline values are from table 4 the logarithmic sensitivity curves x q q x for all variables of model 1 are displayed in fig 9 from the logarithmic sensitivity solution curve the dynamic response of the model solution to parameter changes at different times can be obtained in addition we can also get the percentage change of the model solution caused when that parameter is doubled as can be seen from fig 9 the logarithmic sensitivity solution of all parameter show a fluctuation state in the early time and eventually reaches a steady state from the results of sensitivity analysis the maximum growth rate μ max the light absorption coefficient k a and the maximum actual quantum yield of photosystem ii f max have positive effects on the algal density and the other parameters have negative effects here μ max has the largest positive effect on cell density and e has the largest negative effect in contrast μ max has the most negative effect on the actual quantum yield and e has the most positive effect this may be due to the self shading effect as the density of algae increases the light energy captured by individual algae cells decreases so μ max has a negative effect it is worth noting that the logarithmic sensitivity solutions with respect to k 1 and r tend to the same steady state values over time indicating that the two parameters have similar effects on cell density and actual quantum yield when the system is stable interestingly k a has a positive effect on cell density and b has a negative effect both of them have a positive effect on actual quantum yield and the effects of the two parameters on actual quantum yield are similar when the system reaches a steady state 4 discussion this study exhibits the first attempt to compare the growth and photosynthetic parameters of a p shikokuense bloom batch culture at different time points throughout a bloom process growth cycle we aim to test the hypothesis that the values of algal abundance and photosynthetic parameters would fluctuate to suit the changes of intracellular biological processes these experimental results indicate that the growth and photosynthetic parameters of p shikokuense show a fluctuating phenomenon and that the photosynthetic parameters have a faster response than growth parameters according to the results of glmms fitted by photosynthetic parameters and cell abundance these photosynthetic parameters have significant effects on cell abundance therefore using the actual quantum yield and cell density as the research variables we proposed a novel algal growth model incorporating cell growth delay then the model was calibrated by the long term experimental data of p shikokuense and validated by the experimental data of symbiodinium sp based on the model calibration and verification results the model can better describe the interaction between cell density and photosynthetic parameters during the growth of algae it is worth noting that unlike the statistical model our model is a delay differential equation for the parameterized model when the initial value of variables is given the model has a unique solution curve therefore the model can predict the growth of algae based on the relevant data before the occurrence of habs and provide new insight for the early warning of habs combined with the critical threshold of biomass when habs occurs 4 1 fluctuation of growth and photosynthetic characteristics p shikokuense bloom in the field many studies have begun to focus on the application of pam technology to in situ determination of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters to assess the photosynthetic physiological status of algae during the blooming process rather than to record the changes of algal abundance merely for example some researches indicated that changes in photosynthetic characteristics e g f v f m could be a good indicator of algal bloom formation and succession in the field higo et al 2017 wang et al 2014 on the contrary springer et al 2005 found that the values of f v f m were consistently 0 6 0 8 during the bloom providing little evidence of photo physiological stress as would have been expected under nutrient limiting conditions the reason for these two different results may be due to differences in measurement systems and sampling intervals or differences in species growth status higo et al 2017 springer et al 2005 wang et al 2014 parkhill et al 2001 an additional mechanism was shown in detail by parkhill et al 2001 who indicated that f v f m is not a robust diagnostic for all nutrient stressed conditions because variable fluorescence can only be used as a diagnostic for nutrient starved unbalanced growth conditions to further examine this possibility we take daily sampling to limit the differences of measurement the glmms results showed that the variable chlorophyll fluorescence parameters are closely related to the abundance of algae table 3 and the presence of a time lag phenomenon figs 2b and 3 in addition our investigation results showed that the concentration of p i was deficient during the p shikokuense bloom fig 2a it is shown that the water body is in a phosphorus limited state when the dinoflagellate blooms occur but it is very difficult to determine whether algal cells are in unbalanced growth conditions during this stage later spring to early summer therefore we speculate that whether or not p i is acting as a stressor on algal cells may be more closely related to the photo physiological status furthermore the concentration of intracellular p i the total cellular p i including the intracellular p i and surface adsorbed p i where latter may account for 15 to 45 of total cellular p i in the different phases of blooms sañudo wilhelmy et al 2004 can be used as a good indicator to measure whether algal cells are under phosphorus stress our previous study found that intracellular p i is important to algal growth jiang et al 2019 gao et al 2022 and the photosynthetic phosphorylation level calvin cycle efficiency photosynthetic rate and block recycling of nadp and nadph will be inhibited by this limitation fredeen et al 1990 therefore further investigation of the exact mechanisms involved in intracellular p i and photo physiological parameters in the field is needed 4 2 fluctuation of growth and photosynthetic characteristics p shikokuense in the laboratory phosphorus is considered to be a common limiting factor for the growth of phytoplankton especially when blooms occur huang et al 2007 in this study phosphorus limitation clearly affected cell abundance and chla concentration after 25 days of culturing compared with the first 20 days in phosphorus sufficient conditions fig 5 during the experiment the concentration of p i was low in the first 2 days because the culture of p shikokuense was in a phosphorus starvation state the value of alkaline phosphatase was about 14000 fmol cell 1 h 1 unpublished data and a lot of p i were quickly absorbed in the cell surface a similar result was observed in our previous studies jiang et al 2019 however excessive p i was released into the water because it could not be absorbed and utilized before being exuded the concentration of p i increased on day 5 with a maximum value of 18 70 μ m in the medium although the p i concentration in the medium was low after the 20th day the algae continued to grow rapidly and the abundance and chla concentration continued to increase and began to decrease after 5 days fig 5 during the experiment from day 25 to day 40 the algal abundance decreased significantly followed by the values increasing again until the end of the experiment this has also been observed in other studies such as alexandium minutum lippemeier et al 2003 thalassirosira weissflogii liu et al 2011 in addition there was a small fluctuation of p shikokuense abundance in the first 25 days in p i sufficient conditions followed by a large fluctuation in the later 25 days in p i deficient condition by comparison chlorophyll fluorescence parameters have a faster response than that of algal growth during the experiment fig 6 furthermore there were obvious fluctuations in p shikokuense abundance and photosynthetic characteristics in particular we see fluctuations in retr max which clearly identified algal photo physiological status under different nutrient conditions although there are differing opinions about the use of these parameters as indicators for algal blooms under various environmental stressors kruskopf and flynn 2006 lippemeier et al 2001 liu et al 2011 parkhill et al 2001 this study showed a clear time delay relationship between the photosynthetic characteristics and the abundance of p shikokuense under various degrees of phosphorus limitation with the extension of culture time the concentration of p i decreased to a very low level in the last 25 days fig 5a indicating the cultures were under phosphorus limitation note that p shikokuense was not under nitrogen limitation because the growth of p shikokuense has little demand for nitrogen especially on nitrate which had concentrations still above 37 μ m after 33 days of culture when the initial nutrient was at a f 2 level shen and li 2016 the values of f q f m α and retr max fluctuated and decreased to 0 15 0 032 and 7 55 respectively at the end of the experiment fig 6 similar results have been observed in the harmful raphidophyte chattonella antiqua reported by qiu et al 2013 where they conducted the complete growth cycle culture experiment under different nutrient conditions the control group s results showed the f v f m value changes from 0 58 to 0 70 during the exponential phase from 0 16 to 0 55 during the stationary phase with some fluctuations and increased slightly during the decline phase the relative pattern of variation in f v f m in the nutrient limited group was similar to the control group there were many reasons for the fluctuation of photosynthetic parameters during the long time culture some studies suggested that the value of f v f m was overestimated because of the presence of photosynthetically non functional dead cells and cell detritus franklin et al 2009 however there is strong evidence that photosynthetic parameter values of some algae decrease under phosphorus stress liu et al 2011 qi et al 2013 and increase immediately after being supplemented lippemeier et al 2001 2003 therefore we believe that photosynthetic parameter values are the key to understanding whether the intracellular p i of algae is in a limited state 4 3 model fitting of experimental data of p shikokuense in this paper we establish a novel algal growth model incorporating growth delay based on the interaction between the actual quantum efficiency of photosynthesis and algal growth intuitive fitting results model cost and relative error show that the model can reproduce the changes in cell abundance and photo physiology status during p shikokuense culture it is worth noting that this model coupled the photo physiology status and growth state of algae which is similar to the models of hartmann et al 2014 and nikolaou et al 2016 compared with the models of hartmann et al 2014 and nikolaou et al 2016 our model is simpler and has fewer free parameters our model can directly describe the change of cell density based on the photosynthetic parameters of algae which makes the measurement of experimental data of model variables simpler and more convenient for model verification in addition the time delay between algal growth status and photo physiology status was incorporated this model can simulate the phenomenon of fluctuation of cell density and photo physiology status in the process of p shikokuense culture during the whole culture period the experimental data and the fitted curve of the model show a trend of large oscillatory variation fig 7 which may be caused by the delay between the slow growth of algae and the rapid change of photo physiology status the time delay may cause the system to lose stability and oscillation may occur when there is a phase change between the received signal and the response to the signal droop 1983 mackey and glass 1977 misra et al 2020 an et al 2019 melendez alvarez et al 2021 found that the feedback mechanism of cell growth can lead to the fluctuation of cell density through a molecular mathematical model combined with experimental data in this model we only consider the effect of the photo physiology status of algae on cell growth while the effect of limited nutrients e g phosphorus was ignored phosphorus plays an important role in the photosynthesis of phytoplankton such as the calvin cycle and regulation of some enzyme activity wang et al 2004 shen and li 2016 an interesting avenue of future work would be to incorporate the effects of phosphorus on algal growth and photo physiology status into the model an ecological stoichiometry model is a powerful tool for combining energy balance with various of nutrients in an ecosystem models based on ecological stoichiometry have been widely used to explore various ecological mechanisms such as predator prey systems algae daphnia interactions and nutrient uptake processes in phytoplankton peace and wang 2019 yuan et al 2020 davies and wang 2021 yan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 heggerud et al 2020 to describe the growth characteristics of algae more accurately the influence of limiting nutrients on algal growth can be further considered based on the model proposed in this paper combined with stoichiometric mechanisms lópez sandoval et al 2014 have shown that the size of the cell can affect the metabolic rate of the species for example the relationship between photosynthesis and cell size is unimodal with the highest rate measured in medium sized species therefore our model is unlikely to be applied to all algae species we need to combine the actual data to adjust the relevant model parameters according to the species specificity in order to be suitable for other habs species in addition we speculate that for species with close taxonomic status such as species of the same family or genus the applicability of the model is better due to the similarity of their ecological characteristics we validate the model with the data of symbiodinium sp and obtain good fitting results one possible reason is that p shikokuense and symbiodinium sp have similar taxonomic status in general combined with marine field data the established prediction model for specific phytoplankton species will help to effectively predict the outbreak of harmful algal blooms funding this work was supported by the

24218,understanding how the physiological processes of trees are affected by the environment or silvicultural practices is important for forest management which requires process based models it enables the evaluation of the growth of a forest under different scenarios the 3 pg model has been widely used all over the world justified by its simplicity and efficiency as it uses a more accessible language and fewer parameters than other process based models it is a model of greatest interest for forest management because it enables the use of allometric equations to calculate variables of interest in this area such as the average diameter at 1 30 m height dbh total height and stand volume the 3 pg parameterization is essential to guarantee the model s good performance however in some cases when observed data are not available values from the literature is used or calibration is performed in general there is a mixture of these alternatives in the same parameterization but some of the parameters generate greater sensitivity in some outputs or change according to site characteristics in the present work we analyzed the efficiency of artificial neural networks to predict some of the parameters pointed out in the literature as being of the greatest importance for 3 pg using climate and process variables as inputs for this a simulated database was generated using 16 parameterizations of 3 pg for different regions of brazil the parameters values of the dbh function as and ns minimum and maximum fraction of biomass allocated to the root ηrn and ηrx and age at full canopy cover tc were associated with this database the artificial neural networks anns were trained using the database with parameter repetition over time and with the average condition of each site in the second case training was performed using 100 of the data and validation was performed using a simulated database the efficiency of neural networks has been proven in predicting the parameters as ns and ηrx with validation root mean squared error rmse of 6 9 6 9 and 4 8 in the first training approach respectively for training based on sites average condition rmse was 20 7 3 0 and 8 8 for as ns and ηrx respectively the study showed the need for more scientific investigation for the other parameters including information and input variables such as soil characteristics as demonstrated in this study the possibility of parameterizing 3 pg with anns or any machine learning technique may contribute to the broader use of this process based model in addition artificial neural networks have great potential to assist in the calibration process of the 3 pg model making this process more efficient by integrating environmental conditions and allowing the association between parameters it is recommended to apply these anns for the conditions tested here graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords process based model eucalypt forest management machine learning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction modeling has improved forest management performance over the years all the information required for decision making by management is based on mathematical tools capable of determining the functioning of a natural process or phenomenon from field observations burkhart and tomé 2012 forest growth is a phenomenon that guides management within a company thus forest growth and productivity modeling must be carried out with caution always adopting techniques that best meet the final objective and guarantee productivity economic social and environmental sustainability skovsgaard and vanclay 2008 defining the best time to harvest a forest plantation is one of the main steps however obtaining accurate results depends on understanding how the forest reflects the effects of management silvicultural practices genotype and environmental campos 1970 skovsgaard and vanclay 2008 the interaction between these factors determines the productivity of a forest and maintaining a high level of productivity faces uncertainties especially regarding environmental factors for example a discussion that is currently intensifying questions the potential impact of climate change on forest productivity as the effects of climate cannot be controlled it is up to the forest engineer to seek ways to adapt strategies include long term planning involving climate change scenarios knowing the potential productivity of different areas finding the appropriate genotype for each region and carrying out forest management based on growth and yield models that allow associating causal variables models of this type are called process based models those with potential use in forest management have a hybrid character due to their ability to quantify the carbon fixed by the forest canopy perform biomass allocation to roots stems and foliage and calculate the mean diameter at 1 30 m height dbh total height and stand volume fontes et al 2010 the 3 pg physiological principles predicting growth landsberg and waring 1997 is the most used process based model for its application in the original version it is necessary to determine 63 parameters divided according to the processes simulated absorption and conversion of solar radiation production and allocation of biomass water balance mortality dendrometric calculations litterfall and root turnover sands 2004 each parameter s value depends on certain factors such as the species or clone climate and the region s soil therefore it depends on observations some parameters are universal and standard values are generally used in contrast others such as parameters related to biomass partition and turnover canopy structure and processes and wood and stand properties show greater variation because they are species or clone specific researchers can use values available from previous studies if the conditions are compatible there is also the possibility of calibrating the model with the observed data preferably the root stem and foliage biomass data when this information is unavailable forest inventory data such as dbh total height or volume can replace stem biomass and leaf area index data can replace foliage biomass sands 2004 some parameters are manually modified during calibration and the model runs a few times until proximity is found between the observed and simulated values landsberg waring and coops 2003 this technique requires detailed knowledge about the parameters and functioning of the model to ensure there are no biological inconsistencies sands 2004 as some model parameters change according to the species and environmental characteristics and 3 pg is sensitive to climatic effects machine learning techniques could contribute to a less empirical parameter estimation this can be achieved by integrating climatic variables from the region where the parameterization or calibration is desired and other related variables through an artificial neural network ann in this way parameter estimation can become easier and safer than the calibration process the ann models have a structure inspired by the nervous system in the way the communication between neurons occurs these neurons are represented by simple processing units distributed in parallel layers connected by weights responsible for storing the information learned in the training process haykin 2009 this configuration refers to mlp multilayer perceptron the type of ann most used for approximating functions this work is a preliminary study on the use of a machine learning technique for the 3 pg model parameterization which can allow the model application in areas with different conditions a complete sampling work to 3 pg parameterization requires a great sampling effort based on representative experimental data in addition to the use of destructive methods taking more time and effort to perform in this way using a model to predict some of the most important parameters for 3 pg helps to avoid or reduce the sampling effort this is possible thanks to the variety of parameterizations already made in brazil for different eucalypt genotypes and growth conditions which together with the site characteristics can generate a database for the development of a model capable of predicting 3 pg parameters in different areas among the alternatives for building this model ann is a promising technique capable of relating variables of different types quantitative or categorical variables extracting and relating information conferring non linearity in addition to promoting greater generalization that is the ability to make predictions satisfactory with unobserved data lek et al 1996 haykin 2009 the results and conclusions presented by research in the forestry area using the ann models for different purposes species and locations worldwide including brazil reinforce the idea that this is a viable alternative for this study some examples include studies that predict the leaf area index in coniferous forests ercanli et al 2018 carbon flux in forest plantations wen et al 2014 aboveground biomass modeling vahedi 2016 nandy et al 2017 domingues et al 2020 and the prediction of dendrometric variables such as total height binoti et al 2017 bayat et al 2020 and volume niska et al 2010 binotia binoti and leite 2014 dantas et al 2020 silva et al 2021 this study aimed to evaluate the use of ann to predict the parameters of the 3 pg model which generate greater sensitivity in some outputs and present greater variation 2 material and methods 2 1 description of 3 pg model the 3 pg is a model composed of 63 parameters distributed in five submodels its more recent version is 3 pgpjs2 7 sands 2010 supplementary material

fertility and concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 their values vary in the model between 0 most limiting conditions and 1 least limiting conditions the age vpd and θ modifiers are used to calculate the physiological modifier φ which relates the age modifier to the most restrictive modifier between vpd and θ gross primary production gpp is calculated as the product of absorbed photosynthetically active solar radiation maximum canopy quantum efficiency and growth modifiers the net primary production npp is then calculated by multiplying the gpp by the respiration rate which

correlations between the observed and predicted values were above 0 5 in all networks with the highest correlations in the parameters as ηrx and tc during validation table 3 all networks except for the ηrx parameter during training showed non significant p values in the fh0 test during training and validation the anns for the minimum fraction of biomass allocated to roots ηrn and age of canopy closure tc the rmse values were higher however they showed non significant fh0 values in training and validation table 3 most of the residuals between observed and predicted values were concentrated at 30 in all networks in validation and training except for the parameter ηrn which presented 45 of the residuals in the validation and 48 in training at 30 fig 3 when considering the range of as and ns parameters used in the network training the curve tendency behavior when modifying its values was observed the ns parameter can cause greater sensitivity in some outputs as the curve concavity changes relatively widely with every 0 25 units of difference however this change increases at values above 2 5 fig 4 the change in parameter as representing the curve dislocation is less expressive in relation to ns for different values of ns the dislocation changes to a lesser extent requiring wider variations in this parameter to cause more significant changes fig 4b 3 2 database training with average conditions 16 observations by reducing the database and considering the average values that is average conditions the best combinations between variables remained the same for the anns of parameters of the relationship with dbh as and ns and the minimum biomass fraction allocated to roots ηrn in the network used to predict the parameter tc the number of variables increased and for

foliage and stem for a dbh 2 cm and fd growth modifier dependent on vapor pressure deficit statistically there was an improvement in parameter ns and ηrn networks the other networks showed a small difference in relation to the use of the complete database with repetition the rmse values of parameter ηrn went from 50 5 in training to 38 1 the parameter ns from 7 to 3 using this approach the correlations between observed and predicted values were above 0 8 and all p values of the fh0 test were non significant table 5 in general there was a reduction in the dispersion of the residuals between the observed and predicted values mainly for parameters ns and ηrn fig 5 b c the ns parameter network presented 100 of the data at 25 and parameters as ηrn ηrx and tc with 75 93 7 and 62 5 of residuals in this range respectively however the anns overall performance with training using the average values and the database with repetition maintained the same trend with less data dispersion there was a more significant improvement for parameter ηrn resulting in less dispersion of residuals in relation to the database with repetition fig 5c the anns application in the simulated database showed consistency in relation to the database used in training with regard to the input variables only parameter as presented a well defined trend in relation to the parameter ns there was no clear trend in the other networks as the predicted value is related to climate data despite this the results were consistent with the behavior of the input variable related to each parameter fig 6 4 discussion using artificial neural networks we attempted to map the functional relationships between climate and process variables to predict the parameters of the 3 pg model the selected parameters were those pointed out in the literature responsible for generating greater sensitivity in some model outputs the ann was chosen because it allows the association of different variables providing a greater generalization capacity and the ability to describe the interaction between them in general the 3 pg model simulates the growth and production of forests as a function of climatic variations that affect the physiological processes of trees over time however the parameters were kept constant throughout the processing as changes in the parameter value were not considered in this study subsequently the monthly changes in the climate inputs changed the conditions and model outputs based on this dynamic the state variables were changed every month until the end of the processing period maintaining the values of the parameters thus when configuring the database for training artificial neural networks the columns referring to each location s ann outputs parameter values were repeated over time to verify the effect of this configuration the networks were trained considering two sets of data with parameter repetition over time and with each site average conditions 4 1 artificial neural networks efficiency with the complete database in the first approach testing the conditions and variables used in this study the anns statistical results were satisfactory in training and validation except for parameter of minimum fraction of biomass allocated to roots ηrn and canopy closing age tc it is presumed that important information to explain the variation in these parameters was lacking in these cases this can also be verified by the data dispersion pattern in all trained neural networks which may have been caused by the repetition of the same observed parameter value for different conditions this behavior caused the graph to present a rectangular structure or a set of horizontal rows of points causing low correlation the same was observed in all networks with less intensity in the networks of parameters as and ηrx because in the last two cases other parameters were used as input variables reducing the point dispersion the network selected to predict the parameter as was composed of the variables solar radiation average temperature and parameter ns this network s graphical and statistical results showed the best performance in relation to the networks of other parameters within the first approach the use of ns in the network was essential to reduce the training and validation residues anns trained without such a variable showed correlation values below 0 6 and rmse above 52 as as and ns are predicted together to describe the relationship between dbh and the average stem biomass using a neural network to integrate the value of ns with the climatic variables can promote adequate as parameter results in a given site for parameter ns the combination of rainfall average temperature solar radiation and leaf area index presented the best graphic and statistical results in this case the correlations were low 0 6 in training and validation however the percentage of residuals between the predicted and observed values were concentrated at 20 this occurred because the database structure with repetition generated a set of predictions in relation to each individual observed value for different conditions the behavior described by the parameters as and ns is a curve generated by a simple exponential model in which the constant is represented by as which usually has values close to zero and ns represents the power together these parameters incorporate the effects of stem height and shape landsberg waring and coops 2003 some studies indicate that the outputs dbh and basal area have strong sensitivities to the value of these parameters pérez cruzado et al 2011 and the leaf area index has strong sensitivity in relation to the parameter ns and moderate sensitivity in relation to the parameter as esprey sands and smith 2004 thus the ann improves the prediction process of these parameters according to the site conditions reducing the uncertainties of the model outputs climate variation causes changes in biomass allocation dynamics sands and landsberg 2002 zhao et al 2009 and changes in stem biomass interfere with growth in dbh what justifies the use of climatic variables as important indicators of the curve trend described by the parameters as and ns according to landsberg waring and coops 2003 the ideal would be to obtain the parameters as and ns from experimental data whenever possible since they are parameters of a nonlinear relationship small variations can cause significant differences in the values of dbh basal area and volume these authors recommended that once the values of as and ns are defined they should not be changed during the calibration process in cases where estimations using observed data are not an option the networks presented here may be more feasible in the future a comparison with observed data could reinforce the potential of using this network with different combinations or other machine learning techniques parameters ηrn and ηrx represent the minimum and maximum biomass range allocated to the roots only the network predicting parameter ηrx had good graphic and statistical performance when combining rainfall average temperature the modifier dependent on the vapor pressure deficit fd leaf area index and parameters ηrn and p2 the combination was inadequate for the minimum fraction allocated to roots ηrn network and the results were more dispersed generating greater residuals the interval defined by ηrn and ηrx is inserted in the relationship where the rate of net biomass to be allocated to roots ηr is calculated which also depends on soil fertility and water availability thus adding this information to a network can lead to better predictions however the results for ηrx were accurate allowing the application and testing of this network in the parameterization or calibration of the model another issue is that the predictions could be more accurate if the database is generated with the soil conditions corresponding to each site it is also important to consider that root biomass data are rarely available as they are more difficult to collect in the field in most of the studies covered in this research these parameters were obtained from the literature which shows a certain difficulty in determining them from observed data and the risk of using inappropriate values this also shows how the search for a database with greater variability and amount of information direct or indirect could help obtain a more comprehensive ann that helps the model users according to esprey sands and smith 2004 ηrn and ηrx are part of the set of parameters requiring more accurate determination as they generate moderate sensitivity in the volume and leaf area index outputs almeida landsberg and sands 2004 observed that root biomass is strongly sensitive to ηrn therefore information related to soil fertility could improve the prediction of this parameter the age at full canopy cover parameter tc prediction presented good general performance but with some trends and a high rmse in relation to the other networks the average temperature solar radiation and p20 parameter corresponded to the combination selected in this network this result demonstrates the feasibility of using ann to obtain tc mainly due to the fact that an accurate tc parameter value is fundamental for adjusting the 3 pg model to forest conditions xie wang and lei 2017 which was also verified by cao et al 2019 the age of canopy closure is used to calculate the canopy cover which is then used together with the leaf area index to calculate the intercepted photosynthetically active radiation using beer s law changes in this parameter alter the growth rates of plantations in response to environmental conditions rodríguez suárez et al 2010 thus when the correct age of canopy closure is not used there may be inconsistencies in estimating forest growth in the early years song et al 2013 observed that foliage biomass had a strong sensitivity to the ns parameter canopy closure occurs by canopy growth and determining the most appropriate values for tc and ns is important to better describe the rate of forest growth thus combining climatic variables and the parameter p20 in the tc prediction might represent part of the site effects and the proportion between foliage and stems at a mature age however using variables related to soil fertility can improve the accuracy of this network another possibility is to directly predict the canopy coverage fraction using site variables and age as network inputs oliveira et al 2018 applied the 3 pg model to the northern region of minas gerais state mg using the parameterization performed for the savanna region in northern mg however the results were not representative of the location the authors found more appropriate results when modifying the tc ns and allometric relationship parameters for total height and volume given this it is possible to determine how environmental conditions impact forest growth and how the parameter value must be suitable when using the 3 pg model at different sites artificial neural networks can be adequate for calculating parameters by integrating environmental conditions and other important variables of different types in parameter prediction 4 2 artificial neural networks efficiency with the database in average conditions with the database composed of the average from each site reduced to 16 observations some variable combinations were maintained and others reduced the number of inputs except for the network to predict the parameter tc a network with the same variables and a smaller number of neurons in the intermediate layer was selected to predict the as parameter the average residual was higher when considering the average conditions 10 however in both cases the network performance was satisfactory and the testing and application of both anns are recommended this is because the values of as are close to zero and the maximum residual obtained was 55 7 in this case which corresponds to an observed value of 0 02 predicted as 0 03 moreover as analyzed in this study the variations of this parameter at the considered interval affected the curve trend in a less significant manner in relation to the parameter ns with the elimination of the repetition effect on the database dispersion the network trained for parameter ns presented better statistical results than the first training in this case the network topology and the selected input variables were the same but the percentage residuals between the observed and predicted values reduced the range of 5 to 9 therefore although the performance was satisfactory in both cases the use of average conditions promoted a better fit because of the non repetition of values for different conditions considering the importance of this parameter in the model which is capable of causing high sensitivity in some outputs and is important in the representation of growth rates this smaller residual interval can improve the prediction of ns the minimum value of the interval of the biomass fraction allocated to the roots was the network that presented the most significant change in the statistical results in this training approach however the inclusion of the soil fertility variable can improve precision in training this network as these are small values higher errors did not cause large differences between the observed and predicted values by the ann with 69 of the residuals between 50 the largest errors were for very small values between 0 01 and 0 04 the maximum fraction of biomass allocated to roots ηrx parameter performed well in both approaches however the statistical results were better for the complete database the network topology was different in this case with a smaller number of input variables and neurons in the intermediate layer maintaining the rainfall p2 and ηrn variables with the addition of the variable amplitude between the minimum and maximum temperatures because the variation in this parameter was not high it is recommended to test and apply both anns the network selected to predict the age of canopy closure showed little difference compared to the database with repetition in the first approach 40 of the residues were concentrated within 10 whereas in this case 31 3 of the residues were in this range a combination with more input variables was selected but it was simpler than the first approach the use of both networks is recommended remembering that tests with other variables mainly related to soil fertility are still necessary to predict this parameter the database used in this study considered fr 0 8 in all sites therefore it is believed that cases where soil physical and chemical characteristics or even foliar analysis are available can achieve very efficient ann models the results were consistent with the training database when validating the networks with the simulated data although a well defined trend between the predicted values and input variables was not observed in some cases it is possible to perceive a certain similarity in the dispersion of the training data in relation to the simulated data in fig 6b for example there is a greater concentration of predictions made with the simulated base where there is also a greater concentration of data from the training base the same can be observed in the other graphs the validation proposal using simulated data is an efficient option for modeling studies and can be tested for different models and objectives in both approaches using only climatic variables as network inputs for the parameters and conditions evaluated here did not generate good results results not shown therefore due to the loss of precision using anns as a function of climatic variables alone may not compensate the effort in obtaining other explanatory variables however except for the biomass data the other variables used in the best performing networks are easy to obtain in addition it is believed that the use of simple edaphic data such as soil type clay content or other physical soil characteristics available for the region could be sufficient to improve the results keeping the ann model as simple as possible the calibration process consisted of manually changing the parameter value followed by running the 3 pg model until the simulated values were close to the observed values an ann in supervised training makes the comparison between predicted and observed values at each iteration in an optimized manner through a learning algorithm and based on input variables related to the output with the application of a network in the model calibration process manual calibration can be avoided at the same time it simplifies and results in greater flexibility and consistency as well as a lower cost of obtaining data to calibrate the 3 pg model and the possibility of inserting categorical variables in the network regarding the application of the network itself a decision to use average data from the site as inputs or not is up to the model user regardless of how the networks were trained good results required accurate input data the organization of the database itself did not impact the network training process if the network is presented with a database with adequate variability the inputs may or may not correspond to average data at the time of the application through the large number of studies already published using the 3 pg model in different conditions and species in different parts of the world there is an accumulation of experienced users and researchers considering how the parameters vary among species and sites the determination of these parameters especially those of greater importance and sensitivity can be improved by employing a neural network comprising site and species or clone specific variables ann can also be used to predict the maximum canopy quantum efficiency parameter αcx according to sands 2004 αcx can be determined in three ways from experimental data with trees growing without water and nutrient limitations use of the maximum value of αc from values of αc found in sites with different productivities or by the average of the values of αc found in very productive sites in any of these cases with the addition of other important explanatory variables for example of a categorical nature and related to the species or clone the network can be used as an alternative to predict αcx in addition ann models can be integrated into 3 pg through a parallel system to predict the parameters and simplify their application this first attempt sought to understand which variables have consistent biological relationships with the parameters the results showed that it is possible to apply the networks to the parameterization or calibration process of the 3 pg model however it is still necessary to use more information mainly on soil fertility and to test other machine learning techniques considering for example the possibility of changing the value of parameters in specific periods depending on climate and edaphic changes according to song et al 2013 in the case of brazil it would be interesting to verify whether this analysis would have an impact even in lower rotations it would also be interesting to investigate the differences between using current climatic data and climatological normals advances in understanding the behavior of the parameters lead to more accurate results and consequently better the application of 3 pg for forest management purposes climate change tends to decrease eucalypt productivity in some regions of brazil baesso ribeiro and silva 2010 therefore the risks associated with these changes must be considered in the companies strategic planning palma et al 2021 developed a correction factor inserted in a company optimization model to discount productivity losses caused by climate change this factor relates the differences between forest growth under current and future climate ipcc a1b scenario these simulations were performed using the 3 pg model as it is a process based model driven by climate variables therefore the use of machine learning techniques for calibration of 3 pg can circumvent the limitations of its use for this purpose allowing the model application in areas with different conditions mainly thinking about building machine learning models consisting of variables that will result in better spatial resolution in the 3 pg model at stand level for example 5 conclusions the paper presented the first attempts to obtain an ann model to predict 3 pg model parameters once the efficiency of the artificial neural networks for this purpose has been proven the parameterization and calibration processes of the 3 pg model will be simplified and its use will become more comprehensive and practical since the manual calibration requires greater knowledge about the parameters behavior and must be careful not to compromise the model biological realism predict the parameters based on environment and forest characteristics is also a way to reduce the sampling effort to parameterize 3 pg anns training analysis showed that the parameters predictions of the allometric relationship with the mean dbh as and ns and the maximum fraction of biomass allocated to roots ηrx showed greater accuracy for the other parameters ηrn and tc there is a need for more scientific investigation including information and input variables such as soil characteristics the database structure does not affect the network training process inaccurate results were due to the lack of explanatory variables the differences observed are associated with the database size in each case and how the information was related ann validation using simulated data proved the efficiency of the networks selected in the second approach the ann models developed in this study can be applied to calibrate 3 pg model for eucalypt in the

24218,understanding how the physiological processes of trees are affected by the environment or silvicultural practices is important for forest management which requires process based models it enables the evaluation of the growth of a forest under different scenarios the 3 pg model has been widely used all over the world justified by its simplicity and efficiency as it uses a more accessible language and fewer parameters than other process based models it is a model of greatest interest for forest management because it enables the use of allometric equations to calculate variables of interest in this area such as the average diameter at 1 30 m height dbh total height and stand volume the 3 pg parameterization is essential to guarantee the model s good performance however in some cases when observed data are not available values from the literature is used or calibration is performed in general there is a mixture of these alternatives in the same parameterization but some of the parameters generate greater sensitivity in some outputs or change according to site characteristics in the present work we analyzed the efficiency of artificial neural networks to predict some of the parameters pointed out in the literature as being of the greatest importance for 3 pg using climate and process variables as inputs for this a simulated database was generated using 16 parameterizations of 3 pg for different regions of brazil the parameters values of the dbh function as and ns minimum and maximum fraction of biomass allocated to the root ηrn and ηrx and age at full canopy cover tc were associated with this database the artificial neural networks anns were trained using the database with parameter repetition over time and with the average condition of each site in the second case training was performed using 100 of the data and validation was performed using a simulated database the efficiency of neural networks has been proven in predicting the parameters as ns and ηrx with validation root mean squared error rmse of 6 9 6 9 and 4 8 in the first training approach respectively for training based on sites average condition rmse was 20 7 3 0 and 8 8 for as ns and ηrx respectively the study showed the need for more scientific investigation for the other parameters including information and input variables such as soil characteristics as demonstrated in this study the possibility of parameterizing 3 pg with anns or any machine learning technique may contribute to the broader use of this process based model in addition artificial neural networks have great potential to assist in the calibration process of the 3 pg model making this process more efficient by integrating environmental conditions and allowing the association between parameters it is recommended to apply these anns for the conditions tested here graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords process based model eucalypt forest management machine learning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction modeling has improved forest management performance over the years all the information required for decision making by management is based on mathematical tools capable of determining the functioning of a natural process or phenomenon from field observations burkhart and tomé 2012 forest growth is a phenomenon that guides management within a company thus forest growth and productivity modeling must be carried out with caution always adopting techniques that best meet the final objective and guarantee productivity economic social and environmental sustainability skovsgaard and vanclay 2008 defining the best time to harvest a forest plantation is one of the main steps however obtaining accurate results depends on understanding how the forest reflects the effects of management silvicultural practices genotype and environmental campos 1970 skovsgaard and vanclay 2008 the interaction between these factors determines the productivity of a forest and maintaining a high level of productivity faces uncertainties especially regarding environmental factors for example a discussion that is currently intensifying questions the potential impact of climate change on forest productivity as the effects of climate cannot be controlled it is up to the forest engineer to seek ways to adapt strategies include long term planning involving climate change scenarios knowing the potential productivity of different areas finding the appropriate genotype for each region and carrying out forest management based on growth and yield models that allow associating causal variables models of this type are called process based models those with potential use in forest management have a hybrid character due to their ability to quantify the carbon fixed by the forest canopy perform biomass allocation to roots stems and foliage and calculate the mean diameter at 1 30 m height dbh total height and stand volume fontes et al 2010 the 3 pg physiological principles predicting growth landsberg and waring 1997 is the most used process based model for its application in the original version it is necessary to determine 63 parameters divided according to the processes simulated absorption and conversion of solar radiation production and allocation of biomass water balance mortality dendrometric calculations litterfall and root turnover sands 2004 each parameter s value depends on certain factors such as the species or clone climate and the region s soil therefore it depends on observations some parameters are universal and standard values are generally used in contrast others such as parameters related to biomass partition and turnover canopy structure and processes and wood and stand properties show greater variation because they are species or clone specific researchers can use values available from previous studies if the conditions are compatible there is also the possibility of calibrating the model with the observed data preferably the root stem and foliage biomass data when this information is unavailable forest inventory data such as dbh total height or volume can replace stem biomass and leaf area index data can replace foliage biomass sands 2004 some parameters are manually modified during calibration and the model runs a few times until proximity is found between the observed and simulated values landsberg waring and coops 2003 this technique requires detailed knowledge about the parameters and functioning of the model to ensure there are no biological inconsistencies sands 2004 as some model parameters change according to the species and environmental characteristics and 3 pg is sensitive to climatic effects machine learning techniques could contribute to a less empirical parameter estimation this can be achieved by integrating climatic variables from the region where the parameterization or calibration is desired and other related variables through an artificial neural network ann in this way parameter estimation can become easier and safer than the calibration process the ann models have a structure inspired by the nervous system in the way the communication between neurons occurs these neurons are represented by simple processing units distributed in parallel layers connected by weights responsible for storing the information learned in the training process haykin 2009 this configuration refers to mlp multilayer perceptron the type of ann most used for approximating functions this work is a preliminary study on the use of a machine learning technique for the 3 pg model parameterization which can allow the model application in areas with different conditions a complete sampling work to 3 pg parameterization requires a great sampling effort based on representative experimental data in addition to the use of destructive methods taking more time and effort to perform in this way using a model to predict some of the most important parameters for 3 pg helps to avoid or reduce the sampling effort this is possible thanks to the variety of parameterizations already made in brazil for different eucalypt genotypes and growth conditions which together with the site characteristics can generate a database for the development of a model capable of predicting 3 pg parameters in different areas among the alternatives for building this model ann is a promising technique capable of relating variables of different types quantitative or categorical variables extracting and relating information conferring non linearity in addition to promoting greater generalization that is the ability to make predictions satisfactory with unobserved data lek et al 1996 haykin 2009 the results and conclusions presented by research in the forestry area using the ann models for different purposes species and locations worldwide including brazil reinforce the idea that this is a viable alternative for this study some examples include studies that predict the leaf area index in coniferous forests ercanli et al 2018 carbon flux in forest plantations wen et al 2014 aboveground biomass modeling vahedi 2016 nandy et al 2017 domingues et al 2020 and the prediction of dendrometric variables such as total height binoti et al 2017 bayat et al 2020 and volume niska et al 2010 binotia binoti and leite 2014 dantas et al 2020 silva et al 2021 this study aimed to evaluate the use of ann to predict the parameters of the 3 pg model which generate greater sensitivity in some outputs and present greater variation 2 material and methods 2 1 description of 3 pg model the 3 pg is a model composed of 63 parameters distributed in five submodels its more recent version is 3 pgpjs2 7 sands 2010 supplementary material

provide information about different components of forest growth and production namely biomass production and allocation stand site and management attributes climatic factors canopy attributes growth

compartment root stem and foliage total or seedling biomass at planting sands 2010 the 3 pg model is composed of growth modifiers landsberg and waring 1997 which determine together with the maximum canopy quantum efficiency the plant s ability to absorb photosynthetically active radiation and produce biomass namely temperature vapor pressure deficit vpd age amount of available soil water soil fertility and concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 their values vary in the model between 0 most limiting conditions and 1 least limiting conditions the age vpd and θ modifiers are used to calculate the physiological modifier φ which relates the age modifier to the most restrictive modifier between vpd and θ gross primary production gpp is calculated as the product of absorbed photosynthetically active solar radiation maximum canopy quantum efficiency and growth modifiers the net primary production npp is then calculated by multiplying the gpp by the respiration rate which is defined as a constant value and approximately equal to 0 50 eq 1 finally the amount of biomass calculated is distributed among root stem and foliage compartments the value defined for the first

dataset repeating the parameters values the networks with best performance were selected table 2 the anns for as ns and ηrx predictions showed rmses below 10 in training and validation the correlations between the observed and predicted values were above 0 5 in all networks with the highest correlations in the parameters as ηrx and tc during validation table 3 all networks except for the ηrx parameter during training showed non significant p values in the fh0 test during training and validation the anns for the minimum fraction of biomass allocated to roots ηrn and age of canopy closure tc the rmse values were higher however they showed non significant fh0 values in training and validation table 3 most of the residuals between observed and predicted values were concentrated at 30 in all networks in validation and training except for the parameter ηrn which presented 45 of the residuals in the validation and 48 in training at 30 fig 3 when considering the range of as and ns parameters used in the network training the curve tendency behavior when modifying its values was observed the ns parameter can cause greater sensitivity in some outputs as the curve concavity changes relatively widely with every 0 25 units of difference however this change increases at values above 2 5 fig 4 the change in parameter as representing the curve dislocation is less expressive in relation to ns for different values of ns the dislocation changes to a lesser extent requiring wider variations in this parameter to cause more significant changes fig 4b 3 2 database training with average conditions 16 observations by reducing the database and considering the average values that is average conditions the best combinations between variables remained the same for the anns of parameters of the relationship with dbh as and ns and the minimum biomass fraction allocated to roots ηrn in the network used to predict the parameter tc the number of variables increased and for parameter ηrx it decreased table 4 where prcp monthly rainfall mm ta average temperature c solar rad solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 lai leaf area index m² m 2 as and ns parameters in dbh f ws

foliage and stem for a dbh 2 cm and fd growth modifier dependent on vapor pressure deficit statistically there was an improvement in parameter ns and ηrn networks the other networks showed a small difference in relation to the use of the complete database with repetition the rmse values of parameter ηrn went from 50 5 in training to 38 1 the parameter ns from 7 to 3 using this approach the correlations between observed and predicted values were above 0 8 and all p values of the fh0 test were non significant table 5 in general there was a reduction in the dispersion of the residuals between the observed and predicted values mainly for parameters ns and ηrn fig 5 b c the ns parameter network presented 100 of the data at 25 and parameters as ηrn ηrx and tc with 75 93 7 and 62 5 of residuals in this range respectively however the anns overall performance with training using the average values and the database with repetition maintained the same trend with less data dispersion there was a more significant improvement for parameter ηrn resulting in less dispersion of residuals in relation to the database with repetition fig 5c the anns application in the simulated database showed consistency in relation to the database used in training with regard to the input variables only parameter as presented a well defined trend in relation to the parameter ns there was no clear trend in the other networks as the predicted value is related to climate data despite this the results were consistent with the behavior of the input variable related to each parameter fig 6 4 discussion using artificial neural networks we attempted to map the functional relationships between climate and process variables to predict the parameters of the 3 pg model the selected parameters were those pointed out in the literature responsible for generating greater sensitivity in some model outputs the ann was chosen because it allows the association of different variables providing a greater generalization capacity and the ability to describe the interaction between them in general the 3 pg model simulates the growth and production of forests as a function of climatic variations that affect the physiological processes of trees over time however the parameters were kept constant throughout the processing as changes in the parameter value were not considered in this study subsequently the monthly changes in the climate inputs changed the conditions and model outputs based on this dynamic the state variables were changed every month until the end of the processing period maintaining the values of the parameters thus when configuring the database for training artificial neural networks the columns referring to each location s ann outputs parameter values were repeated over time to verify the effect of this configuration the networks were trained considering two sets of data with parameter repetition over time and with each site average conditions 4 1 artificial neural networks efficiency with the complete database in the first approach testing the conditions and variables used in this study the anns statistical results were satisfactory in training and validation except for parameter of minimum fraction of biomass allocated to roots ηrn and canopy closing age tc it is presumed that important information to explain the variation in these parameters was lacking in these cases this can also be verified by the data dispersion pattern in all trained neural networks which may have been caused by the repetition of the same observed parameter value for different conditions this behavior caused the graph to present a rectangular structure or a set of horizontal rows of points causing low correlation the same was observed in all networks with less intensity in the networks of parameters as and ηrx because in the last two cases other parameters were used as input variables reducing the point dispersion the network selected to predict the parameter as was composed of the variables solar radiation average temperature and parameter ns this network s graphical and statistical results showed the best performance in relation to the networks of other parameters within the first approach the use of ns in the network was essential to reduce the training and validation residues anns trained without such a variable showed correlation values below 0 6 and rmse above 52 as as and ns are predicted together to describe the relationship between dbh and the average stem biomass using a neural network to integrate the value of ns with the climatic variables can promote adequate as parameter results in a given site for parameter ns the combination of rainfall average temperature solar radiation and leaf area index presented the best graphic and statistical results in this case the correlations were low 0 6 in training and validation however the percentage of residuals between the predicted and observed values were concentrated at 20 this occurred because the database structure with repetition generated a set of predictions in relation to each individual observed value for different conditions the behavior described by the parameters as and ns is a curve generated by a simple exponential model in which the constant is represented by as which usually has values close to zero and ns represents the power together these parameters incorporate the effects of stem height and shape landsberg waring and coops 2003 some studies indicate that the outputs dbh and basal area have strong sensitivities to the value of these parameters pérez cruzado et al 2011 and the leaf area index has strong sensitivity in relation to the parameter ns and moderate sensitivity in relation to the parameter as esprey sands and smith 2004 thus the ann improves the prediction process of these parameters according to the site conditions reducing the uncertainties of the model outputs climate variation causes changes in biomass allocation dynamics sands and landsberg 2002 zhao et al 2009 and changes in stem biomass interfere with growth in dbh what justifies the use of climatic variables as important indicators of the curve trend described by the parameters as and ns according to landsberg waring and coops 2003 the ideal would be to obtain the parameters as and ns from experimental data whenever possible since they are parameters of a nonlinear relationship small variations can cause significant differences in the values of dbh basal area and volume these authors recommended that once the values of as and ns are defined they should not be changed during the calibration process in cases where estimations using observed data are not an option the networks presented here may be more feasible in the future a comparison with observed data could reinforce the potential of using this network with different combinations or other machine learning techniques parameters ηrn and ηrx represent the minimum and maximum biomass range allocated to the roots only the network predicting parameter ηrx had good graphic and statistical performance when combining rainfall average temperature the modifier dependent on the vapor pressure deficit fd leaf area index and parameters ηrn and p2 the combination was inadequate for the minimum fraction allocated to roots ηrn network and the results were more dispersed generating greater residuals the interval defined by ηrn and ηrx is inserted in the relationship where the rate of net biomass to be allocated to roots ηr is calculated which also depends on soil fertility and water availability thus adding this information to a network can lead to better predictions however the results for ηrx were accurate allowing the application and testing of this network in the parameterization or calibration of the model another issue is that the predictions could be more accurate if the database is generated with the soil conditions corresponding to each site it is also important to consider that root biomass data are rarely available as they are more difficult to collect in the field in most of the studies covered in this research these parameters were obtained from the literature which shows a certain difficulty in determining them from observed data and the risk of using inappropriate values this also shows how the search for a database with greater variability and amount of information direct or indirect could help obtain a more comprehensive ann that helps the model users according to esprey sands and smith 2004 ηrn and ηrx are part of the set of parameters requiring more accurate determination as they generate moderate sensitivity in the volume and leaf area index outputs almeida landsberg and sands 2004 observed that root biomass is strongly sensitive to ηrn therefore information related to soil fertility could improve the prediction of this parameter the age at full canopy cover parameter tc prediction presented good general performance but with some trends and a high rmse in relation to the other networks the average temperature solar radiation and p20 parameter corresponded to the combination selected in this network this result demonstrates the feasibility of using ann to obtain tc mainly due to the fact that an accurate tc parameter value is fundamental for adjusting the 3 pg model to forest conditions xie wang and lei 2017 which was also verified by cao et al 2019 the age of canopy closure is used to calculate the canopy cover which is then used together with the leaf area index to calculate the intercepted photosynthetically active radiation using beer s law changes in this parameter alter the growth rates of plantations in response to environmental conditions rodríguez suárez et al 2010 thus when the correct age of canopy closure is not used there may be inconsistencies in estimating forest growth in the early years song et al 2013 observed that foliage biomass had a strong sensitivity to the ns parameter canopy closure occurs by canopy growth and determining the most appropriate values for tc and ns is important to better describe the rate of forest growth thus combining climatic variables and the parameter p20 in the tc prediction might represent part of the site effects and the proportion between foliage and stems at a mature age however using variables related to soil fertility can improve the accuracy of this network another possibility is to directly predict the canopy coverage fraction using site variables and age as network inputs oliveira et al 2018 applied the 3 pg model to the northern region of minas gerais state mg using the parameterization performed for the savanna region in northern mg however the results were not representative of the location the authors found more appropriate results when modifying the tc ns and allometric relationship parameters for total height and volume given this it is possible to determine how environmental conditions impact forest growth and how the parameter value must be suitable when using the 3 pg model at different sites artificial neural networks can be adequate for calculating parameters by integrating environmental conditions and other important variables of different types in parameter prediction 4 2 artificial neural networks efficiency with the database in average conditions with the database composed of the average from each site reduced to 16 observations some variable combinations were maintained and others reduced the number of inputs except for the network to predict the parameter tc a network with the same variables and a smaller number of neurons in the intermediate layer was selected to predict the as parameter the average residual was higher when considering the average conditions 10 however in both cases the network performance was satisfactory and the testing and application of both anns are recommended this is because the values of as are close to zero and the maximum residual obtained was 55 7 in this case which corresponds to an observed value of 0 02 predicted as 0 03 moreover as analyzed in this study the variations of this parameter at the considered interval affected the curve trend in a less significant manner in relation to the parameter ns with the elimination of the repetition effect on the database dispersion the network trained for parameter ns presented better statistical results than the first training in this case the network topology and the selected input variables were the same but the percentage residuals between the observed and predicted values reduced the range of 5 to 9 therefore although the performance was satisfactory in both cases the use of average conditions promoted a better fit because of the non repetition of values for different conditions considering the importance of this parameter in the model which is capable of causing high sensitivity in some outputs and is important in the representation of growth rates this smaller residual interval can improve the prediction of ns the minimum value of the interval of the biomass fraction allocated to the roots was the network that presented the most significant change in the statistical results in this training approach however the inclusion of the soil fertility variable can improve precision in training this network as these are small values higher errors did not cause large differences between the observed and predicted values by the ann with 69 of the residuals between 50 the largest errors were for very small values between 0 01 and 0 04 the maximum fraction of biomass allocated to roots ηrx parameter performed well in both approaches however the statistical results were better for the complete database the network topology was different in this case with a smaller number of input variables and neurons in the intermediate layer maintaining the rainfall p2 and ηrn variables with the addition of the variable amplitude between the minimum and maximum temperatures because the variation in this parameter was not high it is recommended to test and apply both anns the network selected to predict the age of canopy closure showed little difference compared to the database with repetition in the first approach 40 of the residues were concentrated within 10 whereas in this case 31 3 of the residues were in this range a combination with more input variables was selected but it was simpler than the first approach the use of both networks is recommended remembering that tests with other variables mainly related to soil fertility are still necessary to predict this parameter the database used in this study considered fr 0 8 in all sites therefore it is believed that cases where soil physical and chemical characteristics or even foliar analysis are available can achieve very efficient ann models the results were consistent with the training database when validating the networks with the simulated data although a well defined trend between the predicted values and input variables was not observed in some cases it is possible to perceive a certain similarity in the dispersion of the training data in relation to the simulated data in fig 6b for example there is a greater concentration of predictions made with the simulated base where there is also a greater concentration of data from the training base the same can be observed in the other graphs the validation proposal using simulated data is an efficient option for modeling studies and can be tested for different models and objectives in both approaches using only climatic variables as network inputs for the parameters and conditions evaluated here did not generate good results results not shown therefore due to the loss of precision using anns as a function of climatic variables alone may not compensate the effort in obtaining other explanatory variables however except for the biomass data the other variables used in the best performing networks are easy to obtain in addition it is believed that the use of simple edaphic data such as soil type clay content or other physical soil characteristics available for the region could be sufficient to improve the results keeping the ann model as simple as possible the calibration process consisted of manually changing the parameter value followed by running the 3 pg model until the simulated values were close to the observed values an ann in supervised training makes the comparison between predicted and observed values at each iteration in an optimized manner through a learning algorithm and based on input variables related to the output with the application of a network in the model calibration process manual calibration can be avoided at the same time it simplifies and results in greater flexibility and consistency as well as a lower cost of obtaining data to calibrate the 3 pg model and the possibility of inserting categorical variables in the network regarding the application of the network itself a decision to use average data from the site as inputs or not is up to the model user regardless of how the networks were trained good results required accurate input data the organization of the database itself did not impact the network training process if the network is presented with a database with adequate variability the inputs may or may not correspond to average data at the time of the application through the large number of studies already published using the 3 pg model in different conditions and species in different parts of the world there is an accumulation of experienced users and researchers considering how the parameters vary among species and sites the determination of these parameters especially those of greater importance and sensitivity can be improved by employing a neural network comprising site and species or clone specific variables ann can also be used to predict the maximum canopy quantum efficiency parameter αcx according to sands 2004 αcx can be determined in three ways from experimental data with trees growing without water and nutrient limitations use of the maximum value of αc from values of αc found in sites with different productivities or by the average of the values of αc found in very productive sites in any of these cases with the addition of other important explanatory variables for example of a categorical nature and related to the species or clone the network can be used as an alternative to predict αcx in addition ann models can be integrated into 3 pg through a parallel system to predict the parameters and simplify their application this first attempt sought to understand which variables have consistent biological relationships with the parameters the results showed that it is possible to apply the networks to the parameterization or calibration process of the 3 pg model however it is still necessary to use more information mainly on soil fertility and to test other machine learning techniques considering for example the possibility of changing the value of parameters in specific periods depending on climate and edaphic changes according to song et al 2013 in the case of brazil it would be interesting to verify whether this analysis would have an impact even in lower rotations it would also be interesting to investigate the differences between using current climatic data and climatological normals advances in understanding the behavior of the parameters lead to more accurate results and consequently better the application of 3 pg for forest management purposes climate change tends to decrease eucalypt productivity in some regions of brazil baesso ribeiro and silva 2010 therefore the risks associated with these changes must be considered in the companies strategic planning palma et al 2021 developed a correction factor inserted in a company optimization model to discount productivity losses caused by climate change this factor relates the differences between forest growth under current and future climate ipcc a1b scenario these simulations were performed using the 3 pg model as it is a process based model driven by climate variables therefore the use of machine learning techniques for calibration of 3 pg can circumvent the limitations of its use for this purpose allowing the model application in areas with different conditions mainly thinking about building machine learning models consisting of variables that will result in better spatial resolution in the 3 pg model at stand level for example 5 conclusions the paper presented the first attempts to obtain an ann model to predict 3 pg model parameters once the efficiency of the artificial neural networks for this purpose has been proven the parameterization and calibration processes of the 3 pg model will be simplified and its use will become more comprehensive and practical since the manual calibration requires greater knowledge about the parameters behavior and must be careful not to compromise the model biological realism predict the parameters based on environment and forest characteristics is also a way to reduce the sampling effort to parameterize 3 pg anns training analysis showed that the parameters predictions of the allometric relationship with the mean dbh as and ns and the maximum fraction of biomass allocated to roots ηrx showed greater accuracy for the other parameters ηrn and tc there is a need for more scientific investigation including information and input variables such as soil characteristics the database structure does not affect the network training process inaccurate results were due to the lack of explanatory variables the differences observed are associated with the database size in each case and how the information was related ann validation using simulated data proved the efficiency of the networks selected in the second approach the ann models developed in this study can be applied to calibrate 3 pg model for eucalypt in the

24219,the pullout resistance is significant to protect slopes from tensive rainfall and strong wind explaining the pullout behavior of a root system is challenging because the root mechanical and architectural characteristics are difficult to characterize this study proposes a new simplified analytical model of the pullout behavior with displacement the root system is divided into several topological levels along depth and then the parameter of the root diameter and root number distribution at each topological level is summarized respectively according to the test result mechanical characteristics are expressed as functions of the root diameter the pullout force of the whole system is the sum of the force of every root segment then the expression is verified by the result of field test and its parameters are summarized the influence of these parameters on pullout behavior is discussed the model is also compared with other models 1 a detailed analysis of the root architecture 2 considering the root angle 3 allowing the pullout force to deviate from roots however 1 the model needs more parameters 2 the model can be improved by more consideration of the interaction between roots and soil the model can be used in stability analysis which should be researched keywords pullout behavior root system analytical model data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction it is well known that roots can stabilize steep slopes and retard soil erosion process by virtue of their tensile strength and extensive subsurface range gray and leiser 1982 stokes et al 2008 quantifying the root property is important which contributes to evaluate the root reinforcement numerous methods have been proposed to simplify the estimation of stabilization an apparent cohesion term was imported based on the mohr coulomb criterion waldron 1977 wu 1976 1 τ c σ c r 2 c r k t r where τ is the shear stress c is the effective soil cohesion σ is the effective normal stress and c r is the apparent cohesion caused by roots traversing the failure surface c r is calculated by the product of the coefficient k and the root tensile strength t r it means that root strength is critical to the shear strength of the root soil note that c r cannot be granted as true cohesion for the anisotropy of roots mitchell 2005 the approach is easy to implement and hence it has been used for decades riestenberg and sovonick dunford 1983 zhou et al 1998 fan and su 2008 mickovski et al 2009 camporeale et al 2013 bogaard and greco 2016 however its failure criterion may not be suitable for the constitutive model of the root soil a site shear test was implemented to prove it whose results showed that the shear stress peaked twice fannin et al 2005 it means that adding the root strength to the soil shear strength may overestimate the strength of root soil for the assumption that the whole root breaks simultaneously considering the root break process fiber bundle model fbm was introduced in the calculation of the root strength which is called riproot model daniels 1945 pollen and simon 2005 in the model stress redistributes in the type of global load sharing which removes the assumption of the simultaneous root break in wu s model hidalgo et al 2001 it shows much fitter for the shear test result of the root soil so it is widely used in stability analysis pollen et al 2004 pollen 2007 mickovski et al 2009 loades et al 2010 however the model is requested that 1 the elastic property of roots is the same 2 the root bundle direction is parallel to each other and the direction of the load the root break is defined in advance quantifying the diversity of mechanical behavior of roots root bundle model rbm was proposed schwarz et al 2010a rbm a strain controlled model is used to estimate the pullout force of the root bundle the pullout force is controlled by the interaction of root and soil which can be used in stability analysis of the root soil arnone et al 2016 it is related to the root soil interfacial friction which has 2 forms during the stretch phase of roots 1 the static friction during the stretching phase 2 the dynamic friction during the slip out phase in the model the root size spatial distribution topological factors mechanical characteristics and their relationship are considered to fit the actual root break rbmw was proposed to estimate the pullout force of a root diameter class which allows unbroken roots schwarz et al 2013 a weibull survival distribution is used to calculate the probability of root break the parameters of mechanical characteristics and the weibull distribution are acquired by the result of field pullout tests or laboratory tensile tests the pullout force of all roots is calculated from the sum of the component pullout force of different root diameter classes however it is challenging to ascertain the root soil interfacial friction and the model is more adaptable to parallel roots to simplify rbm the analytical fiber bundle model afbm was proposed cohen et al 2011 the convenience of afbm is regardless of the friction of roots and soil and mechanical characteristics are related to root diameters clearing the root diameter distribution becomes important and the uniform weibull and lognormal functions are used hence the shape of pullout force diameter curves is similar to these functions it is more convenient to estimate the pullout force however the deviation of pullout force and the root angle are not contemplated in the model the architecture of a single root is too simplified according to these recommended models the analyzation of the root reinforcement counted on root pullout characteristics the laboratory or field experiment was used to illustrate the characteristic of a single root or regularly shaped root bundles but root systems in soil are disordered giadrossich et al 2017 it may be impossible to comprehend all properties of the root system then the relation between root mechanical characteristics and root system architecture were summarized by formulas according to experimental results hence the root system architecture was paid more attention root system architecture is wide deep and irregular in soil it followed simple mathematical rules lutz et al 1937 cochrane and ford 1978 deans and ford 1983 it was simulated by fitted functions based on the root geometry root topological level curve the level division was relied on root growth patterns along depth branch features and so on henderson et al 1983b danjon and reubens 2008 at each topological level the root length distribution was fitted by uniform gamma and exponential distribution functions the root angle distribution was fitted by uniform distribution functions the root number distribution was fitted by poisson and negative binomial distribution functions henderson et al 1983b arnone et al 2016 the indexes of the root system architecture were estimated reciprocally for instance the root length and the root number were related to the root diameter according to measurement results giadrossich et al 2013 schwarz et al 2010a b according to the research of the root system architecture quantifying the root system architecture mainly relied on the relation between root system properties and the root topological level the root topological level was divided by different ways choosing a suitable probability density function contributed to the accurate quantification of root system the aim of this work was to propose an analytical root system model arsm for estimating the pullout force of the root system the model mainly includes 4 aspects 1 quantifying the root system architecture mainly the root number the root diameter and the root angle 2 quantifying the root mechanics 3 illustrating the relationship between the root mechanics and the root system architecture 4 establishing a pullout force analytical model based on the relationship then the model was evaluated by field pullout test results and compared with other models although the model focuses on the pullout force it could have wider engineering applications such as estimating the shear strength of root composites and stability analysis curtin et al 1998 yan et al 2015 wang et al 2019 for instance the pullout behavior was related to the shear stress for estimating the contribution of roots to slope stability lin et al 2010 giadrossich et al 2019 2 model description the pullout force of the root system can be calculated by the friction between roots and soil which can be divided according to the stretching phase and the slip out phase schwarz et al 2010a in afbm the slip out of roots is substituted by the root break afbm gives the complete pullout force displacement curve of roots it allows every single root of the root system have different failure mechanisms which means that some roots of the system may not break at the same displacement the root break is a progressive process cohen et al 2011 arsm a simplified method is used to estimate the pullout force of a root system which equals the sum of the pullout force of every root segment the root system is anchored in the ground at the tip of the root segment at the upper level of the rootless level and pulled along the axis of the root system by controlling displacement fig 1 it breaks instead of slipping out according to the research of wu 1979 abe and ziemer 1991 and schmidt 2001 when it is pulled every root segment 1 shares the same displacement along the axis of the root system 2 is parallel to the axis itself and 3 its diameter remains constant once a root segment is broken the segment cannot support load or hold a residual load and the force redistribution is ignored there are no interactions between neighboring segments the break of each root segment at some critical displacement depends on the architectural and mechanical properties itself every root segment is assumed straight and elastic brittle fibers and sharing the same diameter along its length the root angle and the root number distribution are considered in arsm 2 1 root system architecture arsm requires to quantify the root system architecture it is well known that the root system architecture is consisted of the root depth the root number the root diameter and so on the change of root number and the root diameter along depth was represented by their own relationship with the topological level arnone et al 2016 also the method is still used in arsm fig 1 shows the root system architecture it is assumed that more than two segments can emerge from every vertex z m is the maximum root depth the spacing of each topological level h is assumed equal the first topological level situates the soil layer at a depth h from the soil surface the link diameter between two adjacent vertexes denoted as ϕ is constant which varies with the topological level i i 1 2 topological length topological length equals z m h the angle θ between the link and the axis of the root system uniformly distributes between 0 and π 2 radians henderson et al 1983b so the segment length equals h cos θ φ varies with i and it has two extremes the minimum diameter ϕ i min and the maximum diameter ϕ i max the probability density function of ϕ is assumed as a weibull distribution function 3 p ϕ i ϕ m ϕ i k ϕ i m ϕ i k ϕ i ϕ k ϕ i m ϕ i 1 exp ϕ k ϕ i m ϕ i where m ϕ i and k ϕ i are the shape factor and the scale factor respectively at the ith topological level the root number change is related to i their relationship is reflected by a weibull distribution function 4 p n i i m n k n m n k n i k n m n 1 exp i k n m n where i is the independent variable m n and k n are the parameters of the distribution m n and k n are acquired by the fitted root number i curve the weibull distribution function is a continuous probability density function here it is chosen for the continuity of root number along the root depth and the simplification of arsm also the root number at each topological level can still be estimated based on the weibull distribution function once known the total number of segments n t o t in the root system n i can be estimated by 5 n i n t o t p n i i m n k n although the root system architecture is time varying the model here is assumed to be constant it means that the pullout force calculation based on the model is instant the model of the root system architecture can also be used in root growth prediction seepage and stability analysis of vegetative slopes 2 2 root mechanics the pullout force calculation needs mechanical characteristics of a root in arsm the root tensile strength and the root elastic modulus should be obtained note that the friction factor is difficult to measure and estimate schwarz et al 2010a arsm intentionally substitutes the slip out by the root break each root is assumed a linear elastic fiber that breaks at a threshold displacement because there was little irreversible deformation according to cyclic laboratory pullout tests czarnes et al 1999 studies on roots stated that the threshold tensile strength t and the elastic modulus e can be related to the diameter ϕ waldron and dakessian 1981 schwarz et al 2010a 2013 cohen et al 2011 arnone et al 2016 power law functions are used to reflect their relationship 6 t t 0 ϕ ϕ 0 α 7 e e 0 ϕ ϕ 0 β where t 0 and e 0 are characteristic tensile strength and elastic modulus respectively ϕ 0 is a reference diameter and α and β are power law exponents note that the elastic modulus here combines the effects of the root elasticity and the root tortuosity the negative sign of the exponents results from the experimental data it shows that the tensile strength and the elastic modulus often decrease with increasing root diameter mehtab et al 2020 boldrin et al 2021 eq 6 can be replaced by the relationship of the threshold tensile force and the root diameter 8 f f 0 ϕ ϕ 0 λ where f is the threshold tensile force that breaks the root λ 2 α and f 0 π ϕ 0 2 t 0 4 with eq 8 the equations of the root diameter and elastic modulus can be rewritten whose fundamental variable is the tensile force 9 ϕ ϕ 0 f f 0 1 λ 10 e e 0 f f 0 β λ mechanical characteristics often change with roots in arsm it is assumed that the threshold tensile strength and the elastic modulus do not change instantly during the pullout process the variable f f 0 of these equations is normalized which contributes to calculate the pullout force with analytical model 2 3 pullout force of a root segment the pullout force of a root segment is calculated according to the architectural and mechanical characteristics hence it is considered equal to the tensile force the displacement of a root segment can be reflected by the displacement of the root system schwarz et al 2010a the pullout force of a root segment p at the displacement x n along the root segment axis is given by 11a p e x n π ϕ 2 4 h cos θ π ϕ 2 cos θ 4 h e x n x n x c 11b p 0 x n x c where π ϕ 2 4 is the cross sectional area of a root segment x c is the threshold displacement where the root breaks and h cos θ is the length of a segment mentioned in section 2 1 substituting eq 9 and eq 10 into eq 11a yields 12 p c 0 f κ x n cos θ h where 13 c 0 π 4 e 0 ϕ 0 2 f 0 κ and 14 κ 2 β λ c 0 has units of m 1 κ l 1 κ t 2 κ 1 where m l and t are mass length and time respectively combining the effect of the root system architecture a normalized form of eq 12 is needed 15 p f 0 e 0 t 0 f f 0 κ x n cos θ h the displacement of a segment at failure x n f is obtained under when p equals f of eq 12 16 x n f f 1 κ h c 0 cos θ it is apparent that x n f is mainly controlled by κ it shows that 1 when κ 0 the weaker root holds more force but breaks first 2 when κ 0 both roots hold equal force and the weaker breaks first 3 when 0 κ 1 the weaker holds less force and breaks first 4 when κ 1 the weaker holds less force but both break at the same displacement 5 when κ 1 the weaker hold more force but breaks first the influence of κ on pullout force displacement curve is similar to cohen s research cohen et al 2011 in the pullout force calculation of a root segment θ and x n are often difficult to determine by traditional measurement or calculation methods thus arsm uses the expectation of the segment angle and the displacement of a root bundle to substitute θ and x n of each segment respectively 2 4 pullout force at a topological level the pullout force calculation at a topological level is based on the calculation of a root segment in arsm the root segment at a topological level shares identical displacement along the axis of the root system the force redistribution is ignored because surviving roots may have different displacement from the broken the difference of displacement cannot be tested during a pullout process when a displacement along the axis x i is imposed see fig 1 the pullout force at a topological level p i x can be obtained by integration of pullout force of segments at that level 17 p i x n 1 n i c 0 f κ x n cos θ n h cos θ n where x n cos θ n h cos θ n is the displacement component of a root segment along the axis of the root system in arsm x n is assumed to equal x i cos θ n for simplifying the displacement acquisition hence eq 17 equals 18 p i x n 1 n i c 0 f k x i h cos θ n n i c 0 f i min f i max f κ p f i f d f x i h cos θ n where θ n uniformly distributes between 0 and π 2 radians henderson et al 1983b note that f and θ n are independent and the expectation of cos θ n is 0 π 2 cos θ n p θ θ 2 π the pullout force at the ith topological level is 19 p i x 2 π n i c 0 x i h f i min f i max f κ p f i f d f 2 π n t o t p n i i m n k n c 0 x i h f i min f i max f κ p f i f d f p f i f is the probability density function of the pullout force which can be obtained from eq 3 and eq 8 the formula of p f i f is 20 p f i f m f i k f i m f i k f i f k f i m f i 1 exp f k f i m f i where 21 m f i m ϕ i λ and 22 k f i f 0 k ϕ i ϕ 0 λ the probability density distribution function of f is still a weibull distribution function under the transformation because f monotonically changes with ϕ however the parameters of the function should be modified f i max and f i min is the upper and lower limits of the force respectively which is related to eq 16 if κ 1 x h c 0 and all root segments break at once at the same displacement the root segment with low threshold force breaks first when κ 1 and it is opposite when κ 1 table 1 shows the limits of f therefore the force at the ith level can be expressed by an incomplete gamma function 23 p i x 2 π n t o t m n k n i k n m n 1 exp i k n m n c 0 x i h k f i κ γ κ m f i 1 c 0 x m f i 1 κ h m f i 1 κ k f i m f i it is not certain that the segment with the maximum displacement breaks first for the difference of architectural and mechanical characteristics of roots also it is still tough to determine the displacement at each topological level the move at every topological level is not visible and the difference of displacement at two adjacent level is cumbersome to define therefore it is assumed that the displacement at each level along the axis of the whole root system is equal in arsm 2 5 pullout force of the whole root system the pullout force calculation of a whole root system is related to the force calculation at each topological level in arsm the pullout force of the whole root system is assumed the sum of the force at each level 24 p x i 1 t o p o log i c a l length 2 π n i c 0 x i h f i min f i max f κ p f i f d f i 1 t o p o log i c a l length 2 π n t o t m n k n i k n m n 1 exp i k n m n c 0 x h k f i κ γ κ m f i 1 c 0 x m f i 1 κ h m f i 1 κ k f i m f i where x is the displacement of the whole root system and x i i 1 2 topological length equals x the topological length equals z m h in arsm root segments are requested not to deviate from their own axes during the pullout process because the deviation implies the architectural and mechanical change of the root system the pullout force calculation are related to the root diameter distribution and the parameters f 0 e 0 ϕ 0 and λ the friction of roots and soil is mainly manifested in displacement it is apparent that arsm is more proper to plants with numerous roots or matured plants 3 model evaluation as mentioned above understanding the root system architecture and the mechanical characteristics is important in the study parameters of the arsm were summarized the pullout force calculated by arsm was compared with the experimental results 3 1 root system architecture root geometry is often measured at site such as the root depth root number and root length danjon et al 2005 tardío et al 2016 about the actual root system architecture the root geometry should be related to the root topology the root topology of a longleaf pine in florida was drawn by observation and the size of the taproot supplementary taproots and lateral roots were measured heyward 1933 the model of the pine root system was drawn based on the mathematical functions of the branching density dupuy et al 2005 a 16 year old root system was divided into 6 orders the division rule was that roots around the main stem was in the first order the branches of the first order roots were in the second order and so on the number the length of roots the number of branch point and root angle in each order were measured and then their distribution was summarized by the applied statistical formulas related to their own orders henderson et al 1983a b the root system was assumed a binary tree whose links were divided into exterior links and interior links the amount of links and the geometry of every link were measured oppelt et al 2001 the root area ratio rar increased quickly and then slowly with the increased root number coutts 1983 the relationship between the root number and the root diameter was summarized and it changes with plants waldron and dakessian 1981 schwarz et al 2010b vergani et al 2016 the root number increased and then decreased with depth and the root depth was less than 150 cm danjon et al 2006 2008 arnone et al 2016 also the root number of different diameter classes at the same depth was documented vergani et al 2016 the weibull distribution function was used to estimate the root diameter and root number change of spruce the parameters of the function used in quantifying the root diameter were 3 38 and 2 15 respectively cohen et al 2011 arnone et al 2016 in the subsection parameters of the root diameter and the root number at the ith level m ϕ i and k ϕ i were acquired by the experimental results the root diameter and the root number at each 10 cm depth of alder maple and ironwood were recorded abdi and deljouei 2019 here the influence of the position was ignored at the same depth the root number in the downhill was added up with the number of the same diameter class in the uphill the total root number of a diameter class was regarded as the root number of the average value of the diameter class the root diameter greater than 10 mm was assumed 11 5 mm here is an example in the top 10 m depth the root number of the diameter ranging from2 to 5 mm is 5 in the downhill it is also 5 in the uphill according to abdi s research 2019 hence the root number with a root diameter of 3 5 mm is 10 in the top 10 m depth then the parameters of weibull probability functions were acquired by the fitted curves of calculated results fig 2 and table 2 it shows that m ϕ i and k ϕ i are more adaptable to determine the probability trends the probability of the root diameter less than 6 mm is estimated more accurate note that the specific size of the root diameter above 10 mm is unclear based on that research the integral region of actual probability distribution is different from the region of weibull distribution function the greater the variable is the bigger the difference between calculated and actual probability is the probability of the root number at each depth was estimated by the ratio of root number at each depth to the whole root number and the parameters of its distribution n t o t m n and k n was achieved by the fitting curve of the probability topological level arnone et al 2016 fig 3 and table 3 give the fitting curves and the parameters note that the root number in the downhill and in the uphill were added up at the same depth it is obvious that the weibull distribution probability function is proper in estimation of root number the root number of these plants at the 1st topological level is the largest the probability distribution function is suitable in simulation of the root architectural characteristics the root mechanical characteristics are also required in the calculation of the pullout force 3 2 root mechanics tensile tests are often used to measure the tensile strength and the elastic modulus the tensile strength is achieved by the ratio of the tensile force and the area at break and the elastic modulus is attained by the ratio of the tensile stress and tensile strain in the elastic deformation stage the estimation of tensile strength and the elastic modulus is often related to the root diameter the tensile strength and the elastic modulus often decrease with the increased diameter their relationship was interpreted by negative power equations and power law functions waldron and dakessian 1981 schmidt et al 2001 cazzuffi 2005 fan and su 2008 schwarz et al 2010a abdi et al 2010 osano 2012 abdi and deljouei 2019 the mechanical characteristics are varied with plants and their parameters were summarized cohen et al 2011 the tensile strength the elastic modulus and the tensile strain were estimated by one dimensional linear equation of the reciprocal diameter or topological level tosi 2007 mao et al 2018 in the subsection the mechanical characteristics of roots were estimated by power law functions of root diameter then t 0 α e 0 and β were ascertained then f 0 and λ were calculated by these parameters table 4 gives t 0 α e 0 and β of different plants environmental and test conditions impact the mechanical characteristics in abdi s research the position of root samples is different it is in the road edge zone and on a slope respectively abdi 2018 abdi and deljouei 2019 in zydroń s research 2018 roots of alder were submerged in water before the tensile test and hence the parameters of alder are different the tensile strength of alder maple and ironwood in the summer and winter was tested α was similar no matter how the weather was so was t 0 of alder and maple however t 0 of ironwood changes a lot based on the previous mechanical analyzation of plants most trees shared the same e 0 and β schwarz et al 2010a cohen et al 2011 arnone et al 2016 here the mechanical parameters of alder maple and ironwood provided by abdi and deljouei 2019 were used in the calculation of the pullout force based on these parameters λ and f 0 table 5 were calculated by eq 8 the basic parameters of root architectural and mechanical characteristics are given with them the pullout force of different plants can be calculated by eq 24 3 3 pullout force calculation about the pullout force of a single root it is related to the root diameter the dry weight and the position of plants xu et al 2014 the relation between the force and the root diameter was summarized by a linear equation norris 2005 zhang et al 2012 their relationship was also fitted by the power law function yamase et al 2015 the force often increases with increased displacement and then decreases but the shape of force displacement curve often changes with plants for instance the pullout force displacement curve of a long root a forked or branched root and a multibranched root is different norris 2005 for root systems the pullout process of the root system can be divided into 4 stages 1 the elastic stage 2 the dynamic friction stage 3 the residual strength stage 4 the resting stage at the elastic stage the force increases linearly with displacement to a maximum value at the dynamic friction stage the pullout force displacement curve displays a rapid descent at the residual stage the curve gently declines at the resting stage the pullout force is close to 0 sun et al 2011 yang et al 2017 fig 4 gives the result of field pullout tests there are great differences among these pullout force displacement curves because plants were grown in different environment and pulled out under different test conditions the pullout force displacement curve all has the elastic stage and the dynamic friction stage but the residual stage and the resting stage are not behaved completely there are 2 reasons 1 the root depth may be shallow 2 the broken root system offering resistance may have been pulled out and the remaining roots in the soil cannot be pulled out the curve of reevesia thyrsoidea r thyrsoidea is smoother than the others the force of r thyrsoidea reaches 0 kn at 28 cm displacement the displacement corresponding to the maximum pullout force of hibiscus taiwanensis h taiwanensis macaranga tanarius m tanarius and mallotus paniculatus m paniculatus is less than 5 cm the maximum pullout force of m tanarius and m paniculatus is about 2 times and 4 times the h taiwanensis s respectively the curve of schefflera heptaphulla s heptaphulla contains a rapid decline and the most fluctuation sections at the displacement over 23 cm the curve fluctuates again for the mobilization of root branches it means that the root branch is still capable of carrying the pullout load according to eq 24 m f i k f i c 0 and κ are required to estimate the pullout force of alder maple and ironwood c 0 and κ are given in table 5 and the other parameters are shown in table 2 note that ϕ 0 1 mm here to simplify the diversity in the calculation of c 0 fig 4 also gives the calculation result of alder maple and ironwood they were verified by results of field pullout tests the shape of these pullout force displacement curves is similar to the test result the calculation result gives the intact stage of pullout process as mentioned especially the result of ironwood it displays an obvious residual stage however fluctuation sections cannot be shown mainly due to the shape of gamma function a big difference of the width is shown on the calculated and actual curve there are 2 reasons 1 mechanical characteristics vary with plants 2 the root system architecture of alder maple and ironwood were measured in trenches which are 0 5 m from the center of the root system the 2nd reason means that the root number and the root diameter 0 5 m away from the root center were not recorded in abdi s research 2019 it affects the parameters of root system architecture according to cohen s research 2011 the shape factor m ϕ i mainly controls the width of the curve and hence the curve calculated is narrow for all plants the curve in winter is higher and wider than in summer for the temperature change it shows that weather has less significant effect on the maple the curve of maple in summer and in winter is close to the curve of r thyrsoidea and m paniculatus respectively as for the maximum pullout force alder is followed by ironwood then maple in winter alder is smaller than maple and followed by ironwood in summer in winter the maximum force of alder and ironwood is close to 3 7 kn which is approximately 0 9 kn larger than the force of maple the maximum force of alder and ironwood is approximately 2 times as large in winter as in summer and the maximum force of maple is close no matter the weather is the displacement corresponding to the maximum force is close to 2 cm except alder and ironwood in summer for alder and ironwood in summer it is about 1 cm as for the width the curve of ironwood is wider than maple then alder the curve of alder is 1 cm wider in winter than in summer furthermore arsm still needs to be verified by field pullout test in the future in this calculation vegetation pulled out is different from vegetation whose mechanical and architectural parameters were obtained from experimental results arsm can be verified more accurately in the situation that these parameters and pullout test results belong to the same vegetation also environment and time of root mechanical and architectural test and field pullout test is almost the same 4 discussion arsm describes the pullout behavior of the root system arsm mainly depends on 9 independent parameters see eq 24 practical applications mainly require knowledge of 11 quantities from which the 9 independent parameters are estimated 1 two topological level parameters i h 2 three root number parameters varied with topological level n t o t m n k n 3 two root property exponents α β or λ β 4 two characteristic quantities t 0 e 0 or f 0 e 0 5 two force or diameter root distribution parameters at different topological level m f i k f i note that the probability density functions used in arsm are two parameter distributions which are sufficient to describe the properties of root diameter or force and root number at different topological levels according to fig 2 and fig 3 in the section the effect of these parameters on pullout behavior was discussed so was the relationship between the model and other models 4 1 effects of topological level parameters arsm is mainly applied to describe the pullout behavior of plants at a specific time and position the depth of the root system h is unchangeable but the topological level i is opposite the root diameter often changes with h and i and the range of the root diameter at each topological level is different the diameter of a root segment is assumed constant at each topological level in arsm if i increases the quantity of the root architectural experiment data needed in the root diameter and root number estimation becomes more it complicates the calculation process however the pullout behavior may not change with the increased parameter quantity a reasonable division of a root system is important which improves the calculation efficiency 4 2 effects of root number parameters with eq 24 it is obvious that the pullout force increases proportionally with increased n t o t under a definite topological division for illustrating the influence of m n and k n the other parameters of eq 24 refer to those of maple in winter which are shown in table 2 and table 5 fig 5 gives the calculated pullout force displacement curve no matter how m n and k n change the curve shape resembles and the width is unchangeable the peak increases with increased m n but its correlative displacement slightly decreases m n has a greater impact on the maximum pullout force than k n the maximum pullout force increases with increased k n and then decreases but its correlative displacement is opposite the peak force at k n 0 8 is similar to k n 5 much bigger than k n 0 5 it demonstrates that when m n and k n increase steadily the change of the peak force shows a noticeable and then gentle trend 4 3 effects of root property exponents in afbm κ is controlled by root length and root mechanical characteristics cohen et al 2011 in arsm κ is only governed by root mechanical characteristics κ 2 β λ 2 β 2 α the root length is calculated by the root depth table 4 shows that α is less than 2 here the influence of κ κ 0 on the pullout force was discussed fig 6 the parameters except κ in eq 24 adopt the parameters of maple in winter see table 2 table 3 and table 5 the width of the curve shrinks with increased κ for κ 1 the maximum pullout force increases with increased κ according to eq 8 eq 13 and eq 16 smaller roots hold more force and break first while larger roots remain intact and hold more force at a larger displacement for κ 1 it is opposite the rapid descent of the curve is caused by the earlier larger root break for κ 1 the curve displays a cusp and it is the maximum force roots broke simultaneously where the displacement passes 3 39 cm which can be related to the models of wu et al 1979 the influence of κ is similar to cohen s research 2011 4 4 effects of characteristic quantities in arsm κ affects c 0 for 0 κ 1 and κ 1 c 0 decreases with increased κ for κ 1 c 0 π e 0 ϕ 0 2 4 f 0 e 0 t 0 ϕ 0 1 mm table 5 shows that c 0 is often more than 1 except ironwood in summer also two characteristic quantities e 0 t 0 or e 0 f 0 affect c 0 together fig 7 shows the influence of c 0 on pullout force the parameters except c 0 in eq 24 adopt the parameters of maple in winter see table 2 table 3 and table 5 the maximum force is not affected by c 0 but the width of the curve shrinks dramatically with increased c 0 it is clear that the influence of c 0 on the limits of eq 24 is more significant note that when c 0 1 the dramatical raise of the curve happens at the displacement past 5 cm it means that when c 0 1 the curve is mainly controlled by the exponents of displacement which are the factors of force distribution functions m f i and k f i 4 5 effects of root diameter or force distribution parameters the effect of m ϕ and k ϕ was analyzed in the afbm as for m ϕ the maximum pullout force increases with increased m ϕ but its correlative displacement decreases the width of pullout force displacement curve becomes narrow as for k ϕ the maximum force and its correlative displacement increased with increased k ϕ when κ 1 but the displacement decreased when κ 1 cohen et al 2011 in arsm the parameters of root diameter or force are estimated by the root diameter distribution at each topological level these parameters all impact the pullout behavior so it is difficult to analyze the comprehensive effect of all parameters the parameters depend on the situation of vegetation when the pullout force is loaded instantly also the division plan of the vegetation topology 4 6 comparison with other models and future work in wu s model the displacement corresponding to the maximum tensile force of roots is different and all roots break simultaneously hence the root reinforcement is overestimated wu 1976 waldron 1977 in arsm the root mechanical characteristics are related to the root architecture and the root break process are illustrated by the strain controlled calculation in fbm roots break progressively however the elastic property of every root is requested identical and the criterion of root break is mutative the break criterion usually depends on the root diameter root number and so on it cannot be tested easily daniels 1945 pollen et al 2005 in arsm the mechanical characteristics change with the root architecture the criterion is the displacement of the root system which can be tested easily rbm and afbm are strain controlled models and used to calculate the pullout force of lateral parallel root bundles the pullout force is required to be parallel to lateral roots and the root diameter is the same along the root length note that pullout force was used in stability analysis arnone et al 2016 the resistance offered by roots is not just lateral roots in rbm the friction and the branch distance are needed to be tested schwarz et al 2010a cohen et al 2011 in afbm the dynamic friction caused by the slip out of roots are substituted by the root break but the root length is needed to measure in arsm the root system architecture is divided in detail the root angle is considered the root length is calculated by the ratio of the root depth and the root angle it means that the root diameter can change along the realistic root length the direction of the pullout force and the axis of roots are not requested identical however there are 3 main shortcomings 1 more parameters are needed than other models 2 the pullout force of root segments completely perpendicular to the axis of the root system cannot be considered 3 the pullout force of root segments too curved even growing upward cannot be considered for simplifying the calculation work the root mechanical characteristics is related to the root architectural characteristics the root topological division need to be careful the pullout force is calculated by the interaction between roots and soil the root architectural and mechanical characteristics combined with the interaction can improve the model the characteristics change with time and space so time lags often influence the pullout behavior convergence cross mapping optimal information flow and pcmci can reflect the influence as well as the impact of the plant environment li and convertino 2021 runge et al 2019 also 3d printing 3dp becomes useful in the root architectural research which is helpful to divide topological levels and learn the relationship of different parameters among different topological levels 3dp and mechanical tests of the same plant contributes to reveal the details of pullout behavior then global sensitive analysis can be used to improve arsm pianosi et al 2016 5 conclusions this work presented a new simplified methodology arsm for estimating the pullout force of a root system in arsm the root system shares an identical displacement along the axis and fails progressively in the pullout process the model divides the root system into several topological levels according to its depth the model explicitly considers the properties of root system architecture the root number the root diameter and the root angle the root diameter and the root number at each topological level is calculated by probability density functions weibull the angle of every root segment is represented by the expectation of root angle the root mechanical characteristics the threshold tensile force f and the elastic modulus e are calculated by 2 power functions of the root diameter the pullout force is estimated by the sum of the pullout force at each topological level and the pullout force at each topological level is the sum of the pullout force of every root segment in the level the parameters of alder maple and ironwood in summer and in winter were summarized 1 two topological level parameters i h 2 three parameters of root number that vary with topological levels n t o t m n k n 3 two root property exponents α β or λ β 4 two characteristic quantities t 0 e 0 or f 0 e 0 5 root force or diameter probability distribution parameters at different topological levels m f i k f i the pullout force behavior of alder maple and ironwood was analyzed based on arsm which was also compared with results of field pullout test it proved that arsm can explain the pullout behavior however arsm still needs to be verified in the future the influence of these parameters on the pullout force displacement curve was discussed the division of root system along depth is important the increased n t o t and m n results in the increased maximum pullout force but the influence of the increased k n k n 1 is opposite κ composed of α and β influences the width of the curve the maximum pullout force and its correlative displacement c 0 composed of t 0 and e 0 just impacts the width the influence of the probability distribution parameters of root diameter at each topological level is incomprehensible arsm was compared with other models it is a strain controlled model considering the friction between the soil and the root into the displacement it analyses the root system architecture in detail and allows the force to deviate from the root axis it contemplates the continuous break process the root angle and the relationship of the root architectural and mechanical characteristics however arsm needs more parameters at the moment that the pullout force loads because the root growth varies with time and environment in the future 3dp is needed in root architectural research for the root topological division the relation of different parameters among different topological levels needs to be summarized the regulation of mechanical and architectural characteristics varying with time and space should be surveyed the pullout force calculation can be used in stability analysis so how arsm is used should be researched credit authorship contribution

24219,the pullout resistance is significant to protect slopes from tensive rainfall and strong wind explaining the pullout behavior of a root system is challenging because the root mechanical and architectural characteristics are difficult to characterize this study proposes a new simplified analytical model of the pullout behavior with displacement the root system is divided into several topological levels along depth and then the parameter of the root diameter and root number distribution at each topological level is summarized respectively according to the test result mechanical characteristics are expressed as functions of the root diameter the pullout force of the whole system is the sum of the force of every root segment then the expression is verified by the result of field test and its parameters are summarized the influence of these parameters on pullout behavior is discussed the model is also compared with other models 1 a detailed analysis of the root architecture 2 considering the root angle 3 allowing the pullout force to deviate from roots however 1 the model needs more parameters 2 the model can be improved by more consideration of the interaction between roots and soil the model can be used in stability analysis which should be researched keywords pullout behavior root system analytical model data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction it is well known that roots can stabilize steep slopes and retard soil erosion process by virtue of their tensile strength and extensive subsurface range gray and leiser 1982 stokes et al 2008 quantifying the root property is important which contributes to evaluate the root reinforcement numerous methods have been proposed to simplify the estimation of stabilization an apparent cohesion term was imported based on the mohr coulomb criterion waldron 1977 wu 1976 1 τ c σ c r 2 c r k t r where τ is the shear stress c is the effective soil cohesion σ is the effective normal stress and c r is the apparent cohesion caused by roots traversing the failure surface c r is calculated by the product of the coefficient k and the root tensile strength t r it means that root strength is critical to the shear strength of the root soil note that c r cannot be granted as true cohesion for the anisotropy of roots mitchell 2005 the approach is easy to implement and hence it has been used for decades riestenberg and sovonick dunford 1983 zhou et al 1998 fan and su 2008 mickovski et al 2009 camporeale et al 2013 bogaard and greco 2016 however its failure criterion may not be suitable for the constitutive model of the root soil a site shear test was implemented to prove it whose results showed that the shear stress peaked twice fannin et al 2005 it means that adding the root strength to the soil shear strength may overestimate the strength of root soil for the assumption that the whole root breaks simultaneously considering the root break process fiber bundle model fbm was introduced in the calculation of the root strength which is called riproot model daniels 1945 pollen and simon 2005 in the model stress redistributes in the type of global load sharing which removes the assumption of the simultaneous root break in wu s model hidalgo et al 2001 it shows much fitter for the shear test result of the root soil so it is widely used in stability analysis pollen et al 2004 pollen 2007 mickovski et al 2009 loades et al 2010 however the model is requested that 1 the elastic property of roots is the same 2 the root bundle direction is parallel to each other and the direction of the load the root break is defined in advance quantifying the diversity of mechanical behavior of roots root bundle model rbm was proposed schwarz et al 2010a rbm a strain controlled model is used to estimate the pullout force of the root bundle the pullout force is controlled by the interaction of root and soil which can be used in stability analysis of the root soil arnone et al 2016 it is related to the root soil interfacial friction which has 2 forms during the stretch phase of roots 1 the static friction during the stretching phase 2 the dynamic friction during the slip out phase in the model the root size spatial distribution topological factors mechanical characteristics and their relationship are considered to fit the actual root break rbmw was proposed to estimate the pullout force of a root diameter class which allows unbroken roots schwarz et al 2013 a weibull survival distribution is used to calculate the probability of root break the parameters of mechanical characteristics and the weibull distribution are acquired by the result of field pullout tests or laboratory tensile tests the pullout force of all roots is calculated from the sum of the component pullout force of different root diameter classes however it is challenging to ascertain the root soil interfacial friction and the model is more adaptable to parallel roots to simplify rbm the analytical fiber bundle model afbm was proposed cohen et al 2011 the convenience of afbm is regardless of the friction of roots and soil and mechanical characteristics are related to root diameters clearing the root diameter distribution becomes important and the uniform weibull and lognormal functions are used hence the shape of pullout force diameter curves is similar to these functions it is more convenient to estimate the pullout force however the deviation of pullout force and the root angle are not contemplated in the model the architecture of a single root is too simplified according to these recommended models the analyzation of the root reinforcement counted on root pullout characteristics the laboratory or field experiment was used to illustrate the characteristic of a single root or regularly shaped root bundles but root systems in soil are disordered giadrossich et al 2017 it may be impossible to comprehend all properties of the root system then the relation between root mechanical characteristics and root system architecture were summarized by formulas according to experimental results hence the root system architecture was paid more attention root system architecture is wide deep and irregular in soil it followed simple mathematical rules lutz et al 1937 cochrane and ford 1978 deans and ford 1983 it was simulated by fitted functions based on the root geometry root topological level curve the level division was relied on root growth patterns along depth branch features and so on henderson et al 1983b danjon and reubens 2008 at each topological level the root length distribution was fitted by uniform gamma and exponential distribution functions the root angle distribution was fitted by uniform distribution functions the root number distribution was fitted by poisson and negative binomial distribution functions henderson et al 1983b arnone et al 2016 the indexes of the root system architecture were estimated reciprocally for instance the root length and the root number were related to the root diameter according to measurement results giadrossich et al 2013 schwarz et al 2010a b according to the research of the root system architecture quantifying the root system architecture mainly relied on the relation between root system properties and the root topological level the root topological level was divided by different ways choosing a suitable probability density function contributed to the accurate quantification of root system the aim of this work was to propose an analytical root system model arsm for estimating the pullout force of the root system the model mainly includes 4 aspects 1 quantifying the root system architecture mainly the root number the root diameter and the root angle 2 quantifying the root mechanics 3 illustrating the relationship between the root mechanics and the root system architecture 4 establishing a pullout force analytical model based on the relationship then the model was evaluated by field pullout test results and compared with other models although the model focuses on the pullout force it could have wider engineering applications such as estimating the shear strength of root composites and stability analysis curtin et al 1998 yan et al 2015 wang et al 2019 for instance the pullout behavior was related to the shear stress for estimating the contribution of roots to slope stability lin et al 2010 giadrossich et al 2019 2 model description the pullout force of the root system can be calculated by the friction between roots and soil which can be divided according to the stretching phase and the slip out phase schwarz et al 2010a in afbm the slip out of roots is substituted by the root break afbm gives the complete pullout force displacement curve of roots it allows every single root of the root system have different failure mechanisms which means that some roots of the system may not break at the same displacement the root break is a progressive process cohen et al 2011 arsm a simplified method is used to estimate the pullout force of a root system which equals the sum of the pullout force of every root segment the root system is anchored in the ground at the tip of the root segment at the upper level of the rootless level and pulled along the axis of the root system by controlling displacement fig 1 it breaks instead of slipping out according to the research of wu 1979 abe and ziemer 1991 and schmidt 2001 when it is pulled every root segment 1 shares the same displacement along the axis of the root system 2 is parallel to the axis itself and 3 its diameter remains constant once a root segment is broken the segment cannot support load or hold a residual load and the force redistribution is ignored there are no interactions between neighboring segments the break of each root segment at some critical displacement depends on the architectural and mechanical properties itself every root segment is assumed straight and elastic brittle fibers and sharing the same diameter along its length the root angle and the root number distribution are considered in arsm 2 1 root system architecture arsm requires to quantify the root system architecture it is well known that the root system architecture is consisted of the root depth the root number the root diameter and so on the change of root number and the root diameter along depth was represented by their own relationship with the topological level arnone et al 2016 also the method is still used in arsm fig 1 shows the root system architecture it is assumed that more than two segments can emerge from every vertex z m is the maximum root depth the spacing of each topological level h is assumed equal the first topological level situates the soil layer at a depth h from the soil surface the link diameter between two adjacent vertexes denoted as ϕ is constant which varies with the topological level i i 1 2 topological length topological length equals z m h the angle θ between the link and the axis of the root system uniformly distributes between 0 and π 2 radians henderson et al 1983b so the segment length equals h cos θ φ varies with i and it has two extremes the minimum diameter ϕ i min and the maximum diameter ϕ i max the probability density function of ϕ is assumed as a weibull distribution function 3 p ϕ i ϕ m ϕ i k ϕ i m ϕ i k ϕ i ϕ k ϕ i m ϕ i 1 exp ϕ k ϕ i m ϕ i where m ϕ i and k ϕ i are the shape factor and the scale factor respectively at the ith topological level the root number change is related to i their relationship is reflected by a weibull distribution function 4 p n i i m n k n m n k n i k n m n 1 exp i k n m n where i is the independent variable m n and k n are the parameters of the distribution m n and k n are acquired by the fitted root number i curve the weibull distribution function is a continuous probability density function here it is chosen for the continuity of root number along the root depth and the simplification of arsm also the root number at each topological level can still be estimated based on the weibull distribution function once known the total number of segments n t o t in the root system n i can be estimated by 5 n i n t o t p n i i m n k n although the root system architecture is time varying the model here is assumed to be constant it means that the pullout force calculation based on the model is instant the model of the root system architecture can also be used in root growth prediction seepage and stability analysis of vegetative slopes 2 2 root mechanics the pullout force calculation needs mechanical characteristics of a root in arsm the root tensile strength and the root elastic modulus should be obtained note that the friction factor is difficult to measure and estimate schwarz et al 2010a arsm intentionally substitutes the slip out by the root break each root is assumed a linear elastic fiber that breaks at a threshold displacement because there was little irreversible deformation according to cyclic laboratory pullout tests czarnes et al 1999 studies on roots stated that the threshold tensile strength t and the elastic modulus e can be related to the diameter ϕ waldron and dakessian 1981 schwarz et al 2010a 2013 cohen et al 2011 arnone et al 2016 power law functions are used to reflect their relationship 6 t t 0 ϕ ϕ 0 α 7 e e 0 ϕ ϕ 0 β where t 0 and e 0 are characteristic tensile strength and elastic modulus respectively ϕ 0 is a reference diameter and α and β are power law exponents note that the elastic modulus here combines the effects of the root elasticity and the root tortuosity the negative sign of the exponents results from the experimental data it shows that the tensile strength and the elastic modulus often decrease with increasing root diameter mehtab et al 2020 boldrin et al 2021 eq 6 can be replaced by the relationship of the threshold tensile force and the root diameter 8 f f 0 ϕ ϕ 0 λ where f is the threshold tensile force that breaks the root λ 2 α and f 0 π ϕ 0 2 t 0 4 with eq 8 the equations of the root diameter and elastic modulus can be rewritten whose fundamental variable is the tensile force 9 ϕ ϕ 0 f f 0 1 λ 10 e e 0 f f 0 β λ mechanical characteristics often change with roots in arsm it is assumed that the threshold tensile strength and the elastic modulus do not change instantly during the pullout process the variable f f 0 of these equations is normalized which contributes to calculate the pullout force with analytical model 2 3 pullout force of a root segment the pullout force of a root segment is calculated according to the architectural and mechanical characteristics hence it is considered equal to the tensile force the displacement of a root segment can be reflected by the displacement of the root system schwarz et al 2010a the pullout force of a root segment p at the displacement x n along the root segment axis is given by 11a p e x n π ϕ 2 4 h cos θ π ϕ 2 cos θ 4 h e x n x n x c 11b p 0 x n x c where π ϕ 2 4 is the cross sectional area of a root segment x c is the threshold displacement where the root breaks and h cos θ is the length of a segment mentioned in section 2 1 substituting eq 9 and eq 10 into eq 11a yields 12 p c 0 f κ x n cos θ h where 13 c 0 π 4 e 0 ϕ 0 2 f 0 κ and 14 κ 2 β λ c 0 has units of m 1 κ l 1 κ t 2 κ 1 where m l and t are mass length and time respectively combining the effect of the root system architecture a normalized form of eq 12 is needed 15 p f 0 e 0 t 0 f f 0 κ x n cos θ h the displacement of a segment at failure x n f is obtained under when p equals f of eq 12 16 x n f f 1 κ h c 0 cos θ it is apparent that x n f is mainly controlled by κ it shows that 1 when κ 0 the weaker root holds more force but breaks first 2 when κ 0 both roots hold equal force and the weaker breaks first 3 when 0 κ 1 the weaker holds less force and breaks first 4 when κ 1 the weaker holds less force but both break at the same displacement 5 when κ 1 the weaker hold more force but breaks first the influence of κ on pullout force displacement curve is similar to cohen s research cohen et al 2011 in the pullout force calculation of a root segment θ and x n are often difficult to determine by traditional measurement or calculation methods thus arsm uses the expectation of the segment angle and the displacement of a root bundle to substitute θ and x n of each segment respectively 2 4 pullout force at a topological level the pullout force calculation at a topological level is based on the calculation of a root segment in arsm the root segment at a topological level shares identical displacement along the axis of the root system the force redistribution is ignored because surviving roots may have different displacement from the broken the difference of displacement cannot be tested during a pullout process when a displacement along the axis x i is imposed see fig 1 the pullout force at a topological level p i x can be obtained by integration of pullout force of segments at that level 17 p i x n 1 n i c 0 f κ x n cos θ n h cos θ n where x n cos θ n h cos θ n is the displacement component of a root segment along the axis of the root system in arsm x n is assumed to equal x i cos θ n for simplifying the displacement acquisition hence eq 17 equals 18 p i x n 1 n i c 0 f k x i h cos θ n n i c 0 f i min f i max f κ p f i f d f x i h cos θ n where θ n uniformly distributes between 0 and π 2 radians henderson et al 1983b note that f and θ n are independent and the expectation of cos θ n is 0 π 2 cos θ n p θ θ 2 π the pullout force at the ith topological level is 19 p i x 2 π n i c 0 x i h f i min f i max f κ p f i f d f 2 π n t o t p n i i m n k n c 0 x i h f i min f i max f κ p f i f d f p f i f is the probability density function of the pullout force which can be obtained from eq 3 and eq 8 the formula of p f i f is 20 p f i f m f i k f i m f i k f i f k f i m f i 1 exp f k f i m f i where 21 m f i m ϕ i λ and 22 k f i f 0 k ϕ i ϕ 0 λ the probability density distribution function of f is still a weibull distribution function under the transformation because f monotonically changes with ϕ however the parameters of the function should be modified f i max and f i min is the upper and lower limits of the force respectively which is related to eq 16 if κ 1 x h c 0 and all root segments break at once at the same displacement the root segment with low threshold force breaks first when κ 1 and it is opposite when κ 1 table 1 shows the limits of f therefore the force at the ith level can be expressed by an incomplete gamma function 23 p i x 2 π n t o t m n k n i k n m n 1 exp i k n m n c 0 x i h k f i κ γ κ m f i 1 c 0 x m f i 1 κ h m f i 1 κ k f i m f i it is not certain that the segment with the maximum displacement breaks first for the difference of architectural and mechanical characteristics of roots also it is still tough to determine the displacement at each topological level the move at every topological level is not visible and the difference of displacement at two adjacent level is cumbersome to define therefore it is assumed that the displacement at each level along the axis of the whole root system is equal in arsm 2 5 pullout force of the whole root system the pullout force calculation of a whole root system is related to the force calculation at each topological level in arsm the pullout force of the whole root system is assumed the sum of the force at each level 24 p x i 1 t o p o log i c a l length 2 π n i c 0 x i h f i min f i max f κ p f i f d f i 1 t o p o log i c a l length 2 π n t o t m n k n i k n m n 1 exp i k n m n c 0 x h k f i κ γ κ m f i 1 c 0 x m f i 1 κ h m f i 1 κ k f i m f i where x is the displacement of the whole root system and x i i 1 2 topological length equals x the topological length equals z m h in arsm root segments are requested not to deviate from their own axes during the pullout process because the deviation implies the architectural and mechanical change of the root system the pullout force calculation are related to the root diameter distribution and the parameters f 0 e 0 ϕ 0 and λ the friction of roots and soil is mainly manifested in displacement it is apparent that arsm is more proper to plants with numerous roots or matured plants 3 model evaluation as mentioned above understanding the root system architecture and the mechanical characteristics is important in the study parameters of the arsm were summarized the pullout force calculated by arsm was compared with the experimental results 3 1 root system architecture root geometry is often measured at site such as the root depth root number and root length danjon et al 2005 tardío et al 2016 about the actual root system architecture the root geometry should be related to the root topology the root topology of a longleaf pine in florida was drawn by observation and the size of the taproot supplementary taproots and lateral roots were measured heyward 1933 the model of the pine root system was drawn based on the mathematical functions of the branching density dupuy et al 2005 a 16 year old root system was divided into 6 orders the division rule was that roots around the main stem was in the first order the branches of the first order roots were in the second order and so on the number the length of roots the number of branch point and root angle in each order were measured and then their distribution was summarized by the applied statistical formulas related to their own orders henderson et al 1983a b the root system was assumed a binary tree whose links were divided into exterior links and interior links the amount of links and the geometry of every link were measured oppelt et al 2001 the root area ratio rar increased quickly and then slowly with the increased root number coutts 1983 the relationship between the root number and the root diameter was summarized and it changes with plants waldron and dakessian 1981 schwarz et al 2010b vergani et al 2016 the root number increased and then decreased with depth and the root depth was less than 150 cm danjon et al 2006 2008 arnone et al 2016 also the root number of different diameter classes at the same depth was documented vergani et al 2016 the weibull distribution function was used to estimate the root diameter and root number change of spruce the parameters of the function used in quantifying the root diameter were 3 38 and 2 15 respectively cohen et al 2011 arnone et al 2016 in the subsection parameters of the root diameter and the root number at the ith level m ϕ i and k ϕ i were acquired by the experimental results the root diameter and the root number at each 10 cm depth of alder maple and ironwood were recorded abdi and deljouei 2019 here the influence of the position was ignored at the same depth the root number in the downhill was added up with the number of the same diameter class in the uphill the total root number of a diameter class was regarded as the root number of the average value of the diameter class the root diameter greater than 10 mm was assumed 11 5 mm here is an example in the top 10 m depth the root number of the diameter ranging from2 to 5 mm is 5 in the downhill it is also 5 in the uphill according to abdi s research 2019 hence the root number with a root diameter of 3 5 mm is 10 in the top 10 m depth then the parameters of weibull probability functions were acquired by the fitted curves of calculated results fig 2 and table 2 it shows that m ϕ i and k ϕ i are more adaptable to determine the probability trends the probability of the root diameter less than 6 mm is estimated more accurate note that the specific size of the root diameter above 10 mm is unclear based on that research the integral region of actual probability distribution is different from the region of weibull distribution function the greater the variable is the bigger the difference between calculated and actual probability is the probability of the root number at each depth was estimated by the ratio of root number at each depth to the whole root number and the parameters of its distribution n t o t m n and k n was achieved by the fitting curve of the probability topological level arnone et al 2016 fig 3 and table 3 give the fitting curves and the parameters note that the root number in the downhill and in the uphill were added up at the same depth it is obvious that the weibull distribution probability function is proper in estimation of root number the root number of these plants at the 1st topological level is the largest the probability distribution function is suitable in simulation of the root architectural characteristics the root mechanical characteristics are also required in the calculation of the pullout force 3 2 root mechanics tensile tests are often used to measure the tensile strength and the elastic modulus the tensile strength is achieved by the ratio of the tensile force and the area at break and the elastic modulus is attained by the ratio of the tensile stress and tensile strain in the elastic deformation stage the estimation of tensile strength and the elastic modulus is often related to the root diameter the tensile strength and the elastic modulus often decrease with the increased diameter their relationship was interpreted by negative power equations and power law functions waldron and dakessian 1981 schmidt et al 2001 cazzuffi 2005 fan and su 2008 schwarz et al 2010a abdi et al 2010 osano 2012 abdi and deljouei 2019 the mechanical characteristics are varied with plants and their parameters were summarized cohen et al 2011 the tensile strength the elastic modulus and the tensile strain were estimated by one dimensional linear equation of the reciprocal diameter or topological level tosi 2007 mao et al 2018 in the subsection the mechanical characteristics of roots were estimated by power law functions of root diameter then t 0 α e 0 and β were ascertained then f 0 and λ were calculated by these parameters table 4 gives t 0 α e 0 and β of different plants environmental and test conditions impact the mechanical characteristics in abdi s research the position of root samples is different it is in the road edge zone and on a slope respectively abdi 2018 abdi and deljouei 2019 in zydroń s research 2018 roots of alder were submerged in water before the tensile test and hence the parameters of alder are different the tensile strength of alder maple and ironwood in the summer and winter was tested α was similar no matter how the weather was so was t 0 of alder and maple however t 0 of ironwood changes a lot based on the previous mechanical analyzation of plants most trees shared the same e 0 and β schwarz et al 2010a cohen et al 2011 arnone et al 2016 here the mechanical parameters of alder maple and ironwood provided by abdi and deljouei 2019 were used in the calculation of the pullout force based on these parameters λ and f 0 table 5 were calculated by eq 8 the basic parameters of root architectural and mechanical characteristics are given with them the pullout force of different plants can be calculated by eq 24 3 3 pullout force calculation about the pullout force of a single root it is related to the root diameter the dry weight and the position of plants xu et al 2014 the relation between the force and the root diameter was summarized by a linear equation norris 2005 zhang et al 2012 their relationship was also fitted by the power law function yamase et al 2015 the force often increases with increased displacement and then decreases but the shape of force displacement curve often changes with plants for instance the pullout force displacement curve of a long root a forked or branched root and a multibranched root is different norris 2005 for root systems the pullout process of the root system can be divided into 4 stages 1 the elastic stage 2 the dynamic friction stage 3 the residual strength stage 4 the resting stage at the elastic stage the force increases linearly with displacement to a maximum value at the dynamic friction stage the pullout force displacement curve displays a rapid descent at the residual stage the curve gently declines at the resting stage the pullout force is close to 0 sun et al 2011 yang et al 2017 fig 4 gives the result of field pullout tests there are great differences among these pullout force displacement curves because plants were grown in different environment and pulled out under different test conditions the pullout force displacement curve all has the elastic stage and the dynamic friction stage but the residual stage and the resting stage are not behaved completely there are 2 reasons 1 the root depth may be shallow 2 the broken root system offering resistance may have been pulled out and the remaining roots in the soil cannot be pulled out the curve of reevesia thyrsoidea r thyrsoidea is smoother than the others the force of r thyrsoidea reaches 0 kn at 28 cm displacement the displacement corresponding to the maximum pullout force of hibiscus taiwanensis h taiwanensis macaranga tanarius m tanarius and mallotus paniculatus m paniculatus is less than 5 cm the maximum pullout force of m tanarius and m paniculatus is about 2 times and 4 times the h taiwanensis s respectively the curve of schefflera heptaphulla s heptaphulla contains a rapid decline and the most fluctuation sections at the displacement over 23 cm the curve fluctuates again for the mobilization of root branches it means that the root branch is still capable of carrying the pullout load according to eq 24 m f i k f i c 0 and κ are required to estimate the pullout force of alder maple and ironwood c 0 and κ are given in table 5 and the other parameters are shown in table 2 note that ϕ 0 1 mm here to simplify the diversity in the calculation of c 0 fig 4 also gives the calculation result of alder maple and ironwood they were verified by results of field pullout tests the shape of these pullout force displacement curves is similar to the test result the calculation result gives the intact stage of pullout process as mentioned especially the result of ironwood it displays an obvious residual stage however fluctuation sections cannot be shown mainly due to the shape of gamma function a big difference of the width is shown on the calculated and actual curve there are 2 reasons 1 mechanical characteristics vary with plants 2 the root system architecture of alder maple and ironwood were measured in trenches which are 0 5 m from the center of the root system the 2nd reason means that the root number and the root diameter 0 5 m away from the root center were not recorded in abdi s research 2019 it affects the parameters of root system architecture according to cohen s research 2011 the shape factor m ϕ i mainly controls the width of the curve and hence the curve calculated is narrow for all plants the curve in winter is higher and wider than in summer for the temperature change it shows that weather has less significant effect on the maple the curve of maple in summer and in winter is close to the curve of r thyrsoidea and m paniculatus respectively as for the maximum pullout force alder is followed by ironwood then maple in winter alder is smaller than maple and followed by ironwood in summer in winter the maximum force of alder and ironwood is close to 3 7 kn which is approximately 0 9 kn larger than the force of maple the maximum force of alder and ironwood is approximately 2 times as large in winter as in summer and the maximum force of maple is close no matter the weather is the displacement corresponding to the maximum force is close to 2 cm except alder and ironwood in summer for alder and ironwood in summer it is about 1 cm as for the width the curve of ironwood is wider than maple then alder the curve of alder is 1 cm wider in winter than in summer furthermore arsm still needs to be verified by field pullout test in the future in this calculation vegetation pulled out is different from vegetation whose mechanical and architectural parameters were obtained from experimental results arsm can be verified more accurately in the situation that these parameters and pullout test results belong to the same vegetation also environment and time of root mechanical and architectural test and field pullout test is almost the same 4 discussion arsm describes the pullout behavior of the root system arsm mainly depends on 9 independent parameters see eq 24 practical applications mainly require knowledge of 11 quantities from which the 9 independent parameters are estimated 1 two topological level parameters i h 2 three root number parameters varied with topological level n t o t m n k n 3 two root property exponents α β or λ β 4 two characteristic quantities t 0 e 0 or f 0 e 0 5 two force or diameter root distribution parameters at different topological level m f i k f i note that the probability density functions used in arsm are two parameter distributions which are sufficient to describe the properties of root diameter or force and root number at different topological levels according to fig 2 and fig 3 in the section the effect of these parameters on pullout behavior was discussed so was the relationship between the model and other models 4 1 effects of topological level parameters arsm is mainly applied to describe the pullout behavior of plants at a specific time and position the depth of the root system h is unchangeable but the topological level i is opposite the root diameter often changes with h and i and the range of the root diameter at each topological level is different the diameter of a root segment is assumed constant at each topological level in arsm if i increases the quantity of the root architectural experiment data needed in the root diameter and root number estimation becomes more it complicates the calculation process however the pullout behavior may not change with the increased parameter quantity a reasonable division of a root system is important which improves the calculation efficiency 4 2 effects of root number parameters with eq 24 it is obvious that the pullout force increases proportionally with increased n t o t under a definite topological division for illustrating the influence of m n and k n the other parameters of eq 24 refer to those of maple in winter which are shown in table 2 and table 5 fig 5 gives the calculated pullout force displacement curve no matter how m n and k n change the curve shape resembles and the width is unchangeable the peak increases with increased m n but its correlative displacement slightly decreases m n has a greater impact on the maximum pullout force than k n the maximum pullout force increases with increased k n and then decreases but its correlative displacement is opposite the peak force at k n 0 8 is similar to k n 5 much bigger than k n 0 5 it demonstrates that when m n and k n increase steadily the change of the peak force shows a noticeable and then gentle trend 4 3 effects of root property exponents in afbm κ is controlled by root length and root mechanical characteristics cohen et al 2011 in arsm κ is only governed by root mechanical characteristics κ 2 β λ 2 β 2 α the root length is calculated by the root depth table 4 shows that α is less than 2 here the influence of κ κ 0 on the pullout force was discussed fig 6 the parameters except κ in eq 24 adopt the parameters of maple in winter see table 2 table 3 and table 5 the width of the curve shrinks with increased κ for κ 1 the maximum pullout force increases with increased κ according to eq 8 eq 13 and eq 16 smaller roots hold more force and break first while larger roots remain intact and hold more force at a larger displacement for κ 1 it is opposite the rapid descent of the curve is caused by the earlier larger root break for κ 1 the curve displays a cusp and it is the maximum force roots broke simultaneously where the displacement passes 3 39 cm which can be related to the models of wu et al 1979 the influence of κ is similar to cohen s research 2011 4 4 effects of characteristic quantities in arsm κ affects c 0 for 0 κ 1 and κ 1 c 0 decreases with increased κ for κ 1 c 0 π e 0 ϕ 0 2 4 f 0 e 0 t 0 ϕ 0 1 mm table 5 shows that c 0 is often more than 1 except ironwood in summer also two characteristic quantities e 0 t 0 or e 0 f 0 affect c 0 together fig 7 shows the influence of c 0 on pullout force the parameters except c 0 in eq 24 adopt the parameters of maple in winter see table 2 table 3 and table 5 the maximum force is not affected by c 0 but the width of the curve shrinks dramatically with increased c 0 it is clear that the influence of c 0 on the limits of eq 24 is more significant note that when c 0 1 the dramatical raise of the curve happens at the displacement past 5 cm it means that when c 0 1 the curve is mainly controlled by the exponents of displacement which are the factors of force distribution functions m f i and k f i 4 5 effects of root diameter or force distribution parameters the effect of m ϕ and k ϕ was analyzed in the afbm as for m ϕ the maximum pullout force increases with increased m ϕ but its correlative displacement decreases the width of pullout force displacement curve becomes narrow as for k ϕ the maximum force and its correlative displacement increased with increased k ϕ when κ 1 but the displacement decreased when κ 1 cohen et al 2011 in arsm the parameters of root diameter or force are estimated by the root diameter distribution at each topological level these parameters all impact the pullout behavior so it is difficult to analyze the comprehensive effect of all parameters the parameters depend on the situation of vegetation when the pullout force is loaded instantly also the division plan of the vegetation topology 4 6 comparison with other models and future work in wu s model the displacement corresponding to the maximum tensile force of roots is different and all roots break simultaneously hence the root reinforcement is overestimated wu 1976 waldron 1977 in arsm the root mechanical characteristics are related to the root architecture and the root break process are illustrated by the strain controlled calculation in fbm roots break progressively however the elastic property of every root is requested identical and the criterion of root break is mutative the break criterion usually depends on the root diameter root number and so on it cannot be tested easily daniels 1945 pollen et al 2005 in arsm the mechanical characteristics change with the root architecture the criterion is the displacement of the root system which can be tested easily rbm and afbm are strain controlled models and used to calculate the pullout force of lateral parallel root bundles the pullout force is required to be parallel to lateral roots and the root diameter is the same along the root length note that pullout force was used in stability analysis arnone et al 2016 the resistance offered by roots is not just lateral roots in rbm the friction and the branch distance are needed to be tested schwarz et al 2010a cohen et al 2011 in afbm the dynamic friction caused by the slip out of roots are substituted by the root break but the root length is needed to measure in arsm the root system architecture is divided in detail the root angle is considered the root length is calculated by the ratio of the root depth and the root angle it means that the root diameter can change along the realistic root length the direction of the pullout force and the axis of roots are not requested identical however there are 3 main shortcomings 1 more parameters are needed than other models 2 the pullout force of root segments completely perpendicular to the axis of the root system cannot be considered 3 the pullout force of root segments too curved even growing upward cannot be considered for simplifying the calculation work the root mechanical characteristics is related to the root architectural characteristics the root topological division need to be careful the pullout force is calculated by the interaction between roots and soil the root architectural and mechanical characteristics combined with the interaction can improve the model the characteristics change with time and space so time lags often influence the pullout behavior convergence cross mapping optimal information flow and pcmci can reflect the influence as well as the impact of the plant environment li and convertino 2021 runge et al 2019 also 3d printing 3dp becomes useful in the root architectural research which is helpful to divide topological levels and learn the relationship of different parameters among different topological levels 3dp and mechanical tests of the same plant contributes to reveal the details of pullout behavior then global sensitive analysis can be used to improve arsm pianosi et al 2016 5 conclusions this work presented a new simplified methodology arsm for estimating the pullout force of a root system in arsm the root system shares an identical displacement along the axis and fails progressively in the pullout process the model divides the root system into several topological levels according to its depth the model explicitly considers the properties of root system architecture the root number the root diameter and the root angle the root diameter and the root number at each topological level is calculated by probability density functions weibull the angle of every root segment is represented by the expectation of root angle the root mechanical characteristics the threshold tensile force f and the elastic modulus e are calculated by 2 power functions of the root diameter the pullout force is estimated by the sum of the pullout force at each topological level and the pullout force at each topological level is the sum of the pullout force of every root segment in the level the parameters of alder maple and ironwood in summer and in winter were summarized 1 two topological level parameters i h 2 three parameters of root number that vary with topological levels n t o t m n k n 3 two root property exponents α β or λ β 4 two characteristic quantities t 0 e 0 or f 0 e 0 5 root force or diameter probability distribution parameters at different topological levels m f i k f i the pullout force behavior of alder maple and ironwood was analyzed based on arsm which was also compared with results of field pullout test it proved that arsm can explain the pullout behavior however arsm still needs to be verified in the future the influence of these parameters on the pullout force displacement curve was discussed the division of root system along depth is important the increased n t o t and m n results in the increased maximum pullout force but the influence of the increased k n k n 1 is opposite κ composed of α and β influences the width of the curve the maximum pullout force and its correlative displacement c 0 composed of t 0 and e 0 just impacts the width the influence of the probability distribution parameters of root diameter at each topological level is incomprehensible arsm was compared with other models it is a strain controlled model considering the friction between the soil and the root into the displacement it analyses the root system architecture in detail and allows the force to deviate from the root axis it contemplates the continuous break process the root angle and the relationship of the root architectural and mechanical characteristics however arsm needs more parameters at the moment that the pullout force loads because the root growth varies with time and environment in the future 3dp is needed in root architectural research for the root topological division the relation of different parameters among different topological levels needs to be summarized the regulation of mechanical and architectural characteristics varying with time and space should be surveyed the pullout force calculation can be used in stability analysis so how arsm is used should be researched credit authorship contribution
