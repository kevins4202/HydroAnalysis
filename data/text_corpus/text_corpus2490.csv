12450,the residues of the species calophyllum inophyllum and manihot esculenta were carbonized after impregnation with zncl2 to produce two different activated carbons acs these adsorbents were subsequently used in the removal of the toxic herbicide diuron both the produced adsorbents present functional groups characteristic of structures containing lignin and cellulose these groups are positioned in amorphous and disorganized arrangements the activation process formed a porous carbon exoskeleton with a surface area of 468 m2 g 1 ac calophyllum inophyllum and 614 m2 g 1 ac manihot esculenta respectively adsorption tests of herbicide diuron are performed at different temperatures indicating better performances for the adsorbent derived from manihot esculenta qmax 220 mg g a physical model derived from statistical physics which assumes the formation of two layers of diuron molecules on the acs surface is successfully used to analyze the adsorption mechanism the theoretical analysis of model parameters shows that the number of herbicide molecules captured per adsorption site increases with temperature for both the tested adsorbents suggesting that an endothermic aggregation process occurs the calculation of the adsorption energies confirms that diuron adsorption on the surface of both the adsorbents is based on physical forces finally three thermodynamic parameters are analyzed to attribute a new macroscopic description of the adsorption mechanism keywords adsorption activated carbon herbicide diuron modelling thermodynamic study data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction focused on high production levels as an essential economic target modern agriculture has made indiscriminate use of herbicides and pesticides once released into the environment these compounds are highly persistent and toxic to living organisms 1 2 the possible effects go far beyond the environmental impact of indirect emissions e g transport to groundwater and they also involve the direct exposition of field workers located mainly in low income areas 3 4 various compounds have been utilized for these purposes depending on the specific species targeted for elimination one of the most commonly used herbicides for selective weed control worldwide is diuron also known by its chemical name n 3 4 dichlorophenyl n dimethylurea and sold under different brand names 5 it appears as a white powder with an amine like odor and has a long residual action that remains active in the soil for a long time it can be used both on the land to protect citrus groves asparagus alfalfa currants peppermint rice paddies banks and against algae and aquatic weeds also of the filamentous type and against certain types of submerged aquatic weeds najas potagemon lemna utricularia carex in non flowing waters the european union considers diuron to be highly toxic and carcinogenic to humans 6 the severity of the damage depends on some factors such as the host the contact time and the concentration 7 9 due to its indiscriminate sale in many countries and its persistence in the environment it has already been detected in several water bodies 5 the release in water bodies can occur during the manufacturing stage or the transport and during the use on agricultural crops in the latter case mainly through soil leaching enhanced by precipitation and then propagated to rivers and groundwater 10 mobility in soil occurs by both chemical and biological mechanisms 11 however due to its characteristics such as moderate solubility in water and low molar mass diuron is easily leached into groundwater rivers and lakes 12 all these factors led the scientific community to study and improve different technologies for removing this compound from the environment and in particular from polluted water to this end and among the possible adaptable water treatments adsorption has shown a high efficiency especially in terms of high versatility for a large range of similar substances 13 17 one of the characteristics that make adsorption so largely diffused for water treatment is the wide variety of possible adsorbents that can be tuned and used for specific purposes together with the equally large amount of possible precursors for their synthesis especially among lignocellulosic residues in the literature several adsorbents have been proposed for the removal of herbicides and pesticides eventually modified by different techniques such as bamboo stalk 18 corn cob 19 kaki seeds 20 mushroom 21 residues of wood 22 physalis peruviana 14 cedrella fissilis bark 23 baobab tree 5 24 araçá fruit husks 25 and leaves 26 in order to further diffuse the use of remediation techniques such as adsorption the use of many further lignocellulosic residues as precursors in cost effective synthesis procedures should be promoted due to their general low cost moreover this approach facilitates the diffusion of some important principles of the so called circular economy because the valorization of the residues is coupled with the avoiding of their disposal costs cassava manihot esculenta which originates from south america is a nutrient rich plant that provides a significant source of carbohydrates mainly stored into its roots 27 during the production of this species a substantial amount of residual biomass is generated the peel alone accounting for approximately 3 to 5 of the total weight of the roots in brazil alone it is estimated that 1 million tons of residual bark of this plant are produced annually 28 it is known that a part is destined for animal consumption but due to the large volumes it is not possible to fully consume this biomass 29 in order to assess alternative uses some studies have already tried to verify the possible use of this residue as an adsorbent material for the removal from polluted water of different compounds such as dyes 30 33 and heavy metals 28 34 37 however this residue has never been used for the removal of herbicides while its use could result as appropriate similarly the forest specie calophyllum inophyllum annually produces a large volume of fruits the latter a rounded shape and are not attractive to animals and insects being deposited in the soil after ripening 38 this specie is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions 38 some studies proposed the use of this fruit for the production of biodiesel 39 to the best of our knowledge also this residue has never been used for specific applications such as herbicides pesticides removal from contaminated water a thorough assessment of the possible use of a new adsorbent for a specific application should pass through for a deep investigation based on a coupled experimental and theoretical approach to assess the extent of the adsorption and the mechanism occurring in particular while experimental studies provide a direct indications of the attainable performances a subsequent modelling analysis can allow achieving a deeper knowledge about the adsorption dynamics moreover thermodynamic theoretical studies can complete the investigation by indicating the energetic interactions at a microscopic level this study sought to add value to residuals of manihot esculentabarkand calophyllum inophyllum fruits through their transformation into new adsorbents both residues were carbonized after impregnation with zinc chloride zncl2 and both the precursor and the carbonized materials were characterized by different techniques subsequently the obtained adsorbents were tested for the adsorption of the herbicide diuron at different temperatures 298 328 k in order to gain a molecular level understanding of the adsorption mechanism of diuron on the synthesized adsorbents an analytical model derived from statistical physics was adopted and fitted to the experimental data with the aim of theoretically explaining the retrieved adsorption isotherms a detailed analysis of the model parameters was carried out to retrieve important information about the dynamic of the interactions between the durion molecules and the activated carbon surface finally three fundamental thermodynamic parameters were determined and adopted to interpreter the energetic aspects of the adsorption mechanism 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals employed the chemicals and reagents used in this study were obtained with analytical grade from sigma aldrich usa and included zinc chloride zncl2 hydrochloric acid hcl and diuron 3 3 4 dichlorophenyl 1 1 dimethylurea diuron has a chemical formula of c9h10cl2n2o a molecular weight of 233 1 g mol 1 a molar volume of 170 1 cm3 mol 1 and a molecular area of 0 75 nm2 38 39 to prepare the stock solution 1 g l 1 of diuron was accurately dissolved in methanol as this herbicide has moderate water solubility the stock solution was diluted to the necessary concentrations to create the aqueous solutions for subsequent tests which were then stored in glass vials during the described procedures deionized water was used 2 2 precursor material and adsorbent production the fruits of the tree species calophyllum inophyllum were collected in the city of barranquilla located in colombia this region has a tropical climate which is favorable to the development of thisspecies about 600 g of fruits were collected directly from the ground similarly 600 g of cassava husks manihot esculenta were obtained by rural producers located in southern brazil the steps described below were performed equally for both the precursor materials but in separate runs after collection the residues were washed with distilled water and this process was repeated several times ensuring that all the undesirable particles were removed the washed materials were put in an oven for drying purposes remaining for 48 h at a temperature of 328 k after ensuring that all the moisture was removed the residues were crushed with the aid of a knife mill and sieved generating a powder with particles smaller than 0 20 mm a portion of the precursor material was allocated for characterization analysis while the remaining partwas utilized in the production of activated carbon through subsequent treatment with zinc chloride zncl2 the activating agent s purpose is to enhance the development of surface area and to promote an effective pore formation in this case zncl2 was used for this role 40 a homogeneous paste was prepared by mixing 15 g of precursor material with 15 g of the activating agent 1 1 and 2 ml of distilled water in a petri dish the plates were then conditioned for 48 h at a constant temperature of 378 k and the resulting materials were ground in a crucible to obtain particles with a diameter smaller than 355 μm next the pyrolysis step was carried out under an n2 atmosphere with a flow rate of 0 25 l min 1 heating the mixture at a rate of 283 k min 1 until it reached 923 k and then maintaining it at that temperature for further 80 min the resulting pyrolyzed material was added to a 10 mol l 1 hcl solution and mixed for 120 min to extract the activating agent and then washed with distilled water to remove the acid residuals the activated carbons were deposited in petri dishes and dried in an oven at a temperature of 323 k for 300 min after removing all the moisture the samples were mixed and sieved to standardize the particle size to a value below 149 μm the materials were labeled as activated carbon ac from residual cassava husks manihot esculenta and ac fromcalophyllum inophyllum fruits a portion was used for characterization analysis and the rest was used for isothermal studies of diuron adsorption 2 3 adsorbent characterization the adsorbents were previously characterized in former published works 41 42 where more details can be found various techniques were used to analyze the structural morphological and chemical properties of the adsorbents the specific surface area sbet was estimated by obtaining n2 adsorption desorption isotherms using asap 2020 the surface morphology of the samples was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope specifically a vega 3 sb tescan instrument fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of the materials were obtained using a shimadzu ir prestige 21 ft ir spectrometer with a spectral range of 4500 to 500 cm 1 x ray diffraction xrd carried out with a computer controlled x ray diffractometer rigaku miniflex 300 japan was used to identify the presence of crystallographic structures the results indicated that the carbonization step significantly reduced the heterogeneity present on the surface of both materials resulting in fewer bands related to carbon and hydrogen bonding or compatible with aromatic structures in the activated carbon ac in general it can be inferred that the findings of this study which reveal a low abundance of surface functional groups in activated carbons primarily composed of carbon align with previous researches reported in the literature 34 43 44 the xrd diffractograms of the adsorbent samples indicated the presence of a broad peak present in the precursor corresponding to cellulose ii this indicates the presence of compounds of organic origin such as hemicelluloses and lignin 45 48 the pyrolysis step with the activating agent decreased the peak intensity in addition to the emergence of a new peak corresponding to the 002 plane 49 this peak may be linked to the crystalline graphite formed when the material is subjected to high temperatures 50 in both adsorbents the arrangement maintained its amorphous structure which corresponds to a disorganized and irregular structure where the empty spaces are not uniformly distributed but can be occupied potentially by adsorbate molecules by observing xrd patterns of the materials it is possible to conclude that these results are similar to those obtained in other studies using fruit residues 20 25 51 53 and wood residues 23 54 56 the scanning electronmicroscopy sem technique performed on both the samples revealed the presence of irregularities and cavities alternately distributed over the surface area the textural characteristics of the materials are described in table 1 the activated carbon deriving from manihot esculenta shows a good sbet area of 614 m2 g 1 with a good pore structure development vp 0 42 cm3 g 1 dp 2 70 nm indicating the presence of mesopores according to the iupac classification 57 58 on the other hand the activated carbon deriving from the residue of calophyllum inophyllum had a smaller surface area of 468 m2 g 1 which is relatively low as compared to other activated carbons activated with zncl2 49 59 regarding porosity it presents micro and mesopores with less developed pore structure vp 0 31 cm3 g 1 dp 2 70 nm 57 58 being compatible with textural characteristics of other materials carbonized with the same salt in the proportions of 1 1 60 however the adsorption capacity and good performance of an adsorbent involve many further factors e g the surface functional groups 61 therefore its suitability for the specific application should be evaluated through dedicated experimental tests 2 4 adsorption experiments diuron all the isothermal studies described below were carried out at the natural ph of the solution ph 7 and with a fixed dosage of adsorbent equal to 0 5 g l 1 for the sample obtained from residual cassava manihot esculenta bark and 0 75 g l 1 for that obtained from the fruits of the tree species calophyllum inophyllum the adsorption isotherms of diuron were assessed by modifying the initial concentrations of diuron in erlenmeyer flasks to 50 100 150 and 200 mg l for samples using ac from manihot esculenta and 50 75 100 150 and 200 mg l for samples using ac from calophyllum inophyllum and operating at 298 308 318 and 328 k the samples were shaken for 5 h to achieve equilibrium in the diuron ac system while being stirred at 160 rpm using a thermostatic stirrer marconi ma093 marconi brazil the concentration of the adsorbate in the aqueous medium was determined at the maximum absorption wavelength of diuron 248 nm using a spectrophotometer uv mini 1240 shimadzu to ensure accuracy the experiments were performed in triplicate n 3 and after each trial the samples were centrifuged centribio 80 2b brazil at 4000 rpm for 25 min to achieve complete diuron ac separation the ph of the solution was determined using a ph meter digimed dm 20 brazil 3 results and discussion 3 1 diuron adsorption isotherms fig 1 displays the diuron adsorption isotherms on the two tested adsorbents as a function of equilibrium concentration from fig 1 it can be observed that the temperature exerted a favorable influence on the herbicide molecules adsorption since for both the adsorbents the adsorption capacity increased along with temperature in a more pronounced way for the ac derived from manihot esculenta for each investigated temperature the ac derived from manihot esculenta showed significantly better performances than the ac derived from calophyllum inophyllum as diuron adsorption capacity is almost double moreover the diuron adsorption capacity increases with equilibrium concentration and under the testedset of experimental conditions saturation is reached at a moderately high concentration the adsorbent surface became saturated as the existing adsorption sites were occupied which allowed for the creation of multiple layers of herbicide on the solid surface 3 2 modelling analysis to shed light on the adsorption mechanism and to assess the number of diuron molecule layers formed on acs surface upon adsorption different models deriving from statistical physics were tested an enhanced model em postulating the formation of two layers of diuron molecules on the adsorbent surface resulted to be optimal for the purpose of interpreting the experimental adsorption isotherms retrieved for both the adsorbents this model hypothesizes the production of two adsorption energies one characterizing the interactions between the herbicide molecules and the active sites of the adsorbents and the other describing the interactions of the second layer i e between diuron molecules the adsorbed capacity as a function of the equilibrium concentration associated to this model is provided by the following equation 62 1 q eq n h d as c eq c 1 n h 2 c eq c 2 2 n h 1 c eq c 1 n h c eq c 2 2 n h where n h is the number of diuron molecules captured per adsorption site d as is their density c 1 and c 2 are the half saturation concentrations related to the first and second formed molecule layer respectively the computational modelling of the isotherms was executed via a nonlinear multivariate regression utilizing the levenberg marquardt method the r2 fitting coefficient values and the physicochemical parameters of the adsorption model evaluated by data adjustment are summarized in table 2 it is convenient to note that the values of adsorption capacity are determined via this relationship 2 nh das the coefficient 2 represents the number of formed layer the curves of the adsorption isotherms fitted by the double layer adsorption model are drawn in fig 2 showing a very good agreement with the experimental data 3 3 theoretical analysis of the adsorption mechanism via the enhanced statistical physics model 3 3 1 explanation of the parameters nh and das fig 3 illustrates the effect of temperature on the density of adsorption sites and the number of diuron molecules captured per active site the nh parameter is a relevant stoichiometric coefficient that can be adopted to define the geometric anchorage of diuron molecules on the activated carbons it can also be utilized to assess the aggregation extent of their organic molecule upon adsorption on the adsorbent surface for the activated carbon obtained from calophyllum inophyllum table 2 showed that the values of the number of molecules captured per adsorption site are lower than unity nh 1 for the entire temperature interval tested more precisely at low temperatures 298 k the nh parameter is below 0 5 hinting that the adsorption mechanism is multi anchoring and the herbicide molecules were adsorbed via two or more adsorption sites with a parallel arrangement a mixed anchoring mechanism was observed at high temperatures i e 318 and 328 k where molecules were adsorbed through interaction with one or two adsorption sites with different degrees as an example for the data at 318 k it can be assumed that the obtained figure is the result of two different contributions computable as follows 0 66 1 k 1 k 0 5 where k and 1 k are the percentages of non parallel and parallel orientation respectively in this case k 0 16 hence it is possible to conclude that 16 of the herbicide molecules were adsorbed via a single adsorption site nonparallel position and 84 were adsorbed via two sites parallel position 63 for the activated carbon obtained from manihot esculenta the number of molecules captured per adsorption site is greater than unity implying that the adsorption mechanism is multimolecular and each site can bind several herbicide molecules simultaneously this scenario also demonstrated the presence of aggregation of diuron molecules dimer and trimer upon adsorption on the adsorbent surface regarding the impact of temperature the number of herbicide molecules captured per adsorption site increased with the temperature for both adsorbents as illustrated in fig 3 this observation suggested that the increase in adsorption capacity experimentally observed could be ascribed to an aggregation phenomenon probably facilitated by water desorption at high temperatures fig 3 illustrates a decrease in the adsorption site density das due to the increase in the nh parameter as temperature increases this could be likely connected with the trend of the nh parameter which can lead to a reduction in the available space on the surface of the adsorbent ultimately resulting in a lower density of adsorption sites available for herbicide molecules to bind to 3 3 2 explanation of the adsorbed quantity at saturation to evaluate the performance of the adsorbents tested in this research the adsorbed capacity at saturation was determined using the following relationship 62 2 q s 2 n h d as the trend of this parameter as a function of the temperature is depicted in fig 4 fig 4 shows that the adsorbed quantity at saturation increased with temperature althoughonly slightly for the activated carbon derived from manihot esculenta confirming the endothermic behavior of these adsorbents in diuron adsorption experimentally observed these outcomes indicated that the capture mechanism of diuron herbicide molecules on the two tested adsorbents was significantly influenced by the number of molecules captured per adsorption site nh remarkably under the tested operating conditions the ac obtained from manihot esculenta species showed a significantly higher adsorption capacity at saturation with respect to the ac obtained from calophyllum inophyllum the enhanced adsorption performance of activated carbon obtained from manihot esculenta residue can be ascribed to the higher specific surface area 614 m2 g 1 and good pore development vp 0 42 cm3 g 1 dp 2 7 nm as compared to the other activated carbon tested ac from calophyllum inophyllum residue 3 3 3 calculation of adsorption energies two equations were used to calculate the adsorption energies and analyze the interactions between the two layers of herbicide molecules on the surface of the tested adsorbents 62 3 δ e 1 rt ln c s c 1 4 δ e 2 rt ln c s c 2 where r 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 is the ideal gas constant and c s is the water solubility of diuron herbicide table 3 provides the computed adsorption energies for the two tested adsorbents the interaction energies between the adsorbent and diuron herbicide molecules were found to be 40 kj mol suggesting that the adsorption process is driven by physical forces it can be inferred that hydrogen bonding and van der waals forces are the primary mechanisms by which diuron molecules are adsorbed on the surface of the adsorbents this observation is consistent with previous studies on the adsorption of diuron and other herbicides which have also reported physical interactions as the dominant adsorption mechanism it is interesting observing that the energy related to the interactions between the diuron molecules and the acs surface is higher that the corresponding value of the second layer related to diuron molecules molecules interactions 3 3 4 comparison of the adsorption capacities with the literature taking into consideration the experimental values attained for the activated carbon from calophyllum inophyllum and manihot esculenta and the values reported in the literature a summary table 4 for a comparative evaluation of the results was generated the first aspect to be noticed is that the activated carbon from baobab seeds tends to present the highest adsorption capacity and specific surface area after that the adsorbents presented in this work present the highest adsorption capacities with lower specific surface area in comparison with activated carbon from baobab seeds it is interesting observing that for a specific surface area 3 times lower the adsorption capacity is just twice as small reflecting that the functional groups present on the surface of the adsorbent also offer a contribution 4 thermodynamic analysis interpretation of the adsorption entropy ae gibss free enthalpy gfe and internal energy ie the study of the ae or configurational entropy is useful to provide interesting information regarding the adsorbate arrangement on both adsorbent surfaces its expression is summarized as follows 70 5 s a k b d as c c 1 n h ln c c 1 n h c c 2 2 n h ln c c 2 2 n h 1 c c 1 n h c c 2 2 n h ln 1 c c 1 n h c c 2 2 n h kb is the constant of boltzmann the trend of the adsorption entropy as a function of the durion equilibrium concentration is depicted in fig 5 for both the adsorbents for both the adsorbents a maximum in the entropy was retrieved for an almost constant concentration value even if with a peak intensity different for all the investigated temperatures basically two physical phenomena are related to the maximum of ae before this maximum there is an increment of the ae indicating that the disorder increased at low concentrations due to the large empty adsorption sites for the pollutant to be adsorbed after this maximum an inverse phenomenon was identified clearly there is a decrement of the ae due to the decrement of the disorder related to the lower number of the available adsorption sites on both adsorbent surfaces for the pollutant the interpretation of the gfe is helpful to analyze the adsorption spontaneity its mathematical expression is given by 70 6 g a k b t nd as ln c z v c c 1 n h 2 c c 2 2 n h 1 c c 1 n h c c 2 2 n h in which zv is the translation portion function per unit volume the relationship between this thermodynamic parameter and the durion equilibrium concentration for both the investigated adsorbents is depicted in fig 6 all the values of the gfe are negative and for all the investigated temperatures indicating that the adsorption of this pollutant is spontaneous finally according to the adopted model the expression of the internal energy eint is given by 70 7 e int k b t d as c c 1 n h ln c c 1 n h 2 c c 2 2 n h ln c c 2 2 n h 1 c c 1 n h c c 2 2 n h 1 β ln c z v c c 1 n h 2 c c 2 2 n h 1 c c 1 n h c c 2 2 n h the variation of this thermodynamic parameter as a function of diuron equilibrium concentration for both the adsorbents is depicted in fig 7 overall it was noted that the values of the ie are negative corroborating that the systems evolve spontaneously since it releases energy moreover an increase in modulus of the magnitude with equilibrium concentration testifies that as long as adsorption capacity increases new and more energetic active sites are involved in the adsorption process 5 conclusion in this work the residual biomass produced by the species calophyllum inophyllum and manihot esculenta was used for the synthesis of two new activated carbon samples by the carbonization process of zinc chloride impregnated biomass the obtained adsorbents basically formed by carbonaceous structures showed relatively good surface are as with a bet surface area equal to sbet 468 m2 g 1 and sbet 614 m2 g 1 respectively the ftir analysis indicated that the carbonization step provided morphological changes on the surface favorable to the diuron herbicide adsorption process diuron herbicide adsorption tests indicated that the ac derived from calophyllum inophyllum shows better performances for both adsorbents a double layer model based on statistical physics principles resulted to be the best fitting the modelling results indicated that the herbicide molecule adsorption mechanism is multi anchoring for the ac obtained from calophyllum inophyllum while for ac obtained from manihot esculenta the removal mechanism is multi molecular the experimental and theoretical analysis showed that the activated carbon obtained from manihot esculenta has a better adsorption performance compared to the other tested adsorbent and this result can be associated to its higher specific surface area finally adsorption resulted to be related to physical forces in which the energy associated with the first layer is greater than the figure retrieved for the second layer the process is spontaneous and the increase in the internal energy testifies that as long as adsorption capacity increases new and more energetic active sites are involved in the adsorption process declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial interests acknowledgment this work was financially supported

formation in this case zncl2 was used for this role 40 a homogeneous paste was prepared by mixing 15 g of precursor material with 15 g of the activating agent 1 1 and 2 ml of distilled water in a petri dish the plates were then conditioned for 48 h at a constant temperature of 378 k and the resulting materials were ground in a crucible to obtain particles with a diameter smaller than 355 μm next the pyrolysis step was carried out under an n2 atmosphere with a flow rate of 0 25 l min 1 heating the mixture at a rate of 283 k min 1 until it reached 923 k and then maintaining it at that temperature for further 80 min the resulting pyrolyzed material was added to a 10 mol l 1 hcl solution and mixed for 120 min to extract the activating agent and then washed with distilled water to remove the acid residuals the activated carbons were deposited in petri dishes and dried in an oven at a temperature of 323 k for 300 min after removing all the moisture the samples were mixed and sieved to standardize the particle size to a value below 149 μm the materials were labeled as activated carbon ac from residual cassava husks manihot esculenta and ac fromcalophyllum inophyllum fruits a portion was used for characterization analysis and the rest was used for isothermal studies of diuron adsorption 2 3 adsorbent characterization the adsorbents were previously characterized in former published works 41 42 where more details can be found various techniques were used to analyze the structural morphological and chemical properties of the adsorbents the specific surface area sbet was estimated by obtaining n2 adsorption desorption isotherms using asap 2020 the surface morphology of the samples was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope specifically a vega 3 sb tescan instrument fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of the materials were obtained using a shimadzu ir prestige 21 ft ir spectrometer with a spectral range of 4500 to 500 cm 1 x ray diffraction xrd carried out with a computer controlled x ray diffractometer rigaku miniflex 300 japan was used to identify the presence of crystallographic structures the results indicated that the carbonization step significantly reduced the heterogeneity present on the surface of both materials resulting in fewer bands related to carbon and hydrogen bonding or compatible with aromatic structures in the activated carbon ac in general it can be inferred that the findings of this study which reveal a low abundance of surface functional groups in activated carbons primarily composed of carbon align with previous researches reported in the literature 34 43 44 the xrd diffractograms of the adsorbent samples indicated the presence of a broad peak present in the precursor corresponding to cellulose ii this indicates the presence of compounds of organic origin such as hemicelluloses and lignin 45 48 the pyrolysis step with the activating agent decreased the peak intensity in addition to the emergence of a new peak corresponding to the 002 plane 49 this peak may be linked to the crystalline graphite formed when the material is subjected to high temperatures 50 in both adsorbents the arrangement maintained its amorphous structure which corresponds to a disorganized and irregular structure where the empty spaces are not uniformly distributed but can be occupied potentially by adsorbate molecules by observing xrd patterns of the materials it is possible to conclude that these results are similar to those obtained in other studies using fruit residues 20 25 51 53 and wood residues 23 54 56 the scanning electronmicroscopy sem technique performed on both the samples revealed the presence of irregularities and cavities alternately distributed over the surface area the textural characteristics of the materials are described in table 1 the activated carbon deriving from manihot esculenta shows a good sbet area of 614 m2 g 1 with a good pore structure development vp 0 42 cm3 g 1 dp 2 70 nm indicating the presence of mesopores according to the iupac classification 57 58 on the other hand the activated carbon deriving from the residue of calophyllum inophyllum had a smaller surface area of 468 m2 g 1 which is relatively low as compared to other activated carbons activated with zncl2 49 59 regarding porosity it presents micro and mesopores with less developed pore structure vp 0 31 cm3 g 1 dp 2 70 nm 57 58 being compatible with textural characteristics of other materials carbonized with the same salt in the proportions of 1 1 60 however the adsorption capacity and good performance of an adsorbent involve many further factors e g the surface functional groups 61 therefore its suitability for the specific application should be evaluated through dedicated experimental tests 2 4 adsorption experiments diuron all the isothermal studies described below were carried out at the natural ph of the solution ph 7 and with a fixed dosage of adsorbent equal to 0 5 g l 1 for the sample obtained from residual cassava manihot esculenta bark and 0 75 g l 1 for that obtained from the fruits of the tree species calophyllum inophyllum the adsorption isotherms of diuron were assessed by modifying the initial concentrations of diuron in erlenmeyer flasks to 50 100 150 and 200 mg l for samples using ac from manihot esculenta and 50 75 100 150 and 200 mg l for samples using ac from calophyllum inophyllum and operating at 298 308 318 and 328 k the samples were shaken for 5 h to achieve equilibrium in the diuron ac system while being stirred at 160 rpm using a thermostatic stirrer marconi ma093 marconi brazil the concentration of the adsorbate in the aqueous medium was determined at the maximum absorption wavelength of diuron 248 nm using a spectrophotometer uv mini 1240 shimadzu to ensure accuracy the experiments were performed in triplicate n 3 and after each trial the samples were centrifuged centribio 80 2b brazil at 4000 rpm for 25 min to achieve complete diuron ac separation the ph of the solution was determined using a ph meter digimed dm 20 brazil 3 results and discussion 3 1 diuron adsorption isotherms fig 1 displays the diuron adsorption isotherms on the two tested adsorbents as a function of equilibrium concentration from fig 1 it can be observed that the temperature exerted a favorable influence on the herbicide molecules adsorption since for both the adsorbents the adsorption capacity increased along with temperature in a more pronounced way for the ac derived from manihot esculenta for each investigated temperature the ac derived from manihot esculenta showed significantly better performances than the ac derived from calophyllum inophyllum as diuron adsorption capacity is almost double moreover the diuron adsorption capacity increases with equilibrium concentration and under the testedset of experimental conditions saturation is reached at a moderately high concentration the adsorbent surface became saturated as the existing adsorption sites were occupied which allowed for the creation of multiple layers of herbicide on the solid surface 3 2 modelling analysis to shed light on the adsorption mechanism and to assess the number of diuron molecule layers formed on acs surface upon adsorption different models deriving from statistical physics were tested an enhanced model em postulating the formation of two layers of diuron molecules on the adsorbent surface resulted to be optimal for the purpose of interpreting the experimental adsorption isotherms retrieved for both the adsorbents this model hypothesizes the production of two adsorption energies one characterizing the interactions between the herbicide molecules and the active sites of the adsorbents and the other describing the interactions of the second layer i e between diuron molecules the adsorbed capacity as a function of the equilibrium concentration associated to this model is provided by the following equation 62 1 q eq n h d as c eq c 1 n h 2 c eq c 2 2 n h 1 c eq c 1 n h c eq c 2 2 n h where n h is the number of diuron molecules captured per adsorption site d as is their density c 1 and c 2 are the half saturation concentrations related to the first and second formed molecule layer respectively the computational modelling of the isotherms was executed via a nonlinear multivariate regression utilizing the levenberg marquardt method the r2 fitting coefficient values and the physicochemical parameters of the adsorption model evaluated by data adjustment are summarized in table 2 it is convenient to note that the values of adsorption capacity are determined via this relationship 2 nh das the coefficient 2 represents the number of formed layer the curves of the adsorption isotherms fitted by the double layer adsorption model are drawn in fig 2 showing a very good agreement with the experimental data 3 3 theoretical analysis of the adsorption mechanism via the enhanced statistical physics model 3 3 1 explanation of the parameters nh and das fig 3 illustrates the effect of temperature on the density of adsorption sites and the number of diuron molecules captured per active site the nh parameter is a relevant stoichiometric coefficient that can be adopted to define the geometric anchorage of diuron molecules on the activated carbons it can also be utilized to assess the aggregation extent of their organic molecule upon adsorption on the adsorbent surface for the activated carbon obtained from calophyllum inophyllum table 2 showed that the values of the number of molecules captured per adsorption site are lower than unity nh 1 for the entire temperature interval tested more precisely at low temperatures 298 k the nh parameter is below 0 5 hinting that the adsorption mechanism is multi anchoring and the herbicide molecules were adsorbed via two or more adsorption sites with a parallel arrangement a mixed anchoring mechanism was observed at high temperatures i e 318 and 328 k where molecules were adsorbed through interaction with one or two adsorption sites with different degrees as an example for the data at 318 k it can be assumed that the obtained figure is the result of two different contributions computable as follows 0 66 1 k 1 k 0 5 where k and 1 k are the percentages of non parallel and parallel orientation respectively in this case k 0 16 hence it is possible to conclude that 16 of the herbicide molecules were adsorbed via a single adsorption site nonparallel position and 84 were adsorbed via two sites parallel position 63 for the activated carbon obtained from manihot esculenta the number of molecules captured per adsorption site is greater than unity implying that the adsorption mechanism is multimolecular and each site can bind several herbicide molecules simultaneously this scenario also demonstrated the presence of aggregation of diuron molecules dimer and trimer upon adsorption on the adsorbent surface regarding the impact of temperature the number of herbicide molecules captured per adsorption site increased with the temperature for both adsorbents as illustrated in fig 3 this observation suggested that the increase in adsorption capacity experimentally observed could be ascribed to an aggregation phenomenon probably facilitated by water desorption at high temperatures fig 3 illustrates a decrease in the adsorption site density das due to the increase in the nh parameter as temperature increases this could be likely connected with the trend of the nh parameter which can lead to a reduction in the available space on the surface of the adsorbent ultimately resulting in a lower density of adsorption sites available for herbicide molecules to bind to 3 3 2 explanation of the adsorbed quantity at saturation to evaluate the performance of the adsorbents tested in this research the adsorbed capacity at saturation was determined using the following relationship 62 2 q s 2 n h d as the trend of this parameter as a function of the temperature is depicted in fig 4 fig 4 shows that the adsorbed quantity at saturation increased with temperature althoughonly slightly for the activated carbon derived from manihot esculenta confirming the endothermic behavior of these adsorbents in diuron adsorption experimentally observed these outcomes indicated that the capture mechanism of diuron herbicide molecules on the two tested adsorbents was significantly influenced by the number of molecules captured per adsorption site nh remarkably under the tested operating conditions the ac obtained from manihot esculenta species showed a significantly higher adsorption capacity at saturation with respect to the ac obtained from calophyllum inophyllum the enhanced adsorption performance of activated carbon obtained from manihot esculenta residue can be ascribed to the higher specific surface area 614 m2 g 1 and good pore development vp 0 42 cm3 g 1 dp 2 7 nm as compared to the other activated carbon tested ac from calophyllum inophyllum residue 3 3 3 calculation of adsorption energies two equations were used to calculate the adsorption energies and analyze the interactions between the two layers of herbicide molecules on the surface of the tested adsorbents 62 3 δ e 1 rt ln c s c 1 4 δ e 2 rt ln c s c 2 where r 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 is the ideal gas constant and c s is the water solubility of diuron herbicide table 3 provides the computed adsorption energies for the two tested adsorbents the interaction energies between the adsorbent and diuron herbicide molecules were found to be 40 kj mol suggesting that the adsorption process is driven by physical forces it can be inferred that hydrogen bonding and van der waals forces are the primary mechanisms by which diuron molecules are adsorbed on the surface of the adsorbents this observation is consistent with previous studies on the adsorption of diuron and other herbicides which have also reported physical interactions as the dominant adsorption mechanism it is interesting observing that the energy related to the interactions between the diuron molecules and the acs surface is higher that the corresponding value of the second layer related to diuron molecules molecules interactions 3 3 4 comparison of the adsorption capacities with the literature taking into consideration the experimental values attained for the activated carbon from calophyllum inophyllum and manihot esculenta and the values reported in the literature a summary table 4 for a comparative evaluation of the results was generated the first aspect to be noticed is that the activated carbon from baobab seeds tends to present the highest adsorption capacity and specific surface area after that the adsorbents presented in this work present the highest adsorption capacities with lower specific surface area in comparison with activated carbon from baobab seeds it is interesting observing that for a specific surface area 3 times lower the adsorption capacity is just twice as small reflecting that the functional groups present on the surface of the adsorbent also offer a contribution 4 thermodynamic analysis interpretation of the adsorption entropy ae gibss free enthalpy gfe and internal energy ie the study of the ae or configurational entropy is useful to provide interesting information regarding the adsorbate arrangement on both adsorbent surfaces its expression is summarized as follows 70 5 s a k b d as c c 1 n h ln c c 1 n h c c 2 2 n h ln c c 2 2 n h 1 c c 1 n h c c 2 2 n h ln 1 c c 1 n h c c 2 2 n h kb is the constant of boltzmann the trend of the adsorption entropy as a function of the durion equilibrium concentration is depicted in fig 5 for both the adsorbents for both the adsorbents a maximum in the entropy was retrieved for an almost constant concentration value even if with a peak intensity different for all the investigated temperatures basically two physical phenomena are related to the maximum of ae before this maximum there is an increment of the ae indicating that the disorder increased at low concentrations due to the large empty adsorption sites for the pollutant to be adsorbed after this maximum an inverse phenomenon was identified clearly there is a decrement of the ae due to the decrement of the disorder related to the lower number of the available adsorption sites on both adsorbent surfaces for the pollutant the interpretation of the gfe is helpful to analyze the adsorption spontaneity its mathematical expression is given by 70 6 g a k b t nd as ln c z v c c 1 n h 2 c c 2 2 n h 1 c c 1 n h c c 2 2 n h in which zv is the translation portion function per unit volume the relationship between this thermodynamic parameter and the durion equilibrium concentration for both the investigated adsorbents is depicted in fig 6 all the values of the gfe are negative and for all the investigated temperatures indicating that the adsorption of this pollutant is spontaneous finally according to the adopted model the expression of the internal energy eint is given by 70 7 e int k b t d as c c 1 n h ln c c 1 n h 2 c c 2 2 n h ln c c 2 2 n h 1 c c 1 n h c c 2 2 n h 1 β ln c z v c c 1 n h 2 c c 2 2 n h 1 c c 1 n h c c 2 2 n h the variation of this thermodynamic parameter as a function of diuron equilibrium concentration for both the adsorbents is depicted in fig 7 overall it was noted that the values of the ie are negative corroborating that the systems evolve spontaneously since it releases energy moreover an increase in modulus of the magnitude with equilibrium concentration testifies that as long as adsorption capacity increases new and more energetic active sites are involved in the adsorption process 5 conclusion in this work the residual biomass produced by the species calophyllum inophyllum and manihot esculenta was used for the synthesis of two new activated carbon samples by the carbonization process of zinc chloride impregnated biomass the obtained adsorbents basically formed by carbonaceous structures showed relatively good surface are as with a bet surface area equal to sbet 468 m2 g 1 and sbet 614 m2 g 1 respectively the ftir analysis indicated that the carbonization step provided morphological changes on the surface favorable to the diuron herbicide adsorption process diuron herbicide adsorption tests indicated that the ac derived from calophyllum inophyllum shows better performances for both adsorbents a double layer model based on statistical physics principles resulted to be the best fitting the modelling results indicated that the herbicide molecule adsorption mechanism is multi anchoring for the ac obtained from calophyllum inophyllum while for ac obtained from manihot esculenta the removal mechanism is multi molecular the experimental and theoretical analysis showed that the activated carbon obtained from manihot esculenta has a better adsorption performance compared to the other tested adsorbent and this result can be associated to its higher specific surface area finally adsorption resulted to be related to physical forces in which the energy associated with the first layer is greater than the figure retrieved for the second layer the process is spontaneous and the increase in the internal energy testifies that as long as adsorption capacity increases new and more energetic active sites are involved in the adsorption process declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial interests acknowledgment this work was financially supported

12451,the sonochemical degradation of acesulfame ace a widely used artificial sweetener was investigated the impact of power density 40 and 71 w l initial ace concentration 1 5 30 6 μμ and initial solution ph 3 9 for the elimination of the target pollutant from water was studied it was found that nearly complete degradation of ace was achieved within 120 min of treatment under conditions suitable for high production of free radicals degradation follows a pseudo first order kinetic model coupling sonochemical degradation at optimal conditions with sodium persulfate 0 2 1 0 mm enhanced the rate of ace oxidation by six times the influence of water complexity was also examined the natural occurrence of humic acid in the water matrix reduced the degradation rate despite the fact that at least 42 of ace removal was achieved finally lc qtof ms was used to evaluate the generated transformation products tps using hrms suspect and non target screening seven ace tps were identified and their time trend formation profiles showed a rising trend throughout the experiment according to the ecosar model most of the identified transformation products exhibited lower toxicity than acesulfame with one notable exception that was classified as harmful due to its acute toxicity on fish and green algae graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords acesulfame sonochemical persulfate toxicity degradation pathways data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction artificial sweeteners ass are synthetically produced ingredients that are commonly used as low or no calorie additives in products such as non alcoholic dietary beverages chewing gums dairy and cereals as well as in a variety of pharmaceutical formulations toothpaste mouthwashes and animal feed 1 3 ass have recently been classified as contaminants of emerging concern due to their environmental endurance and widespread occurrence in the aquatic environment 2 4 5 acesulfame ace was produced in 1973 and is currently among the most widely used sugar substitutes 6 due to its low cost and sweetness which exceeds that of sugar by approximately 200 times ace is commonly consumed by people 6800 metric tons 3 6 despite ass fast market placement and mass production so far there are a small number of data concerning their environmental fate in principle ass are only partially absorbed by the human body and following their disposal by urine and feces they reach sewage treatment plants through the sewage system the removal efficiency of ass is different for each target compound for instance acesulfame is not degraded and passes the treatment processes unchanged 7 11 for this reason acesulfame in municipal wastewater has been detected at concentrations of tens of μg l in surface water and some μg l in groundwater 6 9 11 13 despite the fact that studies on the toxicity of ace on human health and aquatic species are not currently being conducted regularly detrimental effects have been reported 5 11 14 15 given the in situ formation of unselective and very active oxygen species advanced oxidation processes aops are considered optimal for the elimination of a wide range of micropollutants in environmental matrices 16 18 in particular the use of ultrasound for degrading hazardous contaminants in water has received significant attention from researchers given its distinct advantages such as operational ease security fast reaction time and overall ecological qualities 18 the removal of micropollutants after ultrasound irradiation is based on the phenomenon of acoustic cavitation the removal of pollutants can be achieved by various mechanisms such as pyrolysis inside the cavities that grow and explode due to acoustic pressure reactions with active oxidizing species released into the bulk of the solution pyrolysis and oxidation by active oxidizing species at the bubble water interface 19 another interesting strategy frequently used to augment the effectiveness of both acoustic and hydrodynamic cavitation involves the addition of oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide or sodium persulfate 20 the latter can also be activated by the elevated temperature and pressure inside or in proximity to the interface of the formed cavities producing additional reactive species such as sulfate radicals 21 many target chemicals have been successfully eliminated using ultrasound including pharmaceutical compounds endocrine disrupting chemicals perfluorinated compounds azo dyes pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and surfactants 22 27 interestingly and to the best of the authors knowledge there are no research articles addressing the sonochemical degradation of ace in the aqueous phase thus the key aims of this work are i to evaluate the effect of acoustic intensity initial ace concentration solution ph water matrix constituents such as inorganic anions organic matter and sodium persulfate sps on the efficient degradation of ace and ii to identify the produced transformation products using high resolution mass spectrometry and suggest a reaction pathway finally to assess the applicability of the sonochemical process within the water treatment framework ace degradation was also examined in real wastewater effluent 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and samples ace c4h5no4s 99 purity was purchased from sigma aldrich other

obtained from sigma aldrich all solvents used for the sample preparation and the lc qtof ms analysis were uplc ms grade methanol meoh and acetonitrile acn were purchased from merck darmstadt germany ammonium acetate formic acid and ammonium formate 99 additives for mobile phase were obtained from fluka buchs switzerland distilled water was provided by a milli q purification apparatus millipore direct q uv bedford ma usa all sonochemical degradation experiments were conducted in ultrapure water unless stated otherwise the real effluent ww was obtained from university of patras wastewater treatment plant while commercially available mineral water bw was purchased from a market in patras greece details of ww ad bw are given in supplementary information table s1 all samples were stored at 4 c 2 2 reaction system ultrasound experiments were carried out using a 20 khz ultrasound generator branson 450 where irradiation was transmitted through a 13 mm in diameter titanium horn sonolysis was carried out in a cylindrical 300 ml doubled wall pyrex vessel containing 200 ml of ace solution at various initial concentrations in the range 1 5 30 6 μμ using calorimetry the actual power density inside the sonoreactor was measured at 40 and 71 w l 28 a water circulator kept the temperature constant at 20 0 5 c throughout the reaction and all experiments were conducted in an aerated atmosphere samples were periodically collected from the vessel during the experimental run filtered with a 0 22 μm pvdf syringe filter purchased from whatman and analyzed immediately 2 3 analytical procedures a waters alliance 2695 liquid chromatography system coupled to a waters 2996 photodiode array detector pda was used for quantitative analysis of ace in process samples the separation of the compound was achieved by a kinetex c18 column 3 150mm 2 6μm purchased from phenomenex usa isocratic elution with acetonitrile and phosphoric acid 85 15 v v as the mobile phase was used the flow rate the sample s injection and the detection wavelength for the target compound was 0 2ml min 100μl and 226nm respectively for the identification of transformation products tps the initial ace concentration was set at 30 6 μμ to facilitate the identification process and the treated samples were analyzed by ultra high performance liquid chromatography uhplc dionex ultimate 3000 rslc thermo fisher scientific tandem with a bruker qtof mass spectrometer maxis impact bruker daltonics 29 30 lc hrms analyses were conducted in both reversed phase rplc and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography hilic about screening of the candidate tps of acesulfame suspect and non target screening workflows were established which have already been described in previous studies 31 more information regarding the lc hrms system and data processing procedures used in this work are described in detail in the supplementary information si si 2 and si 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of operating conditions the influence of power density on the degradation of 3 μm ace was examined and the results are shown in fig 1 as seen increasing power density from 40 to 71 w l results in a substantial increase in ace removal efficiency from 35 to 85 after 120 min of treatment the increase in power levels positively impacts conversion efficiency and this is attributed to the amplified cavitational activity higher power levels lead to more intense conditions inside the cavities and the liquid interface shell resulting in an elevated number of cavities and increased degradation levels this is consistent with a 4 3 fold increase in rate constant also shown in fig 1 which has been computed assuming that ace degradation follows a pseudo first order kinetic model several other studies have reported a positive association linking reaction rates and us power for the sonolysis of endocrine disruptors 32 perfluorinated compounds 23 pesticides 33 pharmaceuticals 34 and dyes 35 experiments were carried out at 71 w l and ph0 6 to investigate the effect of changing the initial ace concentration between 1 5 and 6 μm on its degradation rate the results are shown in fig 2 as anticipated the experimental results fit well with the pseudo first order kinetic model 36 1 d ace dt k app ace where kapp denotes the apparent kinetic constant at the lower initial concentration of 1 5 μm a significant reduction of ace approximately 60 was achieved after only 30 min of treatment in contrast at initial concentrations of 3 0 and 6 μm the corresponding percentages of ace reduction were 50 and 40 this is demonstrated more clearly in the inset of fig 2 where the computed rate constants decline nearly linearly from 0 0213 to 0 0114 min 1 as the initial concentration increases from 1 5 to 6 μm it is a commonly observed phenomenon across many aops and is usually due to the availability and concentration of reactive species relative to the concentration of the target and non target organics and oxidizable inorganics subsequent experiments were carried out with 3 μm ace at 71 w l and different initial ph including acidic ph 3 alkaline ph 9 and inherent ph 6 values the respective rate constants were computed equal to 0 0181 0 0068 and 0 016 min 1 i e the rate decreases with increasing solution s ph value it should be noted that the solution ph was adjusted but not buffered to its initial value in this respect the ph value of the acidic solution remained constant at 3 throughout the reaction while the ph value of the alkaline solution slightly decreased from 9 to 7 5 after 60 min of reaction finally a slight decrease in ph from 6 to 5 4 after 60 min of reaction was recorded at inherent conditions at ph 3 ace is primarily found in its molecular form consistent with the pka value of ace 37 while at ph values 6 ace predominantly exists in its ionic form the increased degradation at acidic conditions is attributed to an increase in the flux of the more hydrophobic ace molecule toward the bubble liquid interface where there is a higher concentration of hydroxyl radicals in contrast at ph values above the pka the more hydrophilic ionic state predominates and reactions are more likely to take place in the liquid bulk the concentration of hydroxyl radicals is lower in the bulk solution since only a small number of them are released into the bulk solution during cavitation 38 39 3 2 influence of water matrix given the non selective nature of reactive species the water matrix which consists of organic and inorganic substances can impact the rate of degradation of the selected contaminants as a result the need to investigate their influence before going to the real system is emphasized in line with this experiments were carried out with differing quantities of common ions chloride bicarbonate and humic acid as a model of natural organic matter specifically ultrapure water upw was spiked with varying initial concentrations of the aforementioned constituents prior to sonication at 71 w l and the results are presented in table 1 the presence of chloride in the range 50 250 mg l 1 was found to slightly increase the rate constant whereas the opposite effect was observed at 500 mg l 1 the existence of carbonate at 250 mg l 1 had a considerably positive effect implying that carbonate radicals may react effectively with ace again increased bicarbonate concentrations had a detrimental impact possibly leading to an increase in the formation of radicals with lower reactivity hence secondary radicals i e carbonate radicals produced from bicarbonate or chloride radicals derived from chlorides may exhibit varying levels of oxidizing ability and selectivity toward the target molecules in actual and more complex systems it is difficult to predict the exact impact of this type of interference between the primary reactive species i e usually hydroxyl radicals and non target ions ιn accordance with the use of various aops mentioned in the literature the presence of inorganic ions can have a diverse range of effects on the sonodegradation of various contaminants 40 42 the negative effect of ha at 10 mg l 1 on ace degradation is demonstrated in table 1 thus confirming the unfavorable interaction between the reactive species and non target organic compounds to determine whether environmentally relevant matrices act as oh scavengers additional experiments were conducted in bottled water bw and secondary treated wastewater ww and the results are presented in fig 3 as seen degradation in bw is practically comparable to that in upw both in terms of 120 min conversion and reaction rate conversely the wastewater matrix affected considerably ace degradation leading to a 4 fold reduction in the rate constant this observed retardation is also consistent with the results obtained from the experiment conducted in upw spiked with ha this decrease is associated with two factors i the antagonistic influence of organic compounds and anions on the available reactive species for contaminants and ii the alkaline character of the wastewater matrix which also affects degradation 3 3 influence of persulfate salt to assess the effect of adding sps 0 2 1 0 mm on 3 μμ ace degradation a set of experiments were carried out and the findings are shown in fig 4 as seen the presence of sps enhances ace removal which highlights the contribution of so 4 and ηο in the combined process us sps owing to the activating impact of ultrasound on sps eq 2 the generation of sο4 increases rapidly and a sequence of reactions eqs 3 5 occur to form several reactive radicals 43 44 2 s 2 o 8 2 2 so 4 3 so 4 oh so 4 2 hο 4 s 2 o 8 2 2 h 2 o 2 so 4 2 ho 2 3 h 5 s 2 o 8 2 ho 2 so 4 2 so 4 h o 2 in general sο4 and ηο are regarded as the main radicals in the us sps system a recent review paper by yang et al 40 summarizes the contribution of sps to the sonochemical degradation of various organic pollutants furthermore numerous studies have already demonstrated the feasibility of activating persulfate salts for the destruction of pollutants using acoustic or hydrodynamic cavitation 43 45 given the complex nature of organic compounds and the different mechanisms involved in the combined process radicals alone cannot explain the degradation pathways occurring in the us sps system degradation intermediates and mechanisms must be identified to unravel the degradation processes reaction pathways and key mechanisms may reasonably be proposed based on the degradation intermediates in addition organic compounds molecular structure and functional groups have a considerable impact on the reaction processes in the us sps system 44 the influence of sps concentration is particularly prominent during the preliminary phases of the oxidation i e when concentration rises from 0 2 to 0 4 mm the 10 min conversion is doubled furthermore sps at 0 2 mm eliminates ace after only 60 min of sonolysis past this concentration level i e at 1 0 mm no effect on ace degradation occurs these findings suggest that at higher concentrations the effectiveness of sps enhancement decreases possibly due to self scavenging reactions it is worth noting that the ratio of sps to ace acetaminophen fell within the range of 66 6 to 333 3 additionally the ratio of sps to the stoichiometric amount of sps required varied from 5 5 to 27 8 a control experiment with simply sps and the target compound resulted in a minimal reduction of ace 20 see fig 5 a commonly employed method in the literature to emphasize the potential synergy between ultrasound and persulfate is through the estimation of the synergetic factor 46 or extent of synergy s 31 6 s k us ps k us k ps in this equation kus ps kus and kps represent the observed kinetic constants for the combined process of sonolysis and persulfate respectively by substituting the data from fig 5 into eq 10 the value of s was determined to be 5 92 the observed result is in agreement with the work of ioannidi et al 31 who estimated a synergy ratio s equal to 3 22 between thermally activated persulfate and ultrasound irradiation for the destruction of the pharmaceutical losartan 31 3 4 influence of radical scavengers the efficacy of radicals and other reactive species to degrade ace in the presence of scavengers was also examined experiments were conducted with 10 mm of either tba in the us system or meoh in the us sps system tba was selected since it is frequently employed for trapping hydroxyl radicals k tba ηο 6 108 m 1 s 1 47 48 meoh is an effective quencher for both sο4 and ηο k meoh ηο 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 k meoh so₄ 1 1 107 m 1 s 1 47 48 fig 5 demonstrates ace degradation with either alcohol in different systems results verify that hydroxyl radicals are the main reactive species for the sonochemical degradation of ace since tba completely inhibits its decomposition in the us system similarly the significant contribution of sulfate radicals in the applied us sps system is clearly indicated since meoh also hinders degradation 3 5 transformation products and possible reaction pathways seven tps of ace were detected by rplc and hilic hrms analysis they were all detected through negative ionization mode analysis on the other hand no additional tps were detected utilizing the positive ionization mode six tps were detected and structurally elucidated following the suspect screening workflow non target screening analysis revealed the presence of an additional tp the proposed structures of the detected tps as well as the potential formation tree are presented in fig 6 the ms ms spectra of the detected tps are presented in fig s1 the transformation product ace 168 was formed after oxidation and hydrolysis of the parent compound acesulfame ace 168 having a molecular mass of c2h3no6s was detected in negative ionization mode as m h ion 167 9608 m z it eluted at 1 1 min using the rplc system and its concentration increased gradually over time reaching its maximum value at the end of the 11 h long experiment as can be seen in fig 7 since an analytical standard was not available for the structure verification of this tp a thorough investigation of ms and ms ms spectra was performed for its tentative identification the characteristic fragments with m z 95 9761 and 79 9574 in its ms ms spectrum were used to deduce the structure elucidation of this tp it has been previously reported in the literature as a transformation product of acesulfame in several studies 49 51 the detection of common fragments in the experimental ms ms spectrum of this study and reports in the literature increase the level of identification confidence furthermore ace 168 was also detected with lower intensity using hilic in negative ionization mode the presence as well as the reverse elution order of the chromatographic peak in hilic with retention time 7 8 min compared to rplc were also considered as additional evidence for identification three additional tps ace 96 ace 170 and ace 152 have also been detected the ace 96 with a molecular mass of h2no3s was detected through suspect screening in the hrms data as m h ion 95 9761 m z ace 96 has already been reported in the literature 6 7 and there is a fragmentation pattern match supporting the proposed structure ace 96 is produced after hydrolysis of the transformation product ace 168 the transformation product ace 170 was detected using rplc as m h ion 169 9754 m z and its formation is suggested to occur after hydrolysis and oxidation of ace the ace 170 proposed structure contains no ring considering the calculated number of rings and double bonds value proposed by dataanalysis software equal to 3 and the three double bonds with the oxygen molecules that remained intact during sonochemical oxidation additionally ace 170 proposed structure is further supported by the elucidation of its fragment ions in the ms ms spectrum as follows m z 151 9659 c2h2no5s 123 9710 ch2no4s 95 9761 h2no3s and 72 0093 c2h2no2 these characteristic fragments of ace 170 have also been reported in previous studies 49 52 therefore a molecular mass of c2h4no6s was assigned to ace 170 through rplc analysis in negative ionization mode a chromatographic peak eluted at 1 2 min was detected corresponding to the pseudo molecular ion of ace 152 c2h2no5s the ace 152 had an increasing trend of formation and reached its maximum concentration at the final stage of the experiment fig 7 due to its low intensity acquiring specific information regarding the fragmentation behavior e g characteristic pattern fragmentation or diagnostic ions in the ms and ms ms spectra was not feasible the formation of ace 152 seems to be triggered after the oxidative cleavage of ace 170 and the loss of 18 da indicating a loss of water moiety h2o as has also been reported in the literature 52 furthermore ace 183 with a molecular mass of c3h7no6s was also detected through suspect screening in negative ionization mode as 183 9925 m z using the rplc system this compound has already been identified as ace tp 52 and its identification was based only on ms information since the low intensity of the precursor ion did not allow the acquisition of the fragmentation spectrum for further evaluation further oxidative cleavage ch3oh loss of this tp leads to the generation of the transformation product ace 152 finally the transformation product ace 178 was detected resulting from the hydroxylation of ace 52 with a molecular mass of c4h5no5s its identification relied on ms data evaluation since ms ms spectrum could not be recorded due to the low intensity of the respective precursor ion this tp was detected only using hilic in negative mode as m h ion underlying the added value of using complementary chromatographic techniques for a holistic strategy in tps identification a non target approach was also implemented to further investigate the transformation of ace during sonochemical oxidation experiments and identify new tps that have not been reported in relevant published studies and thus were not included in the suspect list the initial step was to subtract the zero time sample s total ion chromatographic signal from that of the treated samples 31 an additional chromatographic peak was detected through non target screening the unknown tp of acesulfame ace 358 was detected with precursor ion 358 9106 m z and retention time at 1 1 min in negative ionization mode of rplc analysis the investigation of its ms ms spectra revealed the presence of common fragments with the tps reported through suspect screening e g 123 9710 m z 95 9761 m z supporting that ace 358 is also a tp of acesulfame however an unequivocal molecular formula could not be assigned to this transformation product to enhance the level of identification confidence the time trend profiles of ace and its tps during sonodegradation obtained through rplc esi qtof are presented in fig 7 the chromatographic peak areas were used for creating the graph due to the absence of reference standards of the tps for calculating their concentrations ace 96 and ace 170 were the most abundant while all detected tps of acesulfame reached the maximum of their abundance at the final time point 11h 3 6 toxicity assessment of tps by ecosar for assessing ecotoxicity in different indicators in the literature often computational models are employed that correlate biological activity with the structural properties of chemical compounds quantitative structure activity relationship qsar models in this context the ecosar model provided by the epa was utilized to estimate the acute and chronic toxicity of ace and the intermediates resulting from its degradation these estimations are specific to fish green algae and daphnids and the results are presented in table 2 toxicity is typically classified on a scale harmful 10 100 mg l 1 toxic 1 10 mg l 1 and very toxic 1 mg l 1 acesulfame appears to exhibit minimal toxicity both for immediate and chronic exposure in agreement with previous studies 53 upon reviewing table 2 it s clear that most intermediates resulting from ace degradation present lower toxicity the exceptions which exhibit higher toxicity are marked in italics however ace 178 is an outlier appearing to be far more toxic than both ace and the rest of the byproducts indicatively the lc50 96 h is 84 6 mg l 1 for fish and 23 6 mg l 1 for green algae in comparison the corresponding values for ace are 132 000 mg l 1 and 11 500 mg l 1 respectively therefore monitoring this specific by product is considered crucial for toxicity studies as it is classified as harmful nonetheless it s important to note that these results were confined to the assessment of individual compounds toxicity overlooking potential synergistic effects of mixtures 3 7 ace degradation by different technologies the current study is not intended to make direct comparisons with other existing technologies it is acknowledged that a comprehensive comparison under real world representative conditions preferably in pilot scale reactors would provide more relevant insights however the findings from this study still hold considerable value in providing a first approximation regarding the efficiency of sonolysis compared to other processes as noted in the introduction ace is considered resistant to environmental conditions indeed gan et al 49 examined the photolysis of ace by solar irradiation in sterilized and unsterilized aqueous solutions the researchers observed that the photolysis of ace in a quartz tube under natural solar irradiation was insignificant 8 after three weeks in sterilized water at ph 7 9 the photolysis was slow 7 or negligible after approximately 21 d of irradiation in sterilized distilled water at neutral and alkaline ph values 7 8 and 9 while photolysis increased at acidic ph 4 with an estimated half life of almost 20 d scheurer et al 54 conducted a study on the uvc photolytic degradation of ace in aqueous solutions including environmentally relevant matrices and various experimental setups for ace ranging from 1 μg l to 10 mg l 1 approximately 90 removal was recorded after 5 min in the uv circular flow reactor corresponding to a fluence of approximately 6000 j m2 other experiments were conducted using three different samples of surface water with ace ranging from 0 34 to 1 5 μg l at a fluence of 8000 j m2 a reduction between 19 and 28 was observed additionally the researchers reported that uvc irradiation of 10 μg l ace spiked tap water from the city of karlsruhe and swiss waterworks resulted in decreased ace concentrations by 34 and 37 respectively yin et al 14 demonstrated that 100 μm of mn vii decomposed between 50 and 80 of 10 μm ace from different water matrices in 90 min li et al 50 examined the chlorination of ace according to the researchers the destruction of ace followed pseudo first order kinetics while the role of ph was crucial although the half life of 20 mg l 1 of ace was only 2 min at acidic ph it increased to 35 min at ph 6 5 99 min at ph 7 5 and 693 min at ph 9 4 at the same time the researchers identified several known and regulated disinfection by products in chlorinated solutions chow et al 52 investigated ozone and the peroxone process for ace destruction the addition of 6 mg l 1 hydrogen peroxide significantly enhanced ace removal in wastewater from 54 7 to 74 8 after 30 min of treatment with 1 5 mg min ozone interestingly the combined system could eliminate ace in 2 min in ultrapure water the study highlighted the crucial role of the water matrix table 3 summarizes the efficiency of the technologies in actual water matrices although the use of ultrasound suffers from some disadvantages such as large energy requirements and problems in size scaling it seems that the removal of micropollutants is not far from that found in much more mature and optimized processes at the same time the possibility of the process to perform without the addition of chemicals is an additional advantage 4 conclusions the findings of this study reveal that low frequency ultrasound at 71 w l is capable of almost completely degrading ace the removal of 3 μμ ace i e an environmentally realistic concentration follows pseudo first order kinetics and degradation mainly occurs through hydroxyl radicals the addition of an oxidant reagent sps enhances the treatment due to the substantial effect of sulfate radicals as evidenced by trapping experiments interestingly the sonochemical removal of the targeted artificial sweetener is only partially inhibited by the complexity of the water matrix these findings highlight that ultrasound has a strong potential for removing micropollutants from aqueous systems and this should be further explored in future studies regarding the generated tps during the process seven tps of ace have been detected following suspect and non target screening hrms workflows after complementary analysis by both rplc and hilic qtof ms most tps are structurally elucidated possible reaction pathways are proposed and the time trend profiles of tps reveal their persistence during sonochemical treatment as their abundance increases over reaction time this pinpoints the need to extend studies to include the sonodegradation of such compounds in terms of removal efficiency and ecotoxicological impact according to ecosar model most of the identified transformation products exhibited lower toxicity than ace with the notable exception of ace 170 this particular by product demonstrated greater toxicity than the precursor compound necessitating

12451,the sonochemical degradation of acesulfame ace a widely used artificial sweetener was investigated the impact of power density 40 and 71 w l initial ace concentration 1 5 30 6 μμ and initial solution ph 3 9 for the elimination of the target pollutant from water was studied it was found that nearly complete degradation of ace was achieved within 120 min of treatment under conditions suitable for high production of free radicals degradation follows a pseudo first order kinetic model coupling sonochemical degradation at optimal conditions with sodium persulfate 0 2 1 0 mm enhanced the rate of ace oxidation by six times the influence of water complexity was also examined the natural occurrence of humic acid in the water matrix reduced the degradation rate despite the fact that at least 42 of ace removal was achieved finally lc qtof ms was used to evaluate the generated transformation products tps using hrms suspect and non target screening seven ace tps were identified and their time trend formation profiles showed a rising trend throughout the experiment according to the ecosar model most of the identified transformation products exhibited lower toxicity than acesulfame with one notable exception that was classified as harmful due to its acute toxicity on fish and green algae graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords acesulfame sonochemical persulfate toxicity degradation pathways data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction artificial sweeteners ass are synthetically produced ingredients that are commonly used as low or no calorie additives in products such as non alcoholic dietary beverages chewing gums dairy and cereals as well as in a variety of pharmaceutical formulations toothpaste mouthwashes and animal feed 1 3 ass have recently been classified as contaminants of emerging concern due to their environmental endurance and widespread occurrence in the aquatic environment 2 4 5 acesulfame ace was produced in 1973 and is currently among the most widely used sugar substitutes 6 due to its low cost and sweetness which exceeds that of sugar by approximately 200 times ace is commonly consumed by people 6800 metric tons 3 6 despite ass fast market placement and mass production so far there are a small number of data concerning their environmental fate in principle ass are only partially absorbed by the human body and following their disposal by urine and feces they reach sewage treatment plants through the sewage system the removal efficiency of ass is different for each target compound for instance acesulfame is not degraded and passes the treatment processes unchanged 7 11 for this reason acesulfame in municipal wastewater has been detected at concentrations of tens of μg l in surface water and some μg l in groundwater 6 9 11 13 despite the fact that studies on the toxicity of ace on human health and aquatic species are not currently being conducted regularly detrimental effects have been reported 5 11 14 15 given the in situ formation of unselective and very active oxygen species advanced oxidation processes aops are considered optimal for the elimination of a wide range of micropollutants in environmental matrices 16 18 in particular the use of ultrasound for degrading hazardous contaminants in water has received significant attention from researchers given its distinct advantages such as operational ease security fast reaction time and overall ecological qualities 18 the removal of micropollutants after ultrasound irradiation is based on the phenomenon of acoustic cavitation the removal of pollutants can be achieved by various mechanisms such as pyrolysis inside the cavities that grow and explode due to acoustic pressure reactions with active oxidizing species released into the bulk of the solution pyrolysis and oxidation by active oxidizing species at the bubble water interface 19 another interesting strategy frequently used to augment the effectiveness of both acoustic and hydrodynamic cavitation involves the addition of oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide or sodium persulfate 20 the latter can also be activated by the elevated temperature and pressure inside or in proximity to the interface of the formed cavities producing additional reactive species such as sulfate radicals 21 many target chemicals have been successfully eliminated using ultrasound including pharmaceutical compounds endocrine disrupting chemicals perfluorinated compounds azo dyes pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and surfactants 22 27 interestingly and to the best of the authors knowledge there are no research articles addressing the sonochemical degradation of ace in the aqueous phase thus the key aims of this work are i to evaluate the effect of acoustic intensity initial ace concentration solution ph water matrix constituents such as inorganic anions organic matter and sodium persulfate sps on the efficient degradation of ace and ii to identify the produced transformation products using high resolution mass spectrometry and suggest a reaction pathway finally to assess the applicability of the sonochemical process within the water treatment framework ace degradation was also examined in real wastewater effluent 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and samples ace c4h5no4s 99 purity was purchased from sigma aldrich other chemicals such as sodium persulfate sps na2s2o8 sodium bicarbonate nahco₃ sodium chloride nacl sodium hydroxide naoh sulfuric acid h₂so₄ humic acid ha and tert butanol tba were also of high purity and obtained from sigma aldrich all solvents used for the sample preparation and the lc qtof ms analysis were uplc ms grade methanol meoh and acetonitrile acn were purchased from merck darmstadt germany ammonium acetate formic acid and ammonium formate 99 additives for mobile phase were obtained from fluka buchs switzerland distilled water was provided by a milli q purification apparatus millipore direct q uv bedford ma usa all sonochemical degradation experiments were conducted in ultrapure water unless stated otherwise the real effluent ww was obtained from university of patras wastewater treatment plant while commercially available mineral water bw was purchased from a market in patras greece details of ww ad bw are given in supplementary information table s1 all samples were stored at 4 c 2 2 reaction system ultrasound experiments were carried out using a 20 khz ultrasound generator branson 450 where irradiation was transmitted through a 13 mm in diameter titanium horn sonolysis was carried out in a cylindrical 300 ml doubled wall pyrex vessel containing 200 ml of ace solution at various initial concentrations in the range 1 5 30 6 μμ using calorimetry the actual power density inside the sonoreactor was measured at 40 and 71 w l 28 a water circulator kept the temperature constant at 20 0 5 c throughout the reaction and all experiments were conducted in an aerated atmosphere samples were periodically collected from the vessel during the experimental run filtered with a 0 22 μm pvdf syringe filter purchased from whatman and analyzed immediately 2 3 analytical procedures a waters alliance 2695 liquid chromatography system coupled to a waters 2996 photodiode array detector pda was used for quantitative analysis of ace in process samples the separation of the compound was achieved by a kinetex c18 column 3 150mm 2 6μm purchased from phenomenex usa isocratic elution with acetonitrile and phosphoric acid 85 15 v v as the mobile phase was used the flow rate the sample s injection and the detection wavelength for the target compound was 0 2ml min 100μl and 226nm respectively for the identification of transformation products tps the initial ace concentration was set at 30 6 μμ to facilitate the identification process and the treated samples were analyzed by ultra high performance liquid chromatography uhplc dionex ultimate 3000 rslc thermo fisher scientific tandem with a bruker qtof mass spectrometer maxis impact bruker daltonics 29 30 lc hrms analyses were conducted in both reversed phase rplc and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography hilic about screening of the candidate tps of acesulfame suspect and non target screening workflows were established which have already been described in previous studies 31 more information regarding the lc hrms system and data processing procedures used in this work are described in detail in the supplementary information si si 2 and si 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of operating conditions the influence of power density on the degradation of 3 μm ace was examined and the results are shown in fig 1 as seen increasing power density from 40 to 71 w l results in a substantial increase in ace removal efficiency from 35 to 85 after 120 min of treatment the increase in power levels positively impacts conversion efficiency and this is attributed to the amplified cavitational activity higher power levels lead to more intense conditions inside the cavities and the liquid interface shell resulting in an elevated number of cavities and increased degradation levels this is consistent with a 4 3 fold increase in rate constant also shown in fig 1 which has been computed assuming that ace degradation follows a pseudo first order kinetic model several other studies have reported a positive association linking reaction rates and us power for the sonolysis of endocrine disruptors 32 perfluorinated compounds 23 pesticides 33 pharmaceuticals 34 and dyes 35 experiments were carried out at 71 w l and ph0 6 to investigate the effect of changing the initial ace concentration between 1 5 and 6 μm on its degradation rate the results are shown in fig 2 as anticipated the experimental results fit well with the pseudo first order kinetic model 36 1 d ace dt k app ace where kapp denotes the apparent kinetic constant at the lower initial concentration of 1 5 μm a significant reduction of ace approximately 60 was achieved after only 30 min of treatment in contrast at initial concentrations of 3 0 and 6 μm the corresponding percentages of ace reduction were 50 and 40 this is demonstrated more clearly in the inset of fig 2 where the computed rate constants decline nearly linearly from 0 0213 to 0 0114 min 1 as the initial concentration increases from 1 5 to 6 μm it is a commonly observed phenomenon across many aops and is usually due to the availability and concentration of reactive species relative to the concentration of the target and non target organics and oxidizable inorganics subsequent experiments were carried out with 3 μm ace at 71 w l and different initial ph including acidic ph 3 alkaline ph 9 and inherent ph 6 values the respective rate constants were computed equal to 0 0181 0 0068 and 0 016 min 1 i e the rate decreases with increasing solution s ph value it should be noted that the solution ph was adjusted but not buffered to its initial value in this respect the ph value of the acidic solution remained constant at 3 throughout the reaction while the ph value of the alkaline solution slightly decreased from 9 to 7 5 after 60 min of reaction finally a slight decrease in ph from 6 to 5 4 after 60 min of reaction was recorded at inherent conditions at ph 3 ace is primarily found in its molecular form consistent with the pka value of ace 37 while at ph values 6 ace predominantly exists in its ionic form the increased degradation at acidic conditions is attributed to an increase in the flux of the more hydrophobic ace molecule toward the bubble liquid interface where there is a higher concentration of hydroxyl radicals in contrast at ph values above the pka the more hydrophilic ionic state predominates and reactions are more likely to take place in the liquid bulk the concentration of hydroxyl radicals is lower in the bulk solution since only a small number of them are released into the bulk solution during cavitation 38 39 3 2 influence of water matrix given the non selective nature of reactive species the water matrix which consists of organic and inorganic substances can impact the rate of degradation of the selected contaminants as a result the need to investigate their influence before going to the real system is emphasized in line with this experiments were carried out with differing quantities of common ions chloride bicarbonate and humic acid as a model of natural organic matter specifically ultrapure water upw was spiked with varying initial concentrations of the aforementioned constituents prior to sonication at 71 w l and the results are presented in table 1 the presence of chloride in the range 50 250 mg l 1 was found to slightly increase the rate constant whereas the opposite effect was observed at 500 mg l 1 the existence of carbonate at 250 mg l 1 had a considerably positive effect implying that carbonate radicals may react effectively with ace again increased bicarbonate concentrations had a detrimental impact possibly leading to an increase in the formation of radicals with lower reactivity hence secondary radicals i e carbonate radicals produced from bicarbonate or chloride radicals derived from chlorides may exhibit varying levels of oxidizing ability and selectivity toward the target molecules in actual and more complex systems it is difficult to predict the exact impact of this type of interference between the primary reactive species i e usually hydroxyl radicals and non target ions ιn accordance with the use of various aops mentioned in the literature the presence of inorganic ions can have a diverse range of effects on the sonodegradation of various contaminants 40 42 the negative effect of ha at 10 mg l 1 on ace degradation is demonstrated in table 1 thus confirming the unfavorable interaction between the reactive species and non target organic compounds to determine whether environmentally relevant matrices act as oh scavengers additional experiments were conducted in bottled water bw and secondary treated wastewater ww and the results are presented in fig 3 as seen degradation in bw is practically comparable to that in upw both in terms of 120 min conversion and reaction rate conversely the wastewater matrix affected considerably ace degradation leading to a 4 fold reduction in the rate constant this observed retardation is also consistent with the results obtained from the experiment conducted in upw spiked with ha this decrease is associated with two factors i the antagonistic influence of organic compounds and anions on the available reactive species for contaminants and ii the alkaline character of the wastewater matrix which also affects degradation 3 3 influence of persulfate salt to assess the effect of adding sps 0 2 1 0 mm on 3 μμ ace degradation a set of experiments were carried out and the findings are shown in fig 4 as seen the presence of sps enhances ace removal which highlights the contribution of so 4 and ηο in the combined process us sps owing to the activating impact of ultrasound on sps eq 2 the generation of sο4 increases rapidly and a sequence of reactions eqs 3 5 occur to form several reactive radicals 43 44 2 s 2 o 8 2 2 so 4 3 so 4 oh so 4 2 hο 4 s 2 o 8 2 2 h 2 o 2 so 4 2 ho 2 3 h 5 s 2 o 8 2 ho 2 so 4 2 so 4 h o 2 in general sο4 and ηο are regarded as the main radicals in the us sps system a recent review paper by yang et al 40 summarizes the contribution of sps to the sonochemical degradation of various organic pollutants furthermore numerous studies have already demonstrated the feasibility of activating persulfate salts for the destruction of pollutants using acoustic or hydrodynamic cavitation 43 45 given the complex nature of organic compounds and the different mechanisms involved in the combined process radicals alone cannot explain the degradation pathways occurring in the us sps system degradation intermediates and mechanisms must be identified to unravel the degradation processes reaction pathways and key mechanisms may reasonably be proposed based on the degradation intermediates in addition organic compounds molecular structure and functional groups have a considerable impact on the reaction processes in the us sps system 44 the influence of sps concentration is particularly prominent during the preliminary phases of the oxidation i e when concentration rises from 0 2 to 0 4 mm the 10 min conversion is doubled furthermore sps at 0 2 mm eliminates ace after only 60 min of sonolysis past this concentration level i e at 1 0 mm no effect on ace degradation occurs these findings suggest that at higher concentrations the effectiveness of sps enhancement decreases possibly due to self scavenging reactions it is worth noting that the ratio of sps to ace acetaminophen fell within the range of 66 6 to 333 3 additionally the ratio of sps to the stoichiometric amount of sps required varied from 5 5 to 27 8 a control experiment with simply sps and the target compound resulted in a minimal reduction of ace 20 see fig 5 a commonly employed method in the literature to emphasize the potential synergy between ultrasound and persulfate is through the estimation of the synergetic factor 46 or extent of synergy s 31 6 s k us ps k us k ps in this equation kus ps kus and kps represent the observed kinetic constants for the combined process of sonolysis and persulfate respectively by substituting the data from fig 5 into eq 10 the value of s was determined to be 5 92 the observed result is in agreement with the work of ioannidi et al 31 who estimated a synergy ratio s equal to 3 22 between thermally activated persulfate and ultrasound irradiation for the destruction of the pharmaceutical losartan 31 3 4 influence of radical scavengers the efficacy of radicals and other reactive species to degrade ace in the presence of scavengers was also examined experiments were conducted with 10 mm of either tba in the us system or meoh in the us sps system tba was selected since it is frequently employed for trapping hydroxyl radicals k tba ηο 6 108 m 1 s 1 47 48 meoh is an effective quencher for both sο4 and ηο k meoh ηο 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 k meoh so₄ 1 1 107 m 1 s 1 47 48 fig 5 demonstrates ace degradation with either alcohol in different systems results verify that hydroxyl radicals are the main reactive species for the sonochemical degradation of ace since tba completely inhibits its decomposition in the us system similarly the significant contribution of sulfate radicals in the applied us sps system is clearly indicated since meoh also hinders degradation 3 5 transformation products and possible reaction pathways seven tps of ace were detected by rplc and hilic hrms analysis they were all detected through negative ionization mode analysis on the other hand no additional tps were detected utilizing the positive ionization mode six tps were detected and structurally elucidated following the suspect screening workflow non target screening analysis revealed the presence of an additional tp the proposed structures of the detected tps as well as the potential formation tree are presented in fig 6 the ms ms spectra of the detected tps are presented in fig s1 the transformation product ace 168 was formed after oxidation and hydrolysis of the parent compound acesulfame ace 168 having a molecular mass of c2h3no6s was detected in negative ionization mode as m h ion 167 9608 m z it eluted at 1 1 min using the rplc system and its concentration increased gradually over time reaching its maximum value at the end of the 11 h long experiment as can be seen in fig 7 since an analytical standard was not available for the structure verification of this tp a thorough investigation of ms and ms ms spectra was performed for its tentative identification the characteristic fragments with m z 95 9761 and 79 9574 in its ms ms spectrum were used to deduce the structure elucidation of this tp it has been previously reported in the literature as a transformation product of acesulfame in several studies 49 51 the detection of common fragments in the experimental ms ms spectrum of this study and reports in the literature increase the level of identification confidence furthermore ace 168 was also detected with lower intensity using hilic in negative ionization mode the presence as well as the reverse elution order of the chromatographic peak in hilic with retention time 7 8 min compared to rplc were also considered as additional evidence for identification three additional tps ace 96 ace 170 and ace 152 have also been detected the ace 96 with a molecular mass of h2no3s was detected through suspect screening in the hrms data as m h ion 95 9761 m z ace 96 has already been reported in the literature 6 7 and there is a fragmentation pattern match supporting the proposed structure ace 96 is produced after hydrolysis of the transformation product ace 168 the transformation product ace 170 was detected using rplc as m h ion 169 9754 m z and its formation is suggested to occur after hydrolysis and oxidation of ace the ace 170 proposed structure contains no ring considering the calculated number of rings and double bonds value proposed by dataanalysis software equal to 3 and the three double bonds with the oxygen molecules that remained intact during sonochemical oxidation additionally ace 170 proposed structure is further supported by the elucidation of its fragment ions in the ms ms spectrum as follows m z 151 9659 c2h2no5s 123 9710 ch2no4s 95 9761 h2no3s and 72 0093 c2h2no2 these characteristic fragments of ace 170 have also been reported in previous studies 49 52 therefore a molecular mass of c2h4no6s was assigned to ace 170 through rplc analysis in negative ionization mode a chromatographic peak eluted at 1 2 min was detected corresponding to the pseudo molecular ion of ace 152 c2h2no5s the ace 152 had an increasing trend of formation and reached its maximum concentration at the final stage of the experiment fig 7 due to its low intensity acquiring specific information regarding the fragmentation behavior e g characteristic pattern fragmentation or diagnostic ions in the ms and ms ms spectra was not feasible the formation of ace 152 seems to be triggered after the oxidative cleavage of ace 170 and the loss of 18 da indicating a loss of water moiety h2o as has also been reported in the literature 52 furthermore ace 183 with a molecular mass of c3h7no6s was also detected through suspect screening in negative ionization mode as 183 9925 m z using the rplc system this compound has already been identified as ace tp 52 and its identification was based only on ms information since the low intensity of the precursor ion did not allow the acquisition of the fragmentation spectrum for further evaluation further oxidative cleavage ch3oh loss of this tp leads to the generation of the transformation product ace 152 finally the transformation product ace 178 was detected resulting from the hydroxylation of ace 52 with a molecular mass of c4h5no5s its identification relied on ms data evaluation since ms ms spectrum could not be recorded due to the low intensity of the respective precursor ion this tp was detected only using hilic in negative mode as m h ion underlying the added value of using complementary chromatographic techniques for a holistic strategy in tps identification a non target approach was also implemented to further investigate the transformation of ace during sonochemical oxidation experiments and identify new tps that have not been reported in relevant published studies and thus were not included in the suspect list the initial step was to subtract the zero time sample s total ion chromatographic signal from that of the treated samples 31 an additional chromatographic peak was detected through non target screening the unknown tp of acesulfame ace 358 was detected with precursor ion 358 9106 m z and retention time at 1 1 min in negative ionization mode of rplc analysis the investigation of its ms ms spectra revealed the presence of common fragments with the tps reported through suspect screening e g 123 9710 m z 95 9761 m z supporting that ace 358 is also a tp of acesulfame however an unequivocal molecular formula could not be assigned to this transformation product to enhance the level of identification confidence the time trend profiles of ace and its tps during sonodegradation obtained through rplc esi qtof are presented in fig 7 the chromatographic peak areas were used for creating the graph due to the absence of reference standards of the tps for calculating their concentrations ace 96 and ace 170 were the most abundant while all detected tps of acesulfame reached the maximum of their abundance at the final time point 11h 3 6 toxicity assessment of tps by ecosar for assessing ecotoxicity in different indicators in the literature often computational models are employed that correlate biological activity with the structural properties of chemical compounds quantitative structure activity relationship qsar models in this context the ecosar model provided by the epa was utilized to estimate the acute and chronic toxicity of ace and the intermediates resulting from its degradation these estimations are specific to fish green algae and daphnids and the results are presented in table 2 toxicity is typically classified on a scale harmful 10 100 mg l 1 toxic 1 10 mg l 1 and very toxic 1 mg l 1 acesulfame appears to exhibit minimal toxicity both for immediate and chronic exposure in agreement with previous studies 53 upon reviewing table 2 it s clear that most intermediates resulting from ace degradation present lower toxicity the exceptions which exhibit higher toxicity are marked in italics however ace 178 is an outlier appearing to be far more toxic than both ace and the rest of the byproducts indicatively the lc50 96 h is 84 6 mg l 1 for fish and 23 6 mg l 1 for green algae in comparison the corresponding values for ace are 132 000 mg l 1 and 11 500 mg l 1 respectively therefore monitoring this specific by product is considered crucial for toxicity studies as it is classified as harmful nonetheless it s important to note that these results were confined to the assessment of individual compounds toxicity overlooking potential synergistic effects of mixtures 3 7 ace degradation by different technologies the current study is not intended to make direct comparisons with other existing technologies it is acknowledged that a comprehensive comparison under real world representative conditions preferably in pilot scale reactors would provide more relevant insights however the findings from this study still hold considerable value in providing a first approximation regarding the efficiency of sonolysis compared to other processes as noted in the introduction ace is considered resistant to environmental conditions indeed gan et al 49 examined the photolysis of ace by solar irradiation in sterilized and unsterilized aqueous solutions the researchers observed that the photolysis of ace in a quartz tube under natural solar irradiation was insignificant 8 after three weeks in sterilized water at ph 7 9 the photolysis was slow 7 or negligible after approximately 21 d of irradiation in sterilized distilled water at neutral and alkaline ph values 7 8 and 9 while photolysis increased at acidic ph 4 with an estimated half life of almost 20 d scheurer et al 54 conducted a study on the uvc photolytic degradation of ace in aqueous solutions including environmentally relevant matrices and various experimental setups for ace ranging from 1 μg l to 10 mg l 1 approximately 90 removal was recorded after 5 min in the uv circular flow reactor corresponding to a fluence of approximately 6000 j m2 other experiments were conducted using three different samples of surface water with ace ranging from 0 34 to 1 5 μg l at a fluence of 8000 j m2 a reduction between 19 and 28 was observed additionally the researchers reported that uvc irradiation of 10 μg l ace spiked tap water from the city of karlsruhe and swiss waterworks resulted in decreased ace concentrations by 34 and 37 respectively yin et al 14 demonstrated that 100 μm of mn vii decomposed between 50 and 80 of 10 μm ace from different water matrices in 90 min li et al 50 examined the chlorination of ace according to the researchers the destruction of ace followed pseudo first order kinetics while the role of ph was crucial although the half life of 20 mg l 1 of ace was only 2 min at acidic ph it increased to 35 min at ph 6 5 99 min at ph 7 5 and 693 min at ph 9 4 at the same time the researchers identified several known and regulated disinfection by products in chlorinated solutions chow et al 52 investigated ozone and the peroxone process for ace destruction the addition of 6 mg l 1 hydrogen peroxide significantly enhanced ace removal in wastewater from 54 7 to 74 8 after 30 min of treatment with 1 5 mg min ozone interestingly the combined system could eliminate ace in 2 min in ultrapure water the study highlighted the crucial role of the water matrix table 3 summarizes the efficiency of the technologies in actual water matrices although the use of ultrasound suffers from some disadvantages such as large energy requirements and problems in size scaling it seems that the removal of micropollutants is not far from that found in much more mature and optimized processes at the same time the possibility of the process to perform without the addition of chemicals is an additional advantage 4 conclusions the findings of this study reveal that low frequency ultrasound at 71 w l is capable of almost completely degrading ace the removal of 3 μμ ace i e an environmentally realistic concentration follows pseudo first order kinetics and degradation mainly occurs through hydroxyl radicals the addition of an oxidant reagent sps enhances the treatment due to the substantial effect of sulfate radicals as evidenced by trapping experiments interestingly the sonochemical removal of the targeted artificial sweetener is only partially inhibited by the complexity of the water matrix these findings highlight that ultrasound has a strong potential for removing micropollutants from aqueous systems and this should be further explored in future studies regarding the generated tps during the process seven tps of ace have been detected following suspect and non target screening hrms workflows after complementary analysis by both rplc and hilic qtof ms most tps are structurally elucidated possible reaction pathways are proposed and the time trend profiles of tps reveal their persistence during sonochemical treatment as their abundance increases over reaction time this pinpoints the need to extend studies to include the sonodegradation of such compounds in terms of removal efficiency and ecotoxicological impact according to ecosar model most of the identified transformation products exhibited lower toxicity than ace with the notable exception of ace 170 this particular by product demonstrated greater toxicity than the precursor compound necessitating

12452,an anaerobic ceramic membrane bioreactor has considerable potential for treating low strength wastewater but needs more study on high strength waste streams this study investigated the methanogenesis performance and inorganic fouling behavior of a flat sheet ceramic anmbr treating fresh leachate the performance was elucidated at an average operating flux of 6 2 l m2 h 1 the system demonstrated over 95 chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency under a hydraulic retention time of 10 days and an organic loading rate of 5 8 kg cod m3 d different cleaning strategies were then tested under moderate or severe membrane fouling conditions physical cleaning can achieve efficient flux recovery after moderate fouling while citric acid followed by naclo cleaning was needed when severe membrane fouling occurred the resistance in series distribution showed that pore blocking by inorganic matter dominated the fouling at the end of the experiment accounting for 48 4 of total resistance whereby a permeability of 99 7 was recoverable from the industrial application point of view a ceramic anmbr must be evaluated further in large scale research graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anaerobic digestion ceramic anmbr fresh leachate membrane fouling cleaning strategy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction an anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr is attractive as a novel and promising renewable energy recovery technology anmbrs have been widely studied in treating low strength wastewater streams and high strength organic solid waste such as municipal sewage wastewater 1 industrial wastewater 2 sewage sludge 3 food waste 4 and municipal solid waste leachate 5 an anmbr represents proven technology for excellent pollution removal efficiency and efficient energy recovery however membrane fouling hinders the development of anmbr and it is more severe in anmbr than in aerobic membrane bioreactor aembr due to having different mixed sludge characteristics 6 which resulted in the cake layers in anmbr being removed more difficult than those in aembr 7 in the treatment of fresh msw leachate the process of anaerobic digestion mbr is commonly used 8 when few reports on anmbr recently hydrophilic ceramic membranes cms have become increasingly popular due to a low membrane fouling rate and high flux 9 one study showed that the membrane flux of a cm was 1 7 times higher than that of a pvdf membrane in the anmbr process 10 meanwhile a cm with stable chemical features and outstanding mechanical properties and made of inorganic materials can extend the service life up to 20 years 11 in addition naclo cleaning agents can damage polymer membranes resulting in contaminant leakage and a reduced membrane lifespan thus increasing the potential use of cms 12 both lab scale and pilot scale ceramic anmbrs have been applied to treat municipal wastewater for bioenergy recovery 9 13 an 89 3 cod removal efficiency was achieved in a pilot scale ceramic anmbr treating municipal wastewater operating at a range of 25 35 c with a 16 lmh flux 9 another report utilized an improved flux of 25 lmh in a ceramic anmbr 14 above all even though superb filtration performance was verified in the treatment of low strength wastewater there has still been insufficient research in ceramic anmbrs treating high strength streams in particular at 40000 80000 mg l cod in fresh municipal solid waste leachate identical to polymer membranes membrane fouling is also the main obstacle faced by cm when filtration resistance increases 9 it should be noted that ceramic and polymeric membranes show different fouling characteristics in treating similar substances due to differences in membrane materials 15 one study showed that a hydration layer was formed repelling the organic foulant on the surface of the cm 16 thus a hydrophilic cm exhibits a lower membrane fouling propensity for most wastewater treatment 17 meanwhile a previous study showed that in low strength synthetic wastewater treatment with 6 0 mg l ca2 using a ceramic anmbr a stable gel layer with high inorganic chelation was formed on the cm surface 14 in another study inorganic fouling was not apparent in actual domestic wastewater treatment due to the concentration of ca2 in the effluent having not been significantly decreased as compared to the influent 18 these results show a lack of uniformity in the inorganic fouling effect on a cm under low concentration inorganic ion conditions typically leachate wastewater contains high levels of calcium ions 2000 6000 mg l and magnesium ions 100 800 mg l 18 19 in addition when municipal wastewater cod 376 2 67 2 mg l is used as the substrate cake layer fouling is dominant on the cm whereby the resistance is close to 75 0 of the total fouling resistance while the inorganic foulant accounts for only 1 4 12 another study showed that when an anaerobic cm reactor was used to treat synthetic wastewater cod 350 500 mg l an excellent anti organic fouling effect was obtained but the cake layer resistance was close to 90 0 while the inorganic pollution was less than 2 0 with about 6 mg l ca2 in the in feed 14 however high concentrations of ca and mg in the feed will readily form inorganic precipitates under anaerobic slightly alkaline reaction conditions in our previous study an inorganic precipitate formed on the surface of the flat sheet polymeric membrane 20 previous studies showed that high concentrations of inorganic crystals deposited on cms changed the pore structure 21 foulant properties 15 and membrane permeability 13 based on the above there should be an investigation of the performance of ceramic membranes in an anmbr treating fresh municipal waste leachate this study investigated bioenergy recovery and pollutant removal performance under different fouling conditions the fouling curves of transmembrane pressure tmp in high cod concentration feed and high ts operating conditions were recorded and analyzed membrane fouling factors in the early phase of membrane fouling and the rapid period of membrane fouling were analyzed and compared using principal component analysis pca in addition the physical chemical cleaning method was used to investigate membrane fouling distribution characteristics the study included quantitative analysis of the cake layer inorganic and organic fouling rate determination the development of a cm fouling model and further investigation of the fouling mechanism 2 materials and methods 2 1 anmbr setup and operating conditions a lab scale ceramic anmbr was set up with a submerged honeycomb hole plate cm bocent advanced ceramic china the system was continuously operated at 37 1 c in a thermostatic water bath changzhou guohua china with a working volume of 10 l length width height 450 mm 150 mm 320 mm the cm was made of al2o3 with a nominal pore size of 0 1 μm and a surface area of 0 12 m2 in addition deionized di water permeability was 61 7 lmh kpa in fig 1 the ceramic anmbr was fed 1 0 l d msw leachate from the substrate tank at 4 c by a peristaltic pump longer precision pump co ltd china the permeate pump was operated at a cycle of 4 min on and 1 min off with an average membrane flux of 6 2 0 1 l m2 h 1 lmh a transmembrane pressure tmp sensor esmps min bo co ltd china was installed before the vacuum pump to monitor the operation of the membrane biogas produced in the ceramic anmbr was measured by a wet gas flowmeter through a desulfurization unit the hydraulic retention time hrt and solids retention time srt of the ceramic anmbr were set at 10 d and 100 d respectively biogas sparging with a gas pump iwaki air pump japan was adopted to recirculate the biogas through the diffuser fitted at the bottom of the anmbr 2 2 substrate compositions and analytical methods the fresh leachate was collected from an intermediate msw storage tank in tianjin china leachate characteristics are summarized in table 1 the substrate mixed liquor and permeate were sampled every three days the supernatant was obtained after 15 min centrifugation at 10000 rpm and filtered with a 0 45 μm membrane cod ts vs vfa and other physical and chemical parameters were measured according to a previous study 5 the electro conductivity was tested with an ec meter mettler toledo switzerland the methane content was measured by a gas chromatograph shimadzu gc 8a japan principal component analysis pca of membrane fouling parameters was applied using the program origin 2018 usa 2 3 membrane cleaning and water filtration test ex situ cleaning of the cm was initiated after 37 days and 68 days of reactor operations the layer caking on the membrane was cleaned in distilled water using a sponge followed by hydraulic cleaning of moderate fouling while chemical cleaning was used at the end of the second phase followed by physical cleaning after the removal of the cake and gel layers the cm was soaked in 2 citric acid solution macklin china for 12 h to remove inorganic foulant and subsequently submersed in 0 1 sodium hypochlorite naclo solution macklin china for 15 h to remove organic foulant before the cleaning step and after each cleaning step the tmp was measured in distilled water with different permeate fluxes 22 darcy s law was used to calculate the filtration resistance of membrane samples based on ex situ filtration test results 1 r t r c r inor r or r m r ir p μ j k μ where rt is the total resistance of the fouling membrane m 1 rc is cake layer resistance removable by physical cleaning and obtained from the difference between total resistance and post physical cleaning resistance m 1 rinor represents the resistance due to inorganic fouling defined as the difference rt rc

calculation to evaluate the cm fouling behavior the membrane permeability was obtained as follows by eq 2 4 2 p j tmp where p is the permeability lmh kpa 1 j is the permeate flux lmh p is the transmembrane pressure kpa tmp rate of change is an important indicator of effective membrane filtration therefore the fouling index was defined by eq 3 during the different operating periods 3 f i p f p in t where fi is the fouling index kpa d pf and pin were the final and initial tmp respectively kpa δt is the gap between pf and pin d the cod removal rate rcod and cod biodegradation rate rbiocod in the ceramic anmbr were calculated based on eqs 4 and 5 as follows 4 r cod cod in cod per cod in 5 r biocod cod in cod sup cod in where rcod is the cod removal rate of the ceramic anmbr system codin indicates the cod concentration of fresh leachate mg l codper is the cod concentration of the permeate mg l codsup is the cod concentration of the supernatant in discharge sludge mg l meanwhile the membrane cod rejection rate rre was calculated as follows 6 r re cod su p cod per cod sup 3 results and discussion 3 1 bioenergy recovery and pollution rejection the performance of the ceramic anmbr in treating fresh leachate is shown in fig 2 after 37 days of operation the cm was taken out and physical cleaning was carried out to recover permeability the cm was then reinserted and continued to run in the first operating phase the olr gradually increased from 2 to 6 kg cod m3 d 1 the cod removal efficiency increased from 67 in the initial operation to 95 and stabilized at 95 1 2 the same excellent cod removal efficiency 98 occurred in ceramic anmbr treating food waste recycling wastewater cod 3270 mg l with the same pore size 23 the methane content was increased to over 75 fig 2c which was similar to the values generally obtained in fresh leachate treatment 65 80 24 but far higher than the 58 68 methane content in food waste treatment by ad 25 26 the methane production rate was stable at 280 10 ml ch4 g codre fig 2d during the second phase the cod removal rate returned to the pre cleaning level after about one week of operation and the olr was stabilized at 5 6 kg cod m3 d 1 the cod removal rate and the methane content were also close to the result of the first phase however the methane production rate was most likely increased due to enhanced degradation of cod when the membrane rejection rate increased as shown in fig 4a a high cod removal efficiency was obtained throughout the operation significantly superior to the 88 result of the cm treatment of synthetic leachate indicated in the literature 27 at the same time it is also higher than the pilot scale gac anmbr that treated municipal wastewater 28 an upgrade to the biogas process was reported using anmbr permeate fed into a scrubbing column from the top with the synthetic biogas sparging from the bottom as a result a counterflow was formed and enhanced the methane content 29 this study observed a similar effect biogas sparging took place from the bottom of the reactor and the permeate was recirculated back to the reactor from the top to control the hrt as shown in fig 1 therefore this may be another reason for the higher methane concentration in the biogas furthermore the fresh leachate was rich in calcium ions which consumed carbon dioxide to form calcium carbonate and another report indicated other carbonate precipitates 20 27 in a word it is believed that a ceramic anmbr exhibits good energy recovery and pollutant removal effects in treating real fresh leachate 3 2 ceramic membrane filtration performance and fouling factors 3 2 1 filtration performance of the ceramic membrane fig 3 presents the filtration performance of the ceramic anmbr systems as shown by monitoring the membrane permeability fouling index and tmp after 23 days of operation the tmp showed an increasing trend and increased from 4 3 kpa to 5 6 kpa at day 37 with a constant flux of 6 0 0 1 lmh see fig 3b when the permeability decreased from 1 4 to 1 0 lmh kpa 1 after 37 days to further explore the membrane filtration characteristics at different fouling degrees the ceramic membrane was cleaned at moderate fouling and it was found that the membrane permeability could be restored by physical cleaning even without chemical cleaning fig 3a this phenomenon was very different from the results obtained from polymeric anmbr that treated similar leachate when the tmp increases by 1 1 kpa to form an obvious cake layer that fouling cannot be recovered by physical cleaning and still has to be treated by chemical cleaning 20 and the initial membrane fouling index showed a relatively steady increase the average fouling index during phase 1 was only 0 036 kpa d as shown in fig 3a meanwhile within 37 days the tmp max increased by only 1 3 kpa significantly lower than the 1 19 kpa d fouling index of the ceramic anmbr for treating low concentration municipal wastewater under the same flux operation 18 at the same time there was almost no fluctuation in the tmp min with no obvious irremovable pollution adsorption which might have contributed to the good hydrophilic performance of the cms after physical cleaning the permeability was recovered and showed a trend of rapid decline after day 45 finally reaching 0 5 kpa lmh 1 which was 52 9 and 62 8 lower than that at the end of phase 1 and the start of phase 2 respectively the membrane fouling index increased slowly after physical cleaning and quickly rose to 0 3 kpa d in the final running after physical cleaning both the tmp max and the tmp min immediately returned to the state of a new membrane with the cake layer removed which indicates that cake layer fouling was the main obstacle for the permeability similar tmp curves were shown on day 1 and day 38 see fig 3 meanwhile the three stage tmp profile as shown was obtained the first stage represented slight membrane fouling 4 4 to 4 7 kpa with an average tmp increase rate of 0 03 kpa d the second stage showed a slow tmp increase 4 9 to 6 4 kpa followed by the jump in tmp with an average increase rate of 0 70 kpa d in addition the tmp min rose rapidly indicating that irreversible fouling accumulates faster in the second phase therefore the membrane fouling modes of the second phase were possibly different from those of phase 1 furthermore the detailed characteristics of the tmp with the different degrees of fouling were analyzed explicitly as shown in fig 3c and d all curves of the tmp then showed a dramatic increase to a plateau period and dropped rapidly during membrane relaxation nevertheless the shorter plateau period was observed on day 68 the curve resulting from the ceramic membrane activity was different from that of the polymeric membrane which from the previous study showed no noticeable plateau period 19 the tmp differences between peaks and valleys at a filtration relaxation cycle indicated reversible physical fouling as shown in fig 3c the reversible physical fouling on day 37 was more substantial than on day 1 but it was not significantly so the more significant gap was obtained on day 68 in fig 3d the tmp of day 1 day 37 and day 38 was increased to 4 3 kpa 5 6 kpa and 4 4 kpa and then back to 4 0 kpa 4 3 kpa and 4 1 kpa after relaxation respectively while the tmp in a filtration relaxation cycle on day 68 was back to only 7 1 kpa from 12 1 kpa during the 1 min relaxation period 3 2 2 membrane rejection efficiency and fouling factors the organic matter rejection rate in the anmbr system was also crucial in evaluating membrane performance it is generally believed that colloidal cod and macromolecular organic matter are easily trapped in the reactor which can promote the further conversion of cod to methanogenesis 28 when the test was started the cod concentration in the permeate decreased from 15 1 g l to 2 4 g l while it remained at 4 6 g l cod in the supernatant the rejection rate in the first stage was 30 50 reaching a maximum of 49 3 indicating that more macromolecular cod substances were trapped on the surface of the membrane the rejection rate was close to the 31 34 obtained in pvdf membranes as reported in the literature 31 this result has practical implications for understanding the initial stages of filtration where interactions between organic fouling and filtered organics may dominate fouling behavior at the initial stage of contamination 32 the cod concentration in the permeate increased significant after the off line physical cleaning might be due to the temporary disruption of the completely anaerobic environment at the early stage of operation again in addition the cake layer adsorbed on the membrane surface was removed after physical cleaning resulting in a lower rejection rate at the start of phase 2 after removal at the end of the test no prominent dense cake layer was observed on the surface of the membrane which differs from the results of organic membranes it was noteworthy that ca2 came to occupy the finite binding sites in ceramic membrane pores 14 resulting in the formation of precipitates adsorbed in the pores thereby narrowing the channel with a calcium ion loading rate of 0 11 g ca l d 1 meanwhile some epss adsorbed by inorganic ions acted as floc blocking the membrane pores 15 the factors affecting membrane fouling in the first and second phases are identified by principal component analysis pca as in fig 4c and d it can be shown that mixed liquor total solids mlts were the essential parameter affecting membrane fouling 4 in two phases mixed liquor inorganic solids mlis and mixed liquor volatile solids mlvs as shown in fig 4b concentrations were the main factors in fouling however the better correlation was between organic matter and tmp in the first phase and the inorganic matter was more prominent in the second phase it is believed that membrane fouling may be mainly affected by organic matter in the early stage when the mlvs increased significantly during the whole operation mlis concentration was continuous increase to 20 g l at the end of phase 2 the result was thought that inorganic matter accumulated in the reactor with the ceramic rejection with the ceramic anmbr operation the inorganic ions might precipitate in membrane pores reducing the effective membrane filtration area 3 3 membrane filtration resistance characteristics fig 5 shows the results of the membrane cleaning and clean water filtration tests after the whole experiment the slope of the tmp versus flux curve represents the degree of membrane fouling as shown in fig 5a the slope values ka1 ka2 and ka3 of the fouled membrane and membrane after the cleaning procedure at the end of phase 1 were 0 104 0 0244 and 0 016 respectively while the results after phase 2 were 0 457 0 301 0 046 0 018 and 0 016 respectively as shown in fig 5b the greater the slope value the heavier the degree of membrane fouling 22 therefore biogas sparging cleaning played the most important role in resistance removal during phase 1 when citric acid cleaning dominates the resistance removal as shown in fig 5c and d the total resistance rt was 1 25 1011 m and 5 5 1012 m after phase 1 and 2 respectively as a result the cake layer resistance was increased significantly from 0 95 1011 m in phase 1 and to 2 06 1011 m in phase 2 it was suggested that the cake layer fouling rate grows faster in phase 2 than phase 1 even though the mlvs does not change much the cake layer and residual resistance accounted for 76 5 and 7 6 of total resistance after phase 1 and the rc rinor ror rm and rir contributed 37 3 48 4 10 2 3 8 and 0 3 total resistance after phase 2 respectively the resistance of the membrane itself accounted for 3 8 of the total resistance consistent with that previously reported 9 inorganic foulants dominate the total resistance after the second phase of operation the loose cake layer is still the main pollution part but unlike the previous research on organic membranes the resistance of the cake layer is usually greater than 60 12 even up to 90 33 as shown in fig 5c there is no obvious cake layer observed on the surface of the fouled membrane unlike the black and dense cake layer on the surface of the polymeric membrane 20 31 as a result the ceramic membrane pores without the cake layer overspread are exposed to the inorganic precipitation environment 9 a previous study reported that 90 of inorganic fouling of a membrane resulted from a ceramic anmbr that treated alcohol distillery wastewater 35 meanwhile high concentration calcium ions chelated organic matter to form a gel layer which intensified the proportion of organic pollution 14 the resulting struvite precipitated inside the ceramic membrane pores and caused major hydraulic resistance 35 a different result obtained in the municipal wastewater treatment by ceramic anmbr showed that cake layer fouling was the major 9 the membrane fouling caused by organic foulant was not obvious and was removed by naclo reagent furthermore a ceramic membrane has a greater negative charge in an alkaline environment which can slow down the cake layer formation through a strong electrostatic repulsion force which greatly delays the adsorption and deposition of organic matter 23 after the first phase of operation physical cleaning was used to remove the cake layer the citric acid reagent then eliminated most of the resistance which shows that inorganic fouling tended to stay in the ceramic membrane pores before the cleaning narrowing the channels physically irreversible fouling in the ceramic membranes can be removed only by chemical cleaning and citric acid cleaning should be the primary chemical cleaning method for flux recovery the alumina ceramic membrane absorbing inorganic ions could result in enhanced inorganic fouling 14 generally speaking the initial ceramic membrane fouling i e reversible fouling was characterized by a pore blocking mechanism and then converted into a filter cake filtration mechanism 36 predictably inorganic fouling will be enhanced after applying backwash to remove the cake layer to expose more pores the membrane resistance after chemical cleaning recovers to the extent of 99 7 and the irreversible resistance accounts for only 0 3 which means that a small amount of recalcitrant foulant may remain in the ceramic membrane pores due to its long channel nature the result was showed that a less irreversible fouling than polymeric membrane in previous report 20 and the same phenomenon was observed in a study of comparative analysis of fouling characteristics of ceramic and polymeric 37 the low irreversible fouling was also found in the treatment of municipal wastewater and was considered to be negligible 12 the results showed excellent fouling recovery performance which helps extend the ceramic membrane lifespan because irreversible fouling could decrease the available filtration area during the successive steps 38 it should be noted that citric acid is the leading reagent for cleaning and has fewer naclo requirements for organic foulant removal which will reduce chlorine gas production and membrane corrosion 3 4 ceramic membrane filtration model analysis the ceramic membrane filtration model based on real time tmp curves under differing degrees of fouling was elucidated in a filtration relaxation cycle the value of the tmp flux ratio represented the degree of membrane fouling the degree of membrane fouling on day 1 day 37 and day 68 was suggested as initial moderate and severe fouling to analyze membrane filtration characteristics the difference between the initial and the final tmp during an operating cycle was positively correlated with cake layer fouling for example as shown in fig 6 the difference in severe fouling was 5 0 kpa compared with that in the moderate fouling state 1 3 kpa which indicated that cake layer filtration in severe fouling the result of resistance also proved this phenomenon specifically the initial tangent slopes to the tmp curves are illustrated as ka1 kb1 kc1 which indicates faster cake layer formation with increasing membrane fouling the tmp increased rapidly until to plateau period the tmp plateau period inflection points for the different fouling states appeared at 0 60 0 64 and 0 73 min respectively showing that the formation time of a stable cake layer is related to the tmp after the rapid rise of the tmp a slow increase followed by a short period with no rise was observed it then immediately entered the plateau period in initial and moderate fouling one sequence of tmp curves showed a compact cake layer structure attached to the membrane causing severe fouling that required the formation of a more complex filtration model there may be a balanced force on sludge particles on a cake layer surface during day 1 point a and day 37 point b operation due to the tmp not increasing after points a and b when the force analysis indicated that the drag force drives cake layer compression or particles block pores after point c while a balance of particle accumulation removal results after point d on day 68 the recovery capability of tmp also reflects different filtration characteristics during the membrane relaxation if the tmp at rest can recover to the initial state it indicates that cake layer filtration was the main filtration model otherwise it suggested that the pore blocking dominates the fouling the tmp curves in fig 6a show the results of ka3 kb3 kc3 under different degrees of fouling during the relaxation period in severe fouling the rate of liquid flowing from the outside of the membrane to the inside slows down and pressure is unable to recover to a low fouling state within 1 min this meant that the membrane relaxation interval needs to be extended or the cleaning frequency needs to be increased it is worth noting that inorganic pore blocking was the main resistance contributor followed by cake layer filtration pore clogging foulant easily transforms into irreversible fouling 11 but the irreversible fouling in this experiment was negligible as a result multi category membrane fouling models arose throughout the operation as shown in fig 6b however the dominant fouling model constantly varies with a change in operation time and sludge characteristics 39 during the moderate fouling cake filtration accounted for the vast majority of filtration but physical cleaning could almost recover permeability with the accumulation of inorganic substances and the enhancement of microbial induction the proportion of inorganic fouling gradually increases in the pores a possible explanation for inorganic blocking is that the limited binding sites where biopolymers exist are competitively occupied via excess inorganic ions in the influent leachate such as ca sequestered in pollutants and deposited with dissolved co2 in the membrane channels thereby causing a gradual deterioration in the filtration performance of the inorganic membrane 15 in addition a thinner cake layer forming on the ceramic membrane failed to reject more microparticles and thus enhanced the clogging of pores similar to the granular activated carbon addition in polymers anmbr reduced the cake layer fouling but increased pores blocking 39 the formation of a substantial turbulent impact may also cause the foulant to be washed out by permeate as shown in fig 6b it is necessary to implement a chemical cleaning strategy that depends on the nature of the foulant changes in the properties of the mixed sludge are influenced by the inorganic matter carried over by the feed which alters the fouling tendency of the filtration process 4 conclusion in its initial application the ceramic anmbr showed excellent biological performance by achieving a cod removal efficiency of over 95 in the treatment of fresh leachate the concentration of microbial and inorganic matter was both significant factors in fouling but they came to play different roles in initial versus severe fouling physical cleaning was able to effectively restore the filtration performance of moderately fouled membranes citric acid cleaning played an essential role because the inorganic foulant resistance proved higher than the cake layer resistance after severe fouling cake layering dominates in early fouling while inorganic pore blocking dominates in the severe fouling period inorganic pore blocking accounted for 50 5 of total membrane fouling when the residual irreversible fouling was 0 3 for the ceramic membrane and can thus be discounted overall the ceramic anmbr represents a promising technology for fresh leachate treatment when more attention needs to be paid to inorganic fouling credit authorship

12452,an anaerobic ceramic membrane bioreactor has considerable potential for treating low strength wastewater but needs more study on high strength waste streams this study investigated the methanogenesis performance and inorganic fouling behavior of a flat sheet ceramic anmbr treating fresh leachate the performance was elucidated at an average operating flux of 6 2 l m2 h 1 the system demonstrated over 95 chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency under a hydraulic retention time of 10 days and an organic loading rate of 5 8 kg cod m3 d different cleaning strategies were then tested under moderate or severe membrane fouling conditions physical cleaning can achieve efficient flux recovery after moderate fouling while citric acid followed by naclo cleaning was needed when severe membrane fouling occurred the resistance in series distribution showed that pore blocking by inorganic matter dominated the fouling at the end of the experiment accounting for 48 4 of total resistance whereby a permeability of 99 7 was recoverable from the industrial application point of view a ceramic anmbr must be evaluated further in large scale research graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anaerobic digestion ceramic anmbr fresh leachate membrane fouling cleaning strategy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction an anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr is attractive as a novel and promising renewable energy recovery technology anmbrs have been widely studied in treating low strength wastewater streams and high strength organic solid waste such as municipal sewage wastewater 1 industrial wastewater 2 sewage sludge 3 food waste 4 and municipal solid waste leachate 5 an anmbr represents proven technology for excellent pollution removal efficiency and efficient energy recovery however membrane fouling hinders the development of anmbr and it is more severe in anmbr than in aerobic membrane bioreactor aembr due to having different mixed sludge characteristics 6 which resulted in the cake layers in anmbr being removed more difficult than those in aembr 7 in the treatment of fresh msw leachate the process of anaerobic digestion mbr is commonly used 8 when few reports on anmbr recently hydrophilic ceramic membranes cms have become increasingly popular due to a low membrane fouling rate and high flux 9 one study showed that the membrane flux of a cm was 1 7 times higher than that of a pvdf membrane in the anmbr process 10 meanwhile a cm with stable chemical features and outstanding mechanical properties and made of inorganic materials can extend the service life up to 20 years 11 in addition naclo cleaning agents can damage polymer membranes resulting in contaminant leakage and a reduced membrane lifespan thus increasing the potential use of cms 12 both lab scale and pilot scale ceramic anmbrs have been applied to treat municipal wastewater for bioenergy recovery 9 13 an 89 3 cod removal efficiency was achieved in a pilot scale ceramic anmbr treating municipal wastewater operating at a range of 25 35 c with a 16 lmh flux 9 another report utilized an improved flux of 25 lmh in a ceramic anmbr 14 above all even though superb filtration performance was verified in the treatment of low strength wastewater there has still been insufficient research in ceramic anmbrs treating high strength streams in particular at 40000 80000 mg l cod in fresh municipal solid waste leachate identical to polymer membranes membrane fouling is also the main obstacle faced by cm when filtration resistance increases 9 it should be noted that ceramic and polymeric membranes show different fouling characteristics in treating similar substances due to differences in membrane materials 15 one study showed that a hydration layer was formed repelling the organic foulant on the surface of the cm 16 thus a hydrophilic cm exhibits a lower membrane fouling propensity for most wastewater treatment 17 meanwhile a previous study showed that in low strength synthetic wastewater treatment with 6 0 mg l ca2 using a ceramic anmbr a stable gel layer with high inorganic chelation was formed on the cm surface 14 in another study inorganic fouling was not apparent in actual domestic wastewater treatment due to the concentration of ca2 in the effluent having not been significantly decreased as compared to the influent 18 these results show a lack of uniformity in the inorganic fouling effect on a cm under low concentration inorganic ion conditions typically leachate wastewater contains high levels of calcium ions 2000 6000 mg l and magnesium ions 100 800 mg l 18 19 in addition when municipal wastewater cod 376 2 67 2 mg l is used as the substrate cake layer fouling is dominant on the cm whereby the resistance is close to 75 0 of the total fouling resistance while the inorganic foulant accounts for only 1 4 12 another study showed that when an anaerobic cm reactor was used to treat synthetic wastewater cod 350 500 mg l an excellent anti organic fouling effect was obtained but the cake layer resistance was close to 90 0 while the inorganic pollution was less than 2 0 with about 6 mg l ca2 in the in feed 14 however high concentrations of ca and mg in the feed will readily form inorganic precipitates under anaerobic slightly alkaline reaction conditions in our previous study an inorganic precipitate formed on the surface of the flat sheet polymeric membrane 20 previous studies showed that high concentrations of inorganic crystals deposited on cms changed the pore structure 21 foulant properties 15 and membrane permeability 13 based on the above there should be an investigation of the performance of ceramic membranes in an anmbr treating fresh municipal waste leachate this study investigated bioenergy recovery and pollutant removal performance under different fouling conditions the fouling curves of transmembrane pressure tmp in high cod concentration feed and high ts operating conditions were recorded and analyzed membrane fouling factors in the early phase of membrane fouling and the rapid period of membrane fouling were analyzed and compared using principal component analysis pca in addition the physical chemical cleaning method was used to investigate membrane fouling distribution characteristics the study included quantitative analysis of the cake layer inorganic and organic fouling rate determination the development of a cm fouling model and further investigation of the fouling mechanism 2 materials and methods 2 1 anmbr setup and operating conditions a lab scale ceramic anmbr was set up with a submerged honeycomb hole plate cm bocent advanced ceramic china the system was continuously operated at 37 1 c in a thermostatic water bath changzhou guohua china with a working volume of 10 l length width height 450 mm 150 mm 320 mm the cm was made of al2o3 with a nominal pore size of 0 1 μm and a surface area of 0 12 m2 in addition deionized di water permeability was 61 7 lmh kpa in fig 1 the ceramic anmbr was fed 1 0 l d msw leachate from the substrate tank at 4 c by a peristaltic pump longer precision pump co ltd china the permeate pump was operated at a cycle of 4 min on and 1 min off with an average membrane flux of 6 2 0 1 l m2 h 1 lmh a transmembrane pressure tmp sensor esmps min bo co ltd china was installed before the vacuum pump to monitor the operation of the membrane biogas produced in the ceramic anmbr was measured by a wet gas flowmeter through a desulfurization unit the hydraulic retention time hrt and solids retention time srt of the ceramic anmbr were set at 10 d and 100 d respectively biogas sparging with a gas pump iwaki air pump japan was adopted to recirculate the biogas through the diffuser fitted at the bottom of the anmbr 2 2 substrate compositions and analytical methods the fresh leachate was collected from an intermediate msw storage tank in tianjin china leachate characteristics are summarized in table 1 the substrate mixed liquor and permeate were sampled every three days the supernatant was obtained after 15 min centrifugation at 10000 rpm and filtered with a 0 45 μm membrane cod ts vs vfa and other physical and chemical parameters were measured according to a previous study 5 the electro conductivity was tested with an ec meter mettler toledo switzerland the methane content was measured by a gas chromatograph shimadzu gc 8a japan principal component analysis pca of membrane fouling parameters was applied using the program origin 2018 usa 2 3 membrane cleaning and water filtration test ex situ cleaning of the cm was initiated after 37 days and 68 days of reactor operations the layer caking on the membrane was cleaned in distilled water using a sponge followed by hydraulic cleaning of moderate fouling while chemical cleaning was used at the end of the second phase followed by physical cleaning after the removal of the cake and gel layers the cm was soaked in 2 citric acid solution macklin china for 12 h to remove inorganic foulant and subsequently submersed in 0 1 sodium hypochlorite naclo solution macklin china for 15 h to remove organic foulant before the cleaning step and after each cleaning step the tmp was measured in distilled water with different permeate fluxes 22 darcy s law was used to calculate the filtration resistance of membrane samples based on ex situ filtration test results 1 r t r c r inor r or r m r ir p μ j k μ where rt is the total resistance of the fouling membrane m 1 rc is cake layer resistance removable by physical

calculation to evaluate the cm fouling behavior the membrane permeability was obtained as follows by eq 2 4 2 p j tmp where p is the permeability lmh kpa 1 j is the permeate flux lmh p is the transmembrane pressure kpa tmp rate of change is an important indicator of effective membrane filtration therefore the fouling index was defined by eq 3 during the different operating periods 3 f i p f p in t where fi is the fouling index kpa d pf and pin were the final and initial tmp respectively kpa δt is the gap between pf and pin d the cod removal rate rcod and cod biodegradation rate rbiocod in the ceramic anmbr were calculated based on eqs 4 and 5 as follows 4 r cod cod in cod per cod in 5 r biocod cod in cod sup cod in where rcod is the cod removal rate of the ceramic anmbr system codin indicates the cod concentration of fresh leachate mg l codper is the cod concentration of the permeate mg l codsup is the cod concentration of the supernatant in discharge sludge mg l meanwhile the membrane cod rejection rate rre was calculated as follows 6 r re cod su p cod per cod sup 3 results and discussion 3 1 bioenergy recovery and pollution rejection the performance of the ceramic anmbr in treating fresh leachate is shown in fig 2 after 37 days of operation the cm was taken out and physical cleaning was carried out to recover permeability the cm was then reinserted and continued to run in the first operating phase the olr gradually increased from 2 to 6 kg cod m3 d 1 the cod removal efficiency increased from 67 in the initial operation to 95 and stabilized at 95 1 2 the same excellent cod removal efficiency 98 occurred in ceramic anmbr treating food waste recycling wastewater cod 3270 mg l with the same pore size 23 the methane content was increased to over 75 fig 2c which was similar to the values generally obtained in fresh leachate treatment 65 80 24 but far higher than the 58 68 methane content in food waste treatment by ad 25 26 the methane production rate was stable at 280 10 ml ch4 g codre fig 2d during the second phase the cod removal rate returned to the pre cleaning level after about one week of operation and the olr was stabilized at 5 6 kg cod m3 d 1 the cod removal rate and the methane content were also close to the result of the first phase however the methane production rate was most likely increased due to enhanced degradation of cod when the membrane rejection rate increased as shown in fig 4a a high cod removal efficiency was obtained throughout the operation significantly superior to the 88 result of the cm treatment of synthetic leachate indicated in the literature 27 at the same time it is also higher than the pilot scale gac anmbr that treated municipal wastewater 28 an upgrade to the biogas process was reported using anmbr permeate fed into a scrubbing column from the top with the synthetic biogas sparging from the bottom as a result a counterflow was formed and enhanced the methane content 29 this study observed a similar effect biogas sparging took place from the bottom of the reactor and the permeate was recirculated back to the reactor from the top to control the hrt as shown in fig 1 therefore this may be another reason for the higher methane concentration in the biogas furthermore the fresh leachate was rich in calcium ions which consumed carbon dioxide to form calcium carbonate and another report indicated other carbonate precipitates 20 27 in a word it is believed that a ceramic anmbr exhibits good energy recovery and pollutant removal effects in treating real fresh leachate 3 2 ceramic membrane filtration performance and fouling factors 3 2 1 filtration performance of the ceramic membrane fig 3 presents the filtration performance of the ceramic anmbr systems as shown by monitoring the membrane permeability fouling index and tmp after 23 days of operation the tmp showed an increasing trend and increased from 4 3 kpa to 5 6 kpa at day 37 with a constant flux of 6 0 0 1 lmh see fig 3b when the permeability decreased from 1 4 to 1 0 lmh kpa 1 after 37 days to further explore the membrane filtration characteristics at different fouling degrees the ceramic membrane was cleaned at moderate fouling and it was found that the membrane permeability could be restored by physical cleaning even without chemical cleaning fig 3a this phenomenon was very different from the results obtained from polymeric anmbr that treated similar leachate when the tmp increases by 1 1 kpa to form an obvious cake layer that fouling cannot be recovered by physical cleaning and still has to be treated by chemical cleaning 20 and the initial membrane fouling index showed a relatively steady increase the average fouling index during phase 1 was only 0 036 kpa d as shown in fig 3a meanwhile within 37 days the tmp max increased by only 1 3 kpa significantly lower than the 1 19 kpa d fouling index of the ceramic anmbr for treating low concentration municipal wastewater under the same flux operation 18 at the same time there was almost no fluctuation in the tmp min with no obvious irremovable pollution adsorption which might have contributed to the good hydrophilic performance of the cms after physical cleaning the permeability was recovered and showed a trend of rapid decline after day 45 finally reaching 0 5 kpa lmh 1 which was 52 9 and 62 8 lower than that at the end of phase 1 and the start of phase 2 respectively the membrane fouling index increased slowly after physical cleaning and quickly rose to 0 3 kpa d in the final running after physical cleaning both the tmp max and the tmp min immediately returned to the state of a new membrane with the cake layer removed which indicates that cake layer fouling was the main obstacle for the permeability similar tmp curves were shown on day 1 and day 38 see fig 3 meanwhile the three stage tmp profile as shown was obtained the first stage represented slight membrane fouling 4 4 to 4 7 kpa with an average tmp increase rate of 0 03 kpa d the second stage showed a slow tmp increase 4 9 to 6 4 kpa followed by the jump in tmp with an average increase rate of 0 70 kpa d in addition the tmp min rose rapidly indicating that irreversible fouling accumulates faster in the second phase therefore the membrane fouling modes of the second phase were possibly different from those of phase 1 furthermore the detailed characteristics of the tmp with the different degrees of fouling were analyzed explicitly as shown in fig 3c and d all curves of the tmp then showed a dramatic increase to a plateau period and dropped rapidly during membrane relaxation nevertheless the shorter plateau period was observed on day 68 the curve resulting from the ceramic membrane activity was different from that of the polymeric membrane which from the previous study showed no noticeable plateau period 19 the tmp differences between peaks and valleys at a filtration relaxation cycle indicated reversible physical fouling as shown in fig 3c the reversible physical fouling on day 37 was more substantial than on day 1 but it was not significantly so the more significant gap was obtained on day 68 in fig 3d the tmp of day 1 day 37 and day 38 was increased to 4 3 kpa 5 6 kpa and 4 4 kpa and then back to 4 0 kpa 4 3 kpa and 4 1 kpa after relaxation respectively while the tmp in a filtration relaxation cycle on day 68 was back to only 7 1 kpa from 12 1 kpa during the 1 min relaxation period 3 2 2 membrane rejection efficiency and fouling factors the organic matter rejection rate in the anmbr system was also crucial in evaluating membrane performance it is generally believed that colloidal cod and macromolecular organic matter are easily trapped in the reactor which can promote the further conversion of cod to methanogenesis 28 when the test was started the cod concentration in the permeate decreased from 15 1 g l to 2 4 g l while it remained at 4 6 g l cod in the supernatant the rejection rate in the first stage was 30 50 reaching a maximum of 49 3 indicating that more macromolecular cod substances were trapped on the surface of the membrane the rejection rate was close to the 31 34 obtained in pvdf membranes as reported in the literature 31 this result has practical implications for understanding the initial stages of filtration where interactions between organic fouling and filtered organics may dominate fouling behavior at the initial stage of contamination 32 the cod concentration in the permeate increased significant after the off line physical cleaning might be due to the temporary disruption of the completely anaerobic environment at the early stage of operation again in addition the cake layer adsorbed on the membrane surface was removed after physical cleaning resulting in a lower rejection rate at the start of phase 2 after removal at the end of the test no prominent dense cake layer was observed on the surface of the membrane which differs from the results of organic membranes it was noteworthy that ca2 came to occupy the finite binding sites in ceramic membrane pores 14 resulting in the formation of precipitates adsorbed in the pores thereby narrowing the channel with a calcium ion loading rate of 0 11 g ca l d 1 meanwhile some epss adsorbed by inorganic ions acted as floc blocking the membrane pores 15 the factors affecting membrane fouling in the first and second phases are identified by principal component analysis pca as in fig 4c and d it can be shown that mixed liquor total solids mlts were the essential parameter affecting membrane fouling 4 in two phases mixed liquor inorganic solids mlis and mixed liquor volatile solids mlvs as shown in fig 4b concentrations were the main factors in fouling however the better correlation was between organic matter and tmp in the first phase and the inorganic matter was more prominent in the second phase it is believed that membrane fouling may be mainly affected by organic matter in the early stage when the mlvs increased significantly during the whole operation mlis concentration was continuous increase to 20 g l at the end of phase 2 the result was thought that inorganic matter accumulated in the reactor with the ceramic rejection with the ceramic anmbr operation the inorganic ions might precipitate in membrane pores reducing the effective membrane filtration area 3 3 membrane filtration resistance characteristics fig 5 shows the results of the membrane cleaning and clean water filtration tests after the whole experiment the slope of the tmp versus flux curve represents the degree of membrane fouling as shown in fig 5a the slope values ka1 ka2 and ka3 of the fouled membrane and membrane after the cleaning procedure at the end of phase 1 were 0 104 0 0244 and 0 016 respectively while the results after phase 2 were 0 457 0 301 0 046 0 018 and 0 016 respectively as shown in fig 5b the greater the slope value the heavier the degree of membrane fouling 22 therefore biogas sparging cleaning played the most important role in resistance removal during phase 1 when citric acid cleaning dominates the resistance removal as shown in fig 5c and d the total resistance rt was 1 25 1011 m and 5 5 1012 m after phase 1 and 2 respectively as a result the cake layer resistance was increased significantly from 0 95 1011 m in phase 1 and to 2 06 1011 m in phase 2 it was suggested that the cake layer fouling rate grows faster in phase 2 than phase 1 even though the mlvs does not change much the cake layer and residual resistance accounted for 76 5 and 7 6 of total resistance after phase 1 and the rc rinor ror rm and rir contributed 37 3 48 4 10 2 3 8 and 0 3 total resistance after phase 2 respectively the resistance of the membrane itself accounted for 3 8 of the total resistance consistent with that previously reported 9 inorganic foulants dominate the total resistance after the second phase of operation the loose cake layer is still the main pollution part but unlike the previous research on organic membranes the resistance of the cake layer is usually greater than 60 12 even up to 90 33 as shown in fig 5c there is no obvious cake layer observed on the surface of the fouled membrane unlike the black and dense cake layer on the surface of the polymeric membrane 20 31 as a result the ceramic membrane pores without the cake layer overspread are exposed to the inorganic precipitation environment 9 a previous study reported that 90 of inorganic fouling of a membrane resulted from a ceramic anmbr that treated alcohol distillery wastewater 35 meanwhile high concentration calcium ions chelated organic matter to form a gel layer which intensified the proportion of organic pollution 14 the resulting struvite precipitated inside the ceramic membrane pores and caused major hydraulic resistance 35 a different result obtained in the municipal wastewater treatment by ceramic anmbr showed that cake layer fouling was the major 9 the membrane fouling caused by organic foulant was not obvious and was removed by naclo reagent furthermore a ceramic membrane has a greater negative charge in an alkaline environment which can slow down the cake layer formation through a strong electrostatic repulsion force which greatly delays the adsorption and deposition of organic matter 23 after the first phase of operation physical cleaning was used to remove the cake layer the citric acid reagent then eliminated most of the resistance which shows that inorganic fouling tended to stay in the ceramic membrane pores before the cleaning narrowing the channels physically irreversible fouling in the ceramic membranes can be removed only by chemical cleaning and citric acid cleaning should be the primary chemical cleaning method for flux recovery the alumina ceramic membrane absorbing inorganic ions could result in enhanced inorganic fouling 14 generally speaking the initial ceramic membrane fouling i e reversible fouling was characterized by a pore blocking mechanism and then converted into a filter cake filtration mechanism 36 predictably inorganic fouling will be enhanced after applying backwash to remove the cake layer to expose more pores the membrane resistance after chemical cleaning recovers to the extent of 99 7 and the irreversible resistance accounts for only 0 3 which means that a small amount of recalcitrant foulant may remain in the ceramic membrane pores due to its long channel nature the result was showed that a less irreversible fouling than polymeric membrane in previous report 20 and the same phenomenon was observed in a study of comparative analysis of fouling characteristics of ceramic and polymeric 37 the low irreversible fouling was also found in the treatment of municipal wastewater and was considered to be negligible 12 the results showed excellent fouling recovery performance which helps extend the ceramic membrane lifespan because irreversible fouling could decrease the available filtration area during the successive steps 38 it should be noted that citric acid is the leading reagent for cleaning and has fewer naclo requirements for organic foulant removal which will reduce chlorine gas production and membrane corrosion 3 4 ceramic membrane filtration model analysis the ceramic membrane filtration model based on real time tmp curves under differing degrees of fouling was elucidated in a filtration relaxation cycle the value of the tmp flux ratio represented the degree of membrane fouling the degree of membrane fouling on day 1 day 37 and day 68 was suggested as initial moderate and severe fouling to analyze membrane filtration characteristics the difference between the initial and the final tmp during an operating cycle was positively correlated with cake layer fouling for example as shown in fig 6 the difference in severe fouling was 5 0 kpa compared with that in the moderate fouling state 1 3 kpa which indicated that cake layer filtration in severe fouling the result of resistance also proved this phenomenon specifically the initial tangent slopes to the tmp curves are illustrated as ka1 kb1 kc1 which indicates faster cake layer formation with increasing membrane fouling the tmp increased rapidly until to plateau period the tmp plateau period inflection points for the different fouling states appeared at 0 60 0 64 and 0 73 min respectively showing that the formation time of a stable cake layer is related to the tmp after the rapid rise of the tmp a slow increase followed by a short period with no rise was observed it then immediately entered the plateau period in initial and moderate fouling one sequence of tmp curves showed a compact cake layer structure attached to the membrane causing severe fouling that required the formation of a more complex filtration model there may be a balanced force on sludge particles on a cake layer surface during day 1 point a and day 37 point b operation due to the tmp not increasing after points a and b when the force analysis indicated that the drag force drives cake layer compression or particles block pores after point c while a balance of particle accumulation removal results after point d on day 68 the recovery capability of tmp also reflects different filtration characteristics during the membrane relaxation if the tmp at rest can recover to the initial state it indicates that cake layer filtration was the main filtration model otherwise it suggested that the pore blocking dominates the fouling the tmp curves in fig 6a show the results of ka3 kb3 kc3 under different degrees of fouling during the relaxation period in severe fouling the rate of liquid flowing from the outside of the membrane to the inside slows down and pressure is unable to recover to a low fouling state within 1 min this meant that the membrane relaxation interval needs to be extended or the cleaning frequency needs to be increased it is worth noting that inorganic pore blocking was the main resistance contributor followed by cake layer filtration pore clogging foulant easily transforms into irreversible fouling 11 but the irreversible fouling in this experiment was negligible as a result multi category membrane fouling models arose throughout the operation as shown in fig 6b however the dominant fouling model constantly varies with a change in operation time and sludge characteristics 39 during the moderate fouling cake filtration accounted for the vast majority of filtration but physical cleaning could almost recover permeability with the accumulation of inorganic substances and the enhancement of microbial induction the proportion of inorganic fouling gradually increases in the pores a possible explanation for inorganic blocking is that the limited binding sites where biopolymers exist are competitively occupied via excess inorganic ions in the influent leachate such as ca sequestered in pollutants and deposited with dissolved co2 in the membrane channels thereby causing a gradual deterioration in the filtration performance of the inorganic membrane 15 in addition a thinner cake layer forming on the ceramic membrane failed to reject more microparticles and thus enhanced the clogging of pores similar to the granular activated carbon addition in polymers anmbr reduced the cake layer fouling but increased pores blocking 39 the formation of a substantial turbulent impact may also cause the foulant to be washed out by permeate as shown in fig 6b it is necessary to implement a chemical cleaning strategy that depends on the nature of the foulant changes in the properties of the mixed sludge are influenced by the inorganic matter carried over by the feed which alters the fouling tendency of the filtration process 4 conclusion in its initial application the ceramic anmbr showed excellent biological performance by achieving a cod removal efficiency of over 95 in the treatment of fresh leachate the concentration of microbial and inorganic matter was both significant factors in fouling but they came to play different roles in initial versus severe fouling physical cleaning was able to effectively restore the filtration performance of moderately fouled membranes citric acid cleaning played an essential role because the inorganic foulant resistance proved higher than the cake layer resistance after severe fouling cake layering dominates in early fouling while inorganic pore blocking dominates in the severe fouling period inorganic pore blocking accounted for 50 5 of total membrane fouling when the residual irreversible fouling was 0 3 for the ceramic membrane and can thus be discounted overall the ceramic anmbr represents a promising technology for fresh leachate treatment when more attention needs to be paid to inorganic fouling credit authorship

12453,wet mechanochemical exfoliation of molybdenum disulfide mos2 flakes into mos2 quantum dots qds using various exfoliation agents is studied and the photoluminescence adsorption and photocatalytic

for enhanced light induced intramolecular electron transfer thus photocatalytic performance of the material graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords mos2 quantum dot mechanochemistry adsorption photocatalyst dye data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction molybdate with a global availability of more than 20 million tons is mainly made of molybdenum disulfide mos2 making the latter a highly available natural resource 1 2 due to its graphite like layered structure the hexagonal lattice of mos2 is bound by rather weak van der waals forces therefore the compound can be exfoliated to form two or zero dimensional morphologies with interesting properties such as high electrocatalytic activity long term stability in acidic and alkaline conditions easily tunable band gap and enhanced intrinsic spin orbit coupling as well as low cost and high availability 3 5 as such mos2 nanostructures including 2d nanosheets and quantum does qds have largely been studied for electrocatalytic hydrogen oxygen evolution 6 10 and to less extent for other applications such as energy storage devices 11 13 electrochemical sensors 14 drug delivery 15 humidity sensors 16 and light emitting diodes 17 recently the application of mos2 qds in water treatment application has also been reported 18 while further research is required to reveal their potential in such demanding fields apart from possible applications the preparation of mos2 qds has been the subject of several investigations these methods can be categorized into top down and bottom up approaches as reviewed elsewhere 19 the bottom up methods used to synthesis mos2 qds including sol gel chemical vapor deposition atomic layer deposition and hydrothermal methods typically use expensive and environmentally problematic precursors involving prolonged steps 20 21 for example xie et al 22 prepared surface functionalized mos2 qds 4 4 nm using nh4 2mos4 and glutathione as mo and s sources respectively through a hydrothermal process at 200 c for 24 h other methods use precursors such as sodium molybdates and sulphur 23 24 where preparation of precursors is also energy consuming 24 25 in contrast the top down preparation of mos2 qds is based on the exfoliation of bulk mos2 often using ultrasonication of mos2 suspension in organic solvents such as n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp for prolonged time period typically more than 3 h 26 29 the large scale operation of such techniques can be a challenge due to limitations such as lack of the availability of large scale ultrasonic reactors and high costs involved in the manufacturing of such devices 30 31 therefore the development of alternative techniques for scalable clean and low cost preparation of mos2 qds is an interesting topic to be investigated here we investigate the mechanochemical exfoliation of mos2 in the presence of nmp or ethanol without the involvement of ultrasonication providing a simple approach for scalable synthesis of qds mechanochemical methods based on high energy ball milling of species provide a simple green and scalable approach for preparation of nanostructured alloys compounds and composites 32 35 or exfoliation of layered structured materials such as graphite 36 37 and mos2 12 into thinner flakes during the ball milling process the kinetic energy generated by the high energy motion of balls the milling jar and the particles subject to the ball milling causes high energy collisions between the components leading to the breaking down chemical bonds of the particles therefore an efficient ball milling may lead to the reduction of the crystalline and particle sizes to nanometer scale as such the mechanochemical preparation of carbon qds 38 40 thought high energy ball milling of materials such as activated carbon and koh 38 or graphene and sodium carbonate 40 have been reported however to the best of our knowledge there has not been any research work in the literature investigating the mechanochemical preparation of mos2 qds using high energy ball milling approach moreover the performance of mos2 qds in removal of organic contaminants from wastewater has not been received attention in the literature in this study we report on the green and low cost preparation of mos2 qds by means of high energy ball milling using naturally available mos2 as the initial material in the presence of nmp or ethanol moreover the dye adsorption and photocatalytic performances of the products are examined it should be considered that molybdenum disulfide can possess diverse properties since it can exist in three polymorphic forms of hexagonal 2h rhombohedral 3r and octahedral 1t crystal structures 41 42 furthermore the band gap structure of mos2 can be affected by the quantum confinement and edge effects therefore the indirect band gap of bulk mos2 1 2 ev can be tuned into a direct band gap in sufficiently thin species with an enhanced value of greater than 1 8 ev such alteration can provide photoluminescence effects and photoactivity for mos2 qds 43 also a large number of unsaturated bonds can be attached to the edges of the mos2 qds to provide various functionalities 44 these properties in addition to low toxicity high water dispersibility and chemical inertness as well as excellent photostability 45 47 make mos2 a potential candidate for adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds supporting environmental protection having mentioned above here we investigate on mechanochemical treatment of mos2 as a simple low cost high yield and scalable approach for the preparation of mos2 qds as reported in this article the ball milling of commercially available mos2 powder in the presence of nmp leads to the formation of mos2 quantum dots n mos2 qds with stable 2h crystalline structure and amino carboxyl functional groups exhibiting strong fluorescence and excellent photocatalytic performance toward the degradation of rhodamine b rhb this article for the first time report on the mechanochemical preparation of mos2 qds for the efficient adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes 2 experimental 2 1 synthesis of molybdenum disulfide quantum dots a simple potentially green and scalable ball milling strategy was used to fabricate molybdenum disulfide quantum dots mos2 qds in a typical experiment a quantity of 5 g mos2 aladdin cas 1317 33 5 99 5 was mixed with 50 ml of either nmp ar sinopharm group chemical reagent as the high boiling point 202 c exfoliation agent or ethanol ar tianjin fuyu fine chemical as the low boiling point exfoliation agent 78 c then the mixture was transferred into polymeric jars 500 ml the ball milling bm process was conducted for the period of 10 h at 250 rpm using 100 g alumina al2o3 balls d 5 and 10 mm as the milling medium employing a mitr qm qx 2l high energy planetary ball mill device after the bm process the suspension obtained was vacuum filtered through which it was separated into solid and liquid phases the liquid phase containing mos2 qds were dried in an oven at different temperatures depending on the type of the organic solvent to collect mos2 qds powders accordingly nmp containing qds was dried at 202 c for 12 h and the quantum dots obtained are called n mos2 qds likewise drying of ethanol containing qds was performed at 80 c for 12 h and sample obtained is called e mos2 qds based on the amount of the initial mos2 and that of qds obtained the production yields were calculated and the results are shown in table 1 as can be seen the yield of quantum dots prepared using nmp 13 62 is considerably greater than that of ethanol 1 51 the experimental process is shown in fig 1 2 2 adsorption and photocatalytic examination the adsorption and photocatalytic performances of various materials comprising of commercial molybdenum disulfide c mos2 e mos2 qds and n mos2 qds were examined based on the removal of rhb analytical pure tianjin institute of reagents to this end a quantity of 10 mg mos2 material was dispersed in 100 ml rhb solution with different concentrations of 10 and 20 mg l then the suspension obtained was stirred at room temperature using a magnetic stirrer under dark condition for a period of 20 min to achieve the adsorption equilibrium the photocatalytic performance of the catalysts under different light sources was then measured by led light irradiation at various wavelengths of 365 385 and 450 nm samples of 2 ml were subsequently collected from the reaction cell at given time intervals and analyzed by a uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific evolution 220 to indicate the adsorption decomposition of rhb 2 3 morphological structural and surface characterizations the phase analysis was conducted using an x ray diffractometer xrd panalyco fullprof suite software was used to perform the rietveld refinement of the c mos2 a laser raman spectrometer hr800 was employed to record raman spectra using he ne laser wavelength 633 nm uv vis spectrophotometry thermo scientific evolution 220 was used to evaluate the band gap of various materials as well as the concentration of dye present in solutions fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was performed on a vertex 70v ftir spectrometer to elucidate various surface functional groups microstructural characterizations were performed using a jeol jem f200 transmission electron microscope tem and a zeiss ultra plus field emission scanning electron microscope sem the latter was equipped with an energy dispersive x ray eds detector a thermo scientific k alpha instrument was used for x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps measurements employing the al kα rays 1486 6 ev values of zeta potential and particle size distribution of quantum dots were analyzed using a malvern panalyticalzetasizer nano zs90 instrument the measurement was conducted by dispersing qds in deionized water 3 results and discussion 3 1 x ray and raman characterizations the crystalline structure and phase purity of the commercial mos2 c mos2 and the synthesized samples namely e mos2 and n mos2 qds were characterized using powder x ray diffraction and the results are shown in fig 2 a accordingly all diffraction peaks observed in the pattern of c mos2 can be corresponded to the standard card of molybdenum disulfide with hexagonal structure and there are no other peaks indicating the purity of the substance the sharp peak centred at 2ө 14 64 is related to 002 reflection in the hexagonal lattice of mos2 the peaks with lower intensity appeared at 2ө values of 39 78 44 38 and 50 02 can be corresponded to the 103 104 and 106 planes in the lattice respectively the xrd pattern of c mos2 was further analyzed by the rietveld refinement method fig s1 and the lattice parameters extracted are shown in table s1 overall the xrd pattern of c mos2 represents the presence of three dimensional structure of hexagonal mos2 dominantly developed based on 002 crystalline planes the xrd diffractions of e mos2 qds and n mos2 qds are different from that of c mos2 in that there is no obvious diffraction peak in particular the lack of sharp 002 reflection in qds indicates the conversion of the 3d layered structure of hexagonal mos2 into sufficiently thin crystals so that no long range crystallinity could be detected 48 the xrd patterns of mos2 qds obtained by mechanochemical treatment of c mos2 are in agreement with those of mos2 qds obtained by alternative methods 48 49 as exhibited in fig 2 b further characterization of mos2 qds was performed using raman spectroscopy in the spectrum of the commercial mos2 two peaks can clearly be observed at 381 and 407 cm 1 these peaks are assigned to e 2 g 1 and a 1g modes corresponding to the in plane and out of plane vibrational modes of the mos bond respectively according to the literature 50 54 the raman peaks of mos2 qds are rather weak representing their nanostructures moreover the 1t phase mos2 ods may exhibit three new raman peaks denoted as j1 j2 and j3 compared with commercial mos2 the e mos2 qds and n mos2 qds samples synthesized by the mechanochemical treatment of c mos2 exhibit peaks with relatively weak intensity indicating the nanostructured nature of the samples in addition to those of mos2 three new peaks j1 j2 and j3 could be detected in e mos2 qds at 146 236 and 335 cm 1 respectively the intensity of the j2 peak is the weakest among them the presence of these peaks can be assigned to a zone folding mechanism which is caused due to the generation of a superlattice observed only in 1t phase mos2 these three peaks are not allowed in the bulk and 2h phase mos2 qds 50 54 as can be seen in fig 2 b the new peaks characteristics of the 1t phase mos2 could not be detected in the raman spectra of c mos2 and n mos2 qds this observation indicates the absence of the 1t phase in these samples based on these results the mechanochemical treatment of c mos2 with ethanol and nmp is likely to produce e mos2 and n mos2 qds with 1t mos2 and 2h mos2 crystalline modification respectively 3 2 dispersion stability and particle size distribution of mos2 qds the dispersion of e mos2 and n mos2 qds in ethanol and nmp solvents respectively obtained after filtration of bm ed samples can be visually observed in fig 1 distinguished by the different colour of dispersions it was observed that the dispersion of n mos2 in nmp is highly stable over the course of observations 2 months but that of e mos2 in ethanol shows instability after few days to examine the stability of dispersions zeta potential values were measured considering that the high absolute value of the zeta potential indicates repulsive electrostatic forces between individual particles promoting the dispersion stability as the result highly dispersed nanoparticles can be supposed to exhibit values of zeta potential typically greater or less than 30 mv and 30 mv respectively 55 58 according to fig 3 a the value of zeta potential was measured to be 33 3 19 4 and 11 7 mv for c mos2 e mos2 and n mos2 qds respectively the greater zeta potentials of n mos2 qds than that of e mos2 qds is evident confirming the greater dispersion stability of the earlier in order to provide further insights into the stability of two dispersions the mos2 qds were dispersed into distilled water in order to prepare a concentration of 100 mg l the dispersions were left in the laboratory under natural environmental light for 74 days as shown in fig s2 the colour of the e mos2 qds dispersion gradually disappeared while that of n mos2 qds remained almost unchanged indicating that the stability of n mos2 qds is considerably greater than that of e mos2 qds this observation can be attributed to the distinguished 2h crystalline structure of n mos2 qds in contrast with the 1t crystalline structure in e mos2 qds the latter is known to be metastable 59 the particle size distribution of e mos2 and n mos2 qds was analyzed by dispersing the qds in deionized water the results obtained are shown in fig 3 b and b indicating the presence of a single peak at both spectra recorded at 4 136 and 4 187 nm for e mos2 and n mos2 respectively this observation suggests the formation of mos2 nanoparticles with uniform size of around 4 nm 3 3 uv vis and band gap characterization uv vis absorbance spectra recorded on c mos2 e mos2 qds and n mos2 qds dispersions in deionized water 100 mg l are shown if fig 4 a as observed in the inset of this figure c mos2 shows absorption peaks at 213 235 560 and 640 nm which are the characteristic absorption bands of mos2 in the dispersion 60 61 accordingly the peaks at 560 and 640 nm arise from the k point of the brillouin zone moreover peaks at 213 and 235 nm can be corresponded to the m point of the brillouin zone indicative of the direct transition from the deep valence band to the conduction band in contrast the uv vis spectra of n mos2 and e mos2 qds shown in fig 4 a exhibit absorption peaks at 380 and 310 nm which are the characteristic absorption band of mos2 in dispersions 48 49 among them the peak appeared at 380 nm is the excitonic feature of mono dispersed mos2 confirming the greater dispersion stability of n mos2 qds in semiconductor materials the value of band gap energy is an indicative of the minimum energy required to excite an electron from the valence band to the conduction band based on the tauc method the band gap energy eg of a semiconductor can be obtained using its uv vis spectrum employing the following equation 62 63 1 α hʋ m b hʋ e g here α h and ʋ are the absorption coefficient the planck constant and the photon s frequency respectively and b is a constant moreover m is a value determining the type of band gap accordingly the direct and indirect band gaps are represented by values of m 2 and m 1 2 respectively therefore the optical band gap of samples could be determined by plotting αhʋ m against hʋ and the results are shown in fig 4 b d according to the literature the energy band structure of bulk and single layer mos2 can be characterized by the presence of indirect and direct band gap respectively moreover as the thickness of mos2 flakes decreases into nanoscale range the energy band gap gradually increases 64 according to fig 4d c mos2 shows two optical indirect band gap transitions of 1 60 and 1 48 ev the value 1 60 ev is related to the fundamental homo lumo transition optical band gap while the value of 1 48 ev to the trap energy inside the homo lumo gap on the other hand the e mos2 qds fig 4b exhibits only a direct band gap at 1 64 ev the opening of band gap from 1 48 ev in the bulk mos2 to 1 64 ev in the e mos2 qds can be due to the quantum confinement effect in the latter the n mos2 qds shows the widest direct band gap of 2 68 ev among samples which can be related to the strong quantum size effect in this sample this band gap opening also influences the redox potential of the material as well 65 67 the greater band gap value of n mos2 qds than that of e mos2 qds can also be related to their different crystalline modification 2h and 1t phases respectively enhanced energy level observed between the conduction and valence band edges in n mos2 qds enables the material to act as an efficient photocatalytic agent which will be discussed in this article 3 4 surface characterization surface characteristics of e mos2 and n mos2 qds were examined using ftir and xps techniques ftir spectroscopy could provide valuable information about possible surface functional groups present on mos2 qds the ftir spectra of the qds are shown in fig 5 the peaks observed can be explained based on the data available in the literature 47 68 69 accordingly a weak absorption peaks can be seen at 453 and 420 cm 1 for e mos2 and n mos2 qds respectively which could be attributed to the mos stretching vibration mode observed in mos2 apart from the above characteristic peak both samples show the same features comprising of the oh bond stretching peaks at 3414 2515 1270 1052 650 cm 1 ch vibration peaks at 600 733 780 960 cm 1 and peaks related to the co vibration at 1705 and 1640 cm 1 as highlighted in the spectra of fig 5 these peaks indicate the attachment of organic compounds to the surface of mos2 qds in addition the ftir spectrum of e mos2 qds fig 5 a exhibits characteristic peaks related to ch3 vibration at 1492 cm 1 also the peak observed at 1140 cm 1 is attributed to the cc vibration the presence of methyl and sigma bonds can be related to the attachment of functional group originating from ethanol to the surface of mos2 qds it should be noticed that the spectrum of n mos2 qds fig 5 b exhibits a peak at 3423 cm 1 which can be assigned to the nh vibration moreover the peaks at 1430 and 1365 cm 1 are related to the co2 vibration and the one at 1117 cm 1 to the cnhc cnc stretching vibration moreover the peak at 1007 cm 1 is related to the cn stretching frequencies these peaks indicate the presence of 4 methylamino butyric acid 68 71 on the surfaces n mos2 qds carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups present on the surfaces of the prepared mos2 qds can be responsible for their enhanced dispersibility the presence of amino functional group on n mos2 qds can be related to the evaporative separation of nmp from dispersion at 202 c fig 1 during which adsorbed nmp on the surfaces of qds is converted into 4 methylamino butyric acid 68 69 enabling aminocarboxy functionalization of n mos2 qds during this process as shown in fig s3 according to the literature the performance of aminocarboxy functional group could improve the photocatalytic activity of zirconium metal organic framework 70 the formation of aminocarboxy functional group could greatly enhance the photocatalytic activity of n mos2 qds toward the degradation of organic dyes as will be discussed in this article the surface chemistry of mos2 qds was characterized by the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps measurements and results are shown in fig 6 starting from n mos2 qds the high resolution scan of mo 3d peak exhibited in fig 6 b represents three peaks at 231 26 232 03 and 234 81 ev corresponding to mo4 3d5 2 and mo4 3d3 2 respectively 44 71 72 based on fig 6 c the peaks appeared at 164 49 and 168 66 ev are attributed to s 2p1 2 50 these findings confirm that mo and s exist in the mo4 and s2 oxidation state in n mos2 qds same observations could be concluded for e mos2 qd accordingly peaks observed in fig 6 b at 231 79 233 07 and 234 72 ev can be assigned to mo4 3d5 2 and mo4 3d3 2 of mos2 and peaks at around 168 77 ev to the 2p1 2 line of mos2 fig 6 c moreover the peak at 169 96 ev in e mos2 qd is likely to be due to s2o3 2 group 73 74 which could be sourced by interaction between ethanol and mos2 as shown in fig 6 d the n1s core energy level spectrum of n mos2 qds exhibits peaks at 399 74 400 14 and 400 41 ev confirming the presence of nh n and mon bonds respectively 75 confirming the existence of 4 methylamino butyric acid functional group on the n mos2 qds moreover a small amount of n was also detected in e mos2 qds which is attributed to the introduction of nitrogen from air atmosphere during the evaporation of ethanol furthermore the peaks at 532 15 and 531 45 ev fig 6 e correspond to the organic co and coh and the peaks observed at 285 14 and 288 16 fig 6 f to cn and oco bonds further confirming the presence of aminocarboxy functionalization of n mos2 qds high resolution o 1s spectrum of e mos2 qds is shown in fig 6 e this spectrum exhibits the peak at 532 24 ev and 533 26 ev corresponding to oh bond and physically adsorbed oxygen respectively 50 in addition the c 1s spectrum of e mos2 qds fig 6 f exhibits peaks at 284 52 ev cc and 285 83 ev co due to residual ethanol finally the o 1s spectrum of e mos2 qds fig 6 e exhibits a peak at 531 51 ev this peak is attributed to the presence co bond as a conclusion ftir and xps results confirm that e mos2 and n mos2 qds are functionalized by hydroxyl amino and carboxyl groups dominated by the presence of hydroxyl groups on e mos2 qds and amino carboxyl groups on n mos2 qds 3 5 photoluminescence characterization semiconductor quantum dots may provide tuneable photoluminescence performances suggesting them as attractive alternatives for a range of applications this performance can be influenced by dangling bonds present on the surface of qds 76 70 since our mos2 qds contain different functional groups on their surfaces it was speculated that they exhibits different photoluminescence behaviours to investigate this the optical properties of mos2 qds dispersed in water were characterized through measuring of photoluminescence pl and photoluminescence excitation ple the results obtained are presented in fig 7 a and b as can be realized from fig 7 a the sharp pl emission of the e mos2 qds is observed at 411 nm under the light excitation of 360 nm with a stokes shift of 51 nm on the other hand the sharp emission of the n mos2 qds can be seen at 501 nm under 367 nm light excitation with a stokes shift of 134 nm the n mos2 qds having the larger stokes shift exhibit brighter and more stable fluorescence features than e mos2 qds as shown in figs s1 and 6 c it should be mentioned that the red shift of pl emission of qds can be accompanied by an increase in the value of band gap 76 80 which is in agreement with our results shown in figs 7 and 4 c meanwhile the strong emerging photoluminescence in nano meter scaled mos2 is an indicative of the transition from indirect to direct band gap the difference between the photoluminescence features of e and n mos2 qds can be related to different functional groups available on their surfaces as described based on figs 5 and 6 e mos2 qds are functionalized mainly by hydroxyl while n mos2 by amino and carboxyl groups the functional groups could influence the charge transfer pattern on surfaces of qds thus altering their photoluminescence properties as reported for the case of carbon qds elsewhere 81 82 the e mos2 qds and n mos2 qds were photographed under light irradiation of various wavelengths and the outcomes are shown in fig 7 c under lab light condition e and n mos2 qds appear in blue and yellow respectively under the led light irradiation of 365 and 385 nm n mos2 qds provide green photoluminescent emission which is greater at 385 nm under same light irradiation e mos2 qds exhibit blue photoluminescent emission which is greater at 365 nm the photoluminescence effect of our quantum dots occurs around wavelengths where the strongest pl peak appears based on fig 7 a and b additionally qds show an optical peak centred at 275 nm with an edge extending to around 310 nm for the case of e mos2 qds this value can be measured to be 390 nm for the case of n mos2 qds this feature is an indicative for the abundance of surface functional groups on the surfaces mos2 qds 83 3 6 morphological characterizations the morphological features of mos2 qds were studied using scanning and transmission electron microscopy fig 8 a shows the sem micrograph of c mos2 used as the initial material the material can be characterized by the presence of flakes with overall sizes of around 2 μm with irregular shapes and orientations as commonly expected for commercially available mos2 mechanically exfoliated mos2 flakes of the same sample were studied by tem and the results shown in fig 9 b d demonstrate the high crystallinity of the sample fast fourier transform fft pattern recorded on the micrograph of fig 8 c is shown in d where the presence of hexagonally ordered spots is evident the spots indicating the lattice spacing of 0 29 and 0 14 nm can be corresponded to the 004 and 002 crystalline planes in the hexagonal structure of mos2 this sample was used to prepare qds sem micrograph of the as prepared e mos2 qds shown in fig s4 b exhibits agglomerated particles with overall sizes of around 10 μm the agglomeration of qds into large particles was highly possible to occur during the evaporation of ethanol fig 1 which also made a porous structure due to the outflow of the solvent in response to the vacuum drying leaving holes of about 900 nm behind sem micrographs recorded on large particles could still identify the presence of nano metered particles as shown in fig s4 c and d these large agglomerated particles could be easily dispersed in water as can be realized from fig s2 fig s5 shows the sem eds mapping of e mos2 qds revealing the presence of molybdenum sulphur carbon and oxygen homogeneously distributed across the material the results are in agreement with the formation of functionalized mos2 qds confirming the xrd and xps results the mass ratio of mo s obtained from the eds result is 1 3 which is slightly lower than the theoretical value of 1 5 expected for mos2 which can be explained by the semiquantitative nature of the technique however the value obtained in this study is considerably close to the theoretical value in comparison with mos2 qds prepared by other techniques including the hydrothermal treating of ch4n2s and nh4 6mo7o24 at 170 c for 16 h providing an eds mo s mass ration of 2 5 84 tem micrograph of dispersed e mos2 qds is shown in fig 8 e according to this micrograph the presence of fine nanoparticles can be realized size distribution histogram of observed nanoparticles is shown in fig 8 f indicating a peak at 4 6 nm the morphological features of n mos2 qds are relatively similar to those of e mos2 qds fig s6 shows the sem image of n mos2 qds in which the presence of agglomerated nanoparticles can be understood fig s7 shows the sem eds mapping recorded on the sample where the uniform distribution of mo s n and c can be seen indicating the presence of qds with amino carboxyl functional groups as can be observed in fig 8 g and h the size distribution histogram of nanoparticles in n mos2 qds provides maxima at 4 8 nm the tem observations suggest the preparation of e mos2 and n mos2 qds with sizes of around 4 6 and 4 8 nm which are in perfect agreement with the results obtained from the particle size distribution analysis shown in fig 3 b and c during the mechanochemical exfoliation process bulk mos2 could be exfoliated in different solvents of ethanol and nmp into qds and subsequently disperse in the solvent providing the solvent with blue and yellow colours respectively then qds could be retrieved by the evaporation of the solvents at 80 and 202 c for the case of ethanol and nmp respectively according to xrd raman and ftir results e mos2 qds are likely to have 1t phase structure while n mos2 qds have 2h phase structure since the thermal treatment was conducted at different temperature due to the difference between the evaporation temperatures of solvents we further heat treated e mos2 qds at the same temperature of 202 c and examined the raman spectrum of the prepared qds fig s8 the outcome confirms that the formation of mos2 qds in different phases is affected by the solvent not the temperature of the heat treatment process the formation of mos2 with different phases can be attributed to the presence of various functional groups on samples in particular amino groups were found on the surfaces of n mos2 qds which was explained by the thermal conversion of nmp at high temperature upon evaporation fig s9 the qds prepared by the mechanochemical exfoliation of commercially available mos2 were employed as adsorbent photocatalyst for the removal of rhodamine b as will be discussed in the next section 3 7 rhodamine b removal performance of mos2 qds there is an ever demanding requirement to treat water and waste water bodies in order to remove antigen inorganic and organic pollutants minimizing their negative effects on the human and also aquatic organisms 85 86 nanostructured materials such as carbon nanostructures 87 88 metal oxide 89 and spinel nanoparticles 90 have widely been employed for such applications while quantum dots such as carbon 91 cdte 92 93 gold 94 and bi2moo6 qds 95 have also rarely been used for water purification purposes however mos2 qds have not been employed in the literature for environmental protection purposes to the best of our knowledge in the current research we study the adsorption and photocatalytic performances of c mos2 n mos2 qds and e mos2 qds for the removal of rhodamine b rhb from its solutions for this the standard curve of rhb was first established as shown in fig s10 in which the relationship between the absorbance and concentration of rhb in solution could be found to follow the equation as y 0 2048x 0 014 with the standard deviation is r2 0 9992 uv vis absorbance spectra of rhb after being in contact with the initial mos2 and also qds at various conditions are shown in fig 9 in these curves the intensity of rhb absorbance peak observed at 554 nm is considered to track the dye concentration in the solution providing evidence for the photocatalytic adsorption performances of mos2 qds in contrast with commercial molybdenum disulfide fig 9 a c exhibit the uv vis spectra of rhb 10 ppm solutions in contact with the agent 0 01 g comprising of n mos2 qds e mos2 qds and c mos2 respectively recorded under the led light irradiation with the wavelength value of 385 nm the corresponding c c0 values are shown in fig 9 d according to fig 9 a the uv vis spectrum of rhb solution shows a peak at around 554 nm and the intensity of this peak depends on the concentration of rhb in the solution based on fig s10 according to fig 9 a rhb solution was exposed to n mos2 qds in dark for 20 min to achieve the adsorption equilibrium showing a rhb adsorption rate of 32 mg g and then the light irradiation was initiated as can be observed this sample could provide photocatalytic activity so that after 180 min of led light irradiation 385 nm the degradation of rhb was recorded at 95 in sharp contrast 100 of rhb could be adsorbed on e mos2 qds during the 10 min of adsorption process in dark as shown in fig 9 b the inset observed in fig 9 b shows the initial rhb solution before and after 20 min of adsorption demonstrating the complete removal of the dye therefore e mos2 qds could provide an excellent adsorption capacity on the other hand c mos2 provides a weak adsorption capacity 27 mg g after 20 min while no photocatalytic activity was observed under light irradiation fig 9 e demonstrates the colour changes during the exposure of rhb solution to n mos2 qds in dark and under led light irradiation as can be seen the initial solution has a distinct pinkish red colour which will degrade during the light irradiation to provide 95 dye degradation after 180 min of the process the results obtained indicate that while c mos2 doesn t show a noticeable adsorption capacity or photocatalytic performance mos2 qds show substantially different performances n mos2 qds exhibit a relatively high photocatalytic performance but a weak adsorption capacity in contrast e mos2 qds show an excellent adsorption performance but no obvious photocatalytic performance as shown in figs 9 s10 and s11 e mos2 qds could provide an excellent adsorption performance for rhb with an adsorption capacity of 180 mg g under dark condition outperforming n mos2 qds 32 mg g and c mos2 27 mg g the photocatalytic performance of n mos2 qds is further studied in the next section 3 8 photocatalytic performance of e mos2 qds here we investigate the photocatalytic activity of mos2 qds in contact with rhb solutions of 20 ppm under led light irradiation with various wavelengths namely 365 385 and 450 nm fig 10 shows the uv vis spectra of rhb solutions in contact with e mos2 during the first 20 min in dark the rhb removal is based on the adsorption of dye on the surfaces of qds further demonstrating the outstanding adsorptive dye removal capacity of e mos2 qds reaching around 80 after 20 min however the sample does not provide a considerable photocatalytic performance as demonstrated by the c c0 values of fig 10 d regardless of the led light source the high adsorption performance observed using e mos2 qds can be attributed to the presence of dominating hydroxyl groups on the surfaces of e mos2 qds as demonstrated by the ftir and xps results of figs 5 and 6 wettability of adsorbents toward rhb can significantly be improved by the introduction of surface hydroxyl groups this subsequently increases the adsorption performance of the material through hydrogen bonding as confirmed in the literature for materials such as porous organic polyaminals 2161 mg g 96 silver biochar nanostructures 46 mg g 97 and serpentine tailing 10 mg g 98 here we demonstrated that e mos2 qds functionalised by hydroxyl groups provide a significant rhb adsorption capacity of 180 mg g 3 9 photocatalytic performance of n mos2 qds fig 11 a c show the uv vis absorption spectra of rhb solution 20 ppm in contact with n mos2 qds 100 ppm under led light irradiation of various wavelengths at different time periods the trials were started with 20 min exposure in dark from which the adsorption capacity of n mos2 qds could be estimated to be low at 25 mg g however the subsequent exposure to led light irradiation 365 385 and 450 nm provides evidence for considerably high photocatalytic performance of n mos2 qds it can be observed from fig 11 d that under the visible light irradiation of 450 nm the degradation of rhb could reach 100 after 140 min greater than that obtained under 365 nm 91 and 385 nm 89 fig s11 exhibits the colour change of the rhb solution occurred in the presence of n mos2 qds under various led light sources in contrast with the sharp colour of the initial solution the solution irradiated at 450 nm for 140 min is colourless the enhanced photocatalytic performance of n mos2 qds could be related to the presence of amino carboxyl groups on their surfaces in contrast with dominant hydroxyl groups present on e mos2 qds as realized from the ftir and xps results presented in figs 5 and 6 respectively on the other hand the greater photocatalytic performance n mos2 qds can also be discussed based on the pl results presented in fig 7 this is known that the structural defects of quantum dots can influence their pl and photocatalytic performances 99 therefore the higher photoluminescence intensity of qds can be correlated to their higher photocatalytic performance 100 accordingly the much higher pl intensity of n mos2 qds observed in fig 7 is in agreement with the higher photocatalytic performance of the sample as shown in figs 10 and 11 to further elaborate on this it should be mentioned that the presence of oxygen vacancies and structural defects present in qds can cause binding of photo induced electrons to form excitons leading to the generation of pl signal therefore it is likely that a stronger pl signal is generated where a greater level of such defects is available moreover these defects may function as centres to capture photo induced electrons inhibiting their recombination with photo induced holes providing a greater photocatalytic activity 101 therefore one role of functional groups can be inducing surface defects on qds promoting both pl signal and photocatalytic performance of the material upon exposure to the led light irradiation electrons can be excited from the valance band of n mos2 qds forming electron e and hole h pairs the photogenerated electron and hole pairs travel a short distance on qds to participate in redox reactions before recombination enhancing the photocatalytic activity in aqueous environment water molecules adsorbed on the surfaces of qds interact with e and h to form reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anions in n mos2 qds quantum confinement and structural defects brought about by functional groups promote the active sites and increase the oxidation potential high enough to generate a high yield of reactive oxygen species which could effectively destroy contaminants present in the solution through a variety of interactions resulting in the formation of by products 69 102 as shown in fig 12 the reactions occurred can be summarized as follow 49 2 mos 2 qds r nh 2 hν mos 2 qds r nh 2 e h 3 h 2 o h vb oh h 4 rhb oh co 2 h 2 o 5 o 2 e cb o 2 6 o 2 rhb co 2 h 2 o it should be mentioned that the efficiency of photocatalytic reactions depends on the probability of electron hole recombination which in turn mainly depends on two factors the generation of electrons and holes on surfaces of the catalyst and the transfer of surface charges before recombination 103 the introduction of amino functional groups onto n mos2 qds is beneficial to prolong the lifetime of the excited state in the photocatalytic reaction by stabilising holes thus effectively improving the photocatalytic activity in order to test the reusability of n mos2 qds photocatalyst we employed the same qds in three consecutive experiments for degradation of rhb 20 mg l under visible led light of 450 nm wavelength without conducting any treatment on the photocatalyst after each test fig 13 shows the performance of n mos2 qds while the error bar indicates the uncertainty of the measured data as can be seen the photocatalyst can perfectly be employed in various subsequent experiments without a reduction of the performance as observed from fig 13 a rhb degradation efficiency of 100 could be realized after 140 min of exposure of the solution to the n mos2 qds in contrast only a minor degradation of rhb could be observed after 180 min of the led light irradiation using e mos2 qds and c mos2 as shown in fig 14 despite its poor photocatalytic performance e mos2 qds could exhibit an excellent rhb adsorption with an equilibrium capacity of 180 mg g under dark condition as shown in fig s12a to further demonstrate the photocatalytic performance of n mos2 qds 0 01 g n mos2 qds was added into 100 ml solution of malachite green mg with a concentration of 20 ppm the adsorption and photocatalytic performances of n mos2 qds for mg are shown in fig 15 as can be observed the adsorption of mg onto ods reaches equilibrium under dark condition after 30 min achieving an adsorption capacity of 152 8 mg g then the solution was illuminated by the led light 450 nm as can be seen from fig 15 after 60 min of light illumination 100 degradation of mg was achieved demonstrating the photocatalytic performance of n mos2 qds toward degradation of dye species further research is required to examine the adsorption and photocatalytic activities of qds using alternative dye models and also real wastewater samples 3 10 remark here we reported on a simple and one step mechanochemical method to convert abundant and widely available mos2 flakes into qds using ethanol and nmp as the exfoliation functionalization agents the application of ethanol leads to the formation of 1t phase of qds e mos2 qds which exhibit an excellent rhb adsorption with an equilibrium capacity of 180 mg g under dark condition on the other hand the application of nmp leads to the fabrication of stable 2h phase of qds n mos2 qds with an excellent photocatalytic performance demonstrated by 100 degradation of rhb with the concentration of 20 mg l under the led light irradiation of 450 nm wavelength achieved after 140 min of exposure using a photocatalyst dosage of 0 1 g l the different behaviours of qds prepared using ethanol and nmp were assigned to the presence of hydroxyl groups as the dominant functional groups on e mos2 qds and the presence of amino carboxyl groups on n mos2 qds amino surface groups has reported to be able to enhance the photocatalytic performance of graphene based materials 104 accordingly the function of amino groups on n mos2 qds can be explained based on their lone pair electrons donation performance which can be resonantly conjugated with the photo excited electrons of mos2 qds facilitating the relaxation of photogenerated electrons prolonging the electron lifetime fluorescence properties 105 106 of mos2 qds prepared in this study were discussed based on their distinct morphological and surface characteristics the photocatalytic performance of n mos2 qds was compared with those of mos2 based materials reported in the literature in terms of the preparation methods the precursor materials and photocatalytic performances the outcomes are shown in tables 2 and s2 as well as fig s13 table 2 compares the performance of various nanostructures based on mos2 qds for the degradation removal of dye species including rhb and mg the table also highlights the type of process employed to prepare the agents and the raw materials involved as can be observed such methods often employ molybdenum compounds such as na2moo4 107 108 nh4 2mos4 109 110 nh4 6mo7o24 111 and nh4 2moo4 112 114 116 moreover the methods typically use hazardous chemicals and involve a prolonged processing period in contrast this work proposes a new mechanochemical approach for preparing mos2 quantum dots employing room temperature ball milling of highly available mos2 using substantially reduced amount of chemicals as can be seen in table 2 moreover in this work for the first time we characterized the dye adsorption and degradation performance of functionalized mos2 qds without the involvement of other compounds such as znin2s4 108 g c3n4 ag 109 114 fe2o3 110 sns2 112 tio2 113 si qds 116 bivo4 117 and zno 118 as depicted from table 2 the preparation method employed in this research is relatively simple and the photocatalytic activity of the product is remarkable in comparison with the alternative materials shown in table 2 future work should be directed toward further characterization of 1t and 2h mos2 qds prepared in this research through complementary techniques such as x ray absorption spectroscopy to provide further insight into structural properties of the compounds moreover the photocatalytic performance of the prepared mos2 qds should be further studied for the removal of alternative pollutants from water and also real wastewaters 4 conclusions mos2 qds were synthesized by a potentially green and one step approach based on the wet mechanochemical exfoliation of commercially available mos2 using different solvents the application of nmp led to the formation of n mos2 qds 4 8 nm with 2h modification while the application of ethanol led to the formation of e mos2 qds with 1t crystalline modification ftir and xps analyses manifested that e mos2 qds 4 6 nm is dominantly functionalized by hydroxyl groups in contrast the presence of amino carboxyl groups on n mos2 qds was confirmed based on fluorescence measurements n mos2 qds possess larger stokes shift 134 nm exhibiting brighter and more stable fluorescence features than e mos2 qds 51 nm the surface amino group functionalization of n mos2 qds provided the material with ability to accept donate proton electron pairs enhancing light induced intramolecular electron transfer consequently the 2h n mos2 qds exhibit an excellent photocatalytic performance toward the degradation of rhb demonstrated by 100 degradation of the compound with the concentration of 20 mg l under the led light irradiation of 450 nm wavelength achieved after 140 min of exposure at the photocatalyst dosage of 0 1 g l in contrast the 1t e mos2 qds showed a remarkable adsorption activity due to its surface functional groups with a rhb adsorption capacity of 180 mg g under dark condition this article proposed a facile and scalable strategy for the mechanochemical exfoliation of commercially available bulk mos2 into functionalized qds with distinct photocatalytic and

12453,wet mechanochemical exfoliation of molybdenum disulfide mos2 flakes into mos2 quantum dots qds using various exfoliation agents is studied and the photoluminescence adsorption and photocatalytic activities of qds toward the degradation of rhodamine b rhb are evaluated the application of ethanol as the low boiling point 78 c exfoliation agent leads to the formation of e mos2 qds 4 6 nm with 1t crystalline modification dominately functionalized with hydroxyl groups initial mos2 provides a weak adsorption capacity 27 mg g while no photocatalytic activity is observed under led light irradiation e mos2 qds exhibit a poor photocatalytic performance but an excellent rhb adsorption with an equilibrium capacity of 180 mg g under dark condition in contrast the application of n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp as the high boiling point 202 c exfoliation agent leads to the fabrication of n mos2 qds 4 8 nm with stable 2h crystalline modification n mos2 qds exhibits a limited adsorption capacity 32 mg g but an excellent stability and photocatalytic performance at the photocatalyst dosage of 0 1 g l the degradation rate of dye 20 mg l is recorded at 100 after 140 min of led light 450 nm illumination reusability of n mos2 qds in photocatalysis process is confirmed appropriate energy band gap together with the surface amino carboxyl functional groups are discussed to be responsible for enhanced light induced intramolecular electron transfer thus photocatalytic performance of the material graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords mos2 quantum dot mechanochemistry adsorption photocatalyst dye data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction molybdate with a global availability of more than 20 million tons is mainly made of molybdenum disulfide mos2 making the latter a highly available natural resource 1 2 due to its graphite like layered structure the hexagonal lattice of mos2 is bound by rather weak van der waals forces therefore the compound can be exfoliated to form two or zero dimensional morphologies with interesting properties such as high electrocatalytic activity long term stability in acidic and alkaline conditions easily tunable band gap and enhanced intrinsic spin orbit coupling as well as low cost and high availability 3 5 as such mos2 nanostructures including 2d nanosheets and quantum does qds have largely been studied for electrocatalytic hydrogen oxygen evolution 6 10 and to less extent for other applications such as energy storage devices 11 13 electrochemical sensors 14 drug delivery 15 humidity sensors 16 and light emitting diodes 17 recently the application of mos2 qds in water treatment application has also been reported 18 while further research is required to reveal their potential in such demanding fields apart from possible applications the preparation of mos2 qds has been the subject of several investigations these methods can be categorized into top down and bottom up approaches as reviewed elsewhere 19 the bottom up methods used to synthesis mos2 qds including sol gel chemical vapor deposition atomic layer deposition and hydrothermal methods typically use expensive and environmentally problematic precursors involving prolonged steps 20 21 for example xie et al 22 prepared surface functionalized mos2 qds 4 4 nm using nh4 2mos4 and glutathione as mo and s sources respectively through a hydrothermal process at 200 c for 24 h other methods use precursors such as sodium molybdates and sulphur 23 24 where preparation of precursors is also energy consuming 24 25 in contrast the top down preparation of mos2 qds is based on the exfoliation of bulk mos2 often using ultrasonication of mos2 suspension in organic solvents such as n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp for prolonged time period typically more than 3 h 26 29 the large scale operation of such techniques can be a challenge due to limitations such as lack of the availability of large scale ultrasonic reactors and high costs involved in the manufacturing of such devices 30 31 therefore the development of alternative techniques for scalable clean and low cost preparation of mos2 qds is an interesting topic to be investigated here we investigate the mechanochemical exfoliation of mos2 in the presence of nmp or ethanol without the involvement of ultrasonication providing a simple approach for scalable synthesis of qds mechanochemical methods based on high energy ball milling of species provide a simple green and scalable approach for preparation of nanostructured alloys compounds and composites 32 35 or exfoliation of layered structured materials such as graphite 36 37 and mos2 12 into thinner flakes during the ball milling process the kinetic energy generated by the high energy motion of balls the milling jar and the particles subject to the ball milling causes high energy collisions between the components leading to the breaking down chemical bonds of the particles therefore an efficient ball milling may lead to the reduction of the crystalline and particle sizes to nanometer scale as such the mechanochemical preparation of carbon qds 38 40 thought high energy ball milling of materials such as activated carbon and koh 38 or graphene and sodium carbonate 40 have been reported however to the best of our knowledge there has not been any research work in the literature investigating the mechanochemical preparation of mos2 qds using high energy ball milling approach moreover the performance of mos2 qds in removal of organic contaminants from wastewater has not been received attention in the literature in this study we report on the green and low cost preparation of mos2 qds by means of high energy ball milling using naturally available mos2 as the initial material in the presence of nmp or ethanol moreover the dye adsorption and photocatalytic performances of the products are examined it should be considered that molybdenum disulfide can possess diverse properties since it can exist in three polymorphic forms of hexagonal 2h rhombohedral 3r and octahedral 1t crystal structures 41 42 furthermore the band gap structure of mos2 can be affected by the quantum confinement and edge effects therefore the indirect band gap of bulk mos2 1 2 ev can be tuned into a direct band gap in sufficiently thin species with an enhanced value of greater than 1 8 ev such alteration can provide photoluminescence effects and photoactivity for mos2 qds 43 also a large number of unsaturated bonds can be attached to the edges of the mos2 qds to provide various functionalities 44 these properties in addition to low toxicity high water dispersibility and chemical inertness as well as excellent photostability 45 47 make mos2 a potential candidate for adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds supporting environmental protection having mentioned above here we investigate on mechanochemical treatment of mos2 as a simple low cost high yield and scalable approach for the preparation of mos2 qds as reported in this article the ball milling of commercially available mos2 powder in the presence of nmp leads to the formation of mos2 quantum dots n mos2 qds with stable 2h crystalline structure and amino carboxyl functional groups exhibiting strong fluorescence and excellent photocatalytic performance toward the degradation of rhodamine b rhb this article for the first time report on the mechanochemical preparation of mos2 qds for the efficient adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes 2 experimental 2 1 synthesis of molybdenum disulfide quantum dots a simple potentially green and scalable ball milling strategy was used to fabricate molybdenum disulfide quantum dots mos2 qds in a typical experiment a quantity of 5 g mos2 aladdin cas 1317 33 5 99 5 was mixed with 50 ml of either nmp ar sinopharm group chemical reagent as the high boiling point 202 c exfoliation agent or ethanol ar tianjin fuyu fine chemical as the low boiling point exfoliation agent 78 c then the mixture was transferred into polymeric jars 500 ml the ball milling bm process was conducted for the period of 10 h at 250 rpm using 100 g alumina al2o3 balls d 5 and 10 mm as the milling medium employing a mitr qm qx 2l high energy planetary ball mill device after the bm process the suspension obtained was vacuum filtered through which it was separated into solid and liquid phases the liquid phase containing mos2 qds were dried in an oven at different temperatures depending on the type of the organic solvent to collect mos2 qds powders accordingly nmp containing qds was dried at 202 c for 12 h and the quantum dots obtained are called n mos2 qds likewise drying of ethanol containing qds was performed at 80 c for 12 h and sample obtained is called e mos2 qds based on the amount of the initial mos2 and that of qds obtained the production yields were calculated and the results are shown in table 1 as can be seen the yield of quantum dots prepared using nmp 13 62 is considerably greater than that of ethanol 1 51 the experimental process is shown in fig 1 2 2 adsorption and photocatalytic examination the adsorption and photocatalytic performances of various materials comprising of commercial molybdenum disulfide c mos2 e mos2 qds and n mos2 qds were examined based on the removal of rhb analytical pure tianjin institute of reagents to this end a quantity of 10 mg mos2 material was dispersed in 100 ml rhb solution with different concentrations of 10 and 20 mg l then the suspension obtained was stirred at room temperature using a magnetic stirrer under dark condition for a period of 20 min to achieve the adsorption equilibrium the photocatalytic performance of the catalysts under different light sources was then measured by led light irradiation at various wavelengths of 365 385 and 450 nm samples of 2 ml were subsequently collected from the reaction cell at given time intervals and analyzed by a uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific evolution 220 to indicate the adsorption decomposition of rhb 2 3 morphological structural and surface characterizations the phase analysis was conducted using an x ray diffractometer xrd panalyco fullprof suite software was used to perform the rietveld refinement of the c mos2 a laser raman spectrometer hr800 was employed to record raman spectra using he ne laser wavelength 633 nm uv vis spectrophotometry thermo scientific evolution 220 was used to evaluate the band gap of various materials as well as the concentration of dye present in solutions fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was performed on a vertex 70v ftir spectrometer to elucidate various surface functional groups microstructural characterizations were performed using a jeol jem f200 transmission electron microscope tem and a zeiss ultra plus field emission scanning electron microscope sem the latter was equipped with an energy dispersive x ray eds detector a thermo scientific k alpha instrument was used for x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps measurements employing the al kα rays 1486 6 ev values of zeta potential and particle size distribution of quantum dots were analyzed using a malvern panalyticalzetasizer nano zs90 instrument the measurement was conducted by dispersing qds in deionized water 3 results and discussion 3 1 x ray and raman characterizations the crystalline structure and phase purity of the commercial mos2 c mos2 and the synthesized samples namely e mos2 and n mos2 qds were characterized using powder x ray diffraction and the results are shown in fig 2 a accordingly all diffraction peaks observed in the pattern of c mos2 can be corresponded to the standard card of molybdenum disulfide with hexagonal structure and there are no other peaks indicating the purity of the substance the sharp peak centred at 2ө 14 64 is related to 002 reflection in the hexagonal lattice of mos2 the peaks with lower intensity appeared at 2ө values of 39 78 44 38 and 50 02 can be corresponded to the 103 104 and 106 planes in the lattice respectively the xrd pattern of c mos2 was further analyzed by the rietveld refinement method fig s1 and the lattice parameters extracted are shown in table s1 overall the xrd pattern of c mos2 represents the presence of three dimensional structure of hexagonal mos2 dominantly developed based on 002 crystalline planes the xrd diffractions of e mos2 qds and n mos2 qds are different from that of c mos2 in that there is no obvious diffraction peak in particular the lack of sharp 002 reflection in qds indicates the conversion of the 3d layered structure of hexagonal mos2 into sufficiently thin crystals so that no long range crystallinity could be detected 48 the xrd patterns of mos2 qds obtained by mechanochemical treatment of c mos2 are in agreement with those of mos2 qds obtained by alternative methods 48 49 as exhibited in fig 2 b further characterization of mos2 qds was performed using raman spectroscopy in the spectrum of the commercial mos2 two peaks can clearly be observed at 381 and 407 cm 1 these peaks are assigned to e 2 g 1 and a 1g modes corresponding to the in plane and out of plane vibrational modes of the mos bond respectively according to the literature 50 54 the raman peaks of mos2 qds are rather weak representing their nanostructures moreover the 1t phase mos2 ods may exhibit three new raman peaks denoted as j1 j2 and j3 compared with commercial mos2 the e mos2 qds and n mos2 qds samples synthesized by the mechanochemical treatment of c mos2 exhibit peaks with relatively weak intensity indicating the nanostructured nature of the samples in addition to those of mos2 three new peaks j1 j2 and j3 could be detected in e mos2 qds at 146 236 and 335 cm 1 respectively the intensity of the j2 peak is the weakest among them the presence of these peaks can be assigned to a zone folding mechanism which is caused due to the generation of a superlattice observed only in 1t phase mos2 these three peaks are not allowed in the bulk and 2h phase mos2 qds 50 54 as can be seen in fig 2 b the new peaks characteristics of the 1t phase mos2 could not be detected in the raman spectra of c mos2 and n mos2 qds this observation indicates the absence of the 1t phase in these samples based on these results the mechanochemical treatment of c mos2 with ethanol and nmp is likely to produce e mos2 and n mos2 qds with 1t mos2 and 2h mos2 crystalline modification respectively 3 2 dispersion stability and particle size distribution of mos2 qds the dispersion of e mos2 and n mos2 qds in ethanol and nmp solvents respectively obtained after filtration of bm ed samples can be visually observed in fig 1 distinguished by the different colour of dispersions it was observed that the dispersion of n mos2 in nmp is highly stable over the course of observations 2 months but that of e mos2 in ethanol shows instability after few days to examine the stability of dispersions zeta potential values were measured considering that the high absolute value of the zeta potential indicates repulsive electrostatic forces between individual particles promoting the dispersion stability as the result highly dispersed nanoparticles can be supposed to exhibit values of zeta potential typically greater or less than 30 mv and 30 mv respectively 55 58 according to fig 3 a the value of zeta potential was measured to be 33 3 19 4 and 11 7 mv for c mos2 e mos2 and n mos2 qds respectively the greater zeta potentials of n mos2 qds than that of e mos2 qds is evident confirming the greater dispersion stability of the earlier in order to provide further insights into the stability of two dispersions the mos2 qds were dispersed into distilled water in order to prepare a concentration of 100 mg l the dispersions were left in the laboratory under natural environmental light for 74 days as shown in fig s2 the colour of the e mos2 qds dispersion gradually disappeared while that of n mos2 qds remained almost unchanged indicating that the stability of n mos2 qds is considerably greater than that of e mos2 qds this observation can be attributed to the distinguished 2h crystalline structure of n mos2 qds in contrast with the 1t crystalline structure in e mos2 qds the latter is known to be metastable 59 the particle size distribution of e mos2 and n mos2 qds was analyzed by dispersing the qds in deionized water the results obtained are shown in fig 3 b and b indicating the presence of a single peak at both spectra recorded at 4 136 and 4 187 nm for e mos2 and n mos2 respectively this observation suggests the formation of mos2 nanoparticles with uniform size of around 4 nm 3 3 uv vis and band gap characterization uv vis absorbance spectra recorded on c mos2 e mos2 qds and n mos2 qds dispersions in deionized water 100 mg l are shown if fig 4 a as observed in the inset of this figure c mos2 shows absorption peaks at 213 235 560 and 640 nm which are the characteristic absorption bands of mos2 in the dispersion 60 61 accordingly the peaks at 560 and 640 nm arise from the k point of the brillouin zone moreover peaks at 213 and 235 nm can be corresponded to the m point of the brillouin zone indicative of the direct transition from the deep valence band to the conduction band in contrast the uv vis spectra of n mos2 and e mos2 qds shown in fig 4 a exhibit absorption peaks at 380 and 310 nm which are the characteristic absorption band of mos2 in dispersions 48 49 among them the peak appeared at 380 nm is the excitonic feature of mono dispersed mos2 confirming the greater dispersion stability of n mos2 qds in semiconductor materials the value of band gap energy is an indicative of the minimum energy required to excite an electron from the valence band to the conduction band based on the tauc method the band gap energy eg of a semiconductor can be obtained using its uv vis spectrum employing the following equation 62 63 1 α hʋ m b hʋ e g here α h and ʋ are the absorption coefficient the planck constant and the photon s frequency respectively and b is a constant moreover m is a value determining the type of band gap accordingly the direct and indirect band gaps are represented by values of m 2 and m 1 2 respectively therefore the optical band gap of samples could be determined by plotting αhʋ m against hʋ and the results are shown in fig 4 b d according to the literature the energy band structure of bulk and single layer mos2 can be characterized by the presence of indirect and direct band gap respectively moreover as the thickness of mos2 flakes decreases into nanoscale range the energy band gap gradually increases 64 according to fig 4d c mos2 shows two optical indirect band gap transitions of 1 60 and 1 48 ev the value 1 60 ev is related to the fundamental homo lumo transition optical band gap while the value of 1 48 ev to the trap energy inside the homo lumo gap on the other hand the e mos2 qds fig 4b exhibits only a direct band gap at 1 64 ev the opening of band gap from 1 48 ev in the bulk mos2 to 1 64 ev in the e mos2 qds can be due to the quantum confinement effect in the latter the n mos2 qds shows the widest direct band gap of 2 68 ev among samples which can be related to the strong quantum size effect in this sample this band gap opening also influences the redox potential of the material as well 65 67 the greater band gap value of n mos2 qds than that of e mos2 qds can also be related to their different crystalline modification 2h and 1t phases respectively enhanced energy level observed between the conduction and valence band edges in n mos2 qds enables the material to act as an efficient photocatalytic agent which will be discussed in this article 3 4 surface characterization surface characteristics of e mos2 and n mos2 qds were examined using ftir and xps techniques ftir spectroscopy could provide valuable information about possible surface functional groups present on mos2 qds the ftir spectra of the qds are shown in fig 5 the peaks observed can be explained based on the data available in the literature 47 68 69 accordingly a weak absorption peaks can be seen at 453 and 420 cm 1 for e mos2 and n mos2 qds respectively which could be attributed to the mos stretching vibration mode observed in mos2 apart from the above characteristic peak both samples show the same features comprising of the oh bond stretching peaks at 3414 2515 1270 1052 650 cm 1 ch vibration peaks at 600 733 780 960 cm 1 and peaks related to the co vibration at 1705 and 1640 cm 1 as highlighted in the spectra of fig 5 these peaks indicate the attachment of organic compounds to the surface of mos2 qds in addition the ftir spectrum of e mos2 qds fig 5 a exhibits characteristic peaks related to ch3 vibration at 1492 cm 1 also the peak observed at 1140 cm 1 is attributed to the cc vibration the presence of methyl and sigma bonds can be related to the attachment of functional group originating from ethanol to the surface of mos2 qds it should be noticed that the spectrum of n mos2 qds fig 5 b exhibits a peak at 3423 cm 1 which can be assigned to the nh vibration moreover the peaks at 1430 and 1365 cm 1 are related to the co2 vibration and the one at 1117 cm 1 to the cnhc cnc stretching vibration moreover the peak at 1007 cm 1 is related to the cn stretching frequencies these peaks indicate the presence of 4 methylamino butyric acid 68 71 on the surfaces n mos2 qds carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups present on the surfaces of the prepared mos2 qds can be responsible for their enhanced dispersibility the presence of amino functional group on n mos2 qds can be related to the evaporative separation of nmp from dispersion at 202 c fig 1 during which adsorbed nmp on the surfaces of qds is converted into 4 methylamino butyric acid 68 69 enabling aminocarboxy functionalization of n mos2 qds during this process as shown in fig s3 according to the literature the performance of aminocarboxy functional group could improve the photocatalytic activity of zirconium metal organic framework 70 the formation of aminocarboxy functional group could greatly enhance the photocatalytic activity of n mos2 qds toward the degradation of organic dyes as will be discussed in this article the surface chemistry of mos2 qds was characterized by the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps measurements and results are shown in fig 6 starting from n mos2 qds the high resolution scan of mo 3d peak exhibited in fig 6 b represents three peaks at 231 26 232 03 and 234 81 ev corresponding to mo4 3d5 2 and mo4 3d3 2 respectively 44 71 72 based on fig 6 c the peaks appeared at 164 49 and 168 66 ev are attributed to s 2p1 2 50 these findings confirm that mo and s exist in the mo4 and s2 oxidation state in n mos2 qds same observations could be concluded for e mos2 qd accordingly peaks observed in fig 6 b at 231 79 233 07 and 234 72 ev can be assigned to mo4 3d5 2 and mo4 3d3 2 of mos2 and peaks at around 168 77 ev to the 2p1 2 line of mos2 fig 6 c moreover the peak at 169 96 ev in e mos2 qd is likely to be due to s2o3 2 group 73 74 which could be sourced by interaction between ethanol and mos2 as shown in fig 6 d the n1s core energy level spectrum of n mos2 qds exhibits peaks at 399 74 400 14 and 400 41 ev confirming the presence of nh n and mon bonds respectively 75 confirming the existence of 4 methylamino butyric acid functional group on the n mos2 qds moreover a small amount of n was also detected in e mos2 qds which is attributed to the introduction of nitrogen from air atmosphere during the evaporation of ethanol furthermore the peaks at 532 15 and 531 45 ev fig 6 e correspond to the organic co and coh and the peaks observed at 285 14 and 288 16 fig 6 f to cn and oco bonds further confirming the presence of aminocarboxy functionalization of n mos2 qds high resolution o 1s spectrum of e mos2 qds is shown in fig 6 e this spectrum exhibits the peak at 532 24 ev and 533 26 ev corresponding to oh bond and physically adsorbed oxygen respectively 50 in addition the c 1s spectrum of e mos2 qds fig 6 f exhibits peaks at 284 52 ev cc and 285 83 ev co due to residual ethanol finally the o 1s spectrum of e mos2 qds fig 6 e exhibits a peak at 531 51 ev this peak is attributed to the presence co bond as a conclusion ftir and xps results confirm that e mos2 and n mos2 qds are functionalized by hydroxyl amino and carboxyl groups dominated by the presence of hydroxyl groups on e mos2 qds and amino carboxyl groups on n mos2 qds 3 5 photoluminescence characterization semiconductor quantum dots may provide tuneable photoluminescence performances suggesting them as attractive alternatives for a range of applications this performance can be influenced by dangling bonds present on the surface of qds 76 70 since our mos2 qds contain different functional groups on their surfaces it was speculated that they exhibits different photoluminescence behaviours to investigate this the optical properties of mos2 qds dispersed in water were characterized through measuring of photoluminescence pl and photoluminescence excitation ple the results obtained are presented in fig 7 a and b as can be realized from fig 7 a the sharp pl emission of the e mos2 qds is observed at 411 nm under the light excitation of 360 nm with a stokes shift of 51 nm on the other hand the sharp emission of the n mos2 qds can be seen at 501 nm under 367 nm light excitation with a stokes shift of 134 nm the n mos2 qds having the larger stokes shift exhibit brighter and more stable fluorescence features than e mos2 qds as shown in figs s1 and 6 c it should be mentioned that the red shift of pl emission of qds can be accompanied by an increase in the value of band gap 76 80 which is in agreement with our results shown in figs 7 and 4 c meanwhile the strong emerging photoluminescence in nano meter scaled mos2 is an indicative of the transition from indirect to direct band gap the difference between the photoluminescence features of e and n mos2 qds can be related to different functional groups available on their surfaces as described based on figs 5 and 6 e mos2 qds are functionalized mainly by hydroxyl while n mos2 by amino and carboxyl groups the functional groups could influence the charge transfer pattern on surfaces of qds thus altering their photoluminescence properties as reported for the case of carbon qds elsewhere 81 82 the e mos2 qds and n mos2 qds were photographed under light irradiation of various wavelengths and the outcomes are shown in fig 7 c under lab light condition e and n mos2 qds appear in blue and yellow respectively under the led light irradiation of 365 and 385 nm n mos2 qds provide green photoluminescent emission which is greater at 385 nm under same light irradiation e mos2 qds exhibit blue photoluminescent emission which is greater at 365 nm the photoluminescence effect of our quantum dots occurs around wavelengths where the strongest pl peak appears based on fig 7 a and b additionally qds show an optical peak centred at 275 nm with an edge extending to around 310 nm for the case of e mos2 qds this value can be measured to be 390 nm for the case of n mos2 qds this feature is an indicative for the abundance of surface functional groups on the surfaces mos2 qds 83 3 6 morphological characterizations the morphological features of mos2 qds were studied using scanning and transmission electron microscopy fig 8 a shows the sem micrograph of c mos2 used as the initial material the material can be characterized by the presence of flakes with overall sizes of around 2 μm with irregular shapes and orientations as commonly expected for commercially available mos2 mechanically exfoliated mos2 flakes of the same sample were studied by tem and the results shown in fig 9 b d demonstrate the high crystallinity of the sample fast fourier transform fft pattern recorded on the micrograph of fig 8 c is shown in d where the presence of hexagonally ordered spots is evident the spots indicating the lattice spacing of 0 29 and 0 14 nm can be corresponded to the 004 and 002 crystalline planes in the hexagonal structure of mos2 this sample was used to prepare qds sem micrograph of the as prepared e mos2 qds shown in fig s4 b exhibits agglomerated particles with overall sizes of around 10 μm the agglomeration of qds into large particles was highly possible to occur during the evaporation of ethanol fig 1 which also made a porous structure due to the outflow of the solvent in response to the vacuum drying leaving holes of about 900 nm behind sem micrographs recorded on large particles could still identify the presence of nano metered particles as shown in fig s4 c and d these large agglomerated particles could be easily dispersed in water as can be realized from fig s2 fig s5 shows the sem eds mapping of e mos2 qds revealing the presence of molybdenum sulphur carbon and oxygen homogeneously distributed across the material the results are in agreement with the formation of functionalized mos2 qds confirming the xrd and xps results the mass ratio of mo s obtained from the eds result is 1 3 which is slightly lower than the theoretical value of 1 5 expected for mos2 which can be explained by the semiquantitative nature of the technique however the value obtained in this study is considerably close to the theoretical value in comparison with mos2 qds prepared by other techniques including the hydrothermal treating of ch4n2s and nh4 6mo7o24 at 170 c for 16 h providing an eds mo s mass ration of 2 5 84 tem micrograph of dispersed e mos2 qds is shown in fig 8 e according to this micrograph the presence of fine nanoparticles can be realized size distribution histogram of observed nanoparticles is shown in fig 8 f indicating a peak at 4 6 nm the morphological features of n mos2 qds are relatively similar to those of e mos2 qds fig s6 shows the sem image of n mos2 qds in which the presence of agglomerated nanoparticles can be understood fig s7 shows the sem eds mapping recorded on the sample where the uniform distribution of mo s n and c can be seen indicating the presence of qds with amino carboxyl functional groups as can be observed in fig 8 g and h the size distribution histogram of nanoparticles in n mos2 qds provides maxima at 4 8 nm the tem observations suggest the preparation of e mos2 and n mos2 qds with sizes of around 4 6 and 4 8 nm which are in perfect agreement with the results obtained from the particle size distribution analysis shown in fig 3 b and c during the mechanochemical exfoliation process bulk mos2 could be exfoliated in different solvents of ethanol and nmp into qds and subsequently disperse in the solvent providing the solvent with blue and yellow colours respectively then qds could be retrieved by the evaporation of the solvents at 80 and 202 c for the case of ethanol and nmp respectively according to xrd raman and ftir results e mos2 qds are likely to have 1t phase structure while n mos2 qds have 2h phase structure since the thermal treatment was conducted at different temperature due to the difference between the evaporation temperatures of solvents we further heat treated e mos2 qds at the same temperature of 202 c and examined the raman spectrum of the prepared qds fig s8 the outcome confirms that the formation of mos2 qds in different phases is affected by the solvent not the temperature of the heat treatment process the formation of mos2 with different phases can be attributed to the presence of various functional groups on samples in particular amino groups were found on the surfaces of n mos2 qds which was explained by the thermal conversion of nmp at high temperature upon evaporation fig s9 the qds prepared by the mechanochemical exfoliation of commercially available mos2 were employed as adsorbent photocatalyst for the removal of rhodamine b as will be discussed in the next section 3 7 rhodamine b removal performance of mos2 qds there is an ever demanding requirement to treat water and waste water bodies in order to remove antigen inorganic and organic pollutants minimizing their negative effects on the human and also aquatic organisms 85 86 nanostructured materials such as carbon nanostructures 87 88 metal oxide 89 and spinel nanoparticles 90 have widely been employed for such applications while quantum dots such as carbon 91 cdte 92 93 gold 94 and bi2moo6 qds 95 have also rarely been used for water purification purposes however mos2 qds have not been employed in the literature for environmental protection purposes to the best of our knowledge in the current research we study the adsorption and photocatalytic performances of c mos2 n mos2 qds and e mos2 qds for the removal of rhodamine b rhb from its solutions for this the standard curve of rhb was first established as shown in fig s10 in which the relationship between the absorbance and concentration of rhb in solution could be found to follow the equation as y 0 2048x 0 014 with the standard deviation is r2 0 9992 uv vis absorbance spectra of rhb after being in contact with the initial mos2 and also qds at various conditions are shown in fig 9 in these curves the intensity of rhb absorbance peak observed at 554 nm is considered to track the dye concentration in the solution providing evidence for the photocatalytic adsorption performances of mos2 qds in contrast with commercial molybdenum disulfide fig 9 a c exhibit the uv vis spectra of rhb 10 ppm solutions in contact with the agent 0 01 g comprising of n mos2 qds e mos2 qds and c mos2 respectively recorded under the led light irradiation with the wavelength value of 385 nm the corresponding c c0 values are shown in fig 9 d according to fig 9 a the uv vis spectrum of rhb solution shows a peak at around 554 nm and the intensity of this peak depends on the concentration of rhb in the solution based on fig s10 according to fig 9 a rhb solution was exposed to n mos2 qds in dark for 20 min to achieve the adsorption equilibrium showing a rhb adsorption rate of 32 mg g and then the light irradiation was initiated as can be observed this sample could provide photocatalytic activity so that after 180 min of led light irradiation 385 nm the degradation of rhb was recorded at 95 in sharp contrast 100 of rhb could be adsorbed on e mos2 qds during the 10 min of adsorption process in dark as shown in fig 9 b the inset observed in fig 9 b shows the initial rhb solution before and after 20 min of adsorption demonstrating the complete removal of the dye therefore e mos2 qds could provide an excellent adsorption capacity on the other hand c mos2 provides a weak adsorption capacity 27 mg g after 20 min while no photocatalytic activity was observed under light irradiation fig 9 e demonstrates the colour changes during the exposure of rhb solution to n mos2 qds in dark and under led light irradiation as can be seen the initial solution has a distinct pinkish red colour which will degrade during the light irradiation to provide 95 dye degradation after 180 min of the process the results obtained indicate that while c mos2 doesn t show a noticeable adsorption capacity or photocatalytic performance mos2 qds show substantially different performances n mos2 qds exhibit a relatively high photocatalytic performance but a weak adsorption capacity in contrast e mos2 qds show an excellent adsorption performance but no obvious photocatalytic performance as shown in figs 9 s10 and s11 e mos2 qds could provide an excellent adsorption performance for rhb with an adsorption capacity of 180 mg g under dark condition outperforming n mos2 qds 32 mg g and c mos2 27 mg g the photocatalytic performance of n mos2 qds is further studied in the next section 3 8 photocatalytic performance of e mos2 qds here we investigate the photocatalytic activity of mos2 qds in contact with rhb solutions of 20 ppm under led light irradiation with various wavelengths namely 365 385 and 450 nm fig 10 shows the uv vis spectra of rhb solutions in contact with e mos2 during the first 20 min in dark the rhb removal is based on the adsorption of dye on the surfaces of qds further demonstrating the outstanding adsorptive dye removal capacity of e mos2 qds reaching around 80 after 20 min however the sample does not provide a considerable photocatalytic performance as demonstrated by the c c0 values of fig 10 d regardless of the led light source the high adsorption performance observed using e mos2 qds can be attributed to the presence of dominating hydroxyl groups on the surfaces of e mos2 qds as demonstrated by the ftir and xps results of figs 5 and 6 wettability of adsorbents toward rhb can significantly be improved by the introduction of surface hydroxyl groups this subsequently increases the adsorption performance of the material through hydrogen bonding as confirmed in the literature for materials such as porous organic polyaminals 2161 mg g 96 silver biochar nanostructures 46 mg g 97 and serpentine tailing 10 mg g 98 here we demonstrated that e mos2 qds functionalised by hydroxyl groups provide a significant rhb adsorption capacity of 180 mg g 3 9 photocatalytic performance of n mos2 qds fig 11 a c show the uv vis absorption spectra of rhb solution 20 ppm in contact with n mos2 qds 100 ppm under led light irradiation of various wavelengths at different time periods the trials were started with 20 min exposure in dark from which the adsorption capacity of n mos2 qds could be estimated to be low at 25 mg g however the subsequent exposure to led light irradiation 365 385 and 450 nm provides evidence for considerably high photocatalytic performance of n mos2 qds it can be observed from fig 11 d that under the visible light irradiation of 450 nm the degradation of rhb could reach 100 after 140 min greater than that obtained under 365 nm 91 and 385 nm 89 fig s11 exhibits the colour change of the rhb solution occurred in the presence of n mos2 qds under various led light sources in contrast with the sharp colour of the initial solution the solution irradiated at 450 nm for 140 min is colourless the enhanced photocatalytic performance of n mos2 qds could be related to the presence of amino carboxyl groups on their surfaces in contrast with dominant hydroxyl groups present on e mos2 qds as realized from the ftir and xps results presented in figs 5 and 6 respectively on the other hand the greater photocatalytic performance n mos2 qds can also be discussed based on the pl results presented in fig 7 this is known that the structural defects of quantum dots can influence their pl and photocatalytic performances 99 therefore the higher photoluminescence intensity of qds can be correlated to their higher photocatalytic performance 100 accordingly the much higher pl intensity of n mos2 qds observed in fig 7 is in agreement with the higher photocatalytic performance of the sample as shown in figs 10 and 11 to further elaborate on this it should be mentioned that the presence of oxygen vacancies and structural defects present in qds can cause binding of photo induced electrons to form excitons leading to the generation of pl signal therefore it is likely that a stronger pl signal is generated where a greater level of such defects is available moreover these defects may function as centres to capture photo induced electrons inhibiting their recombination with photo induced holes providing a greater photocatalytic activity 101 therefore one role of functional groups can be inducing surface defects on qds promoting both pl signal and photocatalytic performance of the material upon exposure to the led light irradiation electrons can be excited from the valance band of n mos2 qds forming electron e and hole h pairs the photogenerated electron and hole pairs travel a short distance on qds to participate in redox reactions before recombination enhancing the photocatalytic activity in aqueous environment water molecules adsorbed on the surfaces of qds interact with e and h to form reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anions in n mos2 qds quantum confinement and structural defects brought about by functional groups promote the active sites and increase the oxidation potential high enough to generate a high yield of reactive oxygen species which could effectively destroy contaminants present in the solution through a variety of interactions resulting in the formation of by products 69 102 as shown in fig 12 the reactions occurred can be summarized as follow 49 2 mos 2 qds r nh 2 hν mos 2 qds r nh 2 e h 3 h 2 o h vb oh h 4 rhb oh co 2 h 2 o 5 o 2 e cb o 2 6 o 2 rhb co 2 h 2 o it should be mentioned that the efficiency of photocatalytic reactions depends on the probability of electron hole recombination which in turn mainly depends on two factors the generation of electrons and holes on surfaces of the catalyst and the transfer of surface charges before recombination 103 the introduction of amino functional groups onto n mos2 qds is beneficial to prolong the lifetime of the excited state in the photocatalytic reaction by stabilising holes thus effectively improving the photocatalytic activity in order to test the reusability of n mos2 qds photocatalyst we employed the same qds in three consecutive experiments for degradation of rhb 20 mg l under visible led light of 450 nm wavelength without conducting any treatment on the photocatalyst after each test fig 13 shows the performance of n mos2 qds while the error bar indicates the uncertainty of the measured data as can be seen the photocatalyst can perfectly be employed in various subsequent experiments without a reduction of the performance as observed from fig 13 a rhb degradation efficiency of 100 could be realized after 140 min of exposure of the solution to the n mos2 qds in contrast only a minor degradation of rhb could be observed after 180 min of the led light irradiation using e mos2 qds and c mos2 as shown in fig 14 despite its poor photocatalytic performance e mos2 qds could exhibit an excellent rhb adsorption with an equilibrium capacity of 180 mg g under dark condition as shown in fig s12a to further demonstrate the photocatalytic performance of n mos2 qds 0 01 g n mos2 qds was added into 100 ml solution of malachite green mg with a concentration of 20 ppm the adsorption and photocatalytic performances of n mos2 qds for mg are shown in fig 15 as can be observed the adsorption of mg onto ods reaches equilibrium under dark condition after 30 min achieving an adsorption capacity of 152 8 mg g then the solution was illuminated by the led light 450 nm as can be seen from fig 15 after 60 min of light illumination 100 degradation of mg was achieved demonstrating the photocatalytic performance of n mos2 qds toward degradation of dye species further research is required to examine the adsorption and photocatalytic activities of qds using alternative dye models and also real wastewater samples 3 10 remark here we reported on a simple and one step mechanochemical method to convert abundant and widely available mos2 flakes into qds using ethanol and nmp as the exfoliation functionalization agents the application of ethanol leads to the formation of 1t phase of qds e mos2 qds which exhibit an excellent rhb adsorption with an equilibrium capacity of 180 mg g under dark condition on the other hand the application of nmp leads to the fabrication of stable 2h phase of qds n mos2 qds with an excellent photocatalytic performance demonstrated by 100 degradation of rhb with the concentration of 20 mg l under the led light irradiation of 450 nm wavelength achieved after 140 min of exposure using a photocatalyst dosage of 0 1 g l the different behaviours of qds prepared using ethanol and nmp were assigned to the presence of hydroxyl groups as the dominant functional groups on e mos2 qds and the presence of amino carboxyl groups on n mos2 qds amino surface groups has reported to be able to enhance the photocatalytic performance of graphene based materials 104 accordingly the function of amino groups on n mos2 qds can be explained based on their lone pair electrons donation performance which can be resonantly conjugated with the photo excited electrons of mos2 qds facilitating the relaxation of photogenerated electrons prolonging the electron lifetime fluorescence properties 105 106 of mos2 qds prepared in this study were discussed based on their distinct morphological and surface characteristics the photocatalytic performance of n mos2 qds was compared with those of mos2 based materials reported in the literature in terms of the preparation methods the precursor materials and photocatalytic performances the outcomes are shown in tables 2 and s2 as well as fig s13 table 2 compares the performance of various nanostructures based on mos2 qds for the degradation removal of dye species including rhb and mg the table also highlights the type of process employed to prepare the agents and the raw materials involved as can be observed such methods often employ molybdenum compounds such as na2moo4 107 108 nh4 2mos4 109 110 nh4 6mo7o24 111 and nh4 2moo4 112 114 116 moreover the methods typically use hazardous chemicals and involve a prolonged processing period in contrast this work proposes a new mechanochemical approach for preparing mos2 quantum dots employing room temperature ball milling of highly available mos2 using substantially reduced amount of chemicals as can be seen in table 2 moreover in this work for the first time we characterized the dye adsorption and degradation performance of functionalized mos2 qds without the involvement of other compounds such as znin2s4 108 g c3n4 ag 109 114 fe2o3 110 sns2 112 tio2 113 si qds 116 bivo4 117 and zno 118 as depicted from table 2 the preparation method employed in this research is relatively simple and the photocatalytic activity of the product is remarkable in comparison with the alternative materials shown in table 2 future work should be directed toward further characterization of 1t and 2h mos2 qds prepared in this research through complementary techniques such as x ray absorption spectroscopy to provide further insight into structural properties of the compounds moreover the photocatalytic performance of the prepared mos2 qds should be further studied for the removal of alternative pollutants from water and also real wastewaters 4 conclusions mos2 qds were synthesized by a potentially green and one step approach based on the wet mechanochemical exfoliation of commercially available mos2 using different solvents the application of nmp led to the formation of n mos2 qds 4 8 nm with 2h modification while the application of ethanol led to the formation of e mos2 qds with 1t crystalline modification ftir and xps analyses manifested that e mos2 qds 4 6 nm is dominantly functionalized by hydroxyl groups in contrast the presence of amino carboxyl groups on n mos2 qds was confirmed based on fluorescence measurements n mos2 qds possess larger stokes shift 134 nm exhibiting brighter and more stable fluorescence features than e mos2 qds 51 nm the surface amino group functionalization of n mos2 qds provided the material with ability to accept donate proton electron pairs enhancing light induced intramolecular electron transfer consequently the 2h n mos2 qds exhibit an excellent photocatalytic performance toward the degradation of rhb demonstrated by 100 degradation of the compound with the concentration of 20 mg l under the led light irradiation of 450 nm wavelength achieved after 140 min of exposure at the photocatalyst dosage of 0 1 g l in contrast the 1t e mos2 qds showed a remarkable adsorption activity due to its surface functional groups with a rhb adsorption capacity of 180 mg g under dark condition this article proposed a facile and scalable strategy for the mechanochemical exfoliation of commercially available bulk mos2 into functionalized qds with distinct photocatalytic and

12454,plastic debris is commonplace in aquatic environments and is a means of transportation for several new contaminants including ciprofloxacin cip which also pose risks to ecosystems and public health the interaction of cip with microsized polyethylene terephthalate pet polymers however is not well understood in this study the adsorption and toxicity characteristics of cip with different prepared pet mps such as pristine pr pet acid modified mod pet and thermal oxidatively aged ag pet were studied through both experimental and theoretical calculations and cost benefit analysis the ag pet mps with the highest bet surface area and large pore volume exhibited the best adsorption for cip under different factors with the best stability 450 33 kcal mol as shown by molecular dynamics simulation the adsorption involved both homogenous and heterogenous sites adsorption process although pr pet mps were the least effective adsorbent they were the most economically viable costing 148 75 usd g of cip adsorbed the adsorption of cip on pet mps may have negative impacts on zebrafish and human health by inhibiting cytochrome p450 3a4 and 2d6 protein crystals the study shows that pet mps have great potential for removing cip in practical wastewater treatment and highlights their potential impact on ecosystems keywords adsorption dynamics emerging pollutants interaction mechanisms in silico kinetics simulation toxicity data availability data are presented within the manuscript and its supplementary file 1 introduction an efficient therapy for bacterial infections is the use of antibiotics which can be either synthetic chemicals or natural substances 1 4 ciprofloxacin cip a synthetic fluoroquinolone received a patent in 1980 and became commercially accessible in 1987 it is an essential antibiotic with a wide antibacterial spectrum 1 4 furthermore cip may exhibit synergistic effects with other antibiotic classes such as beta lactam or aminoglycoside making it highly effective in treating illnesses 5 6 despite its popularity cip resistance is rapidly increasing turning it into a concerning form of pollution cip and other antibiotics enter the environment primarily through wastewater treatment plants wwtps which receive antibiotics from various sources such as households hospitals agriculture and industry 7 studies have found significant quantities of cip in hospital effluents sewage water and treated effluent emphasizing its continuous release into the environment 7 8 in some cases extremely high concentrations of cip such as 31 mg l have been detected in wastewater treatment facility effluents highlighting the potential for even higher levels 9 there is a need for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment on a global scale since antibiotic residue such as cip is extremely dangerous to aquatic life including the diversity of algae 10 11 several methods such as adsorption photocatalytic degradation enhanced oxidation and membrane process have been developed and put into use for antibiotic removal 12 the use of non eco friendly adsorbents in the production of adsorbents has been shown to increase the effectiveness of antibiotic removal in line with green chemical techniques 5 most previous studies have involved the use of biomass and clay materials for the removal of cip from wastewater however recent studies on the use of plastic wastes are now gaining more attention from researchers for cip removal 13 microplastics mps are small plastic fibers particles or films with diameters 5 mm they are widespread and difficult to degrade posing a significant environmental threat worldwide 17 mps are derived from the degradation of larger plastic materials releasing plasticizers stabilizers flame retardants and other substances that can directly harm living organisms 17 studies by li et al 18 indicate that mps can penetrate algal cells inhibiting their development and ability to undergo photosynthesis when animals ingest mps it can lead to intestinal damage and other symptoms potentially resulting in death 19 mps have low densities and long atmospheric lifespans making them easily dispersed by wind 20 this poses a health risk to humans and animals that may inhale them furthermore due to their hydrophobicity and large specific surface area mps can readily absorb environmental toxins 21 this characteristic has prompted scientists to explore their potential as adsorbents for water pollution remediation by utilizing mps it may be possible to create inexpensive and effective adsorbents to remove pollutants from water thereby reducing plastic waste in the oceans 21 however it is important to note that when mps adsorb environmental pollutants they may either increase or decrease the toxicity of the adsorbed pollutant and the mp itself to ecosystems 24 adsorption occurs when substances accumulate on the surface of mps mps can attract and retain hydrophobic organic compounds through hydrophobic interactions the surface charge of mps which can be positive or negative influences their affinity for different pollutants and facilitates electrostatic interactions 25 the adsorbent qualities of mps depend on their size shape surface irregularities and chemical composition smaller mps with higher surface area to volume ratios have greater adsorption capacity irregularities on the mp surface provide additional binding sites for pollutants the chemical composition of mps including the type of polymer used affects their adsorption potential environmental conditions like ph and temperature also impact the adsorption process 26 consequently researchers globally are currently evaluating the combined toxicity of mps and emerging pollutants 24 27 nevertheless mps are presently employed as adsorbent for the elimination of cip extensively reviewed by 13 14 these studies have used polyamide pa polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps and polyvinyl chloride pvc mps while there are still many other plastics types commonly found in the environment such as pet are yet to be used and studied in this study the use of pet mps was considered mps must have their qualities evaluated and modified in order to be used effectively for pollution removal for better adsorbent qualities such pore volume surface area and functional groups plastic waste has been manufactured or modified in previous research by ageing or acid modification 13 25 14 in this study we conducted laboratory experiments to investigate the removal of cip using different types of pet mps including pristine modified and aged we also studied how factors such as temperature ph time initial concentration and ionic strength affected the adsorption of cip onto pet mps to assess the economic viability of using adsorption processes for cip removal compared to conventional wastewater treatment methods we conducted a techno economic analysis moreover we used in silico methods to evaluate the potential toxicity of pet and cip to both aquatic organisms and human health both separately and in combination overall our research provides valuable insights into the potential environmental and economic impacts of using pet mps driven removal processes adsorption behavior mechanism was firstly studied using kinetics isotherms and thermodynamics together with atr ftir and sem and further studied by computational method based on sorption simulation and dynamics and density functional theory dft for shortcomings in experiments computational analysis can effectively make up numerous simulations of pollutant adsorption by mps have utilized the gcmc md approach 13 21 25 34 the results of this investigation will contribute to the theoretical underpinning of the experimental work and increase our understanding of the molecular mechanics of sorption which will aid in our comprehension of cip removal by pet mps it will also provide information on the economic feasibility of the process and its potential toxicity to ecosystems when interacting with pet 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals wako pure chemical industries of japan supplied ciprofloxacin analytical standard hydrogen peroxide solution 30 wt sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide for use in the study kishida chemical co provided antipyrine no further purification was performed on any of these compounds unless otherwise specified all tests were conducted using ultrapure water direct q 3uv merck kgaa darmstadt germany the microplastics tested in this investigation were obtained from pet disposable water bottles and other common plastic items 2 2 preparation and characterization of mps sorbent to produce the mps pet plastic bottles were first cut with stainless steel scissors excluding the cap as previously described 14 25 the resulting pieces were further ground using a high speed blender for a minimum of 10 milling cycles with intermediate cooling times the resulting particles were sifted to produce mps with an average size of 500 μm these mps were washed twice with methanol dried and named pr pet to alter the pr pet mps they were treated with 1 m sulfuric acid to produce mod pet particles 14 25 to simulate thermoxidative ageing the pr pet mps were exposed to hydrogen peroxide at 60 c to produce ag pet mps 35 this resulted in the breakdown of the mps the aged samples were washed and air dried at room temperature the production process is depicted in fig s1 the use of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide caused significant chemical changes to the pr pet mps resulting in the mod and ag pet mps with distinct properties the mps were characterized using various methods the morphology was studied using a vp sem and functional groups were identified using an atr ftir system attenuated total reflectance atr pro one base kit jasco ftir 6100 before employing the device to evaluate the mps it was initially blanked to eliminate any background noise the mp sample was then analyzed directly inside the ftir equipment using an infrared range of 400 4000 cm 1 with 64 outputs averaged to achieve a resolution of 4 cm 1 the surface area and thermal stability was determined using the bet model with belsorp minix system tks0 microtracbel corp and a tg dta dtg 60 shimadzu corporation device respectively for the bet isotherms with 30 adsorption and 20 desorption sites were run at liquid nitrogen temperature 77 k while for tg dta the carrier gas ar was injected to fill the furnace for 15 min after the pt cell had been coated with the generated mps 5 mg using an ar stream flow rate of 100 ml min and a warming rate of 10 c min the pet mps were heated from room temperature to 700 c the carbon and hydrogen contents were assessed using a chn corder yanaco chn corder mt 5 yanaco apparatus development laboratory co ltd japan and the c h ratio was calculated the zeta potential was determined using the orp which was measured using the solid addition approach involving adjusting the ph of a nacl solution measuring the orp before and after adding pet mp orp 2 3 adsorption studies the cip solutions of 5 10 20 30 and 50 mg l were prepared by serial dilution from stock of 1000 mg

found in the environment 9 37 38 the regression line had a coefficient of determination of 0 999 indicating that it is both linear and correlates well the batch adsorption procedure was applied in each examination which was done in three fold cip solution 1 5 ml of the necessary concentration was pipet out using pipetman from gilson and transferred to 1 5 ml vial amber glass bottles made by agilent technologies containing pet mps 10 mg the bottles were then shaken using an orbital shaker at 100 rpm stuart ssl1 the effects of ph values 2 4 6 8 and 10 adjusted by using either 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh on adsorption capacity were examined with temperature set at 298 k to 313 k and contact time evaluated at 1 3 7 12 20 and 24 h respectively their effects were evaluated nacl solutions with concentrations of 0 01 0 1 and 1 m were used to assess the effect of ionic concentration after each experiment the solution was filtered from the mps using membrane filters and filtrate analyzed by uv vis then used to calculate the final concentration the residue pet mps residue was also to understand the adsorption process using atr ftir and sem the percentage of cip removed from the aqueous solution and adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was calculated using eqs 1 to 3 which involves variables such as co initial cip concentration ct cip concentration at time t ce cip concentration at

employed for the md simulations to reduce the simulation system and dynamics for temperature effect simulation three temperature was considered including 298 k 303 k and 313 k 2 5 1 density functional theory dft studies the calculations in the study were conducted using the universal force field by applying the dft approach through the dmol3 server in biovia material studio 8 following the method described in previous research 29 39 the visual molecular dynamics analysis in dmol3 was utilized to create a colored illustration of the electrostatic potential esp on the molecular surface this esp calculated by dft was then used to determine the probable adsorption location of the cip molecule onto the pet mps 2 6 pet mps adsorbent regeneration and recycling the capacity of the various pet mps created to regenerate was tested in an experiment 40 after the 50 mg l cip adsorption procedure the adsorbent was sonicated with a solution of 10 ml methanol and 5 ml 3 naoh for 12 h filtered washed dried at 40 c for 3 h and then reused there were five times this entire process was repeated 2 7 cost estimation theory for the adsorption process the techno economic evaluation of the pet mps driven adsorption of the removal of cip from aqueous solution was determined following established the cost benefit analysis model 41 the cost benefit and alternative cost model was used to describe the feasibility of pet mps adsorption of cip beyond removal efficiency following model equation described in eqs 6 to 7 precursor and chemical costs may be calculated using historical data vendor quotations and taking time value of money into account using the formula presented in eq 6 the total cost for the adsorption of cip from the aqueous solution to pet mps was calculated the energy

computation and taken from fig 2 2 8 in silico toxicity evaluation the toxicity pet and cip combination to aquatic organism zebrafish and humans were evaluated cip was adsorbed on pet using adsorption locator module based on simulated annealing in material studio the forcefield were based on compass while electrostatic and vander waals were set as group and atom based the adsorbed cip on pet cip pet is presented in fig s3a the complex formed were saved as protein data bank file used for the toxicity evaluation and compared with control compounds single pet and cip molecules respectively as one of the biological reactions to assess how organic chemicals affect environmental contamination the activation of cytochrome p450 in the fish liver is commonly used 70 this is done in order to study the comprehensive harmful effects of cip pet on aquatic organisms the toxicity of pet mps was assessed using zebrafish as test subjects and the cyp450 protein crystals as the receptor 30 however for human toxicity assessment cyp3a4 and cyp2d6 are the two most crucial enzymes the protein structures of these enzymes were downloaded from the protein data bank pdb fig s3b c and d and processed with discovery studio 4 5 software to ensure accuracy and reliability of the molecular docking procedure the software eliminated docked chemicals and crystallographic water molecules that could interfere with the process the toxicity effects were assessed by conducting molecular docking on the receptor proteins active sites using biovia discovery studio 4 5 the docking of the protein with pet mps and cip was done in autodock vina in pyrx software version 0 8 30 32 33 the native compounds of the respective protein were used as control the controls were abiraterone ritonavir and ajmalicine for cyp450 cyp 3a4 and cyp2d6 respectively the ligand receptor complex was shown using biovia discovery studio 4 5 to show hydrogen bonds and other hydrophobic interactions 2 9 data analysis in order to calculate the concentration calibration curves and the beer lambert equation were utilized in conjunction with the spectrophotometer s absorbance the following software programs were utilized for data analysis origin pro 8 and spss version 23 the median and interquartile range of each experiment s triplicate observations are noted a paired t test with p 0 05 was used to statistically evaluate the effect of the investigated parameters on the cip removal rate by the different pet mps the decision was taken after utilizing q q plots to test the data normality assumption and finding that the data were parametric the adsorption data was also evaluated by kinetics isotherm and thermodynamic models 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of prepared pet mps fig 1 displays the characterization outcomes for produced pet mps and have been discussed previously 14 25 28 fig 1a shows the photographs of the prepared pet mps fig 1b shows the c h ratio surface area monolayer and pore volume of the produced pet mps the ageing process caused by peroxidation and high temperature is thought to be the reason why the ag pet mps typically had the highest values for c h ratio surface area monolayer and pore volume compared to other pet mps adsorbent an interactive cross linked reactive pet product is created during the thermal ageing process in the presence of oxygen which increases the appearance of ch in the structure the surface area and pore volume discovered in this study were highest for ag pet mps fig 1b fig 1c reveals the presence of ch vibrations carbonyl alkyl and oh functional groups in the structure of pet mps however mod and ag pet mps display different characteristics mod pet mps demonstrate a shifted band possibly due to protonation acidification while ag pet mps exhibit a reduced band strength indicating a change in chemical composition these alterations arise from thermoxidative ageing which leads to the destruction of the pet s backbone peroxidation produces a peroxy radical which reacts with free radical pet monomers resulting in the disappearance of the 1099 cm 1 band in pr pet mps creating ag pet mps that are distinct from mod pet mps the modified and aged pet mps have some similarities to pr pet mps in their key functional groups which implies that certain chemical structures have been preserved the treatment process significantly modifies the chemical properties of the pet mps the electric potential of pet mps was measured by subjecting their surface which contains oxidizing groups to equilibrium with reductants in a nacl solution at various ph levels resulting in orp values the orp decreased with increasing ph indicating a negative surface charge on the pet mps among the pet mps ag pet had the highest mean electric potential 25 05 mv across all ph ranges while pr pet and mod pet had mean potentials of 23 20 mv and 12 17 mv respectively this study s findings align with previous research on mp potential 38 43 in general the tga curves of the ag mod and pr pets showed four phases of heat deterioration fig 1e these four phases most likely correlate to the various chemicals that are broken down during the heat degradation of the pet polymer structure most likely co2 and co were lost in the first step followed by c2h6o2 and c2h4o in the second stage c4o2 in the third stage and rco or in the fourth and final stage the produced pr pet mps according to the tga thermograms are stable up to 397 c however as the temperature rises their breakdown begins and is finished at around 588 c when a weight loss of 33 residual fraction of 77 is attained similar to this modified and aged pet mps start to decompose around 397 c and show weight loss as the temperature rises with the exception of the pr pet mps which had a final weight loss of 40 residual fraction of 60 the mod pet mps on the other hand had the highest residual percentage and the least weight loss when compared to other prepared materials tga studies provide useful parameters for material selection for certain applications and provide insight into how polymers react to high temperatures modified and aged pet mps have good heat resistance and may be employed in a variety of technical and environmental applications 44 3 2 pet mps driven cip adsorption experiment 3 2 1 contact time effect and kinetics of adsorption fig 2 displays the findings regarding the impact of contact time on the effectiveness of cip removal by pristine modified and aged pet mps in fig 2a the removal efficiency of cip increased with time until reaching equilibrium at approximately 12 h generally the removal efficiency and adsorption capacity at equilibrium followed ag pet mps 94 1 88 mg g mod pet mps 89 1 78 mg g pr pet mps 87 1 73 mg g fig 7a b the highest removal for the aged mps could due to its large surface area these results are comparable with other studies involving the use of other type of mps for cip removal liu et al 45 using pristine and aged ps and pvc reported removal efficiency 90 for cip at equilibrium time of 24 h xiong et al 38 using ps nps and mps and pvc mps also reported increasing adsorption capacity with time reaching 2 0 mg g at equilibrium time of 10 h similarly yilimulati et al 27 using ps cooh reported equilibrium time of 10 h for cip removal with removal capacity of 2 15 mg g however changfu et al 46 reported equilibrium time of 168 h for aged ps for cip and adsorption capacity of 0 79 mg g adsorption kinetics is frequently used to calculate the rate of adsorption of the adsorbate onto the adsorbent in this work the properties of cip adsorption on pr pet mod pet and ag pet mps were investigated using three non linear kinetic models pfo pso and id eqs 9 to 11 created by ho and mckay 47 and lagergren 48 reflect these models the pfo pso and id rate constants are represented by k1 min 1 k2 g mg min and kid mg g h1 2 respectively the adsorption capacity at equilibrium is given as qe the intercept abbreviated as c sheds light on the boundary layer s thickness 9 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 10 q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 q e k 2 t 11 q t k id t 1 2 c fig 2b d presents the kinetic parameters the pfo model provided the best fit based on the coefficient of determination and error fig 2b but both pfo and pso models showed good fitting with r2 0 9 the pfo model suggests that the initial stage of the adsorption process is relevant and the rate of change of cip uptake with time is proportional to the difference in saturation concentration and the quantity adsorbed over time by different pet mps the pso kinetic model fig 2c indicates that the adsorption process involves both physical and chemical interaction between the pet mps and cip molecules as observed in previous studies chemical interaction involves valence forces and exchange of electrons between the adsorbent and adsorbate due to the presence of ions on the pet mp surface that are in charge of the ion exchange process cip removal is a multi step operation and the intraparticle diffusion model was fitted non linearly to the experimental data to further investigate the adsorption processes fig 2d the sorption process can be divided into three phases with boundary layer diffusion responsible for the initial section intraparticle diffusion for the second section and the third section representing the equilibrium stage the intraparticle diffusion process is limited and additional processes like liquid film diffusion affect the rate as intraparticle diffusion is not the sole factor impacting the rate the id lines did not cross through the origin 3 2 2 initial concentrations effect and isotherm modeling for the adsorption process fig 3 shows the results of the evaluation of the effect of initial cip concentration on its removal by pet mps the cip removal efficiencies and adsorption capacities of the pet mps adsorbent increased as the initial concentration increased the maximum removal efficiencies were observed at an initial cip concentration of 50 mg l with ag pet mps having the highest removal efficiency of 92 79 5 46 followed by mod pet mps with 85 46 9 28 and pr pet mps with 82 89 13 28 similarly the adsorption capacities followed the same trend with ag pet mps having the highest capacity of 6 96 mg g followed by mod pet mps with 6 41 mg g and pr pet mps with 6 22 mg g fig 3b additional research 27 45 46 have also seen a rise in cip removal with increasing concentrations utilizing several types of mps including pp ps and pa as well as a magnetic fullerene nanocomposite made from sustainable pet bottle wastes 40 this phenomenon can be explained by the saturation of the adsorption sites on the surface of the adsorbent the driving force for mass transfer grows together with the initial concentration of cip increasing the adsorbent s capacity the initial concentration facilitates diffusion and mass transfer from the solution with a higher cip concentration to the surface of the adsorbent acting as a catalyst for the adsorption process the data from the effect of cip initial concentration were used for the langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherm modeling fig 3b d the langmuir isotherm assumes that the adsorption of pollutants on the surface of pet mps occurs in a uniform manner at specific locations once a molecule of cip has been absorbed at a particular site no further adsorption can occur at that same location the equation for the langmuir isotherm in its linear form can be found in eq 12 the langmuir constants qm and kl pertain to the ability of a material to adsorb substances measured in mg g and the energy required for the adsorption process measured in l mg respectively 68 12 1 q t 1 q m k l c e 1 q m the freundlich isotherm model suggests that cip molecules adhere to the surface in an irregular manner and form multiple layers the most robust attachment points are filled first and the intensity of the bond depends on the cip s concentration at equilibrium eq 13 represents the linear form of the freundlich isotherm model 13 ln q e 1 n ln c e ln k f where kf mg g l mg 1 n is the freundlich constants and n is the adsorption intensity the temkin isotherm illustrates the effect of indirect interactions between cip and pet mps during adsorption these interactions lead to a decrease in the adsorption heat for all molecules in the layer as coverage increases following a linear pattern this linear pattern is represented by the equation in the temkin isotherm the temkin constant represented by b j mol pertains to the heat absorbed during adsorption while the equilibrium binding constant represented by a l g refers to the binding constant 14 q e b ln c e b ln a the summary of isotherm modeling results is shown in table s1 both langmuir and freundlich isotherm gave the highest correlation r2 0 997 for all adsorbents and thus best fit to describe the cip adsorption by all pet mps while temkin showed the least fitting for all adsorbents these suggest that the adsorption process involves both homogenous and heterogenous sites on the surface of the adsorbents which is in agreement with the study of xiong et al 38 the freundlich equation s n parameter determines the relationship between the concentration of cip solution and the adsorption of pet mps if n is 1 the adsorption is non linear and if n is 1 the adsorption is linear all pet mps had n values 1 in the following order pr pet 0 911 ag pet 0 881 mod pet 0 800 table s1 this implies that cip s adsorption by pet mps was not linear the sorption isotherms for cip onto several mps were non linear according to other investigations 36 adsorption capacity is measured by kf mg g l mg 1 n which was highest for mod pet 12 918 and lowest for pr pet 12 257 the maximal monolayer adsorption capacity qm which is frequently used to assess an absorbent s performance is also included in table s2 the greatest monolayer adsorption capacity of the pet mps created in this investigation was pr pet 17 62 mg g mod pet 12 04 mg g and ag pet 10 56 mg g however when compared with other mps for cip adsorption the results obtained in the current study were higher and lower respectively xiong et al 38 reported values which ranged from 3 5 to 4 5 mg g for pvc and ps while liu et al 45 reported values ranging from 10 2 mg g for ps to 54 8 mg g for aged ps the results generally showed that the pet mps adsorbents demonstrated effective ability to absorb cip and can be used as a solution to eliminate cip from water based solutions 3 2 3 temperature effect and thermodynamics of the adsorption process the temperature effect on the process can alter the reaction from absorbing heat endothermic to releasing heat exothermic or vice versa the impact of temperature can either enhance or decrease the process of adsorption this will vary depending on the combination of the adsorbent and contaminant as the temperature affects the sorption efficiency on one hand it can increase the surface activity and energy of the substance being adsorbed but on the other hand it may also harm the structural integrity of the adsorbent 13 14 in this study the removal efficiency of cip at the different temperatures for the different pet mps is presented in fig 4a generally the trends showed that increasing the solution temperature increased the removal efficiencies which indicates increasing the attractive interactions between the cip molecules and pet mps surface this result of increasing adsorption capacity with increased temperature is in agreement with other studies involving mps according to the findings of choi and choi 49 the capability of adsorption grew as the temperature rose in all levels of cip this conclusion aligns with the discoveries of elessawy et al 40 when temperatures were in the range of 302 k to 314 k however comparing the removal efficiencies for the different adsorbents it followed ag pet pr pet mod pet at 298 and 308 k while followed ag pet mod pet pr pet at 313 k fig 4a in the field of environmental engineering it is important to evaluate spontaneous processes by taking into account both energy and entropy considerations to assess the thermodynamic properties the calculations of gibbs free energy change of adsorption δg in kj mol enthalpy δh in kj mol and entropy δs in j mol k were performed using the following formulas eqs 15 and 16 50 15 g o nrt r stands for the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t for the adsorption temperature and n for the freundlich constant the following formulae can be used to determine how much heat is absorbed or emitted h and how disorderly or unpredictable a system is s the δg values were computed using eq 15 by plotting t against δg the δh and δs values were established from eq 16 16 g o h o t s o fig 4 displays the cip adsorption process of pet mps and includes values for δg δh and δs the process is exergonic as indicated by the negative δg values which increase with temperature this suggests that the process will occur spontaneously as temperature increases at all temperatures the reaction is exothermic and spontaneous according to the values of δh and δs for mod pet and ag pet while pr pet is endothermic a positive δs means that the adsorption process increases randomness at the solid liquid interface indicating a strong affinity for the adsorbate these findings clarify the thermodynamics of the cip adsorption process and provide insight into the different behavior of pet mps with varying modifications 3 2 4 ph effect the ph of the adsorption medium has a significant impact on both the adsorbent and adsorbate making it crucial to optimize the ph for effective adsorption fig 5a demonstrates the influence of solution ph on the removal of cip by pet mps the results indicate that the optimal ph for maximum removal efficiency is at ph 2 with removal rates of 94 67 91 17 and 94 97 for pr pet mps mod pet mps and ag pet mps respectively even at higher ph levels 4 10 removal rates above 50 were achieved except for ag pet mps at ph 6 these findings highlight the importance of considering ph optimization in adsorption research as it can greatly affect the performance of the adsorbent and the efficiency of the adsorption process the comparison of optimum ph for cip with other mps is presented in table s2 the variations observed in different experiments can be explained by factors such as the type of adsorbent used the behavior of cip and the presence of other substances in the solution the charge state of cip which can be a cation zwitterion or anion can vary based on the ph level 2 4 it has been shown that cip is positively charged in in solution of ph 6 05 becomes neutral when is 6 05 ph 9 and then negatively charged at ph 9 fig s4 36 43 45 this led to higher adsorption of pet mps adsorbent at ph 2 as at that ph the oxidative reduction potential of the pet mps was negative fig 1d and therefore had a negative surface charge the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged pet mps and the positively charged cip was increased because cip was positively charged at the same ph fig 5b the main reason that ph had an effect on cip adsorption was due to this electrostatic interaction 3 2 5 effect of ionic strengths on the pet mps driven cip removal processes the presence of dissolved salt ions in natural waters tends to impact the interaction between cips and mps in these bodies of water a solution s level of ion concentration is determined by its ionic strength in water ionic compounds dissolve and separate into individual ions the results for the effect of ionic strength nacl on the cip removal efficiency by the different pet mps is presented in fig s5 the study found that as the concentration of nacl salts increased the removal efficiency of different pet mps decreased out of all the pet mps tested ag pet still had the highest removal efficiency at a concentration of 1 m nacl the removal efficiency ranged from 41 59 0 82 to 47 70 10 28 with a maximum reduction of 51 33 this outcome is consistent with earlier research that discovered that cip adsorption reduced as the ionic strength of the solution rose 2 4 36 however other research has also demonstrated that cip adsorption may rise with salinity level but only up to a particular threshold 15 before falling again 38 the reduced effectiveness of pet mps in removing cip could stem from the inclusion of a na cation exchange in the adsorption process the increasing levels of na in the solution disrupt the balance of charges and neutralize the surface charge of the adsorbent hindering electrostatic interactions and limiting the available binding sites for cip 3 3 computational validation for pet mps driven cip adsorption process 3 3 1 pet mps driven cip sorption energy and density to validate the sorption of cip on pet mps gcmc simulations were performed using the sorption module to determine the sorption energy sorption energy is the energy required to sorb adsorb or absorb one molecule of a substance onto the surface of a solid or onto the interior of a porous material 52 it is often used to describe the strength of the interactions between the sorbate and sorbent and is an important factor in determining the capacity and selectivity of a material for various applications 53 the value of sorption energy depends on various factors including the type of sorbate the nature of the sorbent the temperature and the pressure 53 fig s6 shows the sorption energy for pet mps driven cip adsorption at different temperatures the sorption energy of cip decreased for all pet mps adsorbents with increasing temperature from 298 k to 308 k then it further increased as the temperature increased from 308 k to 313 k in the experimental study it was observed that the increase in temperature resulted to an increase in removal efficiency of the adsorbent fig s6 the results from the simulation therefore agree with the experimental result partially at the temperature range studied however the mean sorption energy followed mod pet mps 86 37 2 47 kcal mol ag pet mps 84 33 6 43 kcal mol pr pet mps 71 33 1 53 kcal mol comparing with the adsorption of phenol using same material 13 the sorption energy was higher for cip it is also higher than the sorption energy reported by li et al 21 for pesticides onto pe mps the sorption analysis conducted at 298 k was further used for the molecular dynamics md simulation the sorption and sorption densities of cip on pr pet mps mod pet mps and ag pet mps is presented in fig 6a f sorption density refers to the amount of a substance that can be sorbed adsorbed or absorbed onto the surface or into the interior of a solid material 53 the sorption density at 298 k distribution followed ag pet mps 1 308 g cm3 mod pet mps 1 164 g cm3 pr pet mps 0 689 g cm3 the enormous surface area of ag pet mps which was substantially different p 0 05 from the other pet mps is what accounts for their high dispersion the high sorption density therefore suggests that the ag pet mps have the best capacity in cip removal in aqueous solution which is in agreement with the experimental studies similar observation was reported for phenol sorption however the pr pet showed better sorption density compared to mod pet mps 13 3 3 2 pet mps driven cip binding energy following the md simulation the binding energy for cip sorption on pet mps adsorbents was computed following eqs 17 and 18 25 17 e e complex e cip e mpsurface 18 e binding kcal mol e the binding energy also known as e binding is calculated as the difference between the single point energies of the cip and pet mps prior to adsorption e cip and e mpsurface and the overall energy of the cip pet mp system after a md simulation e complex e binding is a measure of the strength of the interaction between two or more molecular entities such as atoms ions or molecules it represents the energy required to separate a molecular complex into its individual components a negative e binding indicates a stable and energetically favorable interaction while a positive e binding means that the interaction is energetically unfavorable and the complex is prone to dissociation the magnitude of the binding energy reflects the strength of the interaction and is used to evaluate the stability of molecular complexes 25 the e binding of cip on the different pet mps was all negative indicating that the sorption was stable and energetically favorable table s3 the stability of the pet mps cip complex was determined based on the magnitude of the e binding which followed ag pet 450 33 kcal mol mod pet 225 68 kcal mol pr pet mps 209 38 kcal mol this indicates that the ag pet mps is more stable and thus better adsorbent for the sorption of cip in solution 3 3 3 radial distribution functions rdf for the pet mps cip interaction system the rdf which is sometimes known as the pair correlation function provides a measure of the likelihood of finding two atomic entities i j within a specified radial distance in md simulations 28 this is represented by the function g r which is normalized and given by eq 19 in a spherical shell with a given radius r and thickness dr 54 the rdf is a useful tool for characterizing the spatial organization of atoms in a molecular system 19 g i j r n i j r 4 πr 2 r n i j r 4 πr 2 where n i j r is the number of occurrences of atom pairs between r and r dr the results of the rdf analysis represented by the g r curve for various pet mps cip complexes are shown in fig 6g the peaks of the g r r curve are indicative of the nature of the interactions between the pet mps adsorbent and cip adsorbate specifically chemical and hydrogen bonds are responsible for the peaks that occur when the g r value is below 3 5 å while non bond interactions are responsible for the peaks that occur when g r is above 3 5 å only peaks smaller than 3 5 were produced by ag pet mps cip which may indicate that chemical or hydrogen bonding formed between the cip and ag pet mp further peaks at 10 and 14 were created by the pr pet and mod pet mps respectively this suggests that both chemical or hydrogen bonds and non bonding interactions like electrostatic and vander waals occur during the sorption process of the pr pet and mod pet mps according to md modeling electrostatic interactions and hydrogen or chemical bonding play a major role in the effective cip molecule sorption by pet mps 3 4 atr ftir sem dft analysis and interaction mechanism the adsorption process at its balanced state was observed through the use of atr ftir and sem techniques with the results displayed in fig 7 the sem images in fig 7b demonstrate the appearance of pet mps both prior to and after adsorption before the adsorption of cip the surface of the mps exhibited jagged features such as creases and cracks it was believed that the rough surface of the mps would offer ample areas for cip to adhere to the outcomes suggested that the mps were filled with cip because the surface of the pet mps was smoother following the adsorption for an accurate understanding of the adsorption process the acquired atr ftir spectra were compared with the usual spectra for cip fig 7a all pet mps demonstrated in the post adsorption spectra that the oh group about 3500 cm 1 vanished indicating that it participated in the adsorption process 1 2 4 5 tetrasubstituted benzene rings 865 810 cm 1 and co stretching of the pyridone functional group are both present in cip 55 56 high peaks shown around 1300 cm 1 associated with aromatic c h bonds on pet mps after adsorption were typical of cip spectra suggesting higher adsorption of cip the absorption peaks also indicate that cip may be coupled through hydrogen bonding also as a result the pet mps mostly adsorb cip through hydrogen bonding and π π bonds with the aromatic rings additionally the emergence of the peak at 1628 cm 1 in the post adsorption ftir spectrum which corresponds to co stretching of the pyridone functional group which was specific to cip served as additional evidence that cip was adsorbed by the pet mps the interaction between cip and pet mps was confirmed in the ftir spectrum of the pet mps cip through the absence of the peak at 1300 to 1400 cm 1 which was previously associated with the nh2 bending of the piperazine group in cip 57 and the cf functional group 58 the protonated nh2 group of cip and the carbonyl c o group in pet mps electrostatically bonded to cause the removal of the amine peak that was present in the original cip spectra whereas the cf vanished as a consequence of bonding with the alkyl c h groups on the surface of pet mps the adsorption of cip in the solution often resulted in an increase in peak intensity compared to prior adsorption to put it briefly the primary way that the cip interacts with pet mps adsorbents involves hydrogen bonding π π interactions and electrostatic attraction what sets the adsorption behavior apart is the presence of oxygen containing functional groups which are more plentiful on the surface of aged pet mp particles these groups can form stronger hydrogen bonds with the hydrophilic cip s electronegative atoms leading to an increased ability to adsorb pollutants in comparison to both pristine and modified pet mps a theoretical calculation using dft on the cip molecule was conducted in order to acquire a greater understanding of how cip and pet mps adsorbents interact the geometry optimized structure of cip is shown in fig 7c along with its electrostatic potential esp surface and highest and lowest occupied molecular orbitals respectively essentially the homo or lumo levels of a molecule give insight into how electrons are distributed within a cip species the homo and lumo energies of cip were 5 131 ev and 2 395 ev respectively with an energy gap elumo ehomo of 2 736 ev thus act on the esp energies the molecule s homo energy or its ability to transfer electrons is often used to assess its potential for electron donation meanwhile lumo energy pertains to a molecule s ability to attract electrons which leads to new bonding or interactions higher ehomo values indicate a stronger likelihood of donating electrons to a suitable acceptor molecule with low energy and unoccupied sites thus boosting binding and enhancing adsorption efficiency the surface of the homo mainly consisting of fluoro and piperazin 1 yl substituents while lumo occupied carboxylic acid substituents the esp isosurface colored map fig 7c was presented to facilitate a more precise evaluation of potential adsorption sites the blue and yellow colors in the map depict high and low esp energies respectively the results clearly show that the highest positive esp energy is found on the fluorine and piperazine ring particularly on the amine group for cip the lowest negative esp energy is observed on the side of the carboxylic group similar to the homo and lumo this suggests that cip adsorption onto pet mps is predominantly driven by the piperazine ring and that higher esp energy results in higher cip adsorption capacity 59 furthermore the cip molecules attached to the side of the piperazine ring facing the pet mps adsorbent due to electrostatic attraction between the alkyl c h and co groups in the pet mps this is supported by the atr ftir spectra fig 8 shows a comprehensive illustration of the adsorption and interaction process between various cip species and pet mps based on the combined results of experiments and theoretical calculations 3 5 pet mps adsorbent regeneration and recycling in order to assess the potential for practical application the adsorbent ability to recover was tested after five cycles the results shown in fig 9 revealed that the efficiency of removal remained high and that there were only slight variations in the removal percentage after each cycle of desorption although the fourth and fifth cycle saw a minor and significant decline respectively the new pet mps still had a 50 adsorption capacity proving that the continuous cip treatment of wastewater can be efficiently carried out using pet mps the significant decline observed in the adsorption capacity during the fifth cycle can be attributed to several factors one possible reason is the gradual accumulation of adsorbed pollutants on the surface of the adsorbent pet mps over multiple cycles additionally during the desorption process between cycles some residual pollutants may not be completely removed from the pet mps these residual pollutants can interfere with subsequent adsorption cycles leading to a decrease in the adsorption efficiency over time despite efforts to desorb the adsorbed pollutants some may persist on the surface or within the structure of the pet mps impairing their adsorption performance furthermore during several cycles the physical and chemical characteristics of the pet mps may alter perhaps decreasing their ability for adsorption 60 61 because of the recurrent adsorption desorption processes things like surface degradation changes in surface charge or changes in the accessibility of adsorption sites may happen pollutant removal effectiveness may suffer as a result of these modifications 3 6 cost benefit analysis for the pet mps driven cip removal processes cost benefit analysis cba is a tool used to weigh the potential benefits of a project against its costs to determine if it is economically feasible 42 it is a critical process in project management and decision making as it helps in understanding the trade offs between the costs and benefits of different options the primary goal of cba is to determine if the benefits of a project are worth the investment and to help allocate resources more effectively cost benefit analysis is a crucial tool for ensuring that investments are made in the most efficient and effective manner providing organizations with a better understanding of the long term impact of their decisions 42 the cost evaluation summary is presented in table 1 the estimated energy consumption was 0 004 usd kwh based on unit energy cost in japan as at the month of june 2022 for businesses while the adsorbent production costs was highest for the mod pet 43 usd and lowest for pr pet 19 usd this is due to limited chemical use for the preparation of the pristine adsorbents the project s labor cost included salaries paid to the researchers who participated in it plus taxes and perks one postgraduate researcher student and one research supervisor worked for an average of 5 h per day over the course of 30 days to complete the personnel requirements and synthesis procedure for this study the cost of labor was estimated using the japan minimum wage which is 731 yen h 62 this is equivalent to 5 66 usd h based on exchange rates as at february 2 2023 the labor cost was therefore estimated at 1698 usd for all adsorbent the transportation and rentage of material for adsorption costed 0 usd the pet materials were sourced from a recycling bin at saitama university international house and required no cost for transportation the total cost for cip removal processes was 1717 usd for pr pet 1741 usd for mod pet and 1732 usd for ag pet mps after conducting a cost analysis we found that utilizing pr pet mps is a more cost effective option compared to using modified and aged pet mps this is because pr pet is a readily available waste material that can be obtained easily promoting waste management and recycling of pet plastic waste by using both types of pet this project not only reduces cost but also contributes to environmental protection 3 6 1 cost per gram of cip removed for the pet mps the financial feasibility of the created adsorbent can be established by contrasting the expense of the adsorbent per unit of adsorbate taken away with those of other established adsorbents given that the operational and rejuvenation costs are alike 63 the adsorption cost for the different pet mps is shown in table 1 the adsorption cost followed ag pet mps 668 79 usd g mod pet mps 344 57 usd g pr pet mps 148 75 usd g this indicates that the pr pet cost less compared to other adsorbents which suggests that the modification or ageing may not be needed for the cip removal processes if considering the economic viability the high cost for ag pet is due to it fabrication process and low adsorption capacity at equilibrium which just slightly better than mod pet and ag pet mps 3 7 in silico toxicity evaluation the cytochrome cyp enzyme plays a crucial role in the metabolism of various substances such as drugs steroids insecticides fat soluble vitamins carcinogens and others these enzymes are significant in domains such as drug drug interactions and endocrine function it helps the body eliminate most medications and toxins by its oxidative chemistry the operation of this pathway is dependent on the ability to form protein protein complexes with electron transfer partners and other proteins however interaction with another compound mps can result in inhibition altering the cyp structure or stability and leading to deficiencies or alternative biotransformation pathways which can increase toxicity 30 out of the 50 enzymes in this class two of the most important cyp3a4 and cyp2d6 metabolize 90 of drugs 69 the toxicity of cip and pet mps as single and combined pollutants to aquatic organisms and human health was examined based on its inhibition of cytochrome cyp enzyme and results in comparison to control compounds is presented in fig 10 for the zebrafish danio rerio the cip pet and pet cip showed lower binding affinities than the control 9 8 kcal mol indicating lower toxicity to zebrafish however for human based on cyp34a only pet 9 1 kcal mol and combined pet and cip 9 2 kcal mol showed high binding affinity than control compound 8 3 kcal mol the cip had a binding affinity of 8 1 kcal mol and thus showed low toxicity to the protein however all ligands cip pet and pet cip showed higher toxicity than the control 6 3 kcal mol to cyp2d6 the results generally suggest that the adsorption of cip on pet reduced the toxicity of cip to zebrafish while increasing pet toxicity furthermore to human the toxicities generally increased compared to when the pollutants is acting alone the increased in toxicity suggests that the interaction is synergistic this implies that the combined presence of plastics and cip may pose higher risks to human health if ingested and combined via adsorption the limited research on the joint toxicity of mps and chemical pollutants cip on aquatic life and human health makes comparisons difficult yilimulati et al 27 conducted an experiment to determine the impact of ps cooh on its own cip on its own and cip absorbed by ps cooh on the survival rate of c elegans the study found that c elegans had a survival rate of over 82 when exposed to various concentrations of cip alone while the survival rate was around 61 and 48 for ps cooh mps the absorption of cip by ps cooh further reduced the survival rate of c elegans these findings align with our results that demonstrated that the adsorption of cip onto pet heightened the toxicity of both pollutants especially to human cyp enzymes fig 10 furthermore studies by ma et al 64 and yang et al 65 on zebrafish have demonstrated that when in the presence of polystyrene the accumulation of phenanthrene in its body increases as a result of adsorption onto the microplastic surface furthermore the joint toxic effects of phenanthrene and nanoparticles were found to have a synergistic effect on zebrafish these findings are in line with our own results to further understand the interaction of the ligands and the protein the 2d interactions was evaluated and results is shown in fig s7 the interaction for control pet and cip generally interacted via carbon conventional hydrogen bonds and alkyl and pi alkyl interactions however the cip pet showed further interaction via pi sigma bond with glutamic acid glu296 amino acid residue of the zebrafish protein with the human cyp3a4 and cyp2d6 protein fig s7b c more interaction was shown which may be responsible for its high binding affinity particularly for the pet the pet interacted via carbon hydrogen bonds pi hydrogen bond pi sulfur pi pi stacked and alkyl bonding similar interaction was obtained for pet cip indicating that the pet was still primarily used for the binding on the protein after adsorbing cip fig s7biv civ however when cip was acting alone towards human cyp3a4 protein fig s7biii pi anion pi pi t shaped attractive charges and halogen fluorine bonds was formed with the protein while cyp2d6 protein the interaction involved carbon conventional hydrogen bonds via glutamine gln threonine thr and phenylalanine phe amino acids residues while also alkyl and pi alkyl interactions via arginine amino acid residues fig s7ciii the conventional belief is that hydrogen bonds play a key role in promoting the interaction between proteins and ligands thereby enhancing the stability of the complex hydrogen bonds such as nho oho ohn and nhn are frequently the main sources of stability in biomolecules carbon on the other hand does not have the ability to form hydrogen bonds as it has a lower electronegativity compared to nitrogen and oxygen 66 the hydrophobic effect also contributes to the binding of a ligand to a receptor as shown by enyoh et al 31 hydrophobic interactions including alkyl bonding pi sigma pi hydrogen bond pi sulfur pi pi stacked and pi anion are known to take place according to chen et al 67 the hydrophobic effect has a significant impact on the binding of mps additives to cytochrome p450 receptors and an increase in hydrophobic contacts could improve the body s ability to bind substances another type of noncovalent interaction that can occur between an electron rich atom or group and a halogen atom such as fluorine is known as halogen bonding or fluorine bonding although it is considered weaker than covalent bonds it can still significantly alter the molecular characteristics additionally unfavorable donor donor interactions including hindrances in spatial arrangement and opposing charges were noticed in human cyp3a4 protein as depicted in fig s7bii iv the stability of pet and cip activity is affected by these adverse bonds any negative interaction that occurs between or within the protein ligand complex weakens the complex s stability as these bonds represent a repelling force between two molecules and an atom 4 conclusion the research investigated the adsorption of cip an antibiotic onto different types of pet mps microplastics three types of pet mps were studied pristine modified and aged the study found that the adsorption process involves physical and chemical interactions and occurs in multiple steps the efficiency of cip removal increased with higher initial concentrations and temperatures the order of effectiveness of the pet mps was ag pet mod pet pr pet different models were used to explain the adsorption process including boundary layer diffusion and intra particle diffusion each type of pet mp had a different maximum monolayer capacity for cip adsorption with pr pet having the highest capacity and ag pet having the lowest the adsorption process was spontaneous and exothermic except for pr pet which was spontaneous and endothermic the optimal ph for cip removal was 2 due to the negative oxidative reduction potential of the pet mps surface however the presence of dissolved salts reduced the adsorption capacity of pet mps theoretical analysis confirmed the experimental results and showed that the sorption of cip onto pet mps was stable and energetically favorable ag pet was the most stable and effective adsorbent ftir spectra indicated the formation of specific linkages between cip and pet mps the electrostatic attraction between the piperazine ring of cip and the alkyl and co groups in pet mps played a crucial role in driving adsorption pet mps demonstrated strong reversibility of adsorption the study suggested that pet mps especially ag pet could be used effectively for cip removal in wastewater treatment with pr pet being the most cost effective option however the combination of pet mps and cip showed increased toxicity to aquatic organisms and humans highlighting the potential risks of microplastics as carriers of pollutants future research should assess the environmental risks of micro and nanoplastics and evaluate the efficiency of pet mps in removing contaminants from real world wastewater containing

12454,plastic debris is commonplace in aquatic environments and is a means of transportation for several new contaminants including ciprofloxacin cip which also pose risks to ecosystems and public health the interaction of cip with microsized polyethylene terephthalate pet polymers however is not well understood in this study the adsorption and toxicity characteristics of cip with different prepared pet mps such as pristine pr pet acid modified mod pet and thermal oxidatively aged ag pet were studied through both experimental and theoretical calculations and cost benefit analysis the ag pet mps with the highest bet surface area and large pore volume exhibited the best adsorption for cip under different factors with the best stability 450 33 kcal mol as shown by molecular dynamics simulation the adsorption involved both homogenous and heterogenous sites adsorption process although pr pet mps were the least effective adsorbent they were the most economically viable costing 148 75 usd g of cip adsorbed the adsorption of cip on pet mps may have negative impacts on zebrafish and human health by inhibiting cytochrome p450 3a4 and 2d6 protein crystals the study shows that pet mps have great potential for removing cip in practical wastewater treatment and highlights their potential impact on ecosystems keywords adsorption dynamics emerging pollutants interaction mechanisms in silico kinetics simulation toxicity data availability data are presented within the manuscript and its supplementary file 1 introduction an efficient therapy for bacterial infections is the use of antibiotics which can be either synthetic chemicals or natural substances 1 4 ciprofloxacin cip a synthetic fluoroquinolone received a patent in 1980 and became commercially accessible in 1987 it is an essential antibiotic with a wide antibacterial spectrum 1 4 furthermore cip may exhibit synergistic effects with other antibiotic classes such as beta lactam or aminoglycoside making it highly effective in treating illnesses 5 6 despite its popularity cip resistance is rapidly increasing turning it into a concerning form of pollution cip and other antibiotics enter the environment primarily through wastewater treatment plants wwtps which receive antibiotics from various sources such as households hospitals agriculture and industry 7 studies have found significant quantities of cip in hospital effluents sewage water and treated effluent emphasizing its continuous release into the environment 7 8 in some cases extremely high concentrations of cip such as 31 mg l have been detected in wastewater treatment facility effluents highlighting the potential for even higher levels 9 there is a need for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment on a global scale since antibiotic residue such as cip is extremely dangerous to aquatic life including the diversity of algae 10 11 several methods such as adsorption photocatalytic degradation enhanced oxidation and membrane process have been developed and put into use for antibiotic removal 12 the use of non eco friendly adsorbents in the production of adsorbents has been shown to increase the effectiveness of antibiotic removal in line with green chemical techniques 5 most previous studies have involved the use of biomass and clay materials for the removal of cip from wastewater however recent studies on the use of plastic wastes are now gaining more attention from researchers for cip removal 13 microplastics mps are small plastic fibers particles or films with diameters 5 mm they are widespread and difficult to degrade posing a significant environmental threat worldwide 17 mps are derived from the degradation of larger plastic materials releasing plasticizers stabilizers flame retardants and other substances that can directly harm living organisms 17 studies by li et al 18 indicate that mps can penetrate algal cells inhibiting their development and ability to undergo photosynthesis when animals ingest mps it can lead to intestinal damage and other symptoms potentially resulting in death 19 mps have low densities and long atmospheric lifespans making them easily dispersed by wind 20 this poses a health risk to humans and animals that may inhale them furthermore due to their hydrophobicity and large specific surface area mps can readily absorb environmental toxins 21 this characteristic has prompted scientists to explore their potential as adsorbents for water pollution remediation by utilizing mps it may be possible to create inexpensive and effective adsorbents to remove pollutants from water thereby reducing plastic waste in the oceans 21 however it is important to note that when mps adsorb environmental pollutants they may either increase or decrease the toxicity of the adsorbed pollutant and the mp itself to ecosystems 24 adsorption occurs when substances accumulate on the surface of mps mps can attract and retain hydrophobic organic compounds through hydrophobic interactions the surface charge of mps which can be positive or negative influences their affinity for different pollutants and facilitates electrostatic interactions 25 the adsorbent qualities of mps depend on their size shape surface irregularities and chemical composition smaller mps with higher surface area to volume ratios have greater adsorption capacity irregularities on the mp surface provide additional binding sites for pollutants the chemical composition of mps including the type of polymer used affects their adsorption potential environmental conditions like ph and temperature also impact the adsorption process 26 consequently researchers globally are currently evaluating the combined toxicity of mps and emerging pollutants 24 27 nevertheless mps are presently employed as adsorbent for the elimination of cip extensively reviewed by 13 14 these studies have used polyamide pa polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps and polyvinyl chloride pvc mps while there are still many other plastics types commonly found in the environment such as pet are yet to be used and studied in this study the use of pet mps was considered mps must have their qualities evaluated and modified in order to be used effectively for pollution removal for better adsorbent qualities such pore volume surface area and functional groups plastic waste has been manufactured or modified in previous research by ageing or acid modification 13 25 14 in this study we conducted laboratory experiments to investigate the removal of cip using different types of pet mps including pristine modified and aged we also studied how factors such as temperature ph time initial concentration and ionic strength affected the adsorption of cip onto pet mps to assess the economic viability of using adsorption processes for cip removal compared to conventional wastewater treatment methods we conducted a techno economic analysis moreover we used in silico methods to evaluate the potential toxicity of pet and cip to both aquatic organisms and human health both separately and in combination overall our research provides valuable insights into the potential environmental and economic impacts of using pet mps driven removal processes adsorption behavior mechanism was firstly studied using kinetics isotherms and thermodynamics together with atr ftir and sem and further studied by computational method based on sorption simulation and dynamics and density functional theory dft for shortcomings in experiments computational analysis can effectively make up numerous simulations of pollutant adsorption by mps have utilized the gcmc md approach 13 21 25 34 the results of this investigation will contribute to the theoretical underpinning of the experimental work and increase our understanding of the molecular mechanics of sorption which will aid in our comprehension of cip removal by pet mps it will also provide information on the economic feasibility of the process and its potential toxicity to ecosystems when interacting with pet 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals wako pure chemical industries of japan supplied ciprofloxacin analytical standard hydrogen peroxide solution 30 wt sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide for use in the study kishida chemical co provided antipyrine no further purification was performed on any of these compounds unless otherwise specified all tests were conducted using ultrapure water direct q 3uv merck kgaa darmstadt germany the microplastics tested in this investigation were obtained from pet disposable water bottles and other common plastic items 2 2 preparation and characterization of mps sorbent to produce the mps pet plastic bottles were first cut with stainless steel scissors excluding the cap as previously described 14 25 the resulting pieces were further ground using a high speed blender for a minimum of 10 milling cycles with intermediate cooling times the resulting particles were sifted to produce mps with an average size of 500 μm these mps were washed twice with methanol dried and named pr pet to alter the pr pet mps they were treated with 1 m sulfuric acid to produce mod pet particles 14 25 to simulate thermoxidative ageing the pr pet mps were exposed to hydrogen peroxide at 60 c to produce ag pet mps 35 this resulted in the breakdown of the mps the aged samples were washed and air dried at room temperature the production process is depicted in fig s1 the use of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide caused significant chemical changes to the pr pet mps resulting in the mod and ag pet mps with distinct properties the mps were characterized using various methods the morphology was studied using a vp sem and functional groups were identified using an atr ftir system attenuated total reflectance atr pro one base kit jasco ftir 6100 before employing the device to evaluate the mps it was initially blanked to eliminate any background noise the mp sample was then analyzed directly inside the ftir equipment using an infrared range of 400 4000 cm 1 with 64 outputs averaged to achieve a resolution of 4 cm 1 the surface area and thermal stability was determined using the bet model with belsorp minix system tks0 microtracbel corp and a tg dta dtg 60 shimadzu corporation device respectively for the bet isotherms with 30 adsorption and 20 desorption sites were run at liquid nitrogen temperature 77 k while for tg dta the carrier gas ar was injected to fill the furnace for 15 min after the pt cell had been coated with the generated mps 5 mg using an ar stream flow rate of 100 ml min and a warming rate of 10 c min the pet mps were heated from room temperature to 700 c the carbon and hydrogen contents were assessed using a chn corder yanaco chn corder mt 5 yanaco apparatus development laboratory co ltd japan and the c h ratio was calculated the zeta potential was determined using the orp which was measured using the solid addition approach involving adjusting the ph of a nacl solution measuring the orp before and after adding pet mp orp 2 3 adsorption studies the cip solutions of 5 10 20 30 and 50 mg l were prepared by serial dilution from stock of 1000 mg l following atugoda et al 36 these concentrations were chosen for calibration of the uv vis spectrophotometer uv mini 1240 shimadzu 206 24000 92 japan at a wavelength of 281 nm because they can be found in the environment 9 37 38 the regression line had a coefficient of determination of 0 999 indicating that it is both linear and correlates well the batch adsorption procedure was applied in each examination which was done in three fold cip solution 1 5 ml of the necessary concentration was pipet out using pipetman from gilson and transferred to 1 5 ml vial amber glass bottles made by agilent technologies containing pet mps 10 mg the bottles were then shaken using an orbital shaker at 100 rpm stuart ssl1 the effects of ph values 2 4 6 8 and 10 adjusted by using either 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh on adsorption capacity were examined with temperature set at 298 k to 313 k and contact time evaluated at 1 3 7 12 20 and 24 h respectively their effects were evaluated nacl solutions with concentrations of 0 01 0 1 and 1 m were used to assess the effect of ionic concentration after each experiment the solution was filtered from the mps using membrane filters and filtrate analyzed by uv vis then used to calculate the final concentration the residue pet mps residue was also to understand the adsorption process using atr ftir and sem the percentage of cip removed from the aqueous solution and adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was calculated using eqs 1 to 3 which involves variables such as co initial cip concentration ct cip concentration at time t ce cip concentration at equilibrium qe quantity of cip adsorbed at equilibrium by the mps qt quantity of cip adsorbed at a specific time by the pet mps v volume of the solution and m mass of sorbent 1 r c o c t c o 2 q e c o

the variance and the subscripts exp and cal stand for the experimental and calculated values respectively to get the best model output the objective should be to attain the lowest error with and the highest with r2 correlations 2 5 computational validation of adsorption processes as previously mentioned the biovia material studio 8 dassault systèmes usa program was used to perform the gcmc md simulation 14 29 in order to save energy the mps and cip were created in silico using 3d atomistic then optimized geometrically using compass forcefield in fig s2 the optimized pr mod and ag pet mps are shown both the gcmc simulation and the md simulation were performed using the ms software s sorption and forcite modules with the system temperature adjusted to 298 k a clever approach was employed for the md simulations to reduce the simulation system and dynamics for temperature effect simulation three temperature was considered including 298 k 303 k and 313 k 2 5 1 density functional theory dft studies the calculations in the study were conducted using the universal force field by applying the dft approach through the dmol3 server in biovia material studio 8 following the method described in previous research 29 39 the visual molecular dynamics analysis in dmol3 was utilized to create a colored illustration of the electrostatic potential esp on the molecular surface this esp calculated by dft was then used to determine the probable adsorption location of the cip molecule onto the pet mps 2 6 pet mps adsorbent regeneration and recycling the capacity of the various pet mps created to regenerate was tested in an experiment 40 after the 50 mg l cip adsorption procedure the adsorbent was sonicated with a solution of 10 ml methanol and 5 ml 3 naoh for 12 h filtered washed dried at 40 c for 3 h and then reused there were five times this entire process was repeated 2 7 cost estimation theory for the adsorption process the techno economic evaluation of the pet mps driven adsorption of the removal of cip from aqueous solution was determined following established the cost benefit analysis model 41 the cost benefit and alternative cost model was used to describe the feasibility of pet mps adsorption of cip beyond removal efficiency following model equation described in eqs 6 to 7 precursor and chemical costs may be calculated using historical data vendor quotations and taking time value of money into account using the formula presented in eq 6 the total cost for the adsorption of cip from the aqueous solution to pet mps was calculated the energy consumption e c was evaluated using eq 2 41 and given by 6 e c p c f t c where pc is the power consumption by devices i e filtrations pump 0 012 kw oven 1 3 kw and uv vis 0 05 kw f is a load factor in

including the cost of adsorbent production cost of labor cost of energy and cm is costs incurred from transportation and rentage 41 7 t c c p c l c m 2 7 1 cost per gram of adsorbate removed for the adsorbent as demonstrated in eq 8 the cost of an adsorbent per gram of adsorbate may be utilized to calculate the cost of the adsorption operation per adsorbent employed 42 applications in large scale industry can be scaled up using this 8 adsorption cost usd g adsorbate chemical purchase cost usd g energy consumption usd g kwh adsorptio n capacity mg g 10 3 g mg the cost of chemical purchase were obtained from wako chemicals as at 3rd february 2023 i e methanol cost was 19 usd 500 ml https labchem wako fujifilm com us product detail w01w0113 0947 html h2o2 was 15 usd 100 ml https labchem wako

computation and taken from fig 2 2 8 in silico toxicity evaluation the toxicity pet and cip combination to aquatic organism zebrafish and humans were evaluated cip was adsorbed on pet using adsorption locator module based on simulated annealing in material studio the forcefield were based on compass while electrostatic and vander waals were set as group and atom based the adsorbed cip on pet cip pet is presented in fig s3a the complex formed were saved as protein data bank file used for the toxicity evaluation and compared with control compounds single pet and cip molecules respectively as one of the biological reactions to assess how organic chemicals affect environmental contamination the activation of cytochrome p450 in the fish liver is commonly used 70 this is done in order to study the comprehensive harmful effects of cip pet on aquatic organisms the toxicity of pet mps was assessed using zebrafish as test subjects and the cyp450 protein crystals as the receptor 30 however for human toxicity assessment cyp3a4 and cyp2d6 are the two most crucial enzymes the protein structures of these enzymes were downloaded from the protein data bank pdb fig s3b c and d and processed with discovery studio 4 5 software to ensure accuracy and reliability of the molecular docking procedure the software eliminated docked chemicals and crystallographic water molecules that could interfere with the process the toxicity effects were assessed by conducting molecular docking on the receptor proteins active sites using biovia discovery studio 4 5 the docking of the protein with pet mps and cip was done in autodock vina in pyrx software version 0 8 30 32 33 the native compounds of the respective protein were used as control the controls were abiraterone ritonavir and ajmalicine for cyp450 cyp 3a4 and cyp2d6 respectively the ligand receptor complex was shown using biovia discovery studio 4 5 to show hydrogen bonds and other hydrophobic interactions 2 9 data analysis in order to calculate the concentration calibration curves and the beer lambert equation were utilized in conjunction with the spectrophotometer s absorbance the following software programs were utilized for data analysis origin pro 8 and spss version 23 the median and interquartile range of each experiment s triplicate observations are noted a paired t test with p 0 05 was used to statistically evaluate the effect of the investigated parameters on the cip removal rate by the different pet mps the decision was taken after utilizing q q plots to test the data normality assumption and finding that the data were parametric the adsorption data was also evaluated by kinetics isotherm and thermodynamic models 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of prepared pet mps fig 1 displays the characterization outcomes for produced pet mps and have been discussed previously 14 25 28 fig 1a shows the photographs of the prepared pet mps fig 1b shows the c h ratio surface area monolayer and pore volume of the produced pet mps the ageing process caused by peroxidation and high temperature is thought to be the reason why the ag pet mps typically had the highest values for c h ratio surface area monolayer and pore volume compared to other pet mps adsorbent an interactive cross linked reactive pet product is created during the thermal ageing process in the presence of oxygen which increases the appearance of ch in the structure the surface area and pore volume discovered in this study were highest for ag pet mps fig 1b fig 1c reveals the presence of ch vibrations carbonyl alkyl and oh functional groups in the structure of pet mps however mod and ag pet mps display different characteristics mod pet mps demonstrate a shifted band possibly due to protonation acidification while ag pet mps exhibit a reduced band strength indicating a change in chemical composition these alterations arise from thermoxidative ageing which leads to the destruction of the pet s backbone peroxidation produces a peroxy radical which reacts with free radical pet monomers resulting in the disappearance of the 1099 cm 1 band in pr pet mps creating ag pet mps that are distinct from mod pet mps the modified and aged pet mps have some similarities to pr pet mps in their key functional groups which implies that certain chemical structures have been preserved the treatment process significantly modifies the chemical properties of the pet mps the electric potential of pet mps was measured by subjecting their surface which contains oxidizing groups to equilibrium with reductants in a nacl solution at various ph levels resulting in orp values the orp decreased with increasing ph indicating a negative surface charge on the pet mps among the pet mps ag pet had the highest mean electric potential 25 05 mv across all ph ranges while pr pet and mod pet had mean potentials of 23 20 mv and 12 17 mv respectively this study s findings align with previous research on mp potential 38 43 in general the tga curves of the ag mod and pr pets showed four phases of heat deterioration fig 1e these four phases most likely correlate to the various chemicals that are broken down during the heat degradation of the pet polymer structure most likely co2 and co were lost in the first step followed by c2h6o2 and c2h4o in the second stage c4o2 in the third stage and rco or in the fourth and final stage the produced pr pet mps according to the tga thermograms are stable up to 397 c however as the temperature rises their breakdown begins and is finished at around 588 c when a weight loss of 33 residual fraction of 77 is attained similar to this modified and aged pet mps start to decompose around 397 c and show weight loss as the temperature rises with the exception of the pr pet mps which had a final weight loss of 40 residual fraction of 60 the mod pet mps on the other hand had the highest residual percentage and the least weight loss when compared to other prepared materials tga studies provide useful parameters for material selection for certain applications and provide insight into how polymers react to high temperatures modified and aged pet mps have good heat resistance and may be employed in a variety of technical and environmental applications 44 3 2 pet mps driven cip adsorption experiment 3 2 1 contact time effect and kinetics of adsorption fig 2 displays the findings regarding the impact of contact time on the effectiveness of cip removal by pristine modified and aged pet mps in fig 2a the removal efficiency of cip increased with time until reaching equilibrium at approximately 12 h generally the removal efficiency and adsorption capacity at equilibrium followed ag pet mps 94 1 88 mg g mod pet mps 89 1 78 mg g pr pet mps 87 1 73 mg g fig 7a b the highest removal for the aged mps could due to its large surface area these results are comparable with other studies involving the use of other type of mps for cip removal liu et al 45 using pristine and aged ps and pvc reported removal efficiency 90 for cip at equilibrium time of 24 h xiong et al 38 using ps nps and mps and pvc mps also reported increasing adsorption capacity with time reaching 2 0 mg g at equilibrium time of 10 h similarly yilimulati et al 27 using ps cooh reported equilibrium time of 10 h for cip removal with removal capacity of 2 15 mg g however changfu et al 46 reported equilibrium time of 168 h for aged ps for cip and adsorption capacity of 0 79 mg g adsorption kinetics is frequently used to calculate the rate of adsorption of the adsorbate onto the adsorbent in this work the properties of cip adsorption on pr pet mod pet and ag pet mps were investigated using three non linear kinetic models pfo pso and id eqs 9 to 11 created by ho and mckay 47 and lagergren 48 reflect these models the pfo pso and id rate constants are represented by k1 min 1 k2 g mg min and kid mg g h1 2 respectively the adsorption capacity at equilibrium is given as qe the

provided the best fit based on the coefficient of determination and error fig 2b but both pfo and pso models showed good fitting with r2 0 9 the pfo model suggests that the initial stage of the adsorption process is relevant and the rate of change of cip uptake with time is proportional to the difference in saturation concentration and the quantity adsorbed over time by different pet mps the pso kinetic model fig 2c indicates that the adsorption process involves both physical and chemical interaction between the pet mps and cip molecules as observed in previous studies chemical interaction involves valence forces and exchange of electrons between the adsorbent and adsorbate due to the presence of ions on the pet mp surface that are in charge of the ion exchange process cip removal is a multi step operation and the intraparticle diffusion model was fitted non linearly to the experimental data to further investigate the adsorption processes fig 2d the sorption process can be divided into three phases with boundary layer diffusion responsible for the initial section intraparticle diffusion for the second section and the third section representing the equilibrium stage the intraparticle diffusion process is limited and additional processes like liquid film diffusion affect the rate as intraparticle diffusion is not the sole factor impacting the rate the id lines did not cross through the origin 3 2 2 initial concentrations effect and isotherm modeling for the adsorption process fig 3 shows the results of the evaluation of the effect of initial cip concentration on its removal by pet mps the cip removal efficiencies and adsorption capacities of the pet mps adsorbent increased as the initial concentration increased the maximum removal efficiencies were observed at an initial cip concentration of 50 mg l with ag pet mps having the highest removal efficiency of 92 79 5 46 followed by mod pet mps with 85 46 9 28 and pr pet mps with 82 89 13 28 similarly the adsorption capacities followed the same trend with ag pet mps having the highest capacity of 6 96 mg g followed by mod pet mps with 6 41 mg g and pr pet mps with 6 22 mg g fig 3b additional research 27 45 46 have also seen a rise in cip removal with increasing concentrations utilizing several types of mps including pp ps and pa as well as a magnetic fullerene nanocomposite made from sustainable pet bottle wastes 40 this phenomenon can be explained by the saturation of the adsorption sites on the surface of the adsorbent the driving force for mass transfer grows together with the initial concentration of cip increasing the adsorbent s capacity the initial concentration facilitates diffusion and mass transfer from the solution with a higher cip concentration to the surface of the adsorbent acting as a catalyst for the adsorption process the data from the effect of cip initial concentration were used for the langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherm modeling fig 3b d the langmuir isotherm assumes that the adsorption of pollutants on the surface of pet mps occurs in a uniform manner at specific locations once a molecule of cip has been absorbed at a particular site no further adsorption can occur at that same location the equation for the langmuir isotherm in its linear form can be found in eq 12 the langmuir constants qm and kl pertain to the ability of a material to adsorb substances measured in mg g and the energy required for the adsorption process measured in l mg respectively 68 12 1 q t 1 q m k l c e 1 q m the freundlich isotherm model suggests that cip molecules adhere to the surface in an irregular manner and form multiple layers the most robust attachment points are filled first and the intensity of the bond depends on the cip s concentration at equilibrium eq 13 represents the linear form of the freundlich isotherm model 13 ln q e 1 n ln c e ln k f where kf mg g l mg 1 n is the freundlich constants and n is the adsorption intensity the temkin isotherm illustrates the effect of indirect interactions between cip and pet mps during adsorption these interactions lead to a decrease in the adsorption heat for all molecules in the layer as coverage increases following a linear pattern this linear pattern is represented by the equation in the temkin isotherm the temkin constant represented by b j mol pertains to the heat absorbed during adsorption while the equilibrium binding constant represented by a l g refers to the binding constant 14 q e b ln c e b ln a the summary of isotherm modeling results is shown in table s1 both langmuir and freundlich isotherm gave the highest correlation r2 0 997 for all adsorbents and thus best fit to describe the cip adsorption by all pet mps while temkin showed the least fitting for all adsorbents these suggest that the adsorption process involves both homogenous and heterogenous sites on the surface of the adsorbents which is in agreement with the study of xiong et al 38 the freundlich equation s n parameter determines the relationship between the concentration of cip solution and the adsorption of pet mps if n is 1 the adsorption is non linear and if n is 1 the adsorption is linear all pet mps had n values 1 in the following order pr pet 0 911 ag pet 0 881 mod pet 0 800 table s1 this implies that cip s adsorption by pet mps was not linear the sorption isotherms for cip onto several mps were non linear according to other investigations 36 adsorption capacity is measured by kf mg g l mg 1 n which was highest for mod pet 12 918 and lowest for pr pet 12 257 the maximal monolayer adsorption capacity qm which is frequently used to assess an absorbent s performance is also included in table s2 the greatest monolayer adsorption capacity of the pet mps created in this investigation was pr pet 17 62 mg g mod pet 12 04 mg g and ag pet 10 56 mg g however when compared with other mps for cip adsorption the results obtained in the current study were higher and lower respectively xiong et al 38 reported values which ranged from 3 5 to 4 5 mg g for pvc and ps while liu et al 45 reported values ranging from 10 2 mg g for ps to 54 8 mg g for aged ps the results generally showed that the pet mps adsorbents demonstrated effective ability to absorb cip and can be used as a solution to eliminate cip from water based solutions 3 2 3 temperature effect and thermodynamics of the adsorption process the temperature effect on the process can alter the reaction from absorbing heat endothermic to releasing heat exothermic or vice versa the impact of temperature can either enhance or decrease the process of adsorption this will vary depending on the combination of the adsorbent and contaminant as the temperature affects the sorption efficiency on one hand it can increase the surface activity and energy of the substance being adsorbed but on the other hand it may also harm the structural integrity of the adsorbent 13 14 in this study the removal efficiency of cip at the different temperatures for the different pet mps is presented in fig 4a generally the trends showed that increasing the solution temperature increased the removal efficiencies which indicates increasing the attractive interactions between the cip molecules and pet mps surface this result of increasing adsorption capacity with increased temperature is in agreement with other studies involving mps according to the findings of choi and choi 49 the capability of adsorption grew as the temperature rose in all levels of cip this conclusion aligns with the discoveries of elessawy et al 40 when temperatures were in the range of 302 k to 314 k however comparing the removal efficiencies for the different adsorbents it followed ag pet pr pet mod pet at 298 and 308 k while followed ag pet mod pet pr pet at 313 k fig 4a in the field of environmental engineering it is important to evaluate spontaneous processes by taking into account both energy and entropy considerations to assess the thermodynamic properties the calculations of gibbs free energy change of adsorption δg in kj mol enthalpy δh in kj mol and entropy δs in j mol k were performed using the following formulas eqs 15 and 16 50 15 g o nrt r stands for the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t for the adsorption temperature and n for the freundlich constant the following formulae can be used to determine how much heat is absorbed or emitted h and how disorderly or unpredictable a system is s the δg values were computed using eq 15 by plotting t against δg the δh and δs values were established from eq 16 16 g o h o t s o fig 4 displays the cip adsorption process of pet mps and includes values for δg δh and δs the process is exergonic as indicated by the negative δg values which increase with temperature this suggests that the process will occur spontaneously as temperature increases at all temperatures the reaction is exothermic and spontaneous according to the values of δh and δs for mod pet and ag pet while pr pet is endothermic a positive δs means that the adsorption process increases randomness at the solid liquid interface indicating a strong affinity for the adsorbate these findings clarify the thermodynamics of the cip adsorption process and provide insight into the different behavior of pet mps with varying modifications 3 2 4 ph effect the ph of the adsorption medium has a significant impact on both the adsorbent and adsorbate making it crucial to optimize the ph for effective adsorption fig 5a demonstrates the influence of solution ph on the removal of cip by pet mps the results indicate that the optimal ph for maximum removal efficiency is at ph 2 with removal rates of 94 67 91 17 and 94 97 for pr pet mps mod pet mps and ag pet mps respectively even at higher ph levels 4 10 removal rates above 50 were achieved except for ag pet mps at ph 6 these findings highlight the importance of considering ph optimization in adsorption research as it can greatly affect the performance of the adsorbent and the efficiency of the adsorption process the comparison of optimum ph for cip with other mps is presented in table s2 the variations observed in different experiments can be explained by factors such as the type of adsorbent used the behavior of cip and the presence of other substances in the solution the charge state of cip which can be a cation zwitterion or anion can vary based on the ph level 2 4 it has been shown that cip is positively charged in in solution of ph 6 05 becomes neutral when is 6 05 ph 9 and then negatively charged at ph 9 fig s4 36 43 45 this led to higher adsorption of pet mps adsorbent at ph 2 as at that ph the oxidative reduction potential of the pet mps was negative fig 1d and therefore had a negative surface charge the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged pet mps and the positively charged cip was increased because cip was positively charged at the same ph fig 5b the main reason that ph had an effect on cip adsorption was due to this electrostatic interaction 3 2 5 effect of ionic strengths on the pet mps driven cip removal processes the presence of dissolved salt ions in natural waters tends to impact the interaction between cips and mps in these bodies of water a solution s level of ion concentration is determined by its ionic strength in water ionic compounds dissolve and separate into individual ions the results for the effect of ionic strength nacl on the cip removal efficiency by the different pet mps is presented in fig s5 the study found that as the concentration of nacl salts increased the removal efficiency of different pet mps decreased out of all the pet mps tested ag pet still had the highest removal efficiency at a concentration of 1 m nacl the removal efficiency ranged from 41 59 0 82 to 47 70 10 28 with a maximum reduction of 51 33 this outcome is consistent with earlier research that discovered that cip adsorption reduced as the ionic strength of the solution rose 2 4 36 however other research has also demonstrated that cip adsorption may rise with salinity level but only up to a particular threshold 15 before falling again 38 the reduced effectiveness of pet mps in removing cip could stem from the inclusion of a na cation exchange in the adsorption process the increasing levels of na in the solution disrupt the balance of charges and neutralize the surface charge of the adsorbent hindering electrostatic interactions and limiting the available binding sites for cip 3 3 computational validation for pet mps driven cip adsorption process 3 3 1 pet mps driven cip sorption energy and density to validate the sorption of cip on pet mps gcmc simulations were performed using the sorption module to determine the sorption energy sorption energy is the energy required to sorb adsorb or absorb one molecule of a substance onto the surface of a solid or onto the interior of a porous material 52 it is often used to describe the strength of the interactions between the sorbate and sorbent and is an important factor in determining the capacity and selectivity of a material for various applications 53 the value of sorption energy depends on various factors including the type of sorbate the nature of the sorbent the temperature and the pressure 53 fig s6 shows the sorption energy for pet mps driven cip adsorption at different temperatures the sorption energy of cip decreased for all pet mps adsorbents with increasing temperature from 298 k to 308 k then it further increased as the temperature increased from 308 k to 313 k in the experimental study it was observed that the increase in temperature resulted to an increase in removal efficiency of the adsorbent fig s6 the results from the simulation therefore agree with the experimental result partially at the temperature range studied however the mean sorption energy followed mod pet mps 86 37 2 47 kcal mol ag pet mps 84 33 6 43 kcal mol pr pet mps 71 33 1 53 kcal mol comparing with the adsorption of phenol using same material 13 the sorption energy was higher for cip it is also higher than the sorption energy reported by li et al 21 for pesticides onto pe mps the sorption analysis conducted at 298 k was further used for the molecular dynamics md simulation the sorption and sorption densities of cip on pr pet mps mod pet mps and ag pet mps is presented in fig 6a f sorption density refers to the amount of a substance that can be sorbed adsorbed or absorbed onto the surface or into the interior of a solid material 53 the sorption density at 298 k distribution followed ag pet mps 1 308 g cm3 mod pet mps 1 164 g cm3 pr pet mps 0 689 g cm3 the enormous surface area of ag pet mps which was substantially different p 0 05 from the other pet mps is what accounts for their high dispersion the high sorption density therefore suggests that the ag pet mps have the best capacity in cip removal in aqueous solution which is in agreement with the experimental studies similar observation was reported for phenol sorption however the pr pet showed better sorption density compared to mod pet mps 13 3 3 2 pet mps driven cip binding energy following the md simulation the binding energy for cip sorption on pet mps adsorbents was computed following eqs 17 and 18 25 17 e e complex e cip e mpsurface 18 e binding kcal mol e the binding energy also known as e binding is calculated as the difference between the single point energies of the cip and pet mps prior to adsorption e cip and e mpsurface and the overall energy of the cip pet mp system after a md simulation e complex e binding is a measure of the strength of the interaction between two or more molecular entities such as atoms ions or molecules it represents the energy required to separate a molecular complex into its individual components a negative e binding indicates a stable and energetically favorable interaction while a positive e binding means that the interaction is energetically unfavorable and the complex is prone to dissociation the magnitude of the binding energy reflects the strength of the interaction and is used to evaluate the stability of molecular complexes 25 the e binding of cip on the different pet mps was all negative indicating that the sorption was stable and energetically favorable table s3 the stability of the pet mps cip complex was determined based on the magnitude of the e binding which followed ag pet 450 33 kcal mol mod pet 225 68 kcal mol pr pet mps 209 38 kcal mol this indicates that the ag pet mps is more stable and thus better adsorbent for the sorption of cip in solution 3 3 3 radial distribution functions rdf for the pet mps cip interaction system the rdf which is sometimes known as the pair correlation function provides a measure of the likelihood of finding two atomic entities i j within a specified radial distance in md simulations 28 this is represented by the function g r which is normalized and given by eq 19 in a spherical shell with a given radius r and thickness dr 54 the rdf is a useful tool for characterizing the spatial organization of atoms in a molecular system 19 g i j r n i j r 4 πr 2 r n i j r 4 πr 2 where n i j r is the number of occurrences of atom pairs between r and r dr the results of the rdf analysis represented by the g r curve for various pet mps cip complexes are shown in fig 6g the peaks of the g r r curve are indicative of the nature of the interactions between the pet mps adsorbent and cip adsorbate specifically chemical and hydrogen bonds are responsible for the peaks that occur when the g r value is below 3 5 å while non bond interactions are responsible for the peaks that occur when g r is above 3 5 å only peaks smaller than 3 5 were produced by ag pet mps cip which may indicate that chemical or hydrogen bonding formed between the cip and ag pet mp further peaks at 10 and 14 were created by the pr pet and mod pet mps respectively this suggests that both chemical or hydrogen bonds and non bonding interactions like electrostatic and vander waals occur during the sorption process of the pr pet and mod pet mps according to md modeling electrostatic interactions and hydrogen or chemical bonding play a major role in the effective cip molecule sorption by pet mps 3 4 atr ftir sem dft analysis and interaction mechanism the adsorption process at its balanced state was observed through the use of atr ftir and sem techniques with the results displayed in fig 7 the sem images in fig 7b demonstrate the appearance of pet mps both prior to and after adsorption before the adsorption of cip the surface of the mps exhibited jagged features such as creases and cracks it was believed that the rough surface of the mps would offer ample areas for cip to adhere to the outcomes suggested that the mps were filled with cip because the surface of the pet mps was smoother following the adsorption for an accurate understanding of the adsorption process the acquired atr ftir spectra were compared with the usual spectra for cip fig 7a all pet mps demonstrated in the post adsorption spectra that the oh group about 3500 cm 1 vanished indicating that it participated in the adsorption process 1 2 4 5 tetrasubstituted benzene rings 865 810 cm 1 and co stretching of the pyridone functional group are both present in cip 55 56 high peaks shown around 1300 cm 1 associated with aromatic c h bonds on pet mps after adsorption were typical of cip spectra suggesting higher adsorption of cip the absorption peaks also indicate that cip may be coupled through hydrogen bonding also as a result the pet mps mostly adsorb cip through hydrogen bonding and π π bonds with the aromatic rings additionally the emergence of the peak at 1628 cm 1 in the post adsorption ftir spectrum which corresponds to co stretching of the pyridone functional group which was specific to cip served as additional evidence that cip was adsorbed by the pet mps the interaction between cip and pet mps was confirmed in the ftir spectrum of the pet mps cip through the absence of the peak at 1300 to 1400 cm 1 which was previously associated with the nh2 bending of the piperazine group in cip 57 and the cf functional group 58 the protonated nh2 group of cip and the carbonyl c o group in pet mps electrostatically bonded to cause the removal of the amine peak that was present in the original cip spectra whereas the cf vanished as a consequence of bonding with the alkyl c h groups on the surface of pet mps the adsorption of cip in the solution often resulted in an increase in peak intensity compared to prior adsorption to put it briefly the primary way that the cip interacts with pet mps adsorbents involves hydrogen bonding π π interactions and electrostatic attraction what sets the adsorption behavior apart is the presence of oxygen containing functional groups which are more plentiful on the surface of aged pet mp particles these groups can form stronger hydrogen bonds with the hydrophilic cip s electronegative atoms leading to an increased ability to adsorb pollutants in comparison to both pristine and modified pet mps a theoretical calculation using dft on the cip molecule was conducted in order to acquire a greater understanding of how cip and pet mps adsorbents interact the geometry optimized structure of cip is shown in fig 7c along with its electrostatic potential esp surface and highest and lowest occupied molecular orbitals respectively essentially the homo or lumo levels of a molecule give insight into how electrons are distributed within a cip species the homo and lumo energies of cip were 5 131 ev and 2 395 ev respectively with an energy gap elumo ehomo of 2 736 ev thus act on the esp energies the molecule s homo energy or its ability to transfer electrons is often used to assess its potential for electron donation meanwhile lumo energy pertains to a molecule s ability to attract electrons which leads to new bonding or interactions higher ehomo values indicate a stronger likelihood of donating electrons to a suitable acceptor molecule with low energy and unoccupied sites thus boosting binding and enhancing adsorption efficiency the surface of the homo mainly consisting of fluoro and piperazin 1 yl substituents while lumo occupied carboxylic acid substituents the esp isosurface colored map fig 7c was presented to facilitate a more precise evaluation of potential adsorption sites the blue and yellow colors in the map depict high and low esp energies respectively the results clearly show that the highest positive esp energy is found on the fluorine and piperazine ring particularly on the amine group for cip the lowest negative esp energy is observed on the side of the carboxylic group similar to the homo and lumo this suggests that cip adsorption onto pet mps is predominantly driven by the piperazine ring and that higher esp energy results in higher cip adsorption capacity 59 furthermore the cip molecules attached to the side of the piperazine ring facing the pet mps adsorbent due to electrostatic attraction between the alkyl c h and co groups in the pet mps this is supported by the atr ftir spectra fig 8 shows a comprehensive illustration of the adsorption and interaction process between various cip species and pet mps based on the combined results of experiments and theoretical calculations 3 5 pet mps adsorbent regeneration and recycling in order to assess the potential for practical application the adsorbent ability to recover was tested after five cycles the results shown in fig 9 revealed that the efficiency of removal remained high and that there were only slight variations in the removal percentage after each cycle of desorption although the fourth and fifth cycle saw a minor and significant decline respectively the new pet mps still had a 50 adsorption capacity proving that the continuous cip treatment of wastewater can be efficiently carried out using pet mps the significant decline observed in the adsorption capacity during the fifth cycle can be attributed to several factors one possible reason is the gradual accumulation of adsorbed pollutants on the surface of the adsorbent pet mps over multiple cycles additionally during the desorption process between cycles some residual pollutants may not be completely removed from the pet mps these residual pollutants can interfere with subsequent adsorption cycles leading to a decrease in the adsorption efficiency over time despite efforts to desorb the adsorbed pollutants some may persist on the surface or within the structure of the pet mps impairing their adsorption performance furthermore during several cycles the physical and chemical characteristics of the pet mps may alter perhaps decreasing their ability for adsorption 60 61 because of the recurrent adsorption desorption processes things like surface degradation changes in surface charge or changes in the accessibility of adsorption sites may happen pollutant removal effectiveness may suffer as a result of these modifications 3 6 cost benefit analysis for the pet mps driven cip removal processes cost benefit analysis cba is a tool used to weigh the potential benefits of a project against its costs to determine if it is economically feasible 42 it is a critical process in project management and decision making as it helps in understanding the trade offs between the costs and benefits of different options the primary goal of cba is to determine if the benefits of a project are worth the investment and to help allocate resources more effectively cost benefit analysis is a crucial tool for ensuring that investments are made in the most efficient and effective manner providing organizations with a better understanding of the long term impact of their decisions 42 the cost evaluation summary is presented in table 1 the estimated energy consumption was 0 004 usd kwh based on unit energy cost in japan as at the month of june 2022 for businesses while the adsorbent production costs was highest for the mod pet 43 usd and lowest for pr pet 19 usd this is due to limited chemical use for the preparation of the pristine adsorbents the project s labor cost included salaries paid to the researchers who participated in it plus taxes and perks one postgraduate researcher student and one research supervisor worked for an average of 5 h per day over the course of 30 days to complete the personnel requirements and synthesis procedure for this study the cost of labor was estimated using the japan minimum wage which is 731 yen h 62 this is equivalent to 5 66 usd h based on exchange rates as at february 2 2023 the labor cost was therefore estimated at 1698 usd for all adsorbent the transportation and rentage of material for adsorption costed 0 usd the pet materials were sourced from a recycling bin at saitama university international house and required no cost for transportation the total cost for cip removal processes was 1717 usd for pr pet 1741 usd for mod pet and 1732 usd for ag pet mps after conducting a cost analysis we found that utilizing pr pet mps is a more cost effective option compared to using modified and aged pet mps this is because pr pet is a readily available waste material that can be obtained easily promoting waste management and recycling of pet plastic waste by using both types of pet this project not only reduces cost but also contributes to environmental protection 3 6 1 cost per gram of cip removed for the pet mps the financial feasibility of the created adsorbent can be established by contrasting the expense of the adsorbent per unit of adsorbate taken away with those of other established adsorbents given that the operational and rejuvenation costs are alike 63 the adsorption cost for the different pet mps is shown in table 1 the adsorption cost followed ag pet mps 668 79 usd g mod pet mps 344 57 usd g pr pet mps 148 75 usd g this indicates that the pr pet cost less compared to other adsorbents which suggests that the modification or ageing may not be needed for the cip removal processes if considering the economic viability the high cost for ag pet is due to it fabrication process and low adsorption capacity at equilibrium which just slightly better than mod pet and ag pet mps 3 7 in silico toxicity evaluation the cytochrome cyp enzyme plays a crucial role in the metabolism of various substances such as drugs steroids insecticides fat soluble vitamins carcinogens and others these enzymes are significant in domains such as drug drug interactions and endocrine function it helps the body eliminate most medications and toxins by its oxidative chemistry the operation of this pathway is dependent on the ability to form protein protein complexes with electron transfer partners and other proteins however interaction with another compound mps can result in inhibition altering the cyp structure or stability and leading to deficiencies or alternative biotransformation pathways which can increase toxicity 30 out of the 50 enzymes in this class two of the most important cyp3a4 and cyp2d6 metabolize 90 of drugs 69 the toxicity of cip and pet mps as single and combined pollutants to aquatic organisms and human health was examined based on its inhibition of cytochrome cyp enzyme and results in comparison to control compounds is presented in fig 10 for the zebrafish danio rerio the cip pet and pet cip showed lower binding affinities than the control 9 8 kcal mol indicating lower toxicity to zebrafish however for human based on cyp34a only pet 9 1 kcal mol and combined pet and cip 9 2 kcal mol showed high binding affinity than control compound 8 3 kcal mol the cip had a binding affinity of 8 1 kcal mol and thus showed low toxicity to the protein however all ligands cip pet and pet cip showed higher toxicity than the control 6 3 kcal mol to cyp2d6 the results generally suggest that the adsorption of cip on pet reduced the toxicity of cip to zebrafish while increasing pet toxicity furthermore to human the toxicities generally increased compared to when the pollutants is acting alone the increased in toxicity suggests that the interaction is synergistic this implies that the combined presence of plastics and cip may pose higher risks to human health if ingested and combined via adsorption the limited research on the joint toxicity of mps and chemical pollutants cip on aquatic life and human health makes comparisons difficult yilimulati et al 27 conducted an experiment to determine the impact of ps cooh on its own cip on its own and cip absorbed by ps cooh on the survival rate of c elegans the study found that c elegans had a survival rate of over 82 when exposed to various concentrations of cip alone while the survival rate was around 61 and 48 for ps cooh mps the absorption of cip by ps cooh further reduced the survival rate of c elegans these findings align with our results that demonstrated that the adsorption of cip onto pet heightened the toxicity of both pollutants especially to human cyp enzymes fig 10 furthermore studies by ma et al 64 and yang et al 65 on zebrafish have demonstrated that when in the presence of polystyrene the accumulation of phenanthrene in its body increases as a result of adsorption onto the microplastic surface furthermore the joint toxic effects of phenanthrene and nanoparticles were found to have a synergistic effect on zebrafish these findings are in line with our own results to further understand the interaction of the ligands and the protein the 2d interactions was evaluated and results is shown in fig s7 the interaction for control pet and cip generally interacted via carbon conventional hydrogen bonds and alkyl and pi alkyl interactions however the cip pet showed further interaction via pi sigma bond with glutamic acid glu296 amino acid residue of the zebrafish protein with the human cyp3a4 and cyp2d6 protein fig s7b c more interaction was shown which may be responsible for its high binding affinity particularly for the pet the pet interacted via carbon hydrogen bonds pi hydrogen bond pi sulfur pi pi stacked and alkyl bonding similar interaction was obtained for pet cip indicating that the pet was still primarily used for the binding on the protein after adsorbing cip fig s7biv civ however when cip was acting alone towards human cyp3a4 protein fig s7biii pi anion pi pi t shaped attractive charges and halogen fluorine bonds was formed with the protein while cyp2d6 protein the interaction involved carbon conventional hydrogen bonds via glutamine gln threonine thr and phenylalanine phe amino acids residues while also alkyl and pi alkyl interactions via arginine amino acid residues fig s7ciii the conventional belief is that hydrogen bonds play a key role in promoting the interaction between proteins and ligands thereby enhancing the stability of the complex hydrogen bonds such as nho oho ohn and nhn are frequently the main sources of stability in biomolecules carbon on the other hand does not have the ability to form hydrogen bonds as it has a lower electronegativity compared to nitrogen and oxygen 66 the hydrophobic effect also contributes to the binding of a ligand to a receptor as shown by enyoh et al 31 hydrophobic interactions including alkyl bonding pi sigma pi hydrogen bond pi sulfur pi pi stacked and pi anion are known to take place according to chen et al 67 the hydrophobic effect has a significant impact on the binding of mps additives to cytochrome p450 receptors and an increase in hydrophobic contacts could improve the body s ability to bind substances another type of noncovalent interaction that can occur between an electron rich atom or group and a halogen atom such as fluorine is known as halogen bonding or fluorine bonding although it is considered weaker than covalent bonds it can still significantly alter the molecular characteristics additionally unfavorable donor donor interactions including hindrances in spatial arrangement and opposing charges were noticed in human cyp3a4 protein as depicted in fig s7bii iv the stability of pet and cip activity is affected by these adverse bonds any negative interaction that occurs between or within the protein ligand complex weakens the complex s stability as these bonds represent a repelling force between two molecules and an atom 4 conclusion the research investigated the adsorption of cip an antibiotic onto different types of pet mps microplastics three types of pet mps were studied pristine modified and aged the study found that the adsorption process involves physical and chemical interactions and occurs in multiple steps the efficiency of cip removal increased with higher initial concentrations and temperatures the order of effectiveness of the pet mps was ag pet mod pet pr pet different models were used to explain the adsorption process including boundary layer diffusion and intra particle diffusion each type of pet mp had a different maximum monolayer capacity for cip adsorption with pr pet having the highest capacity and ag pet having the lowest the adsorption process was spontaneous and exothermic except for pr pet which was spontaneous and endothermic the optimal ph for cip removal was 2 due to the negative oxidative reduction potential of the pet mps surface however the presence of dissolved salts reduced the adsorption capacity of pet mps theoretical analysis confirmed the experimental results and showed that the sorption of cip onto pet mps was stable and energetically favorable ag pet was the most stable and effective adsorbent ftir spectra indicated the formation of specific linkages between cip and pet mps the electrostatic attraction between the piperazine ring of cip and the alkyl and co groups in pet mps played a crucial role in driving adsorption pet mps demonstrated strong reversibility of adsorption the study suggested that pet mps especially ag pet could be used effectively for cip removal in wastewater treatment with pr pet being the most cost effective option however the combination of pet mps and cip showed increased toxicity to aquatic organisms and humans highlighting the potential risks of microplastics as carriers of pollutants future research should assess the environmental risks of micro and nanoplastics and evaluate the efficiency of pet mps in removing contaminants from real world wastewater containing multiple chemicals funding this study was partially supported by the special funds for innovative area research no 20120015 fy 2008 fy2012 and basic research b no 24310005 fy2012 fy2014 no 18h03384
