21610,this paper presents an approach that involves the advection diffusion equation together with a parameter identification approach to analyze the evolution of consecutive green water events the goal of the parameter identification approach is the estimation of the ad coefficients in real time by using a method based on a bank of state estimators which in turn are based on a spatial discrete version of the ad equation in order to test the approach with real data laboratory experiments of consecutive green water events on a fixed structure were performed such events were generated with regular waves of different steepness in a wave flume by employing high speed video to capture flow evolution time series of water elevations were obtained at several positions over the deck to perform the parameter identification and to validate the present approach results suggested that the present approach allowed capturing acceptably the evolution of consecutive events even when considering constant ad parameters maximum elevations in each event as well as their time of occurrence were well approximated which is an advantage against traditional analytical methods keywords green water parameter identification water elevations advection diffusion equation regular waves 1 introduction consecutive green water events can be described as the volumes of water that ship and propagate over the deck of marine structures when an incident wave train exceeds its freeboard ships and platforms are exposed to these phenomena when the marine environment is adverse such as during storms thus predicting and understanding green water flow has been recognized as the path to improve the performance and security of these facilities over the last decades the research on green water has been tackled from the points of view of flow kinematics lee et al 2019 yan et al 2018 sanchez mondragon et al 2019 motions in floating structures wang et al 2017 rajendran et al 2016 structural responses qin et al 2017 shipping flow features greco et al 2007 hernández fontes et al 2018 2020 water distribution over the decks hernández fontes et al 2019c hu et al 2015 among others each contributed to enlighten diverse aspects of the phenomenon regarding the analysis of green water evolution over the deck which is the topic of the present work analytical models have been proposed as practical approaches for its prediction this is of relevance since the knowledge of the water on deck distribution is the key data to perform early estimations of the derived loads buchner 2002 ogawa et al 1997 hernández fontes et al 2019d the most commonly used analytical models to evaluate the evolution of green water over a deck are based on the dam break and the flood wave approaches hernández fontes et al 2019b in the dam break method the green water flow over the deck of a structure is idealized as the resulting flow from the breaking of a dam e g goda and miyamoto 1976 the classical analytical solutions for the shallow water equations to represent dam break propagation ritter 1892 stoker 1957 have been employed to calculate distributions of green water elevations goda and miyamoto 1976 buchner 2002 however recent studies hu et al 2015 hernández fontes et al 2019c have shown that this method does not accurately represent the decay trend of the water elevations along the deck which can be attributed to the assumption of an infinitely long reservoir of water flooding a horizontal surface this assumption can limit the representation of finite amounts of water on deck that can be found in different types of green water events hernández fontes et al 2019c greco et al 2005 2007 to face this limitation recent works have proposed the use of modified versions of the classical dam break solutions to provide a more realistic representation zhang et al 2019 hu et al 2015 on the other hand in the flood wave approach a solution of the saint venant equations that represents the propagation of flow in a river or channel has been considered this solution also known in hydrology as the hayami solution hayami 1951 is a fundamental solution of the advection diffusion ad equation that has been used to model flood routing in rivers and channels moussa 1996 such a model was formerly adapted by ogawa et al 1997 to represent green water evolution on a ship with forward speed under some empirical assumptions this approach was further used by ogawa et al 2000 2002 ogawa 2003 for similar predictions in ships with forward speed and by hernández fontes et al 2015 for a simplified analysis of a moored vessel the flood wave representation which is based on a convolution equation showed good results regarding the elevation decay of the water elevation along the deck however no information was made available to the authors knowledge on its accuracy predicting green water in different conditions such as on fixed structures hernández fontes et al 2019c motivated by the capabilities of convolution to represent green water propagation hernández fontes 2018 and hernández fontes et al 2019c presented the modeling of green water on the deck on a fixed structure through a simplified engineering approach based on the ad equation unlike the flood wave approach followed by ogawa et al 1997 the problem was represented by the navier stokes equations providing details on how to obtain the ad equation and how to use the possible convolution solutions it was showed by hernández fontes et al 2019c that considering constant advection and diffusion coefficients in the ad equation it is possible to derive different analytical convolution solutions for several initial and boundary conditions xu et al 2007 although the ad approach to represent green water has limitations due to the shallow water assumptions the possibility to use convolution integrals from an engineering point of view can allow the spatial and temporal analysis of green water propagation in dynamic system analyzers however the use of the convolution solutions of the ad approach requires the knowledge of the advection and diffusion parameters for green water representation in specific structure configurations this until now is a topic that still requires to be investigated in fact previous applications of the method proposed by hernández fontes et al 2019c have estimated these parameters by calibrating heuristically the convolution results with experimental measurements hernández fontes et al 2019b d therefore the necessity of alternative methods to determine these parameters is evident recently some alternatives to identify the coefficients of the ad equation have been proposed for instance tych and young 2012 presented an approach to emulate the dynamic behavior of the ad equation by using a continuous time transfer function model for each space point the parameters for each transfer function were identified using a matlab routine another identification approach was presented by schorsch et al 2013 who used the method of least squares together with an instrumental variable method in order to handle the case of irregularly spatial distributed data in the light of the foregoing this paper presents an analytical and experimental investigation of green water propagation on a fixed structure which has been modeled by the ad approach in order to accurately predict the green water propagation i e the water on deck distributions in time and space a methodology for estimating the coefficients of the ad equation in real time is presented such a methodology is based on a bank of state observers that are designed from a spatial discrete version of the ad equation for validating the present approach three study cases of green water experiments generated by regular waves of different steepness were used in the experimental research high speed visualization was used to capture flow propagation of the consecutive events and open source image based methods were employed to extract time series of water elevations to compare with the analytical findings the present work is divided as follows section 2 briefly describes the ad approach to model the green water problem in sect 3 and sect 4 the parameter identification approach and the experimental methods are presented respectively sect 5 describes the procedure to implement the identified parameters next in sect 6 the results of the convolution model are presented and discussed and finally in sect 7 the main conclusions of the present study are summarized 2 the advection diffusion approach to model green water in this study the propagation of the green water events over the deck of a fixed structure has been represented by the ad equation following the approach proposed by hernández fontes 2018 hernández fontes et al 2019c in this approach the one dimensional shallow water equations were simplified so that the water elevation shows strong dependence on the bottom friction i e friction on the deck of a fixed structure after some mathematical simplifications the momentum equation was combined with the continuity equation to obtain the ad equation eq 1 in which the only dependent variable is the water elevation over the horizontal surface η it is important to mention that this is a very simplified approach to represent green water which has been proposed under shallow water assumptions and neglecting inertial terms however these simplifications were taken following previous hydrological applications see for instance moussa 1996 fan and li 2006 to allow the use of convolution integrals solutions of the ad equation to represent flow propagation regardless acceptable results have been found improving classical dam break methods hernández fontes et al 2019c d therefore it can be considered a potential engineering approach to analyze green water evolution from a dynamic system analysis point of view a brief description of the procedure to derive the ad equation is presented in appendix a more details in the modeling of the green water problem by the ad approach can be found in hernández fontes 2018 and hernández fontes et al 2019c the ad equation from those works is written as follows 1 η t u a 1 η x u η 2 s f 2 η x 2 where η is the water elevation over the horizontal surface x represents the distance along the horizontal domain t is time u is the depth averaged mean horizontal flow velocity s f is a resistance coefficient and a is a constant obtained from manning friction a 2 3 from equation 1 the advection a and diffusion b coefficients are defined as hernández fontes et al 2019c 2 a u a 1 3 b u η 2 s f if the a and b terms are assumed constant analytical solutions of eq 1 expressed as convolution integrals can be obtained xu et al 2007 following xu et al 2007 hernández fontes et al 2019c in the present work the solution of eq 1 considering dirichlet type boundary conditions at x 0 in a semi infinite domain has been considered to model the water on deck elevation distributions 4 η x t 0 t f τ k a k b d τ with 5 k a x a t τ 16 π b t τ 3 e x p x a t τ 2 4 b t τ 6 k b x a t τ 16 π b t τ 3 e x p a x b x a t τ 2 4 b t τ where f τ is the boundary condition upstream the domain considered as the variation of freeboard exceedance in green water applications hernández fontes et al 2019c d b and k a k b represents the kernel of the convolution k 3 parameter identification approaches in this contribution three approaches are proposed for computing the coefficients a and b of the ad equation by using records over time and space of η considered at eight equidistant positions η 0 η 7 fig 1 the three approaches are summarized in table 1 the first approach is based on a bank of state estimators the goal of each state estimator is calculating a and b for specific coordinates positions along the deck and within its boundaries the values provided by the bank of estimators are coefficients that vary in space and time thus for the first approach the estimates were averaged in time to obtain the coefficients for each spatial coordinate within the boundaries fig 1 shows a schema that illustrates the architecture of the first approach the second approach is also based on a bank of state estimators here the estimations of the coefficients were averaged both in time and space so that a unique value is obtained for a and b along all the domain at this point it is important to say that the number of estimators that make up the bank used in the first and second approaches will depend on the number of measurements available for performing the estimation finally the third approach is based on a unique state estimator that uses only three measurements taken in coordinates sufficiently separated see fig 2 to appreciate the architecture of this approach 3 1 design of the state estimator the first step for designing each state estimator that composes the bank used for the first and second approach or the single estimator used in the third approach is the approximation of the spatial derivatives involved in eq 1 by finite differences that is 7 2 η x t x 2 i η i 1 t 2 η i t η i 1 t δ x 2 8 η x t x i η i 1 t η i t δ x where η i t η x i t is the value of η x t at the coordinate x i along the spatial domain which is defined as ω 0 l δ x l n is the length of the spatial step finite difference of the approximation discretization such that x i i δ x i 0 1 2 n since the space is approximated by differences eq 1 becomes an ordinary differential equation where 9 η x t t d η i t d t η i t by replacing eq 7 eq 8 and eq 9 into eq 1 we have 10 η i t a i η i 1 t η i t δ x b i η i 1 t 2 η i t η i 1 t δ x 2 where a i and b i are the values of a and b at the coordinate x i by assuming that a i and b i are constant in time their derivatives are zero i e a i 0 and b i 0 thus if we define a state vector composed of η i t a i and b i as state variables denoted as follows 11 ξ i t ξ i a t ξ i b t ξ i c t t η i t a i b i t we obtain the following augmented system in state space representation 12 ξ i t 0 η i 1 t η i t δ x η i 1 t 2 η i t η i 1 t δ x 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 g i η i 1 t η i t η i 1 t ξ i t system 12 can be written in the following compact form 13 ξ i t g i η i 1 t η i t η i 1 t ξ i y i t c i ξ i t η i t where g i η i 1 t η i t η i 1 t is a known matrix function y i t is the measured output and c i 1 0 0 is the output vector for system 13 an exponential estimator with the form 14 ξ ˆ i t g i η i 1 t η i t η i 1 t ξ ˆ i t s i 1 t c i t c i ξ ˆ i t y i t s i t λ s i t g i t η i 1 t η i t η i 1 t s i t s i t g i η i 1 t η i t η i 1 t c i t c i for λ 0 and s 0 0 can be used to estimate its state variables in other words eq 14 is an algorithm that can be used to estimate η i a i and b i the estimator is exponential in the sense that the error ξ ˆ i t ξ i t can exponentially decay to zero as t goes to infinity in this case the rate of decay can be adjusted by means of parameter λ the exponential convergence is guaranteed under an appropriate excitation condition besançon et al 1996 more details about the background of eq 14 are provided in appendix b 4 experimental methods for the present study experiments of green water on a fixed structure were performed with incident regular waves the experiments were carried out in the wave flume at the engineering institute of unam mexico which features a piston type wave maker equipped with an active absorption system fig 3 a illustrates the installation of the fixed structure in the flume moreover fig 3b and c show the main dimensions of the experimental setup in side and top views respectively given that the main goal of the present research is the study of the water propagation over the deck the main parameter recorded during the experiments was the water on deck elevation in time and space to do so high speed image based methods were used following the methodology proposed by hernández et al 2018 this method employs images from a high speed camera we used a fastec imaging camera model hispec2gmono with a 50 mm lens fig 3c requiring uniform background illumination we used led lamps fig 3b and c for reducing noise then the captured images are turned into binary in color the water was painted to facilitate this process from which it is straightforward to extract the water elevation from the binary images time series of water elevation i e effective water heights see hernández et al 2018 for details can be computed anywhere along the deck the scripts used can be consulted in hernández et al 2018 and are available at https doi org 10 17632 9vwdgv2g5z 3 an error of 1 mm in the water elevation measurements was verified during the stages of image acquisition and processing time series of water elevation were obtained at the eight equally spaced positions over the structure deck p0 to p7 in fig 3d the measurements at p0 correspond to the freeboard exceedance time series that is the variation of the resultant water elevations at the bow edge of the structure this is a relevant data in the study of green water since it represents the initial conditions for simulation purposes hernández fontes et al 2019a on the other hand the measurements obtained at p1 p7 represent the time series of water elevation at different positions over the deck the experimental data of the consecutive green water events obtained at positions p0 to p7 were firstly employed in this work to perform the parameter identification a and b parameters of the ad equation that was used to model the green water propagation eq 1 as described in sect 3 and 5 afterwards they were used to compare the analytical solution convolution of the ad equation to represent the water evolution over the deck sect 6 in our tests three different regular wave trains were considered assuming the linear wave theory for deep waters the regular wave characteristics that were sent to the wave maker had different wave lengths but the same wave heights in order to test incoming waves with different steepness characteristics of the incident waves for the three study cases c1 c3 are summarized in table 2 the wave trains obtained in these cases generated green water events of the plunging dam break pdb type see greco et al 2007 for details these events were adequate to be modeled by the ad approach which considers shipping water events invading horizontally the deck hernández fontes et al 2019c and to obtain single valued water surface measurements using image based methods hernández et al 2018 further details in the experimental methods can be found in hernández fontes et al 2020 5 implementation of the approaches to compute the a and b parameters the eight experimental measurements taken at p0 p7 fig 3d are denoted as η 0 t η 7 t as shown in fig 1 for the implementation of the proposed approaches described in sect 3 table 1 p0 and p7 correspond to the boundaries of the deck so consequently η 0 t and η 7 t are the boundary conditions notice that the approximation of 2 η x t x 2 requires three measurements observations of η η i 1 t η i t and η i 1 t therefore for the first and second approaches these three measurements are always required for estimating the coefficients this fact implies that both boundary conditions are required for estimating a i and b i at the coordinates x i within the boundaries since eight measurements are available and two are the boundary functions six couples of a i and b i are estimated as illustrated in fig 1 for the second approach measurements η 0 t η 2 t and η 4 t were used for estimating a single couple of coefficients a and b as illustrated in fig 2 for each study case time series of the parameters a and b for the positions p1 p6 fig 3d were obtained the results provided by the three approaches are summarized in tables 3 and 4 the values between the second and seventh columns are the coefficient values for each position that were estimated with the first approach the values in the penultimate column are the resulting estimations from the second approach and the values of the last column are the resulting estimation of the application of the third approach the estimators were tuned by setting λ 1 the initial conditions of the first order differential equations composing the estimators were all set to zero the matrix s t was initialized as s 0 i the observer was implemented in matlab simulink by using the ode4 runge kutta solver with δ t 0 02 s as time step for numerically solving the differential equations 6 convolution results for green water evolution this section presents the comparison of results obtained with the convolution approach and the experiments at positions p1 p6 for the three study cases first a time step analysis is presented sect 6 1 which is required to guarantee an adequate representation of the kernel function hernández fontes et al 2019c next the convolution model was implemented sect 6 2 considering the three approaches for a and b identification finally a quantitative analysis was performed to investigate the differences between the convolution results and the experiments sect 6 3 6 1 time step selection the area of the convolution kernel has to be equal to the unity wang et al 2014 hernández fontes et al 2019c thus an adequate time step δ t must be considered to apply the convolution model for the case of green water this assessment can be done by considering the position over the deck closer to the border of the domain i e x 0 where the rising limb of the kernel function is steeper as suggested by hernández fontes et al 2019c the procedure for determining the appropriate time step is graph the kernel for the position closer to the origin for different time steps and select the one that reproduces the rising limb with at least more than three time steps this will give the area of the convolution the closest possible to the unity in this sense fig 4 a and b shows the kernel function k at p1 for case 1 and case 3 respectively six time steps from 0 1 s to 0 0005 s were tested the a and b values corresponding to these cases for p1 were taken from tables 3 and 4 respectively in both cases note that only the time steps of 0 5 and 0 1 s did not allow representing the rising limb of the kernel in fact it can be verified below each figure that the area of the kernel curves equals to unity for time steps lower than 0 005 s therefore to guarantee an adequate kernel assessment the time step of 0 001 s was selected for all the model implementations of this study 6 2 model implementation figs 5 7 show the comparison of the water elevation time series obtained with the convolution model for the three approaches defined in sect 3 and 5 approaches 1 2 and 3 table 1 and the experiments for cases 1 2 and 3 respectively in each figure the time series were obtained and compared for the six positions p1 p6 defined in the sketch of fig 3d in the plots shown for each position the input series used for each case has been included to visualize the evolution of the shipping water along the deck furthermore the convolution results were compared with mean and standard deviation sd values of the experiments which were obtained from three test repetitions performed for each case table 5 describes the experimental data of each study case employed for application of the convolution model in all cases the time domain for the analysis was 19 t 24 5 s notice that for the case 1 six green water events were presented whereas for case 2 and 3 five events occurred during this period of time for illustrative purposes fig 8 shows some snapshots from the second to fifth events of green water found in 19 t 24 5 s for each study case note that in all the events plunging dam break pdb events were presented in these events a small air cavity was initially formed at the beginning of the deck then it was trapped by the flow and then collapsed generating bubbles that escaped downstream while water propagated over the deck details regarding these events are well described by greco 2001 greco et al 2007 colicchio et al 2011 hernández fontes et al 2019a in the next paragraphs a qualitative description of the results for the three cases is presented to verify the differences between the convolution approaches and the experiments a quantitative analysis is provided in sect 6 3 for case 1 fig 5 which considers the green water events generated with the steepest waves ε 0 056 it can be noted that results of approach 1 show differences with respect to those obtained with approaches 2 and 3 which gave similar amplitudes at x 0 04 m fig 5a the three approaches overestimate the experiments but approximate quite well the time at which peak values occurred for each event from 0 08 x 0 16 m fig 5b d the convolution results present a better agreement with the experiments regardless of a considerable overestimation in the peak values by the approach 1 at x 0 08 and x 0 12 m at farther positions from the beginning of the deck x 0 20 m x 0 24 m fig 5e and f approach 1 underestimated the experimental amplitudes and delayed the occurrence of the peak values whereas approaches 2 and 3 captured quite well the experiments for case 2 fig 6 which considers the waves with intermediate steepness ε 0 042 all the convolution approaches seemed to capture well the experiments assessing quite well the peaks at which maximum values occurred at x 0 04 m fig 6 a approach 1 showed an excellent agreement with the experiments whereas approaches 2 and 3 overestimated the peak values next for 0 08 x 0 20 m fig 6b e the three approaches remained very close between them with approach 1 presenting a small overestimation of peak values at the farthest position considered x 0 24 m fig 6f approach 1 presented a delay with respect to the other results similarly as observed in case 1 for case 3 fig 7 which considers the longest waves for green water generation ε 0 034 the trend of the convolution results with respect to the experiments is very similar to the one verified in case 2 however in this case it seems that convolution results approximated better the peak values of each event than the previous cases particularly for 0 04 x 0 20 m fig 7a e in spite of some difficulties to capture the first event which presented a very small amount of water over the deck at x 0 24 m fig 7f the three convolution approaches underestimated the first and fourth event but presented a reasonable agreement for the other events until now we have only given qualitative descriptions of the trends observed in the results shown in figs 5 7 it seems that the three approaches used are capable of reproducing the recorded elevations with an acceptable engineering accuracy however a more detailed analysis is required to identify which one provides better performance thus the next section includes a quantitative analysis to verify the degree of approximation of the three convolution approaches with respect to the experimental data 6 3 differences between convolution and experiments to evaluate the goodness of fit of the convolution approaches two procedures of comparison have been followed which are summarized in table 6 the comparison is performed directly against the water elevation time series mean and standard deviation values basically these two procedures are based in an analysis of the areas under the time series curves procedure 1 and the maximum elevations presented in each green water event procedure 2 procedure 1 is quite simple but provides a global idea about the differences between real and predicted amount of water over the deck on the other hand procedure 2 quantifies the differences between the stages at which the green water effects over the deck may be more significant since the occurrence of the maximum elevations over the deck are often related with the occurrence of the maximum vertical green water loads buchner 2002 hernández fontes et al 2019d in procedure 1 table 6 the areas under the curves of convolution a c o n v and experimental a e x p results cases 1 3 figs 5 7 were obtained from 19 t 24 5 s by trapezoidal integration then the ratios between a c o n v and a e x p were compared for different positions along the deck as shown in fig 9 higher ratios suggest a global overestimation of the shipped amount of water during the events considered in the analysis of each case study fig 9a b and c show the a c o n v a e x p ratios for cases 1 2 and 3 respectively the main findings are described next at the beginning of the deck p1 a c o n v obtained with approaches 2 and 3 was closer to a e x p than with approach 1 for the three cases a c o n v of approach 1 underestimated a e x p approximately 6 at intermediate positions over the deck p2 p3 a c o n v for the three approaches overestimated a e x p in less than 8 for all the cases at p4 convolution results resulted very close to the experiments however at farther positions over the deck p5 p6 a c o n v the three approaches underestimated a e x p this underestimation was close to 20 at p6 for the three cases the differences between convolution and experiments at farther positions from the bow may be attributed to a thin layer of water of 5 mm that remained over the deck after each event see fig 9a c regarding an overall evaluation it can be concluded that approaches 2 and 3 provided better predictions than approach 1 in procedure 2 table 6 the maximum elevation of each green water event η m and its time of occurrence t m were considered thus two errors were defined to compare η m and t m considering the experiments as reference mean plus standard deviation values for t m and η m the error between convolution and experiments was defined as e t m t m c o n v t m e x p t m e x p and e η m η m c o n v η m e x p η m e x p respectively in these expressions the subscripts c o n v and e x p denote convolution and experiments respectively figs 10 12 show the errors e t m and e η m for each of the events found in cases 1 2 and 3 respectively these were calculated with the time series of η at each position p1 p6 over the deck 0 04 x 0 24 positive values of e t m mean that η m c o n v occurred after η m e x p conversely negative values of e t m indicate that convolution results anticipated the experiments on the other hand positive and negative e η m values refer to overestimation and underestimation of the experiments respectively our main findings in the analysis of e t m and e η m for the three case studies are summarized in next paragraphs case 1 fig 10 at the beginning of the deck p1 e t m from the three convolution approaches is close to zero for all the green water events this trend remains between p2 and p5 for the events 3 6 then e t m tend to increase between p5 and p6 a different behavior occurred for the first and second events which presented negative values from p2 to p5 tending to increase from p5 to p6 overall it can be stated that t m c o n v captured quite well t m e x p at the start and middle of the deck particularly during the events 3 to 6 at the end of the deck t m c o n v delayed to attain t m e x p during almost all the events regarding the error e η m note that in all the events and approaches η m c o n v show good results at p4 and p5 at the start of the deck p1 p2 the η m c o n v values given by the three convolution approaches overestimate η m e x p between 20 60 whereas at the end of the deck p6 η m e x p was underestimated in less than 35 in general all the convolution approaches tend to overestimate η m e x p at the beginning of the deck next they present a closer agreement at the middle of the deck to finally underestimate it at the end of the deck to identify the convolution approaches that allowed a better approximation with the experiments fig 13 summarizes the approaches that presented the errors e t m and e η m closer to zero for all the green water events in the three study cases in general it can be verified from fig 13 that for case 1 the convolution approaches 2 and 3 presented the smallest errors allowing a closer agreement with the experiments case 2 fig 11 from p1 to p4 e t m was very close to zero so the agreement of t m c o n v with respect to t m e x p was good for the three approaches in all the events however from p5 to p6 t m c o n v presented a time delay to capture t m e x p regarding e η m the best agreement of η m c o n v with η m e x p occurred between p2 p4 η m e x p was overestimated and underestimated by all the convolution approaches at the beginning p1 and the end p6 of the deck respectively from fig 13 it can be inferred that approach 3 offer better results of t m e x p in all the events with respect to the assessment of η m e x p approaches 2 and 3 allowed the minimum errors i e a better assessment particularly at the middle and end of the deck case 3 fig 12 from p1 to p6 the three convolution approaches followed a similar trend showing e t m close to zero particularly in events 2 to 5 this indicates an acceptable assessment of t m e x p by t m c o n v with regards to e η m the best agreement of η m c o n v of the three convolution approaches with η m e x p occurred at the intermediate positions over the deck p2 p4 particularly between events 2 and 4 for p5 p6 η m c o n v tended to underestimate η m e x p in general table 13 suggests that the convolution approaches 3 and 2 performed quite well to approximate the t m and η m values of experiments respectively from the results observed through figs 9 13 it is possible to conclude that approaches 2 and 3 give good results regarding the spatio temporal evolution of water on deck elevation for consecutive green water events this can be of practical use to predict the evolution of green water events on structures from the identification of mean and constant a and b parameters knowing these parameters for a specific deck and estimating the freeboard exceedance it would be possible to predict the distribution of water on deck and subsequently to estimate the evolution of loading through simplified engineering procedures such as in hernández fontes et al 2019d it is important to mention that the present ad approach has limitation to estimate the exact water elevations over the deck as observed in the comparisons with experiments however these differences can be acceptable from an engineering point of view since it is a simplified analytical approach developed under the assumption of neglecting inertial terms in the governing momentum equation hernández fontes et al 2019c despite of this it presents the capability to be implemented at low computational cost allowing to capture general trends of the evolution of multiple green water events in an approximate way this capability may be useful in global analyzes of green water either by coupling the present approach with ship dynamic codes e g rajendran et al 2016 or using it for estimating shipping water loads with safety factors 7 conclusions in this work the prediction of the spatio temporal evolution of green water elevations on deck of a fixed structure considering the advection diffusion ad approach to model the propagation of consecutive green water events was performed the main contribution of this research is precisely related to the identification of the advection and diffusion parameters in the ad equation to overcome the trial and error procedures to estimate these parameters in previous research to validate the present approach experiments of green water were performed with regular waves of different steepness time series of water elevations were obtained from high speed videos by using image based approaches the main findings of the research can be summarized as follows advection a and diffusion b parameters were identified then three different approaches to assess these parameters in the ad convolution model were tested and compared to identify the one that better approximates the experimental results these considered constant parameters in time but variable in space approach 1 mean constant parameters approach 2 and constant parameters roughly estimated approach 3 it was verified that for the three approaches the convolution model captured the trends of experiments providing results that approximated well the time at which maximum elevations of each green water event were presented overall approaches 2 and 3 provided acceptable results this suggests that mean and constant a and b parameters obtained from the identified ones can give acceptable results to represent the water on deck evolution from an engineering point of view with the identification of a and b parameters convolution models that are solutions of the ad equation can be used to represent the propagation of water over the deck these models can be easily implemented at low computational cost and coupled with more complex dynamic system analyzers the topics of further research to extend the present work can be described as follows the present study considered a simplified structure with very small roughness in the deck to demonstrate the use of the method of identification however it can be further investigated for different deck configurations e g by varying its slope and roughness and conditions of operation e g applications with fixed or moving structures different prototype deck arrangements can be represented in model scale to perform green water experiments then a similar procedure as the one proposed in this work can be implemented to identify a and b parameters proper of that deck for different test conditions with these data an alternative of practical implementation of the present approach could be to generate curves or tables of a and b parameters for different structure and wave conditions therefore further research could verify the possibility of characterizing the structure to predict the evolution of water on deck in real conditions credit authorship contribution

procedure to derive the ad equation more details related to its derivation from the navier stokes equations regarding the green water problem can be found in the works of hernández fontes 2018 hernández fontes et al 2019c the simplified shallow water equations in the x direction i e 1d equations considering only the shear stress produced by the bottom boundary τ x z are expressed by the equations of continuity eq 15 and momentum 16 as follows 15 η t u η x 0 16 u η t u 2 η x g η η x 1 ρ τ x z where η is the water surface t is time x is the coordinate in the horizontal direction g is the acceleration due to gravity ρ is the fluid density τ x z is the bottom shear stress and u is to the depth averaged flow velocity in the x direction assuming subcritical flow conditions the continuity equation remains as eq 15 while the momentum equation is simplified to eq 17 17 η x τ x z ρ g η the bottom shear stress is considered empirically through the manning resistance approach this practice is commonly employed to consider frictional effects in a simplified way in other areas of research such as in hydraulics and hydrology chanson 2004 gottardi and venutelli 2008 therefore the simplified momentum equation eq 17 can be expressed as 18 η x u β η a 2 where β 1 m r with m r as the manning roughness coefficient with dimension l 1 3 t and a 2 3 through some mathematical development for details see hernández fontes 2018 the continuity and momentum equations eqs 15 and 18 respectively are combined to obtain the ad equation which is a single partial differential equation with η as the only dependent variable 19 η t u a 1 η x u η 2 s f 2 η x 2 appendix b the a and b parameters were estimated using an algorithm known as a state estimator this algorithm is made up of two ingredients a copy of the model plus a correction term state estimator model correction term the proposed first ingredient i e the model used to deal with the estimation of a and b is given by eq 12 which can be re expressed in a simpler manner as follows 20 ξ t g i u t y t ξ t y t c ξ t where u t is a function involving η i 1 t and η i 1 t whereas y t is η i t on the other hand the second ingredient the correction term is the estimation error multiplied by a convergence gain k t namely the estimation error is defined as 21 e t ξ ˆ t ξ t where ξ ˆ is the state vector involving the estimated state variables a state estimator for a system with a model expressed by eq 20 can be given as follows 22 ξ ˆ g i u t y t ξ ˆ t m o d e l k t e t c o r r e c t i o n t e r m it is important to note in eq 22 that the purpose of k t is to make the error tends to zero i e e t 0 as t this idea may become clearer if the differential error equation is developed and solved the differential equation of the error is given by 23 e t ξ t ξ ˆ t by substituting ξ t and ξ ˆ t from eq 20 and eq 22 into the equation above one has 24 e t g i u t y t ξ t g i u t y t ξ ˆ t k t e t g i u t y t ξ t ξ ˆ t k t e t g i u t y t k t θ e t if the so called state matrix g u t y t and the convergence gain k t were both constant the homogeneous solution for the differential equation 24 would be 25 e t γ e θ t where γ would be e 0 notice then that e t would have a decreasing exponential behavior if and only if θ 0 since this behavior is precisely that one wants it must be ensured that θ is always negative by choosing the convergence gain such that the eigenvalues of θ are negatives in their real part for systems with a time varying state matrix such as in eq 20 the choice of k t is a little more complicated task however this task was accomplished by bornard et al 1989 hammouri and de leon morales 1990 who proposed a convergence gain given by 26 k i t s i 1 t c i t where s i t is the solution of the following lyapunov equation 27 s t λ s i t g i t u t y t s i t s i t g i u t y t c i c i t 
21610,this paper presents an approach that involves the advection diffusion equation together with a parameter identification approach to analyze the evolution of consecutive green water events the goal of the parameter identification approach is the estimation of the ad coefficients in real time by using a method based on a bank of state estimators which in turn are based on a spatial discrete version of the ad equation in order to test the approach with real data laboratory experiments of consecutive green water events on a fixed structure were performed such events were generated with regular waves of different steepness in a wave flume by employing high speed video to capture flow evolution time series of water elevations were obtained at several positions over the deck to perform the parameter identification and to validate the present approach results suggested that the present approach allowed capturing acceptably the evolution of consecutive events even when considering constant ad parameters maximum elevations in each event as well as their time of occurrence were well approximated which is an advantage against traditional analytical methods keywords green water parameter identification water elevations advection diffusion equation regular waves 1 introduction consecutive green water events can be described as the volumes of water that ship and propagate over the deck of marine structures when an incident wave train exceeds its freeboard ships and platforms are exposed to these phenomena when the marine environment is adverse such as during storms thus predicting and understanding green water flow has been recognized as the path to improve the performance and security of these facilities over the last decades the research on green water has been tackled from the points of view of flow kinematics lee et al 2019 yan et al 2018 sanchez mondragon et al 2019 motions in floating structures wang et al 2017 rajendran et al 2016 structural responses qin et al 2017 shipping flow features greco et al 2007 hernández fontes et al 2018 2020 water distribution over the decks hernández fontes et al 2019c hu et al 2015 among others each contributed to enlighten diverse aspects of the phenomenon regarding the analysis of green water evolution over the deck which is the topic of the present work analytical models have been proposed as practical approaches for its prediction this is of relevance since the knowledge of the water on deck distribution is the key data to perform early estimations of the derived loads buchner 2002 ogawa et al 1997 hernández fontes et al 2019d the most commonly used analytical models to evaluate the evolution of green water over a deck are based on the dam break and the flood wave approaches hernández fontes et al 2019b in the dam break method the green water flow over the deck of a structure is idealized as the resulting flow from the breaking of a dam e g goda and miyamoto 1976 the classical analytical solutions for the shallow water equations to represent dam break propagation ritter 1892 stoker 1957 have been employed to calculate distributions of green water elevations goda and miyamoto 1976 buchner 2002 however recent studies hu et al 2015 hernández fontes et al 2019c have shown that this method does not accurately represent the decay trend of the water elevations along the deck which can be attributed to the assumption of an infinitely long reservoir of water flooding a horizontal surface this assumption can limit the representation of finite amounts of water on deck that can be found in different types of green water events hernández fontes et al 2019c greco et al 2005 2007 to face this limitation recent works have proposed the use of modified versions of the classical dam break solutions to provide a more realistic representation zhang et al 2019 hu et al 2015 on the other hand in the flood wave approach a solution of the saint venant equations that represents the propagation of flow in a river or channel has been considered this solution also known in hydrology as the hayami solution hayami 1951 is a fundamental solution of the advection diffusion ad equation that has been used to model flood routing in rivers and channels moussa 1996 such a model was formerly adapted by ogawa et al 1997 to represent green water evolution on a ship with forward speed under some empirical assumptions this approach was further used by ogawa et al 2000 2002 ogawa 2003 for similar predictions in ships with forward speed and by hernández fontes et al 2015 for a simplified analysis of a moored vessel the flood wave representation which is based on a convolution equation showed good results regarding the elevation decay of the water elevation along the deck however no information was made available to the authors knowledge on its accuracy predicting green water in different conditions such as on fixed structures hernández fontes et al 2019c motivated by the capabilities of convolution to represent green water propagation hernández fontes 2018 and hernández fontes et al 2019c presented the modeling of green water on the deck on a fixed structure through a simplified engineering approach based on the ad equation unlike the flood wave approach followed by ogawa et al 1997 the problem was represented by the navier stokes equations providing details on how to obtain the ad equation and how to use the possible convolution solutions it was showed by hernández fontes et al 2019c that considering constant advection and diffusion coefficients in the ad equation it is possible to derive different analytical convolution solutions for several initial and boundary conditions xu et al 2007 although the ad approach to represent green water has limitations due to the shallow water assumptions the possibility to use convolution integrals from an engineering point of view can allow the spatial and temporal analysis of green water propagation in dynamic system analyzers however the use of the convolution solutions of the ad approach requires the knowledge of the advection and diffusion parameters for green water representation in specific structure configurations this until now is a topic that still requires to be investigated in fact previous applications of the method proposed by hernández fontes et al 2019c have estimated these parameters by calibrating heuristically the convolution results with experimental measurements hernández fontes et al 2019b d therefore the necessity of alternative methods to determine these parameters is evident recently some alternatives to identify the coefficients of the ad equation have been proposed for instance tych and young 2012 presented an approach to emulate the dynamic behavior of the ad equation by using a continuous time transfer function model for each space point the parameters for each transfer function were identified using a matlab routine another identification approach was presented by schorsch et al 2013 who used the method of least squares together with an instrumental variable method in order to handle the case of irregularly spatial distributed data in the light of the foregoing this paper presents an analytical and experimental investigation of green water propagation on a fixed structure which has been modeled by the ad approach in order to accurately predict the green water propagation i e the water on deck distributions in time and space a methodology for estimating the coefficients of the ad equation in real time is presented such a methodology is based on a bank of state observers that are designed from a spatial discrete version of the ad equation for validating the present approach three study cases of green water experiments generated by regular waves of different steepness were used in the experimental research high speed visualization was used to capture flow propagation of the consecutive events and open source image based methods were employed to extract time series of water elevations to compare with the analytical findings the present work is divided as follows section 2 briefly describes the ad approach to model the green water problem in sect 3 and sect 4 the parameter identification approach and the experimental methods are presented respectively sect 5 describes the procedure to implement the identified parameters next in sect 6 the results of the convolution model are presented and discussed and finally in sect 7 the main conclusions of the present study are summarized 2 the advection diffusion approach to model green water in this study the propagation of the green water events over the deck of a fixed structure has been represented by the ad equation following the approach proposed by hernández fontes 2018 hernández fontes et al 2019c in this approach the one dimensional shallow water equations were simplified so that the water elevation shows strong dependence on the bottom friction i e friction on the deck of a fixed structure after some mathematical simplifications the momentum equation was combined with the continuity equation to obtain the ad equation eq 1 in which the only dependent variable is the water elevation over the horizontal surface η it is important to mention that this is a very simplified approach to represent green water which has been proposed under shallow water assumptions and neglecting inertial terms however these simplifications were taken following previous hydrological applications see for instance moussa 1996 fan and li 2006 to allow the use of convolution integrals solutions of the ad equation to represent flow propagation regardless acceptable results have been found improving classical dam break methods hernández fontes et al 2019c d therefore it can be considered a potential engineering approach to analyze green water evolution from a dynamic system analysis point of view a brief description of the procedure to derive the ad equation is presented in appendix a more details in the modeling of the green water problem by the ad approach can be found in hernández fontes 2018 and hernández fontes et al 2019c the ad equation from those works is written as follows 1 η t u a 1 η x u η 2 s f 2 η x 2 where η is the water elevation over the horizontal surface x represents the distance along the horizontal domain t is time u is the depth averaged mean horizontal flow velocity s f is a resistance coefficient and a is a constant obtained from manning friction a 2 3 from equation 1 the advection a and diffusion b coefficients are defined as hernández fontes et al 2019c 2 a u a 1 3 b u η 2 s f if the a and b terms are assumed constant analytical solutions of eq 1 expressed as convolution integrals can be obtained xu et al 2007 following xu et al 2007 hernández fontes et al 2019c in the present work the solution of eq 1 considering dirichlet type boundary conditions at x 0 in a semi infinite domain has been considered to model the water on deck elevation distributions 4 η x t 0 t f τ k a k b d τ with 5 k a x a t τ 16 π b t τ 3 e x p x a t τ 2 4 b t τ 6 k b x a t τ 16 π b t τ 3 e x p a x b x a t τ 2 4 b t τ where f τ is the boundary condition upstream the domain considered as the variation of freeboard exceedance in green water applications hernández fontes et al 2019c d b and k a k b represents the kernel of the convolution k 3 parameter identification approaches in this contribution three approaches are proposed for computing the coefficients a and b of the ad equation by using records over time and space of η considered at eight equidistant positions η 0 η 7 fig 1 the three approaches are summarized in table 1 the first approach is based on a bank of state estimators the goal of each state estimator is calculating a and b for specific coordinates positions along the deck and within its boundaries the values provided by the bank of estimators are coefficients that vary in space and time thus for the first approach the estimates were averaged in time to obtain the coefficients for each spatial coordinate within the boundaries fig 1 shows a schema that illustrates the architecture of the first approach the second approach is also based on a bank of state estimators here the estimations of the coefficients were averaged both in time and space so that a unique value is obtained for a and b along all the domain at this point it is important to say that the number of estimators that make up the bank used in the first and second approaches will depend on the number of measurements available for performing the estimation finally the third approach is based on a unique state estimator that uses only three measurements taken in coordinates sufficiently separated see fig 2 to appreciate the architecture of this approach 3 1 design of the state estimator the first step for designing each state estimator that composes the bank used for the first and second approach or the single estimator used in the third approach is the approximation of the spatial derivatives involved in eq 1 by finite differences that is 7 2 η x t x 2 i η i 1 t 2 η i t η i 1 t δ x 2 8 η x t x i η i 1 t η i t δ x where η i t η x i t is the value of η x t at the coordinate x i along the spatial domain which is defined as ω 0 l δ x l n is the length of the spatial step finite difference of the approximation discretization such that x i i δ x i 0 1 2 n since the space is approximated by differences eq 1 becomes an ordinary differential equation where 9 η x t t d η i t d t η i t by replacing eq 7 eq 8 and eq 9 into eq 1 we have 10 η i t a i η i 1 t η i t δ x b i η i 1 t 2 η i t η i 1 t δ x 2 where a i and b i are the values of a and b at the coordinate x i by assuming that a i and b i are constant in time their derivatives are zero i e a i 0 and b i 0 thus if we define a state vector composed of η i t a i and b i as state variables denoted as follows 11 ξ i t ξ i a t ξ i b t ξ i c t t η i t a i b i t we obtain the following augmented system in state space representation 12 ξ i t 0 η i 1 t η i t δ x η i 1 t 2 η i t η i 1 t δ x 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 g i η i 1 t η i t η i 1 t ξ i t system 12 can be written in the following compact form 13 ξ i t g i η i 1 t η i t η i 1 t ξ i y i t c i ξ i t η i t where g i η i 1 t η i t η i 1 t is a known matrix function y i t is the measured output and c i 1 0 0 is the output vector for system 13 an exponential estimator with the form 14 ξ ˆ i t g i η i 1 t η i t η i 1 t ξ ˆ i t s i 1 t c i t c i ξ ˆ i t y i t s i t λ s i t g i t η i 1 t η i t η i 1 t s i t s i t g i η i 1 t η i t η i 1 t c i t c i for λ 0 and s 0 0 can be used to estimate its state variables in other words eq 14 is an algorithm that can be used to estimate η i a i and b i the estimator is exponential in the sense that the error ξ ˆ i t ξ i t can exponentially decay to zero as t goes to infinity in this case the rate of decay can be adjusted by means of parameter λ the exponential convergence is guaranteed under an appropriate excitation condition besançon et al 1996 more details about the background of eq 14 are provided in appendix b 4 experimental methods for the present study experiments of green water on a fixed structure were performed with incident regular waves the experiments were carried out in the wave flume at the engineering institute of unam mexico which features a piston type wave maker equipped with an active absorption system fig 3 a illustrates the installation of the fixed structure in the flume moreover fig 3b and c show the main dimensions of the experimental setup in side and top views respectively given that the main goal of the present research is the study of the water propagation over the deck the main parameter recorded during the experiments was the water on deck elevation in time and space to do so high speed image based methods were used following the methodology proposed by hernández et al 2018 this method employs images from a high speed camera we used a fastec imaging camera model hispec2gmono with a 50 mm lens fig 3c requiring uniform background illumination we used led lamps fig 3b and c for reducing noise then the captured images are turned into binary in color the water was painted to facilitate this process from which it is straightforward to extract the water elevation from the binary images time series of water elevation i e effective water heights see hernández et al 2018 for details can be computed anywhere along the deck the scripts used can be consulted in hernández et al 2018 and are available at https doi org 10 17632 9vwdgv2g5z 3 an error of 1 mm in the water elevation measurements was verified during the stages of image acquisition and processing time series of water elevation were obtained at the eight equally spaced positions over the structure deck p0 to p7 in fig 3d the measurements at p0 correspond to the freeboard exceedance time series that is the variation of the resultant water elevations at the bow edge of the structure this is a relevant data in the study of green water since it represents the initial conditions for simulation purposes hernández fontes et al 2019a on the other hand the measurements obtained at p1 p7 represent the time series of water elevation at different positions over the deck the experimental data of the consecutive green water events obtained at positions p0 to p7 were firstly employed in this work to perform the parameter identification a and b parameters of the ad equation that was used to model the green water propagation eq 1 as described in sect 3 and 5 afterwards they were used to compare the analytical solution convolution of the ad equation to represent the water evolution over the deck sect 6 in our tests three different regular wave trains were considered assuming the linear wave theory for deep waters the regular wave characteristics that were sent to the wave maker had different wave lengths but the same wave heights in order to test incoming waves with different steepness characteristics of the incident waves for the three study cases c1 c3 are summarized in table 2 the wave trains obtained in these cases generated green water events of the plunging dam break pdb type see greco et al 2007 for details these events were adequate to be modeled by the ad approach which considers shipping water events invading horizontally the deck hernández fontes et al 2019c and to obtain single valued water surface measurements using image based methods hernández et al 2018 further details in the experimental methods can be found in hernández fontes et al 2020 5 implementation of the approaches to compute the a and b parameters the eight experimental measurements taken at p0 p7 fig 3d are denoted as η 0 t η 7 t as shown in fig 1 for the implementation of the proposed approaches described in sect 3 table 1 p0 and p7 correspond to the boundaries of the deck so consequently η 0 t and η 7 t are the boundary conditions notice that the approximation of 2 η x t x 2 requires three measurements observations of η η i 1 t η i t and η i 1 t therefore for the first and second approaches these three measurements are always required for estimating the coefficients this fact implies that both boundary conditions are required for estimating a i and b i at the coordinates x i within the boundaries since eight measurements are available and two are the boundary functions six couples of a i and b i are estimated as illustrated in fig 1 for the second approach measurements η 0 t η 2 t and η 4 t were used for estimating a single couple of coefficients a and b as illustrated in fig 2 for each study case time series of the parameters a and b for the positions p1 p6 fig 3d were obtained the results provided by the three approaches are summarized in tables 3 and 4 the values between the second and seventh columns are the coefficient values for each position that were estimated with the first approach the values in the penultimate column are the resulting estimations from the second approach and the values of the last column are the resulting estimation of the application of the third approach the estimators were tuned by setting λ 1 the initial conditions of the first order differential equations composing the estimators were all set to zero the matrix s t was initialized as s 0 i the observer was implemented in matlab simulink by using the ode4 runge kutta solver with δ t 0 02 s as time step for numerically solving the differential equations 6 convolution results for green water evolution this section presents the comparison of results obtained with the convolution approach and the experiments at positions p1 p6 for the three study cases first a time step analysis is presented sect 6 1 which is required to guarantee an adequate representation of the kernel function hernández fontes et al 2019c next the convolution model was implemented sect 6 2 considering the three approaches for a and b identification finally a quantitative analysis was performed to investigate the differences between the convolution results and the experiments sect 6 3 6 1 time step selection the area of the convolution kernel has to be equal to the unity wang et al 2014 hernández fontes et al 2019c thus an adequate time step δ t must be considered to apply the convolution model for the case of green water this assessment can be done by considering the position over the deck closer to the border of the domain i e x 0 where the rising limb of the kernel function is steeper as suggested by hernández fontes et al 2019c the procedure for determining the appropriate time step is graph the kernel for the position closer to the origin for different time steps and select the one that reproduces the rising limb with at least more than three time steps this will give the area of the convolution the closest possible to the unity in this sense fig 4 a and b shows the kernel function k at p1 for case 1 and case 3 respectively six time steps from 0 1 s to 0 0005 s were tested the a and b values corresponding to these cases for p1 were taken from tables 3 and 4 respectively in both cases note that only the time steps of 0 5 and 0 1 s did not allow representing the rising limb of the kernel in fact it can be verified below each figure that the area of the kernel curves equals to unity for time steps lower than 0 005 s therefore to guarantee an adequate kernel assessment the time step of 0 001 s was selected for all the model implementations of this study 6 2 model implementation figs 5 7 show the comparison of the water elevation time series obtained with the convolution model for the three approaches defined in sect 3 and 5 approaches 1 2 and 3 table 1 and the experiments for cases 1 2 and 3 respectively in each figure the time series were obtained and compared for the six positions p1 p6 defined in the sketch of fig 3d in the plots shown for each position the input series used for each case has been included to visualize the evolution of the shipping water along the deck furthermore the convolution results were compared with mean and standard deviation sd values of the experiments which were obtained from three test repetitions performed for each case table 5 describes the experimental data of each study case employed for application of the convolution model in all cases the time domain for the analysis was 19 t 24 5 s notice that for the case 1 six green water events were presented whereas for case 2 and 3 five events occurred during this period of time for illustrative purposes fig 8 shows some snapshots from the second to fifth events of green water found in 19 t 24 5 s for each study case note that in all the events plunging dam break pdb events were presented in these events a small air cavity was initially formed at the beginning of the deck then it was trapped by the flow and then collapsed generating bubbles that escaped downstream while water propagated over the deck details regarding these events are well described by greco 2001 greco et al 2007 colicchio et al 2011 hernández fontes et al 2019a in the next paragraphs a qualitative description of the results for the three cases is presented to verify the differences between the convolution approaches and the experiments a quantitative analysis is provided in sect 6 3 for case 1 fig 5 which considers the green water events generated with the steepest waves ε 0 056 it can be noted that results of approach 1 show differences with respect to those obtained with approaches 2 and 3 which gave similar amplitudes at x 0 04 m fig 5a the three approaches overestimate the experiments but approximate quite well the time at which peak values occurred for each event from 0 08 x 0 16 m fig 5b d the convolution results present a better agreement with the experiments regardless of a considerable overestimation in the peak values by the approach 1 at x 0 08 and x 0 12 m at farther positions from the beginning of the deck x 0 20 m x 0 24 m fig 5e and f approach 1 underestimated the experimental amplitudes and delayed the occurrence of the peak values whereas approaches 2 and 3 captured quite well the experiments for case 2 fig 6 which considers the waves with intermediate steepness ε 0 042 all the convolution approaches seemed to capture well the experiments assessing quite well the peaks at which maximum values occurred at x 0 04 m fig 6 a approach 1 showed an excellent agreement with the experiments whereas approaches 2 and 3 overestimated the peak values next for 0 08 x 0 20 m fig 6b e the three approaches remained very close between them with approach 1 presenting a small overestimation of peak values at the farthest position considered x 0 24 m fig 6f approach 1 presented a delay with respect to the other results similarly as observed in case 1 for case 3 fig 7 which considers the longest waves for green water generation ε 0 034 the trend of the convolution results with respect to the experiments is very similar to the one verified in case 2 however in this case it seems that convolution results approximated better the peak values of each event than the previous cases particularly for 0 04 x 0 20 m fig 7a e in spite of some difficulties to capture the first event which presented a very small amount of water over the deck at x 0 24 m fig 7f the three convolution approaches underestimated the first and fourth event but presented a reasonable agreement for the other events until now we have only given qualitative descriptions of the trends observed in the results shown in figs 5 7 it seems that the three approaches used are capable of reproducing the recorded elevations with an acceptable engineering accuracy however a more detailed analysis is required to identify which one provides better performance thus the next section includes a quantitative analysis to verify the degree of approximation of the three convolution approaches with respect to the experimental data 6 3 differences between convolution and experiments to evaluate the goodness of fit of the convolution approaches two procedures of comparison have been followed which are summarized in table 6 the comparison is performed directly against the water elevation time series mean and standard deviation values basically these two procedures are based in an analysis of the areas under the time series curves procedure 1 and the maximum elevations presented in each green water event procedure 2 procedure 1 is quite simple but provides a global idea about the differences between real and predicted amount of water over the deck on the other hand procedure 2 quantifies the differences between the stages at which the green water effects over the deck may be more significant since the occurrence of the maximum elevations over the deck are often related with the occurrence of the maximum vertical green water loads buchner 2002 hernández fontes et al 2019d in procedure 1 table 6 the areas under the curves of convolution a c o n v and experimental a e x p results cases 1 3 figs 5 7 were obtained from 19 t 24 5 s by trapezoidal integration then the ratios between a c o n v and a e x p were compared for different positions along the deck as shown in fig 9 higher ratios suggest a global overestimation of the shipped amount of water during the events considered in the analysis of each case study fig 9a b and c show the a c o n v a e x p ratios for cases 1 2 and 3 respectively the main findings are described next at the beginning of the deck p1 a c o n v obtained with approaches 2 and 3 was closer to a e x p than with approach 1 for the three cases a c o n v of approach 1 underestimated a e x p approximately 6 at intermediate positions over the deck p2 p3 a c o n v for the three approaches overestimated a e x p in less than 8 for all the cases at p4 convolution results resulted very close to the experiments however at farther positions over the deck p5 p6 a c o n v the three approaches underestimated a e x p this underestimation was close to 20 at p6 for the three cases the differences between convolution and experiments at farther positions from the bow may be attributed to a thin layer of water of 5 mm that remained over the deck after each event see fig 9a c regarding an overall evaluation it can be concluded that approaches 2 and 3 provided better predictions than approach 1 in procedure 2 table 6 the maximum elevation of each green water event η m and its time of occurrence t m were considered thus two errors were defined to compare η m and t m considering the experiments as reference mean plus standard deviation values for t m and η m the error between convolution and experiments was defined as e t m t m c o n v t m e x p t m e x p and e η m η m c o n v η m e x p η m e x p respectively in these expressions the subscripts c o n v and e x p denote convolution and experiments respectively figs 10 12 show the errors e t m and e η m for each of the events found in cases 1 2 and 3 respectively these were calculated with the time series of η at each position p1 p6 over the deck 0 04 x 0 24 positive values of e t m mean that η m c o n v occurred after η m e x p conversely negative values of e t m indicate that convolution results anticipated the experiments on the other hand positive and negative e η m values refer to overestimation and underestimation of the experiments respectively our main findings in the analysis of e t m and e η m for the three case studies are summarized in next paragraphs case 1 fig 10 at the beginning of the deck p1 e t m from the three convolution approaches is close to zero for all the green water events this trend remains between p2 and p5 for the events 3 6 then e t m tend to increase between p5 and p6 a different behavior occurred for the first and second events which presented negative values from p2 to p5 tending to increase from p5 to p6 overall it can be stated that t m c o n v captured quite well t m e x p at the start and middle of the deck particularly during the events 3 to 6 at the end of the deck t m c o n v delayed to attain t m e x p during almost all the events regarding the error e η m note that in all the events and approaches η m c o n v show good results at p4 and p5 at the start of the deck p1 p2 the η m c o n v values given by the three convolution approaches overestimate η m e x p between 20 60 whereas at the end of the deck p6 η m e x p was underestimated in less than 35 in general all the convolution approaches tend to overestimate η m e x p at the beginning of the deck next they present a closer agreement at the middle of the deck to finally underestimate it at the end of the deck to identify the convolution approaches that allowed a better approximation with the experiments fig 13 summarizes the approaches that presented the errors e t m and e η m closer to zero for all the green water events in the three study cases in general it can be verified from fig 13 that for case 1 the convolution approaches 2 and 3 presented the smallest errors allowing a closer agreement with the experiments case 2 fig 11 from p1 to p4 e t m was very close to zero so the agreement of t m c o n v with respect to t m e x p was good for the three approaches in all the events however from p5 to p6 t m c o n v presented a time delay to capture t m e x p regarding e η m the best agreement of η m c o n v with η m e x p occurred between p2 p4 η m e x p was overestimated and underestimated by all the convolution approaches at the beginning p1 and the end p6 of the deck respectively from fig 13 it can be inferred that approach 3 offer better results of t m e x p in all the events with respect to the assessment of η m e x p approaches 2 and 3 allowed the minimum errors i e a better assessment particularly at the middle and end of the deck case 3 fig 12 from p1 to p6 the three convolution approaches followed a similar trend showing e t m close to zero particularly in events 2 to 5 this indicates an acceptable assessment of t m e x p by t m c o n v with regards to e η m the best agreement of η m c o n v of the three convolution approaches with η m e x p occurred at the intermediate positions over the deck p2 p4 particularly between events 2 and 4 for p5 p6 η m c o n v tended to underestimate η m e x p in general table 13 suggests that the convolution approaches 3 and 2 performed quite well to approximate the t m and η m values of experiments respectively from the results observed through figs 9 13 it is possible to conclude that approaches 2 and 3 give good results regarding the spatio temporal evolution of water on deck elevation for consecutive green water events this can be of practical use to predict the evolution of green water events on structures from the identification of mean and constant a and b parameters knowing these parameters for a specific deck and estimating the freeboard exceedance it would be possible to predict the distribution of water on deck and subsequently to estimate the evolution of loading through simplified engineering procedures such as in hernández fontes et al 2019d it is important to mention that the present ad approach has limitation to estimate the exact water elevations over the deck as observed in the comparisons with experiments however these differences can be acceptable from an engineering point of view since it is a simplified analytical approach developed under the assumption of neglecting inertial terms in the governing momentum equation hernández fontes et al 2019c despite of this it presents the capability to be implemented at low computational cost allowing to capture general trends of the evolution of multiple green water events in an approximate way this capability may be useful in global analyzes of green water either by coupling the present approach with ship dynamic codes e g rajendran et al 2016 or using it for estimating shipping water loads with safety factors 7 conclusions in this work the prediction of the spatio temporal evolution of green water elevations on deck of a fixed structure considering the advection diffusion ad approach to model the propagation of consecutive green water events was performed the main contribution of this research is precisely related to the identification of the advection and diffusion parameters in the ad equation to overcome the trial and error procedures to estimate these parameters in previous research to validate the present approach experiments of green water were performed with regular waves of different steepness time series of water elevations were obtained from high speed videos by using image based approaches the main findings of the research can be summarized as follows advection a and diffusion b parameters were identified then three different approaches to assess these parameters in the ad convolution model were tested and compared to identify the one that better approximates the experimental results these considered constant parameters in time but variable in space approach 1 mean constant parameters approach 2 and constant parameters roughly estimated approach 3 it was verified that for the three approaches the convolution model captured the trends of experiments providing results that approximated well the time at which maximum elevations of each green water event were presented overall approaches 2 and 3 provided acceptable results this suggests that mean and constant a and b parameters obtained from the identified ones can give acceptable results to represent the water on deck evolution from an engineering point of view with the identification of a and b parameters convolution models that are solutions of the ad equation can be used to represent the propagation of water over the deck these models can be easily implemented at low computational cost and coupled with more complex dynamic system analyzers the topics of further research to extend the present work can be described as follows the present study considered a simplified structure with very small roughness in the deck to demonstrate the use of the method of identification however it can be further investigated for different deck configurations e g by varying its slope and roughness and conditions of operation e g applications with fixed or moving structures different prototype deck arrangements can be represented in model scale to perform green water experiments then a similar procedure as the one proposed in this work can be implemented to identify a and b parameters proper of that deck for different test conditions with these data an alternative of practical implementation of the present approach could be to generate curves or tables of a and b parameters for different structure and wave conditions therefore further research could verify the possibility of characterizing the structure to predict the evolution of water on deck in real conditions credit authorship contribution

procedure to derive the ad equation more details related to its derivation from the navier stokes equations regarding the green water problem can be found in the works of hernández fontes 2018 hernández fontes et al 2019c the simplified shallow water equations in the x direction i e 1d equations considering only the shear stress produced by the bottom boundary τ x z are expressed by the equations of continuity eq 15 and momentum 16 as follows 15 η t u η x 0 16 u η t u 2 η x g η η x 1 ρ τ x z where η is the water surface t is time x is the coordinate in the horizontal direction g is the acceleration due to gravity ρ is the fluid density τ x z is the bottom shear stress and u is to the depth averaged flow velocity in the x direction assuming subcritical flow conditions the continuity equation remains as eq 15 while the momentum equation is simplified to eq 17 17 η x τ x z ρ g η the bottom shear stress is considered empirically through the manning resistance approach this practice is commonly employed to consider frictional effects in a simplified way in other areas of research such as in hydraulics and hydrology chanson 2004 gottardi and venutelli 2008 therefore the simplified momentum equation eq 17 can be expressed as 18 η x u β η a 2 where β 1 m r with m r as the manning roughness coefficient with dimension l 1 3 t and a 2 3 through some mathematical

equation with η as the only dependent variable 19 η t u a 1 η x u η 2 s f 2 η x 2 appendix b the a and b parameters were estimated using an algorithm known as a state estimator this algorithm is made up of two ingredients a copy of the model plus a correction term state estimator model correction term the proposed first ingredient i e the model used to deal with the estimation of a and b is given by eq 12 which can be re expressed in a simpler manner as follows 20 ξ t g i u t y t ξ t y t c ξ t where u t is a function involving η i 1 t and η i 1 t whereas y t is η i t on the other hand the second ingredient the correction term is the estimation error multiplied by a convergence gain k t namely the estimation error is defined as 21 e t ξ ˆ t ξ t where ξ ˆ is the state vector involving the estimated state variables a state estimator for a system with a model expressed by eq 20 can be given as follows 22 ξ ˆ g i u t y t ξ ˆ t m o d e l k t e t c o r r e c t i o n t e r m it is important to note in eq 22 that the purpose of k t is to make the error tends to zero i e e t 0 as t this idea may become clearer if the differential error equation is developed and solved the differential equation of the error is given by 23 e t ξ t ξ ˆ t by substituting ξ t and ξ ˆ t from eq 20 and eq 22 into the equation above one has 24 e t g i u t y t ξ t g i u t y t ξ ˆ t k t e t g i u t y t ξ t ξ ˆ t k t e t g i u t y t k t θ e t if the so called state matrix g u t y t and the convergence gain k t were both constant the homogeneous solution for the differential equation 24 would be 25 e t γ e θ t where γ would be e 0 notice then that e t would have a decreasing exponential behavior if and only if θ 0 since this behavior is precisely that one wants it must be ensured that θ is always negative by choosing the convergence gain such that the eigenvalues of θ are negatives in their real part for systems with a time varying state matrix such as in eq 20 the choice of k t is a little more complicated task however this task was accomplished by bornard et al 1989 hammouri and de leon morales 1990 who proposed a convergence gain given by 26 k i t s i 1 t c i t where s i t is

21611,in this research a hybrid approach for global path planning for maritime autonomous surface ship mass is proposed which generates the shortest path considering the collision risk and the proximity between path and obstacles the collision risk concerning obstacles is obtained using time varying collision risk tcr concept taking into account the velocity constraint of the ship that can achieve during operation the influence of proximity from obstacles is measured with the fast marching fm algorithm a new cost function is proposed allowing to combine the influence of obstacle proximity and collision risk in the region finally the fast marching square algorithm is applied to generate the globally optimal path that can reach the pre set destination the contribution of this work is two fold 1 considering the velocity constraint of the own ship together with its influences of collision risk into the global path planning stage of autonomous navigation 2 measuring the collision risk induced by the obstacles from their comprehensive influences on the achievable velocity range using tcr concept instead of numerical integration of risk measurement the results of the case study indicate that the proposed approach can find an optimal path considering the collision risk and proximity from the obstacles keywords global path planning autonomous ship fast marching method fast marching square method velocity obstacle 1 introduction maritime transportation industry plays a significant role in the development of the world economy accidents however have been continuously posing risks to the society and the environment in terms of various aspects e g loss of human life property etc improving the safety and efficiency of maritime traffic has always been an important research topic in academia chen et al 2019 huang et al 2020 the autonomous ship in the meantime is considered as a promising future to facilitate the development of maritime safety ghaderi 2018 wrobel et al 2017 wu et al 2020 xue et al 2019 path planning as one of the critical task providing a safe and efficient route for the navigation of an autonomous ship has been drawing much attention from both the academia and industry liu et al 2016 the objective of path planning is to provide an optimal route considering the various factors e g distance travel time etc for the ship to navigate in certain regions such a process is classified into two major categories 1 global path planning this category of research is to provide a general macroscopic route solution for autonomous ships considering more the static environment such as geographic characteristics e g akka and khaber 2018 meteorological information e g song et al 2017 etc and 2 local trajectory planning this category of research is to provide a specific trajectory or series of motions to achieve certain objectives e g collision avoidances e g lyu and yin 2018a according to huang et al 2020 huang and van gelder 2019 the collision risk between the ship and an obstacle also depends on the velocity of the ship during navigation integration of the velocity profile of the ship would facilitate the development of a path that suits the manoeuvrability characteristics of the ship at the global path level to expand the research on global path planning in this direction a collision risk integrated path planning method is proposed based on fast marching square fm2 method in this paper compared with the traditional methods the contribution of this research is two fold 1 the integration of collision risk into the global path planning process by considering the velocity constraint of the own ship to obtain length and risk optimal path 2 collision risk is measured with comprehensive influences of all obstacles in the velocity space of the own ship using time varying collision risk tcr huang and van gelder 2019 concept instead of numerically integrating the individual measurement on each obstacle in this manner a path that considers both the distance collision risk from a velocity perspective can be proposed such a path has the potential to be furtherly integrated with the local motion planning process to facilitate the development of the control model of mass to do this we propose the integration of the fm2 gomez et al 2013 and velocity obstacle vo fiorini and shiller 1998 method to generate the shortest path considering both the collision risk and the proximity from obstacles the contents of the paper are arranged as follows section 2 presents a brief literature review concerning global path planning methods section 3 elaborates the details on the methodology introduced in the research followed by information on the methods utilised in the research and the details on the model design in section 4 a case study of global path planning using the proposed hybrid approach is implemented in section 5 followed by its comparison with the results obtained with classical dijkstra algorithm and discussions on the hybrid approach in section 6 section 7 concludes the research 2 literature review path planning is a research topic in various disciplines in this section we mainly focus on the development of related works in the maritime discipline especially for ocean going ships and mass among the related literature the optimisation methods and heuristic searching methods are popular in path planning liu et al 2016 artificial potential field apf is a frequently seen method for path planning of maritime vessels which obtains the path via constructing a potential field of the environment the destination of the path generates global attractive forces to the ship and the obstacles stationary or dynamic in the environment generates local repulsive forces lyu and yin 2018b constructed an artificial potential field to represent the influence of obstacles and international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs for the collision avoidance of autonomous ships wang et al 2019 established a multi layered apf model for the path planning of the unmanned ship with consideration of minimum energy consumption and external influences a discretised version of apf is also proposed by lazarowska 2019 to obtain collision free trajectory for the ship among these examples the risk induced by obstacles is usually measured by the function of local repulsive forces which is determined by the proximity between obstacles and the own ship in the meantime the short computation time of heuristic methods has made them the most popular methods in global path planning of autonomous ships the principle of this type of global path planning method is to generate the optimal path with the lowest total cost path length energy consumption etc for the risk of collision in these methods the distance between obstacles is also frequently utilised to formulate the estimation function ant colony optimisation aco a star a singh et al 2018b and dijkstra algorithm singh et al 2018a topaj et al 2019 are representatives for this approach lazarowska 2014 applied aco for path planning during collision avoidance of autonomous ships in a dynamic environment xia et al 2019 proposed an improved quantum aco algorithm considering multiple obstacles for path planning of autonomous ship eriksen et al 2019 2020 have developed a series of new methods for path planning and collision avoidance operation for the autonomous ship the energy saving perspective and rule compliance colav have also been integrated into the process using a approach and model predictive control mpc method another typical approach of global path planning is the computational geometry methods such as voronoi diagram vd visibility graph vg etc candeloro et al 2017 utilised vd as the global planner of the underactuated marine vessels considering the depth information of the environment kulbiej 2018 utilised vg to design the shortest path for autonomous ship considering the confined marine environment besides to integrate the advantages of vd and vg niu et al 2019 applied the voronoi visibility graph based approach for path planning problem of autonomous ships as for this type of approach the distance between obstacles and ships are also frequently utilised as indicators of collision risk for the global paths obtained with the methods above the length or travel time could be optimal and shortest in the meantime the collision risk induced by external factors wind current etc and limitations of the own ship alongside the path e g maximum and minimum velocities of the ship etc should also be considered some works have been conducted to solve this issue e g song et al 2017 have proposed a fast marching method fmm based approach that generates the shortest path considering the external influence of wind and current garrido et al 2020 also applied such a set of methods on path planning of marine surface ship with consideration of the influence of wind current etc via a vector field for the collision risk analysis in these works proximity from obstacles still the primary indicator although the velocity of obstacles is also utilised to measure the risk with indicators such as distance time to closest point of approach d tcpa such parameters are frequently integrated numerically e g yoo and lee 2019 zhang et al 2019 in such a design it is difficult to give a clear physical interpretation to the control module or remote operator of mass on the current situation tcr concept can analyse the risk of collision via measuring the difficulty of collision avoidance in velocity space and consider the influences from multiple obstacles comprehensively e g du et al 2020 based on such an idea a risk integrated fast marching square fm2 method is then proposed to generate the optimal path considering both the path length and velocity related collision risk 3 methodology 3 1 methodological overview of the research in this research the risk of collision defined as the proportion of velocities which would lead to a collision to the whole velocity sets that the own ship can achieve such an idea is adopted from huang and van gelder 2019 where the risk is considered as inversely proportional to the free space in the velocity space of the own ship such a consideration include the difficulty level of collision avoidance into the risk analysis process based on this definition of collision risk a tcr integrated fm2 tcr fm2 path planning method is proposed 1 firstly a spatial proximity map of the obstacles is obtained by conducting the fast marching of front originating from the obstacles 2 secondly the collision risk map in the region is calculated with the method of linear vo algorithm on each cell of the map and 3 by integrating these two layers of analysis on the environment as a new indicator through a path cost function the shortest path considering both the proximity between ship and obstacles and collision risk can be generated with gradient descent method the details of the methods utilised are elaborated in section 3 2 and 3 3 respectively the framework of the methodology can be found in fig 1 3 2 fast marching and fast marching square method fast marching method fmm is firstly proposed by sethian sethian 1996 1999 to compute the position of a monotonically propagating front by solving the eikonal equation a path of shortest time cost of front expansion can be extracted from the arrival time matrix of the fronts with the utilisation of the gradient descent method especially when the speed of the front expansion is set as a constant e g 1 the time optimal path obtained can also be considered as the path with the shortest distance based on such a principle fmm has been proposed sethian 1996 and applied in the path route planning of robots and mass etc garrido et al 2017 2020 janson et al 2015 song et al 2017 as aforementioned the essence of the fmm is solving the eikonal equation sethian 1996 which is where is the time when the front reaches the point and is the front expansion speed at the point according to the design of the fmm proposed by sethian 1996 valero gomez et al 2013 three types of points are defined to apply the algorithm on a grid map 1 unknown which denotes the points where the front has yet not reached whose arrival time is therefore unknown 2 narrow band which are the points that the front will arrive at next step and 3 frozen which are the points that the front have already passed and their arrival time have been therefore determined from the front origin an iteration of arrival time calculation at each point of the map is then performed the starting point which is also the origin of the path is defined as a frozen point with arrival time assigned as 0 at the first iteration for each round of iterations the arrival time of the front on all points around frozen points are calculated by solving the discretised form of the eikonal equation the details of such a process can be referred to garrido et al 2017 after the iteration the arrival time of each point in the grid map is obtained as an ordinal number which qualitatively indicates the total cost from the origin if no metric is specified an example of front expansion in a 50 50 grid space without obstacle is shown in fig 2 for global path planning with a single origin this method is efficient to obtain the shortest path with the gradient descent method however the results of this method only consider the cost on distance which cannot ensure the safety of the path as it may drive the autonomous ships into dangerous proximity with the obstacles to handle such an issue gomez et al 2013 valero gomez et al 2013 proposed the fast marching square fm2 method to integrate the consideration of safety during global path planning following the logic of fmm the difference compared with the original fmm is that it introduced a two step front expansion 1 for the first step consider all the obstacles in the environment as the start points to obtain a potential field i e the arrival time map of the fronts induced from the obstacles is calculated as shown in fig 3 if the path planned needs to be contained within the environment an external boundary could be added by one grid outside the environment which is shown in fig 3 b the blue ring around fig 3 b is induced by the external boundary added the discussion of the boundary is followed up in section 6 2 2 taking the arrival time map as a function of the speed i e the closer the points to the obstacle the speed of front expansion at this point will be slower a second round calculation of arrival time with the velocity map is performed based on which the time and safety optimal path can be obtained 3 3 modified time varying collision risk vo method is another tool for detecting and measuring the collision risk between the ship and obstacles chen et al 2018 huang et al 2018 the principle of vo is the projection of the spatial temporal relationship between the own ship and the obstacle e g suppose that ship a navigates in the waterways where b is an obstacle the status of ship a can be denoted as and obstacle b is denoted as where l is the dimensions of them p is the position of a and b at time t and v is the velocity of them at the time step t since b is the static obstacle in the environment its position is set to be stationary and its velocity is set to be 0 fig 4 shows their spatiotemporal relationship and corresponding projection into the velocity space of a as shown in fig 4 b the spatiotemporal relationship between ship a and obstacle can be projected into the velocity space of ship a are all the possible positions of a around the obstacle when the collision happens in the future time huang et al 2018 the criterion of collision considering the ship s movement can be denoted as where denotes the position of a and b at collision time and is the minkowski addition denotes the position of a and b at the given time after the observation timestep considering the assumption that a maintain their kinematic status constant during the encounter process the collision criterion can be reorganised as where denotes the velocity sets of the own ship induced by the obstacle which is the cone shaped area in the velocity space of the own ship and indicates the distance between ship b and a at observation timestep such a projection provides an effective method to determine the risk of collision if the velocity of the own ship falls into collision will happen in the future if the ship does not take action due to the assumption that the ship s kinematic status remains constant the vo method utilised in research is also defined as linear vo lvo method vo provides an efficient method to determine which velocities of the own ship are likely to cause a collision with obstacles by obtaining the vo sets such a risk measurement not only consider the distance between the own ship and the obstacles but also take the spatiotemporal proximity into account with the utilisation of velocity based on this notion in this research the risk of collision between the own ship and obstacles is calculated using the concept of tcr which is is the range of velocity of own ship obtained by lvo which denotes the velocities that could lead to a collision between the own ship and obstacles in the environment is the range of the possible velocities that the own ship can achieve the basic idea is demonstrated in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 the blue ring indicates and the red area is the velocities that could lead to a collision in huang and van gelder 2019 is obtained by accurately estimating the reachability of the own ship based on its manoeuvrability parameters such a process would need extensive computational time for each point in the map and should be considered in local motion planning collision avoidance instead of global path planning as a modification of tcr here we use maximum and minimum velocities the ship can reach as the constraint of for simplification the risk of collision is obtained with the proportion of to in this manner the influence of ship velocity on collision risk can be considered from a general perspective at the global planning stage 4 model design 4 1 map construction the first step for the path planning is to construct the grid based environment map for further processing since the vo method is introduced to calculate the collision risk in each cell of the grid map which requires the actual geo coordinates of the obstacles as the inputs to construct the vo sets the picture based map is not suitable to utilise directly therefore the environment map will be reconstructed from the geographical information about the obstacles the information on the obstacles is obtained from map providers such as openstreetmap 1 1 https www openstreetmap org first it then is extracted with the help of geographical information system gis software such as qgis etc by setting the reference point of the region the geo coordinates of the obstacles will be transformed into the coordinate system with the unit which is consistent with the velocity of the ship e g meter in distance and m s in velocity in this research we utilised the meter as the unit based on these processes a map of obstacles in cartesian coordination system can be constructed fig 6 shows an example of the process 4 2 obstacle potential field construction the objective of this process is to construct a potential field of the environment to measure the spatial proximity from the obstacles the obstacles are set as origins of the expansion of the front with same expansion speed of the fronts the arrival time of each position in the environment can be considered as a measurement of the proximity of the obstacles which then can be considered as a measurement of collision risk gomez et al 2013 valero gomez et al 2013 the resized grid map of the obstacles based on the spatial resolution r in the analysis is first processed to obtain the location of obstacles once the locations are obtained the fast marching method is introduced to perform the front expansion originating from the obstacles to determine the obstacle potential map fig 7 elaborates an example of obstacle potential map with a grid size of 10 m which is obtained based on fig 6 b the effect of map resolution is discussed in section 6 3 as the figure shows the blue regions indicate the area close to or inside the obstacles and the yellow areas indicate longer distance from the obstacles 4 3 integration of fm2 and tcr in the conventional fm2 method the distance from obstacles is considered to formulate the indicator of collision risk however such design only considers the spatial proximity between the location of interest and obstacles and ignores the influences of the spatiotemporal relationship between them which is caused by the velocity of the moving object to integrate this aspect into the path planning process we adopt the modified tcr to measure the collision risk on each cell in the environment based on the possible velocity range of the ship the calculation process is as follows 1 determine the centre point of the cell 2 perform the lvo algorithm for each obstacle for a detection time of 30 min i e to analyse the potential collision risk with this obstacle for the next 30 min in the future this parameter can be adjusted for the practical application 3 combine all the lvo sets obtained for the obstacles and calculate the proportion of the overlap between the lvo sets and the possible velocity set of the own ship as the risk indicators of the cell to integrate the obstacle potential matrix and the collision risk matrix a cost function for front expansion speed in the second step of fm2 method which is utilised to modify the front expansion speed at each point is proposed 1 c x y α χ 1 r e s c a l e d p o b s t a c l e x y 1 α χ r c o l l i s i o n x y v x y 1 c x y is the combined cost for front expansion at considering both the proximity level and the local collision risk obtained with lvo is a weight factor on the preference between the spatial proximity from the obstacle and the collision risk to decide which component has a stronger influence on cost which is determined by comparing the total cost of the possible paths obtained using the algorithm is the front expansion speed based on the cost at the point if the local cost is high the front expansion speed is slow vice versa to let the proximity level and risk have the same level of influence on the total cost here we rescale the range of to 0 1 where 0 means that the location is an obstacle and 1 means that the location is at the farthest position from obstacles 4 4 path extraction using the gradient descent method after the establishment of the risk potential map the second round of fm is performed with the velocity of front expansion modified the small value of indicates the front expands slowly vice versa a new arrival time matrix of front propagation will be obtained after the second round of fast marching from the start point of the path based on which the gradient descent method is then performed to extract a path that has the global lowest cost 4 5 design of the algorithm the whole process of the tcr integrated fm2 algorithm is implemented through the fmm toolbox of matlab 2 2 https nl mathworks com matlabcentral fileexchange 6110 toolbox fast marching algorithm 1 shows the pseudocode of the whole algorithm algorithm 1

case study on path planning with the proposed tcr fm2 algorithm is illustrated to verify the method to do this an area for the case study is randomly chosen and the geo information of the region is extracted within the following boundary latitude 25 2125 n to 25 2390 n longitude 119 5705 e to 119 67 e the configuration of the case study are shown in table 1 5 1 map construction based on the open street map service the geo coordinates of the obstacles are obtained in the form shown as where is the boundary of the ith obstacle in the area are the vertices of the obstacles stored in latitude longitude manner via setting the left bottom corner as the reference point of the map the positions of obstacles are transformed into the relative distance from the reference point using spherical distance calculation based on which a corresponding environment map is constructed and illustrated in fig 8 before applying fm2 on this map to obtain the obstacle potential the environment map should be transformed into a grid map with a larger resolution instead of 1 m in the original form to improve the efficiency of the calculation in this case study we chose 50 m as the resolution of the map which is shown in fig 8 b however different resolution can be selected based on the trade off between the computation time and the accuracy of the results 5 2 obstacle potential map the first step to applying tcr fm2 method is to obtain the obstacle potential map based on the environmental information the binary occupancy map fig 8 b is utilised as the input of the first step of fm with the settings as follows 1 front expand speed as 1 2 obstacles as the front origins after the front propagation the arrival time matrix of the front expansion is obtained fig 9 is the illustration of the rescaled arrival time of the front expansion from the obstacles with or without external boundary respectively the blue region indicates areas close to the obstacle and the red areas show otherwise this obstacle potential map can be considered as a measurement of spatial proximity between the possible positions of the autonomous ship and obstacle as can be seen from fig 9 the obstacle potential map with an external boundary alongside the map boundary is significantly different from the one without boundary the reason to do so is to avoid the path planned reaching or exceeding the boundary such difference on the path planning will be discussed in section 6 2 5 3 collision risk map and integration with obstacle potential as the next step lvo based collision risk potential map is constructed by calculating collision risk on each cell in the map which is shown in fig 10 from fig 10 one can see clearly how collision risk is distributed in the environment considering the range of the velocity that the autonomous ship can achieve compared with the obstacle potential map the collision risk does not linearly decrease with the increment of the distance from obstacles for some points that are close to the obstacles the collision risk considering the velocity range of the autonomous ship could be small which is still navigable considering both the spatial proximity and the collision risk during the global path planning the obstacle potential map and collision risk map are integrated based on the total cost function fig 11 shows the combined potential map with different α values one can see that when the α value is small a large area of the environment is available for the front to expand with high speed however as the α value increases the high speed area decreases which reflects the increment of the influence of spatial proximity from obstacles such difference will have an impact on the shortest path obtained with the introduction of the gradient descent method which will be elaborated in section 5 4 and discussed in section 6 3 5 4 path planning with the front expansion speed map obtained in section 5 3 the second round of fm should be applied with pre set front origin to obtain the arrival time map and the shortest path to compare the results obtained with standard fmm and different types of fm2 4 cases of path planning are examined table 2 gives the name and description of each method the paths obtained under different configurations are shown in fig 12 their path length and accumulated risk are illustrated in table 3 fig 12 1 is the path planned with standard fmm one can see that the path is the shortest connection between the start point and destination table 3 however alongside the planned path two parts are extremely close to the obstacle the accumulated risk of this path is also the highest among the four paths obtained table 3 as an improvement fig 12 2 and 3 illustrate the paths planned utilised collision risk and proximity from obstacles as the cost respectively the problem shown in fig 12 1 can be solved by expanding the obstacles with methods such as standard fm2 and obtain a path that keeps a safe distance from the obstacles as shown in fig 12 3 however as fig 10 indicates the collision risk considering the own ship s velocity is not evenly distributed around obstacles so simply expanding the obstacles could generate a longer path 12 3 that sacrifices the length of path length as can be seen from table 3 the path obtained with standard fm2 has the lowest accumulated risk but the longest path length among the four results for the risk based path fig 12 2 compared with the path obtained with standard fmm the accumulated risk is lower than the path obtained with standard fmm however it path through some small objectives which is not optimal from the navigation perspective fig 12 4 shows a good combination of 2 and 3 the accumulated risk of the path obtained with tcr fm2 is only slightly larger than that of standard fm2 and the path length is shorter than that of standard fm2 to a large extent table 3 the determination of weight factor alpha is discussed in section 6 3 compared with fig 12 2 the path obtained with tcr fm2 avoids the high risk and complicated area by travelling around the obstacles to the destination and at the same time by staying at certain proximity from the obstacles and the path is shorter than the path planned by standard fm2 besides these two indicators we also analysed the curvature of each path fig 13 shows the boxplot of the curvature value at each point of the paths the outliers are discarded in the figure only to show general descriptions of the paths for path obtained with risk based fm2 and standard fm2 their curvature is more dispersed compared with paths obtained with standard fmm and tcr fm2 which indicates more manoeuvres have to be performed to follow the path at the same time the curvature distribution of path obtained with tcr fm2 is narrow which indicates a low path curvature fluctuation 5 5 path planning with dynamic obstacles for global path planning in practices the influences from the external dynamic obstacles such as other ships in the region should also be considered to achieve this we have added another component of collision risk which is induced by target ships into the risk function which is shown in eq 2 2 r c o l l i s i o n x y r s t a t i c o b s t a c l e x y r d y n a m i c o b s t a c l e x y denotes the tcr induced by the static obstacles at point and denotes the tcr induced by the dynamic obstacles at point the estimation of follow the same method as which is based on chen et al 2018 since the information of the static environment remains constant during the navigation such a design can simply recalculate risk from dynamic obstacles when it needs an update in this way the influences from target ships can be integrated into the cost function of the proposed tcr fm2 method to verify such design another case study on global path planning considering two assumed target ships is conducted the configuration of the case study is illustrated in table 4 a target ship with known kinematic information is considered in this case study besides an iteration scheme is also introduced to plan the global path at a certain time interval the goal of this case study is to verify the capability of the path update of the proposed method instead of real time collision avoidance the target ship is assumed to keep speed and course unchanged the speed of own ship is assumed to randomly choose between 2 and 4 m s to simulate the update of ship speed during navigation here we designed to update the path every 5 min the risk distribution in the region and the corresponding planned path is shown in fig 14 as shown in fig 14 with different iterations the position of target ships is updated and considered in the collision probability estimation at each iteration the proposed tcr fm2 can update the result of path planning with a new calculation of the collision risk induced by the target ships at a new start point when in practices once the new information of target ships is acquired from ais radar etc or the pre set update frequency has been reached the proposed method can update the global path from the current location of the own ship as for the update frequency in this case we chose 5 min in practices such parameter can be adjusted based on the updated information of target ships and the computational speed of each iteration in the meantime a dynamic local motion model can be developed and integrated with this method to design a complete path planning module for mass however since the goal of this research is to develop a global path planning method such consideration is not included in this work 6 discussion in the previous section a series of case studies are conducted to illustrate the process of tcr fm2 algorithm on path planning in the environment and compare with three paths obtained with fmm and fm2 methods in this section the algorithm will be discussed on the comparison with the classical dijkstra algorithm the consideration of boundary during path planning and the choice of the parameters α and resolution for tcr fm2 for optimal path planning 6 1 comparison with the dijkstra algorithm as a comparison two cases of path planning with classical dijkstra 4 and 8 direction searching algorithms are shown in fig 15 respectively which did not consider the collision risk factor the principle of searching is the same between these two algorithms while the difference is the number of search directions from the figure one can see that both dijkstra algorithms give the shortest path that goes through the area with high collision risk between islands and have close distances from the obstacles besides compared with the path obtained from fmm and tcr fm2 the results have many sharp turns and path sections which is not suitable for the manoeuvre of autonomous ships and could result in a collision accident this could be explained as follows 1 due to the discretised nature of the dijkstra algorithm the direction of searching is pre defined in the implementation of the algorithm e g 4 directions and 8 directions the paths obtained based on such configurations are therefore not as smooth as those obtained with fm2 which is continuous in design 2 same as the standard fmm since the classic dijkstra algorithm does not consider the influence of obstacle proximity and collision risk the path obtained will follow the principle of shortest total length which would lead to paths being too close to the boundary of the obstacles considering these differences the proposed tcr fm2 performs better on finding the shortest path considering both the spatial proximity of obstacles and collision risk induced by the velocities of the own ship 6 2 consideration of the map boundary during the construction of the obstacle potential map an external boundary of the environment based on the grid map was introduced by adding a set of phantom obstacles at one cell outside the boundary of the map the cost of approaching map boundary can be obtained and therefore influence the process of path planning fig 16 illustrates two cases of the planned paths under two scenarios with or without consideration of the map boundary from fig 16 one can see that the boundary of the environment influences the result of path planning such influence can be explained as follows with the integration of standard fm2 the obstacles are enlarged to some extent however in a certain situation shown in fig 16 a the enlargement could force the gradient descent algorithm to generate the path alongside the boundary of the map however compared with fig 16 b the path obtained under such a scenario is longer and has more sharp turns which is not optimal compared with the results considering the influence of map boundary this influence depends on the location of the start point and destination of the path to some extent considering the difference in fig 16 to deal with such scenarios the following aspects can be considered 1 carefully determine the weight factor to adjust the influence of obstacle enlargement 2 put an additional boundary of the area for path planning to consider it as an obstacle in the region such boundary can be set on the grid map obtained from the region s map with one cell outside the area the reason to do so is to ensure each cell in the map is reachable 6 3 influence of parameter settings according to the cost function a convex combination of the risk cost and obstacle proximity cost is proposed with parameter α to integrate the influence from these two aspects for each α a shortest length path under the configuration will be obtained after the tcr fm2 process therefore it is necessary to determine which path obtained is optimal among the solutions to do this an analysis of the paths obtained with is conducted the total length measured in cells of the grid map and accumulated risk of paths are shown in fig 17 a a combined evaluation indicator which is the geometric mean of the total length and total risk is shown in fig 17 b from fig 17 one can see that with the increment of weight factor α the total length of the path planned is increasing this is because the increasing influence of the obstacle potential with α will push the path from the obstacles as far as possible at the initial stage the path planned is short among other results but the corresponding accumulated risk is high the accumulated risk decreases with the increment of path length but at a certain point such decrement stops as fig 17 a indicates that risk is increasing with α afterwards which indicates these paths are not optimal in both total length and accumulated risk from fig 17 a it is difficult to determine which α and the corresponding path is optimal to determine this we choose the geometric mean of path length and accumulated as the combined evaluation indicator the results of the evaluation are shown in fig 17 b one can see that the evaluation of the paths is also divided into two parts this can be explained by the results that the path has changed from going through the islands and instead go around the obstacles according to fig 17 b when α 0 31 the combined evaluation is the minimum which can be considered as the optimal choice for the case from this process it is advised that a comparison between the combined evaluation under different α should be conducted to find the best solution when implementing the method another parameter which could also have an influence on the global path planning process is the resolution of the environmental map the resolution of the environment map determines the accuracy of the shape of obstacles when they are constructed as the binary occupancy grid fig 18 indicates the different binary occupancy grid map of the same environment and target ship information with different resolutions fig 19 gives the relative difference between the length of path obtained with α 0 1 under different resolutions as can be seen from the figure with high resolution the accuracy of the obstacle shape can be increased however as the number of the grid is increasing the computational burden of the static risk map is also increasing according to fig 19 the median relative difference of all the path lengths obtained with different resolutions are less than 0 25 0 25 to achieve a proper balance between the update frequency of path planning and the accuracy of the map and path results a trade off between these two aspects should be considered when utilising this method in practices we advise choosing the resolution parameter based on the relationship between the dimension of the own ship and the regional geographic characteristics of the obstacles such as shape and size of them and relatively large value to increase the computation speed of the algorithm 7 conclusions path planning is a critical component of the autonomous ship system to facilitate finding the optimal route and its safety of navigation to improve the quality of global path planning various methods have been proposed in this research a collision risk integrated fm2 tcr fm2 algorithm is proposed to plan the path for autonomous ship considering both the influence of environment obstacles and the velocity of the own ship for the conventional global path planning methods that find the time distance paths the influence of the velocity range of own ship can achieve on collision risk is rarely considered from a comprehensive perspective to integrate such information into the process a vo based collision risk measurement is introduced to measure the risk of collision between ship and obstacles via the space of the dangerous velocity in the velocity space of the autonomous ship based on the definition the spatial risk map is obtained which is utilised as input for the fm2 algorithm the influence of the environmental obstacles is obtained with the original design of the fm2 algorithm with the integration of the two path costs according to the convex combination function in the paper a front expansion cost matrix considering both the influence of spatial proximity and collision risk between obstacles are obtained as the inputs for the fm2 algorithm for path planning four case studies based on different configurations of path planning methods are conducted based on the comparison one can see that the proposed method integrates both the advantages from risk based path planning and standard distance based fm2 algorithm and produces a path that can avoid the high risk areas and maintain a short total length at the same time besides compared with results from the dijkstra algorithm the tcr fm2 avoids producing a path that has sharp turns and proximity to obstacles which shows good potential for practical implications an analysis of the influence of weight factor α is also conducted the results indicate that with the increase of α the total length of the planned path increases continuously while the accumulated risk first decreases and then increases slowly to determine the optimal path the combined evaluation on the path length and accumulated risk should be considered besides an additional case study on verifying the capability of updating the path planning considering the dynamic obstacle is also conducted compared with other global path planning methods the advantages of the proposed method are as follows 1 considering both the path length and collision risk during planning 2 introduction of velocity induced collision risk considering the velocity constraint of the own ship and 3 measuring collision risk from obstacles in the velocity space which provides a clear physical interpretation of the risk in the meantime the relatively higher computational burden of the proposed method induced by the cell based design is the limitation however since the computational power is increasing fast with proper optimisation of the computer code with higher efficiency such limitation can be addressed in practices with the proposed tcr fm2 the velocity information of the autonomous ship is introduced into the global path planning stage it provides a new perspective on finding multiple objectives i e efficiency and safety optimal path planning with the utilisation of fm2 method as the framework which could facilitate the development of

21611,in this research a hybrid approach for global path planning for maritime autonomous surface ship mass is proposed which generates the shortest path considering the collision risk and the proximity between path and obstacles the collision risk concerning obstacles is obtained using time varying collision risk tcr concept taking into account the velocity constraint of the ship that can achieve during operation the influence of proximity from obstacles is measured with the fast marching fm algorithm a new cost function is proposed allowing to combine the influence of obstacle proximity and collision risk in the region finally the fast marching square algorithm is applied to generate the globally optimal path that can reach the pre set destination the contribution of this work is two fold 1 considering the velocity constraint of the own ship together with its influences of collision risk into the global path planning stage of autonomous navigation 2 measuring the collision risk induced by the obstacles from their comprehensive influences on the achievable velocity range using tcr concept instead of numerical integration of risk measurement the results of the case study indicate that the proposed approach can find an optimal path considering the collision risk and proximity from the obstacles keywords global path planning autonomous ship fast marching

continuously posing risks to the society and the environment in terms of various aspects e g loss of human life property etc improving the safety and efficiency of maritime traffic has always been an important research topic in academia chen et al 2019 huang et al 2020 the autonomous ship in the meantime is considered as a promising future to facilitate the development of maritime safety ghaderi 2018 wrobel et al 2017 wu et al 2020 xue et al 2019 path planning as one of the critical task providing a safe and efficient route for the navigation of an autonomous ship has been drawing much attention from both the academia and industry liu et al 2016 the objective of path planning is to provide an optimal route considering the various factors e g distance travel time etc for the ship to navigate in certain regions such a process is classified into two major categories 1 global path planning this category of research is to provide a general macroscopic route solution for autonomous ships considering more the static environment such as geographic characteristics e g akka and khaber 2018 meteorological information e g song et al 2017 etc and 2 local trajectory planning this category of research is to provide a specific trajectory or series of motions to achieve certain objectives e g collision avoidances e g lyu and yin 2018a according to huang et al 2020 huang and van gelder 2019 the collision risk between the ship and an obstacle also depends on the velocity of the ship during navigation integration of the velocity profile of the ship would facilitate the development of a path that suits the manoeuvrability characteristics of the ship at the global path level to expand the research on global path planning in this direction a collision risk integrated path planning method is proposed based on fast marching square fm2 method in this paper compared with the traditional methods the contribution of this research is two fold 1 the integration of collision risk into the global path planning process by considering the velocity constraint of the own ship to obtain length and risk optimal path 2 collision risk is measured with comprehensive influences of all obstacles in the velocity space of the own ship using time varying collision risk tcr huang and van gelder 2019 concept instead of numerically integrating the individual measurement on each obstacle in this manner a path that considers both the distance collision risk from a velocity perspective can be proposed such a path has the potential to be furtherly integrated with the local motion planning process to facilitate the development of the control model of mass to do this we propose the integration of the fm2 gomez et al 2013 and velocity obstacle vo fiorini and shiller 1998 method to generate the shortest path considering both the collision risk and the proximity from obstacles the contents of the paper are arranged as follows section 2 presents a brief literature review concerning global path planning methods section 3 elaborates the details on the methodology introduced in the research followed by information on the methods utilised in the research and the details on the model design in section 4 a case study of global path planning using the proposed hybrid approach is implemented in section 5 followed by its comparison with the results obtained with classical dijkstra algorithm and discussions on the hybrid approach in section 6 section 7 concludes the research 2 literature review path planning is a research topic in various disciplines in this section we mainly focus on the development of related works in the maritime discipline especially for ocean going ships and mass among the related literature the optimisation methods and heuristic searching methods are popular in path planning liu et al 2016 artificial potential field apf is a frequently seen method for path planning of maritime vessels which obtains the path via constructing a potential field of the environment the destination of the path generates global attractive forces to the ship and the obstacles stationary or dynamic in the environment generates local repulsive forces lyu and yin 2018b constructed an artificial potential field to represent the influence of obstacles and international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs for the collision avoidance of autonomous ships wang et al 2019 established a multi layered apf model for the path planning of the unmanned ship with consideration of minimum energy consumption and external influences a discretised version of apf is also proposed by lazarowska 2019 to obtain collision free trajectory for the ship among these examples the risk induced by obstacles is usually measured by the function of local repulsive forces which is determined by the proximity between obstacles and the own ship in the meantime the short computation time of heuristic methods has made them the most popular methods in global path planning of autonomous ships the principle of this type of global path planning method is to generate the optimal path with the lowest total cost path length energy consumption etc for the risk of collision in these methods the distance between obstacles is also frequently utilised to formulate the estimation function ant colony optimisation aco a star a singh et al 2018b and dijkstra algorithm singh et al 2018a topaj et al 2019 are representatives for this approach lazarowska 2014 applied aco for path planning during collision avoidance of autonomous ships in a dynamic environment xia et al 2019 proposed an improved quantum aco algorithm considering multiple obstacles for path planning of autonomous ship eriksen et al 2019 2020 have developed a series of new methods for path planning and collision avoidance operation for the autonomous ship the energy saving perspective and rule compliance colav have also been integrated into the process using a approach and model predictive control mpc method another typical approach of global path planning is the computational geometry methods such as voronoi diagram vd visibility graph vg etc candeloro et al 2017 utilised vd as the global planner of the underactuated marine vessels considering the depth information of the environment kulbiej 2018 utilised vg to design the shortest path for autonomous ship considering the confined marine environment besides to integrate the advantages of vd and vg niu et al 2019 applied the voronoi visibility graph based approach for path planning problem of autonomous ships as for this type of approach the distance between obstacles and ships are also frequently utilised as indicators of collision risk for the global paths obtained with the methods above the length or travel time could be optimal and shortest in the meantime the collision risk induced by external factors wind current etc and limitations of the own ship alongside the path e g maximum and minimum velocities of the ship etc should also be considered some works have been conducted to solve this issue e g song et al 2017 have proposed a fast marching method fmm based approach that generates the shortest path considering the external influence of wind and current garrido et al 2020 also applied such a set of methods on path planning of marine surface ship with consideration of the influence of wind current etc via a vector field for the collision risk analysis in these works proximity from obstacles still the primary indicator although the velocity of obstacles is also utilised to measure the risk with indicators such as distance time to closest point of approach d tcpa such parameters are frequently integrated numerically e g yoo and lee 2019 zhang et al 2019 in such a design it is difficult to give a clear physical interpretation to the control module or remote operator of mass on the current situation tcr concept can analyse the risk of collision via measuring the difficulty of collision avoidance in velocity space and consider the influences from multiple obstacles comprehensively e g du et al 2020 based on such an idea a risk integrated fast marching square fm2 method is then proposed to generate the optimal path considering both the path length and velocity related collision risk 3 methodology 3 1 methodological overview of the research in this research the risk of collision defined as the proportion of velocities which would lead to a collision to the whole velocity sets that the own ship can achieve such an idea is adopted from huang and van gelder 2019 where the risk is considered as inversely proportional to the free space in the velocity space of the own ship such a consideration include the difficulty level of collision avoidance into the risk analysis process based on this definition of collision risk a tcr integrated fm2 tcr fm2 path planning method is proposed 1 firstly a spatial proximity map of the obstacles is obtained by conducting the fast marching of front originating from the obstacles 2 secondly the collision risk map in the region is calculated with the method of linear vo algorithm on each cell of the map and 3 by integrating these two layers of analysis on the environment as a new indicator through a path cost function the shortest path considering both the proximity between ship and obstacles and collision risk can be generated with gradient descent method the details of the methods utilised are elaborated in section 3 2 and 3 3 respectively the framework of the methodology can be found in fig 1 3 2 fast marching and fast marching square method fast marching method fmm is firstly proposed by sethian sethian 1996 1999 to compute the position of a monotonically propagating front by solving the eikonal equation a path of shortest time cost of front expansion can be extracted from the arrival time matrix of the fronts with the utilisation of the gradient descent method especially when the speed of the front expansion is set as a constant e g 1 the time optimal path obtained can also be considered as the path with the shortest distance based on such a principle fmm has been proposed sethian 1996 and applied in the path route planning of robots and mass etc garrido et al 2017 2020 janson et al 2015 song et al 2017 as aforementioned the essence of the fmm is solving the eikonal equation sethian 1996 which is where is the time when the front reaches the point and is the front expansion speed at the point according to the design of the fmm proposed by sethian 1996 valero gomez et al 2013 three types of points are defined to apply the algorithm on a grid map 1 unknown which denotes the points where the front has yet not reached whose arrival time is therefore unknown 2 narrow band which are the points that the front will arrive at next step and 3 frozen which are the points that the front have already passed and their arrival time have been therefore determined from the front origin an iteration of arrival time calculation at each point of the map is then performed the starting point which is also the origin of the path is defined as a frozen point with arrival time assigned as 0 at the first iteration for each round of iterations the arrival time of the front on all points around frozen points are calculated by solving the discretised form of the eikonal equation the details of such a process can be referred to garrido et al 2017 after the iteration the arrival time of each point in the grid map is obtained as an ordinal number which qualitatively indicates the total cost from the origin if no metric is specified an example of front expansion in a 50 50 grid space without obstacle is shown in fig 2 for global path planning with a single origin this method is efficient to obtain the shortest path with the gradient descent method however the results of this method only consider the cost on distance which cannot ensure the safety of the path as it may drive the autonomous ships into dangerous proximity with the obstacles to handle such an issue gomez et al 2013 valero gomez et al 2013 proposed the fast marching square fm2 method to integrate the consideration of safety during global path planning following the logic of fmm the difference compared with the original fmm is that it introduced a two step front expansion 1 for the first step consider all the obstacles in the environment as the start points to obtain a potential field i e the arrival time map of the fronts induced from the obstacles is calculated as shown in fig 3 if the path planned needs to be contained within the environment an external boundary could be added by one grid outside the environment which is shown in fig 3 b the blue ring around fig 3 b is induced by the external boundary added the discussion of the boundary is followed up in section 6 2 2 taking the arrival time map as a function of the speed i e the closer the points to the obstacle the speed of front expansion at this point will be slower a second round calculation of arrival time with the velocity map is performed based on which the time and safety optimal path can be obtained 3 3 modified time varying collision risk vo method is another tool for detecting and measuring the collision risk between the ship and obstacles chen et al 2018 huang et al 2018 the principle of vo is the projection of the spatial temporal relationship between the own ship and the obstacle e g suppose that ship a navigates in the waterways where b is an obstacle the status of ship a can be denoted as and obstacle b is denoted as where l is the dimensions of them p is the position of a and b at time t and v is the velocity of them at the time step t since b is the static obstacle in the environment its position is set to be stationary and its velocity is set to be 0 fig 4 shows their spatiotemporal relationship and corresponding projection into the velocity space of a as shown in fig 4 b the spatiotemporal relationship between ship a and obstacle can be projected into the velocity space of ship a are all the possible positions of a around the obstacle when the collision happens in the future time huang et al 2018 the criterion of collision considering the ship s movement can be denoted as where denotes the position of a and b at collision time and is the minkowski addition denotes the position of a and b at the given time after the observation timestep considering the assumption that a maintain their kinematic status constant during the encounter process the collision criterion can be reorganised as where denotes the velocity sets of the own ship induced by the obstacle which is the cone shaped area in the velocity space of the own ship and indicates the distance between ship b and a at observation timestep such a projection provides an effective method to determine the risk of collision if the velocity of the own ship falls into collision will happen in the future if the ship does not take action due to the assumption that the ship s kinematic status remains constant the vo method utilised in research is also defined as linear vo lvo method vo provides an efficient method to determine which velocities of the own ship are likely to cause a collision with obstacles by obtaining the vo sets such a risk measurement not only consider the distance between the own ship and the obstacles but also take the spatiotemporal proximity into account with the utilisation of velocity based on this notion in this research the risk of collision between the own ship and obstacles is calculated using the concept of tcr which is is the range of velocity of own ship obtained by lvo which denotes the velocities that could lead to a collision between the own ship and obstacles in the environment is the range of the possible velocities that the own ship can achieve the basic idea is demonstrated in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 the blue ring indicates and the red area is the velocities that could lead to a collision in huang and van gelder 2019 is obtained by accurately estimating the reachability of the own ship based on its manoeuvrability parameters such a process would need extensive computational time for each point in the map and should be considered in local motion planning collision avoidance instead of global path planning as a modification of tcr here we use maximum and minimum velocities the ship can reach as the constraint of for simplification the risk of collision is obtained with the proportion of to in this manner the influence of ship velocity on collision risk can be considered from a general perspective at the global planning stage 4 model design 4 1 map construction the first step for the path planning is to construct the grid based environment map for further processing since the vo method is introduced to calculate the collision risk in each cell of the grid map which requires the actual geo coordinates of the obstacles as the inputs to construct the vo sets the picture based map is not suitable to utilise directly therefore the environment map will be reconstructed from the geographical information about the obstacles the information on the obstacles is obtained from map providers such as openstreetmap 1 1 https www openstreetmap org first it then is extracted with the help of geographical information system gis software such as qgis etc by setting the reference point of the region the geo coordinates of the obstacles will be transformed into the coordinate system with the unit which is consistent with the velocity of the ship e g meter in distance and m s in velocity in this research we utilised the meter as the unit based on these processes a map of obstacles in cartesian coordination system can be constructed fig 6 shows an example of the process 4 2 obstacle potential field construction the objective of this process is to construct a potential field of the environment to measure the spatial proximity from the obstacles the obstacles are set as origins of the expansion of the front with same expansion speed of the fronts the arrival time of each position in the environment can be considered as a measurement of the proximity of the obstacles which then can be considered as a measurement of collision risk gomez et al 2013 valero gomez et al 2013 the resized grid map of the obstacles based on the spatial resolution r in the analysis is first processed to obtain the location of obstacles once the locations are obtained the fast marching method is introduced to perform the front expansion originating from the obstacles to determine the obstacle potential map fig 7 elaborates an example of obstacle potential map with a grid size of 10 m which is obtained based on fig 6 b the effect of map resolution is discussed in section 6 3 as the figure shows the blue regions indicate the area close to or inside the obstacles and the yellow areas indicate longer distance from the obstacles 4 3 integration of fm2 and tcr in the conventional fm2 method the distance from obstacles is considered to formulate the indicator of collision risk however such design only considers the spatial proximity between the location of interest and obstacles and ignores the influences of the spatiotemporal relationship between them which is caused by the velocity of the moving object to integrate this aspect into the path planning process we adopt the modified tcr to measure the collision risk on each cell in the environment based on the possible velocity range of the ship the calculation process is as follows 1 determine the centre point of the cell 2 perform the lvo algorithm for each obstacle for a detection time of 30 min i e to analyse the potential collision risk with this obstacle for the next 30 min in the future this parameter can be adjusted for the practical application 3 combine all the lvo sets obtained for the obstacles and calculate the proportion of the overlap between the lvo sets and the possible velocity set of the own ship as the risk indicators of the cell to integrate the obstacle potential matrix and the collision risk matrix a cost function for front expansion speed in the second step of fm2 method which is utilised to modify the front expansion speed at each point is proposed 1 c x y α χ 1 r e s c a l e d p o b s t a c l e x y 1 α χ r c o l l i s i o n x y v x y 1 c x y is the combined cost for front expansion at considering both the proximity level and the local collision risk obtained with lvo is a weight factor on the preference between the spatial proximity from the obstacle and the collision risk to decide which component has a stronger influence on cost which is determined by comparing the total cost of the possible paths obtained using the algorithm is the front expansion speed based on the cost at the point if the local cost is high the front expansion speed is slow vice versa to let the proximity level and risk have the same level of influence on the total cost here we rescale the range of to 0 1 where 0 means that the location is an obstacle and 1 means that the location is at the farthest position from obstacles 4 4 path extraction using the gradient descent method after the establishment of the risk potential map the second round of fm is performed with the velocity of front expansion modified the small value of indicates the front expands slowly vice versa a new arrival time matrix of front propagation will be obtained after the second round of fast marching from the start point of the path based on which the gradient descent method is then performed to extract a path that has the global lowest cost 4 5 design of the algorithm the whole process of the tcr integrated fm2 algorithm is

case study on path planning with the proposed tcr fm2 algorithm is illustrated to verify the method to do this an area for the case study is randomly chosen and the geo information of the region is extracted within the following boundary latitude 25 2125 n to 25 2390 n longitude 119 5705 e to 119 67 e the configuration of the case study are shown in table 1 5 1 map construction based on the open street map service the geo coordinates of the obstacles are obtained in the form shown as where is the boundary of the ith obstacle in the area are the vertices of the obstacles stored in latitude longitude manner via setting the left bottom corner as the reference point of the map the positions of obstacles are transformed into the relative distance from the reference point using spherical distance calculation based on which a corresponding environment map is constructed and illustrated in fig 8 before applying fm2 on this map to obtain the obstacle potential the environment map should be transformed into a grid map with a larger resolution instead of 1 m in the original form to improve the efficiency of the calculation in this case study we chose 50 m as the resolution of the map which is shown in fig 8 b however different resolution can be selected based on the trade off between the computation time and the accuracy of the results 5 2 obstacle potential map the first step to applying tcr fm2 method is to obtain the obstacle potential map based on the environmental information the binary occupancy map fig 8 b is utilised as the input of the first step of fm with the settings as follows 1 front expand speed as 1 2 obstacles as the front origins after the front propagation the arrival time matrix of the front expansion is obtained fig 9 is the illustration of the rescaled arrival time of the front expansion from the obstacles with or without external boundary respectively the blue region indicates areas close to the obstacle and the red areas show otherwise this obstacle potential map can be considered as a measurement of spatial proximity between the possible positions of the autonomous ship and obstacle as can be seen from fig 9 the obstacle potential map with an external boundary alongside the map boundary is significantly different from the one without boundary the reason to do so is to avoid the path planned reaching or exceeding the boundary such difference on the path planning will be discussed in section 6 2 5 3 collision risk map and integration with obstacle potential as the next step lvo based collision risk potential map is constructed by calculating collision risk on each cell in the map which is shown in fig 10 from fig 10 one can see clearly how collision risk is distributed in the environment considering the range of the velocity that the autonomous ship can achieve compared with the obstacle potential map the collision risk does not linearly decrease with the increment of the distance from obstacles for some points that are close to the obstacles the collision risk considering the velocity range of the autonomous ship could be small which is still navigable considering both the spatial proximity and the collision risk during the global path planning the obstacle potential map and collision risk map are integrated based on the total cost function fig 11 shows the combined potential map with different α values one can see that when the α value is small a large area of the environment is available for the front to expand with high speed however as the α value increases the high speed area decreases which reflects the increment of the influence of spatial proximity from obstacles such difference will have an impact on the shortest path obtained with the introduction of the gradient descent method which will be elaborated in section 5 4 and discussed in section 6 3 5 4 path planning with the front expansion speed map obtained in section 5 3 the second round of fm should be applied with pre set front origin to obtain the arrival time map and the shortest path to compare the results obtained with standard fmm and different types of fm2 4 cases of path planning are examined table 2 gives the name and description of each method the paths obtained under different configurations are shown in fig 12 their path length and accumulated risk are illustrated in table 3 fig 12 1 is the path planned with standard fmm one can see that the path is the shortest connection between the start point and destination table 3 however alongside the planned path two parts are extremely close to the obstacle the accumulated risk of this path is also the highest among the four paths obtained table 3 as an improvement fig 12 2 and 3 illustrate the paths planned utilised collision risk and proximity from obstacles as the cost respectively the problem shown in fig 12 1 can be solved by expanding the obstacles with methods such as standard fm2 and obtain a path that keeps a safe distance from the obstacles as shown in fig 12 3 however as fig 10 indicates the collision risk considering the own ship s velocity is not evenly distributed around obstacles so simply expanding the obstacles could generate a longer path 12 3 that sacrifices the length of path length as can be seen from table 3 the path obtained with standard fm2 has the lowest accumulated risk but the longest path length among the four results for the risk based path fig 12 2 compared with the path obtained with standard fmm the accumulated risk is lower than the path obtained with standard fmm however it path through some small objectives which is not optimal from the navigation perspective fig 12 4 shows a good combination of 2 and 3 the accumulated risk of the path obtained with tcr fm2 is only slightly larger than that of standard fm2 and the path length is shorter than that of standard fm2 to a large extent table 3 the determination of weight factor alpha is discussed in section 6 3 compared with fig 12 2 the path obtained with tcr fm2 avoids the high risk and complicated area by travelling around the obstacles to the destination and at the same time by staying at certain proximity from the obstacles and the path is shorter than the path planned by standard fm2 besides these two indicators we also analysed the curvature of each path fig 13 shows the boxplot of the curvature value at each point of the paths the outliers are discarded in the figure only to show general descriptions of the paths for path obtained with risk based fm2 and standard fm2 their curvature is more dispersed compared with paths obtained with standard fmm and tcr fm2 which indicates more manoeuvres have to be performed to follow the path at the same time the curvature distribution of path obtained with tcr fm2 is narrow which indicates a low path curvature fluctuation 5 5 path planning with dynamic obstacles for global path planning in practices the influences from the external dynamic obstacles such as other ships in the region should also be considered to achieve this we have added another component of collision risk which is induced by target ships into the risk function which is shown in eq 2 2 r c o l l i s i o n x y r s t a t i c o b s t a c l e x y r d y n a m i c o b s t a c l e x y denotes the tcr induced by the static obstacles at point and denotes the tcr induced by the dynamic obstacles at point the estimation of follow the same method as which is based on chen et al 2018 since the information of the static environment remains constant during the navigation such a design can simply recalculate risk from dynamic obstacles when it needs an update in this way the influences from target ships can be integrated into the cost function of the proposed tcr fm2 method to verify such design another case study on global path planning considering two assumed target ships is conducted the configuration of the case study is illustrated in table 4 a target ship with known kinematic information is considered in this case study besides an iteration scheme is also introduced to plan the global path at a certain time interval the goal of this case study is to verify the capability of the path update of the proposed method instead of real time collision avoidance the target ship is assumed to keep speed and course unchanged the speed of own ship is assumed to randomly choose between 2 and 4 m s to simulate the update of ship speed during navigation here we designed to update the path every 5 min the risk distribution in the region and the corresponding planned path is shown in fig 14 as shown in fig 14 with different iterations the position of target ships is updated and considered in the collision probability estimation at each iteration the proposed tcr fm2 can update the result of path planning with a new calculation of the collision risk induced by the target ships at a new start point when in practices once the new information of target ships is acquired from ais radar etc or the pre set update frequency has been reached the proposed method can update the global path from the current location of the own ship as for the update frequency in this case we chose 5 min in practices such parameter can be adjusted based on the updated information of target ships and the computational speed of each iteration in the meantime a dynamic local motion model can be developed and integrated with this method to design a complete path planning module for mass however since the goal of this research is to develop a global path planning method such consideration is not included in this work 6 discussion in the previous section a series of case studies are conducted to illustrate the process of tcr fm2 algorithm on path planning in the environment and compare with three paths obtained with fmm and fm2 methods in this section the algorithm will be discussed on the comparison with the classical dijkstra algorithm the consideration of boundary during path planning and the choice of the parameters α and resolution for tcr fm2 for optimal path planning 6 1 comparison with the dijkstra algorithm as a comparison two cases of path planning with classical dijkstra 4 and 8 direction searching algorithms are shown in fig 15 respectively which did not consider the collision risk factor the principle of searching is the same between these two algorithms while the difference is the number of search directions from the figure one can see that both dijkstra algorithms give the shortest path that goes through the area with high collision risk between islands and have close distances from the obstacles besides compared with the path obtained from fmm and tcr fm2 the results have many sharp turns and path sections which is not suitable for the manoeuvre of autonomous ships and could result in a collision accident this could be explained as follows 1 due to the discretised nature of the dijkstra algorithm the direction of searching is pre defined in the implementation of the algorithm e g 4 directions and 8 directions the paths obtained based on such configurations are therefore not as smooth as those obtained with fm2 which is continuous in design 2 same as the standard fmm since the classic dijkstra algorithm does not consider the influence of obstacle proximity and collision risk the path obtained will follow the principle of shortest total length which would lead to paths being too close to the boundary of the obstacles considering these differences the proposed tcr fm2 performs better on finding the shortest path considering both the spatial proximity of obstacles and collision risk induced by the velocities of the own ship 6 2 consideration of the map boundary during the construction of the obstacle potential map an external boundary of the environment based on the grid map was introduced by adding a set of phantom obstacles at one cell outside the boundary of the map the cost of approaching map boundary can be obtained and therefore influence the process of path planning fig 16 illustrates two cases of the planned paths under two scenarios with or without consideration of the map boundary from fig 16 one can see that the boundary of the environment influences the result of path planning such influence can be explained as follows with the integration of standard fm2 the obstacles are enlarged to some extent however in a certain situation shown in fig 16 a the enlargement could force the gradient descent algorithm to generate the path alongside the boundary of the map however compared with fig 16 b the path obtained under such a scenario is longer and has more sharp turns which is not optimal compared with the results considering the influence of map boundary this influence depends on the location of the start point and destination of the path to some extent considering the difference in fig 16 to deal with such scenarios the following aspects can be considered 1 carefully determine the weight factor to adjust the influence of obstacle enlargement 2 put an additional boundary of the area for path planning to consider it as an obstacle in the region such boundary can be set on the grid map obtained from the region s map with one cell outside the area the reason to do so is to ensure each cell in the map is reachable 6 3 influence of parameter settings according to the cost function a convex combination of the risk cost and obstacle proximity cost is proposed with parameter α to integrate the influence from these two aspects for each α a shortest length path under the configuration will be obtained after the tcr fm2 process therefore it is necessary to determine which path obtained is optimal among the solutions to do this an analysis of the paths obtained with is conducted the total length measured in cells of the grid map and accumulated risk of paths are shown in fig 17 a a combined evaluation indicator which is the geometric mean of the total length and total risk is shown in fig 17 b from fig 17 one can see that with the increment of weight factor α the total length of the path planned is increasing this is because the increasing influence of the obstacle potential with α will push the path from the obstacles as far as possible at the initial stage the path planned is short among other results but the corresponding accumulated risk is high the accumulated risk decreases with the increment of path length but at a certain point such decrement stops as fig 17 a indicates that risk is increasing with α afterwards which indicates these paths are not optimal in both total length and accumulated risk from fig 17 a it is difficult to determine which α and the corresponding path is optimal to determine this we choose the geometric mean of path length and accumulated as the combined evaluation indicator the results of the evaluation are shown in fig 17 b one can see that the evaluation of the paths is also divided into two parts this can be explained by the results that the path has changed from going through the islands and instead go around the obstacles according to fig 17 b when α 0 31 the combined evaluation is the minimum which can be considered as the optimal choice for the case from this process it is advised that a comparison between the combined evaluation under different α should be conducted to find the best solution when implementing the method another parameter which could also have an influence on the global path planning process is the resolution of the environmental map the resolution of the environment map determines the accuracy of the shape of obstacles when they are constructed as the binary occupancy grid fig 18 indicates the different binary occupancy grid map of the same environment and target ship information with different resolutions fig 19 gives the relative difference between the length of path obtained with α 0 1 under different resolutions as can be seen from the figure with high resolution the accuracy of the obstacle shape can be increased however as the number of the grid is increasing the computational burden of the static risk map is also increasing according to fig 19 the median relative difference of all the path lengths obtained with different resolutions are less than 0 25 0 25 to achieve a proper balance between the update frequency of path planning and the accuracy of the map and path results a trade off between these two aspects should be considered when utilising this method in practices we advise choosing the resolution parameter based on the relationship between the dimension of the own ship and the regional geographic characteristics of the obstacles such as shape and size of them and relatively large value to increase the computation speed of the algorithm 7 conclusions path planning is a critical component of the autonomous ship system to facilitate finding the optimal route and its safety of navigation to improve the quality of global path planning various methods have been proposed in this research a collision risk integrated fm2 tcr fm2 algorithm is proposed to plan the path for autonomous ship considering both the influence of environment obstacles and the velocity of the own ship for the conventional global path planning methods that find the time distance paths the influence of the velocity range of own ship can achieve on collision risk is rarely considered from a comprehensive perspective to integrate such information into the process a vo based collision risk measurement is introduced to measure the risk of collision between ship and obstacles via the space of the dangerous velocity in the velocity space of the autonomous ship based on the definition the spatial risk map is obtained which is utilised as input for the fm2 algorithm the influence of the environmental obstacles is obtained with the original design of the fm2 algorithm with the integration of the two path costs according to the convex combination function in the paper a front expansion cost matrix considering both the influence of spatial proximity and collision risk between obstacles are obtained as the inputs for the fm2 algorithm for path planning four case studies based on different configurations of path planning methods are conducted based on the comparison one can see that the proposed method integrates both the advantages from risk based path planning and standard distance based fm2 algorithm and produces a path that can avoid the high risk areas and maintain a short total length at the same time besides compared with results from the dijkstra algorithm the tcr fm2 avoids producing a path that has sharp turns and proximity to obstacles which shows good potential for practical implications an analysis of the influence of weight factor α is also conducted the results indicate that with the increase of α the total length of the planned path increases continuously while the accumulated risk first decreases and then increases slowly to determine the optimal path the combined evaluation on the path length and accumulated risk should be considered besides an additional case study on verifying the capability of updating the path planning considering the dynamic obstacle is also conducted compared with other global path planning methods the advantages of the proposed method are as follows 1 considering both the path length and collision risk during planning 2 introduction of velocity induced collision risk considering the velocity constraint of the own ship and 3 measuring collision risk from obstacles in the velocity space which provides a clear physical interpretation of the risk in the meantime the relatively higher computational burden of the proposed method induced by the cell based design is the limitation however since the computational power is increasing fast with proper optimisation of the computer code with higher efficiency such limitation can be addressed in practices with the proposed tcr fm2 the velocity information of the autonomous ship is introduced into the global path planning stage it provides a new perspective on finding multiple objectives i e efficiency and safety optimal path planning with the utilisation of fm2 method as the framework which could facilitate the development of the global path planner of the autonomous ship in the future credit authorship contribution statement pengfei chen conceptualization methodology software formal analysis writing original draft yamin

performance is one of the main factors considered when assessing ship hydrodynamic performance at ship design stage ittc 2014 has been proposed the procedures and methods to predict self propulsion performance the self propulsion indices can be obtained by model tests or numerical computations scale model testing is a universally applicable approach to investigate ship self propulsion performance in gothenburg 2010 and tokyo 2015 a collection of ship models such as kvlcc2 kcs dtmb 5415 jbc and onrt were selected to carry out self propulsion tests by different research institutes and all test data is available the experimental measurements provide data for both exploration of flow physics and for cfd validation cfd is an alternative and more cost effective method of studying propeller hull interaction compared with model tests cfd computation of ship self propulsion not only reduces lots of time and cost but could provide more information of ship flow ship wave and other details related to the ship hydrodynamic performance there are two self propulsion numerical simulation methods proposed by ittc 2014 interpolation method and use of a controller kim et al 2006 used interpolation method to obtain the self propulsion point by trial and error using successive iterations until the force imbalance satisfied the order of 10 6 carrica et al 2010 proposed a method using pi speed controller and discretized propellers that could be used to predicted self propulsion performance for surface ships including kcs kvlcc and dtmb 5613 the use of speed controller made the self propulsion point available in a single run thus resulting in a reduced cpu time ship self propulsion free running computation usually used discretized propeller as propulsion model shen et al 2015 performed kcs self propulsion and maneuvering computations with direct discretization of the propeller using dynamic overset grids in openfoam grid convergence studies were performed to further validate the implementation of the overset grid method song et al 2020 predicted the effect of biofouling on ship self propulsion characteristics of the full scale kcs using cfd the barnacles on the hull rudder and propeller surfaces were represented using a roughness function model in wall function finally the effect of biofouling on the ship self propulsion parameters and propulsive efficiencies as well as flow characteristics around the hull are concluded guo et al 2020 conducted numerical simulations and analysis on the self propulsion performance of a waterjet propelled trimaran mrf was used to simulate directly the waterjet comparing the numerical results of bare hull and self propulsion with efd data proved the validity of the numerical method the body force method makes self propulsion computation more easily and quickly when the detailed propeller flow is not essential for some studies like interaction of propeller hull rudder system bakica et al 2019 simulated self propulsion with an actuator disk using cfd with vof and gfm method it can be found that body force method has high cpu efficiency without external algorithm coupling both bekhit 2018 and yuting 2019 had used discretized propeller and body force method to carry out self propulsion and dynamic manoeuver simulations the body force method could be proven to be a valid option to research propeller hull rudder interference considering the accuracy and rapid computational time usually the body force approaches can be classified into descriptive and iterative body force according to the methods of coupling with the rans solver in descriptive body force method the body force source term would be computed once and then input into rans solver so that the interaction between the propeller and hull would be ignored such as the model based on the simple hough and ordway approach hough and ordway 1964 the model is based on the experiment open water curve and discretizes the thrust and torque of the propeller using a specified distribution where the vessel speed or modified vessel speed is always taken as propeller advance speed in iterative body force method the virtual propeller and rans codes interact with each other towards a solution these methods generally originate from some potential flow methods such as lift line theory and blade element theory bet villa et al 2018 2019 have calculated the hull wake field in rans solver and propeller performance in boundary element method bem code separately and their results are iterated and updated each other until the convergence is reached the explicit iteration methods are used in their study tokgoz 2015 developed viscous flow method osaka university method oum coupled with rans which uses the lifting body theory and a simplified quasi steady two dimensional bemt blade element momentum theory with the infinite bladed propeller model in the approach the local instantaneous velocity within rans code is used as advance velocity and thrust and torque distributions are calculated by bemt in every iteration step the effective propeller inflow is implicitly accounted for in the hydrodynamic coefficients derived by cfd this method uses the direct coupling of bemt and rans rather than iterating their results this fact further reduces the computational time in comparison to traditional blade element model because the iteration loop to solve for the induction is avoided c l and c d are vital for the methods based on bemt however c l and c d are obtained according to two dimensional airfoils using empirical formulas or potential flow methods without considering viscous effects for this problem li et al 2019 had obtained directly c l and c d closer to the actual ones from open water cfd simulation combining the method of computing force and torque in oum and the method of obtaining c l and c d proposed by li et al 2019 modified oum considering the three dimensional viscous effect of the propeller is developed in this paper in this paper four propulsion models are adopted to simulate the ship self propulsion using pi speed controller including discretized propeller model and three body force methods three body force models are a model based on the simple hough and ordway approach hough and ordway 1964 oum based on the simplified quasi steady two dimensional bemt blade element momentum theory tokgoz 2015 and modified oum based on bemt considering the three dimensional viscous effects for a propeller considering the three dimensional effect the airfoil and space position will affect its performance and pitch will affect the angle of attack of the airfoil so c l and c d would be fitted into functions about radius chord length and pitch for three dimensional airfoils the key objective of this study is to compare the computation time and accuracy of different methods and verify the feasibility and reliability of modified oum for ship propulsion simulation ship model kcs with propeller kp505 was used for this study the computations are set according to experiment conditions provided by gothenburg 2010 the thrust velocity of

ω 0 where k is the turbulent kinetic energy and ω is the rate of dissipation of the turbulent energy 2 1 1 2 coordinate systems and ship motion equations ship motions are described on the basis of two right handed cartesian coordinate systems as shown in fig 2 according to momentum rigid body dynamics and momentum moment theorem ship motion equations of 6dof guo et al 2018 can be written as 7 m u v r w q x 8 m v w p u r y 9 m w u q v p z 10 i x p i z i y q r k 11 i y q i x i z r p m 12 i z r i y i x p q n in which i x i y and i z are the components of moment of inertia with respect to gravity center x y z and k m n are the components of external forces and moments acting on hull respectively the ship position is described in an earth fixed coordinate system with x pointing south y pointing east and z pointing upward the origin of the ship local coordinate system is set at the intersection of design waterline and bow the velocities for 6dof motions u v w p q r are reported in a ship local coordinate system with x axis positive toward stern y axis positive toward starboard and z axis positive upward the motions of the ship are reported at the center of gravity 2 1 1 3 free surface handling the single phase level set method is used to capture the free surface where the influence of air density and viscosity is ignored the water surface is regarded as the free interface ϕ is the distance from any point in flow field to free surface so the free surface is the iso surface with ϕ 0 the level set function burg 2005 is 13 ϕ t v ϕ 0 where v is the velocity vector in flow field in addition ϕ is zero at free surface positive in water and negative in air 14 ϕ 0 i n w a t e r 0 a t f r e e s u r f a c e 0 i n a i r the flow of water would be solved in the area of ϕ 0 and the position of free surface would be obtained by interpolation the boundary condition for the velocity at the interface n j is the normal vector 15 v n j 0 16 n j ϕ ϕ 2 1 1 4 overset grid technology the overall flow field domain is divided into a system of grids which overset one another by one or more grid cells rogers et al 2003 the ultimate goal of the overset method is to establish the relationship among grids of all regions and transfer the flow field information of boundary for computation of each region as shown in fig 1 the points of mesh 1 that fall into the solid surface of mesh 2 are marked as hole points which wouldn t participate in the calculation of flow field the points adjacent to hole points in grid 1 are hole boundary points these points accept the flow field information transmitted from mesh 2 through interpolation correspondingly the outer boundary points of mesh 2 would also receive the flow field information transmitted from mesh 1 through interpolation which is obtained by trilinear interpolation method the area between the hole boundary point of mesh 1 and the interpolation point of mesh 2 outer boundary is the overset area usually three steps are required for overset approach chan 2009 hole cutting the interpolation points identification and the donor cells identification the purpose of hole cutting is to remove the unnecessary or meaningless meshes such as the inside of a solid body before flow field computation the cutting face will be set in the area that needs to be removed and then the grid points that fall into cutting face will be identified and discarded in the cfd computation process hole mapping method is used for the hole cutting process the interpolation point identification is to identify two types of interpolation points as illustrated in fig 1 hole fringe points and outer boundary points the hole fringe points as any point near a hole point are easily identified the outer boundary point is any point that lies on the boundary of a computational mesh the donor cells identification is to identify the hexahedral donor cells with the interpolation points as the vertex the simplest and most reliable way to find donor cells is to traverse the entire mesh domains until the correct cells are found however the efficiency of this method is the lowest and the use of excellent data structure can improve the seeking speed adt attribute distributed tree is utilized for the donor search process 2 1 1 5 pi speed controller in self propulsion computation pi proportional integral speed controller carrica et al 2010 in the form of equation 13 is used is applied to match propeller rotating speed at target speed 17 n p e i 0 t e d t where n is propeller rotating speed e u t a r g e t u s h i p is the difference between instantaneous ship speed u s h i p and target speed u t a r g e t p and i are the proportional and integral constants the empirical formula for estimating p and i can be obtained by testing 18 p i n δ t 500 where δ t is time step theoretically any p and i value can finally control to reach the target speed but the value estimated by the empirical formula is more reasonable and the control process would be completed faster 2 1 2 propulsion model self propulsion computations would be carried out at model scale propulsion point using discretized propeller model and three body force methods as shown in fig 3 pi control method is used to match the propeller rotating speed where the target velocity is 2 2 m s in fig 4 three body force models are here considered a model based on the simple hough and ordway approach hough and ordway 1964 a model based on the simplified quasi steady two dimensional bemt blade element momentum theory tokgoz 2015 and a model based on bemt considering the three dimensional viscous effects the body force methods can usually be classified into descriptive and iterative body force based on the methods of obtaining the body force source term the model based on the simple hough and ordway approach is a descriptive body force the method discretizes the thrust and torque of the propeller according to the propeller open water curve using a specified distribution which is first put forward by hough and ordway the models based on bemt are iterative body force methods tokgoz 2015 developed viscous flow method osaka university method oum coupled with rans which uses the lifting body theory and a simplified quasi steady two dimensional bemt with the infinite bladed propeller model in the approach the local instantaneous velocity within rans code is used as advance velocity and thrust and torque distributions are calculated by bemt in every iteration step cl and cd are vital for the methods based on bemt and they are obtained according to two dimensional airfoils using empirical formulas or potential flow methods without considering viscous effects in oum the modified oum body force propulsion model follows oum with however an important difference regarding acquisition of cl and cd in modified oum cl and cd closer to the actual ones would be obtained directly from cfd which take the three dimensional viscous effect of propellers in account 2 1 2 1 discretized propeller model dpm the structured dynamic overset grid technique which can handle complex geometries and large amplitude motions is used to simulate the rotation of discretized propeller as shown in fig 5 the rotation of the propeller is defined in ship local frame also the propeller as a sub object will translate and rotate with hull the ship 6dof motion equations are solved in ship local frame and translation and rotation of hull with propeller are described in ship local frame the mass of propeller is much smaller than the mass of ship and the rotation acceleration is also small castro et al 2011 so the rotational acceleration of propeller is not included in the acceleration term of ship but is only used to calculate the hydrodynamic forces after calculating the hydrodynamic forces acting on propeller and hull the overall motion of hull and propeller can be solved to obtain the new position and attitude of ship from 6dof motion solver in addition the propeller rotating controller can obtain the angular position of propeller finally the propeller grid can be moved to the new position 2 1 2 2 the descriptive body force based on hough and ordway approach the body force model coupled with urans solver is to simplify the propeller into a thin cylinder for the descriptive body force method the blade surface load is substituted for the thrust and torque of the propeller area discretized with open water curve as input in calculation the idea of the force distributes along the propeller radius is first put forward by hough and ordway 1964 the relevant formula used in the process is as follows 19 f b x ρ u 2 l p p a x r 1 r 20 f b θ ρ u 2 l p p a θ r 1 r 1 y h r y h where 21 r r r h r p r h 22 y h r h r p 23 a x c t δ x 105 16 4 3 y h 1 y h 24 a θ k q j 2 δ x 105 π 4 3 y h 1 y h 25 c t 32 n 2 r p 2 k t π u 2 where f b x f b θ are the distribution of thrust and torque in the propeller virtual disk k t t ρ n 2 d p 4 is the thrust factor k q q ρ n 2 d p 5 is the torque coefficient n is propeller rotating speed r is the distance from any point in the propeller area to the propeller axis r p r h are the radius of a propeller and a hub respectively y h r h r p is hub diameter ratio d p 2 r p is propeller diameter l p p is length between perpendiculars of the vessel δ x δ x l p p is ratio of the thickness of the virtual disk to length between perpendiculars j v a n d p is propeller speed of advance factor where v a is propeller speed of advance but v a the tradition body force used is always the vessel speed the effective wake fraction is 0 so it is impossible to predict the correct self propulsion factor here k t and k q are usually based on experimental open water data and decribed to polynomials about j as input in calculation for propeller kp505 polynomials can be written as 26 k t 0 1611 j 3 0 3162 j 2 0 7004 j 0 5677 27 k q 0 0097 j 3 0 0151 j 2 0 0708 j 0 0745 2 1 2 3 osaka university method oum for body force method based on bemt the thrust and torque generated by the propeller are obtained by radial integration of the lift and drag of each blade section and the flow field around propeller will be solved by the rans the principle of this method is that there are innumerable lift lines with distributed forces rotating around the axis in the virtual disk area and the real propeller is taken the place of by the virtual disk which is added in the space occupied by the propeller as shown in fig 6 in the figure r p is the radius of the propeller d p 2r p is propeller diameter δ x is the thickness of the virtual disk the cylindrical region with a combined force t and a torque q behind the ship is formed by numerous lifting lines with distributed forces rotating along the axis shown as fig 7 the flow around the hull is calculated using the viscous flow theory and the calculation of the body force is based on lifting body and bemt the basic idea of this method is to use the local velocity field at the disk from the cfd calculation directly to calculate the blade thrust and torque the radius r p of the propeller blade is divided into 10 parts in the radial direction dr r p r h 10 where r h is the radius of the propeller hub 28 u r u 2 2 π n r u t 2 where u r is the propeller resultant speed u and u t are the axial and tangential local instantaneous velocity including the induced velocity of virtual disk from the cfd calculation respectively n is the rotation speed 29 β i a r c t a n u 2 π n r u t 30 d l 0 5 c l u r 2 c r d r 31 d d 0 5 c d u r 2 c r d r 32 d t d l cos β i d d sin β i 33 d q dl sin β i d d cos β i r 34 d p x d t n 2 π r d r 35 d p θ d q n 2 π r 2 d r 36 f b x d t δ x n 2 π r d r 37 f b θ d q δ x n 2 π r 2 d r 38 t 0 2 π r b r p f b x δ x r d r d θ q 0 2 π r b r f b θ δ x r 2 d r d θ where β i is hydrodynamic pitch angle c l is the lift coefficient and c d the drag coefficient on each airfoil profile δ x is the thickness of the virtual disk n is the number of blades in oum two dimensional bemt is used where c l and c d are obtained according to two dimensional airfoils using empirical formulas or potential flow methods without considering viscous effects the correction factor k 1 takes into account the effect of blade to blade interaction and so on yamazaki 1977 c d is assumed to be 0 01 r e is the radius of the representative blade section for a specific propeller k 1 and c d are constant just like a simple two dimensional airfoil 39 c l 2 π k 1 sin α α 0 40 k 1 1 07 1 05 c r e r p 0 375 c r e r p 2 41 c d 0 01 2 1 2 4 modified oum body force method the modified oum body force model follows oum with however an important modified regarding acquisition of c l and c d therefore the method of computing thrust and torque in modified oum is the same as that of oum except that the way of obtaining c l and c d is changed c l and c d closer to the actual ones would be obtained directly from urans cfd computation results and then they would be fitted into regression formulas about propeller parameters for different three dimensional airfoil on each section of the propeller the airfoil and space position will affect its performance and pitch will affect the angle of attack of the airfoil so radius chord length and pitch are selected as the influencing factors of c l and c d for three dimensional airfoils finally the formulas would be used in bemt instead of equations 39 41 to predict thrust and torque the method to get regression formulas of c l and c d consists of two steps discretizing blade and regression analysis 2 1 2 4 1 discretize the propeller blade at first propeller open water computation would be performed analyzing the relationship between c l c d and propeller blade section parameters is helpful to obtain the distribution of c l and c d on the propeller blade to facilitate the analysis of their relationship the blade is equally divided into ten parts as shown in fig 8 and the average c l c d on each blade section will be obtained thereby obtaining the distribution at different advance velocities of each section the sensitivity analysis on blade divisions has been discussed at j 0 8 the blade is divided into 5 10 and 20 parts along the radial direction respectively the distributions of c l and c d obtained by dividing into 10 and 20 parts are almost the same as shown in fig 9 so the 10 parts are considered to be credible 2 1 2 4 2 regression analysis multivariate regression method is used to investigate the relationship between c l c d and propeller parameters the blade shape and dimension spatial location would be major parameters to be considered for the investigations the regression formulas would be used in bemt to calculate thrust and torque for a propeller 2 1 2 4 2 1 effect of blade according to the wing theory the lift coefficient c l is related to the wing shape and their relationship can be described as 42 c l f p c α where p is the pitch c is the chord length and α is the angle of attack newman 1977 expressed the relationship between c l of the simple two dimensional airfoil and the angle of attack as 43 c l 2 π sin α c l 0 in which c l 0 is the lift coefficient at α 0 for a finite length airfoil with the same cross sectional shape the drag coefficient consists of the drag coefficient at zero lift c d 0 and induced drag coefficient 44 c d 1 π a r e c l 2 c d 0 where a r is the aspect ratio of the finite length airfoil and e is the efficiency factor lifting line theory shows that the optimum lowest induced drag occurs for an elliptic distribution of lift from tip to tip the efficiency factor is equal to 1 0 for an elliptic distribution and is some value less than 1 0 for any other lift distribution considering the influence of different three dimensional airfoil on each section of the propeller the coefficients in expressions 43 and 44 of c l and c d are considered to be no longer constant so their relationship is expressed as 45 c l k α s i n α c α 46 c d k 1 c l 2 k 2 therefore c l and c d is mainly determined by four coefficients k α c α k 1 k 2 in addition the relationship between the pitch and c l is reflected in the angle of attack α according to bet theory the angle of attack α is equal to pitch angle minus the hydrodynamic pitch angle 47 α arctan p 2 π r a r c t a n u 2 π n r u t so for the effect of the airfoil these four coefficients can be described as 48 k α c α k 1 k 2 f c 2 1 2 4 2 2 effect of spatial location the lift coefficient of each section for different radius of the propeller is closely related to the advance and the axial induced velocity compared with the circumferential and the radial the axial velocity has the greatest influence on the thrust characteristics and the lift coefficient of propellers in addition the advanced velocity at different radius is almost the same but the blade root is smaller a lot due to the influence of the hub the axial induced velocity increases with the increase of the relative radius r but at 0 8 r 1 0 r the axial induction velocity decreases rapidly due to the influence of the tip vortex so for the effect of the spatial location these four coefficients can be described as 49 k α c α k 1 k 2 f r finally they can be described as 50 k α c α k 1 k 2 f c r referring to the form of equations 39 and 40 these coefficients are described as 51 k α c α k 1 k 2 f c r 52 k α c α k 1 k 2 k 11 k 12 k 21 k 22 k 13 k 14 k 23 k 24 k 31 k 32 k 41 k 42 k 33 k 34 k 43 k 44 c r 3 c r 2 c r 1 53 k k 11 k 12 k 21 k 22 k 13 k 14 k 23 k 24 k 31 k 32 k 41 k 42 k 33 k 34 k 43 k 44 where c is the chord length r is the radius c r c r the relationship between c r and the i th coefficient can be fitted using a cubic polynomial and the coefficients of this cubic polynomial can be successively recorded as k i 1 k i 2 k i 3 k i 4 c l and c d distributions of kp505 each blade can be seen in fig 10 the coefficient matrix k can be obtained by processing the distribution of c l and c d using formats 45 46 and 52 for the 5 blades propeller with a blade section airfoil of naca66 the coefficient matrix is 54 k 1 152

small difference as shown in fig 11 it can be proved that the regression method is feasible and the regression formula is reliable 2 2 numerical model 2 2 1 geometries of ship and propeller the computational ship and propeller models are kcs and kp505 with scale ratio 1 31 6 whose open water resistance and self propulsion experiments data is available from tokyo 2015 the main parameters of kcs and kp505 model are presented in table 1 and table 2 the computational ship and propeller models are shown in fig 12 and fig 13 2 2 2 computational domain of propeller open water performances there are two different open water computational domains were created for each computation the discretized propeller model and the body force models the computational domain and the boundary conditions for the open water simulations is shown in fig 14 the grid generation had used structured dynamic overset grid technology the overset grid technique can handle complex surfaces in this study propeller kp505 would be decomposed into several simple components the blades and the hub their volume grids were generated from their own surface grids using hyperbolic solvers as shown in fig 15 finally all the grids are embedded into the numerical tank and become a whole by overset grid the interpolation relationship between each grid can be built automatically by the in house overset subroutine of which hole map is used for the hole cutting process and adt attribute distributed tree is utilized for the donor search process as shown in fig 16 for the body force methods the other grids are consistent with discretized propeller except for blades as shown in fig 17 2 2 3 computational domain of resistance and self propulsion to prevent ship waves from reflecting on the boundary and affecting the results computation domain needs to select a suitable size according to ittc recommendation ittc 2011 the inlet boundary has to be located 1 2 l p p away from hull while the outlet should be placed 3 5 l p p downstream in addition to determine the reasonable size computation domains in previous literatures similar to this study are summarized as shown in table 3 finally considering the computation experience of in house cfd code hust ship the computation domain is created as shown in fig 18 also two different computational domains were created for each simulation the discretized propeller model self propulsion simulation and the improved body force methods self propulsion simulations in addition the computational domain of resistance simulation is the same as improved body force methods application of the overset grid technique can decompose a complex model into several simple components then generate grid for each component separately and finally embed the grids of these components into the computational domain such as kcs with kp505 in this study its surface geometry is very complex so it is separated to blades hub tail and hull to create grid such as fig 19 and fig 20 the blades and hub grid distributions are the same as the open water simulation their volume grids were generated from their own surface grids using hyperbolic solvers finally blades hub tail hull grids and refinements are embedded in the numerical tank using overset grid technology the grid nodes inside the blades hub tail and hull grids are removed but several layers of oversetting nodes are remained these remaining nodes are prepared for interpolation as depicted in fig 21 for the body force methods and resistance computation the other grids are consistent with discretized propeller except for propeller 2 2 4 time step for urans for self propulsion cfd computation discretized propeller model and body force methods would be used in this study to obtain a suitable level of accuracy within a reasonable running time different time step resolutions are selected according to the related procedures and guidelines of ittc 2011 2014 1 for discretized propeller model to ensure spatial continuity the propeller rotates between 0 5 and 2 per time step and the higher number appropriate for implicit higher order numerical integration schemes the lower typical for explicit solvers 2 for body force methods where it is not necessary to consider space continuity of propeller model the time step δ t 0 005 0 01 l u of resistance computations in calm water is considered of course the time step sensitivity of body force method would also be discussed 3 cfl condition is supposed to be satisfied the courant number is typically calculated for each cell and should be less than or equal to 1 for numerical stability 55 c f l u δ t δ x where δ t is time step δ x is the grid cell dimension finally δ t 2 360 n and δ t 0 005 l u as reference time steps are used for discretized propeller model and body force methods computation where n is propeller rotating speed l and u are the ship perpendicular length and ship velocity 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation and verification validation and verification of numerical method for the discretized propeller model modified oum body force method and bare hull resistance computations will be carried out estimation the numerical modeling errors of cfd using asme v v verification and validation 2009 validation procedure requires experimental data and its uncertainties numerical computations and its uncertainties and input parameter uncertainties stern et al 2001 wilson et al 2001 xing and stern 2010 the overall cfd v v procedures can be conveniently grouped into four consecutive steps preparation verification validation and documentation 3 1 1 numerical uncertainty verification is defined as a process for assessing numerical uncertainty u s n in general the numerical uncertainty u s n consists of the iteration steps uncertainty u i the grid space uncertainty u g the time step uncertainty u t and other parameters uncertainty u p for urans solver hust ship u i and u p have been verified by lots of computation which could be ignored for the specific computation here u g and u t are the most concerned finally the estimated numerical uncertainty u s n are given by 56 u s n 2 u g 2 u t 2 in this paper results of v v of the propeller will be obtained by analyzing the propeller thrust and the kcs hull total resistance systematic grid spacing and time step study will be carried out using the richardson extrapolation method according to the literature xing and stern 2010 at first the uniform parameter refinement ratio r k between solutions is assumed 57 r k δ x 2 δ x 1 δ x 3 δ x 2 where δ x 1 δ x 2 and δ x 3 are the coarse medium and fine grid spacing or time step respectively and s 1 s 2 and s 3 are the results of coarse medium and fine grid spacing or time step respectively ε 21 s 2 s 1 and ε 32 s 3 s 2 are changes between medium fine and coarse medium solutions the convergence ratio r is defined as 58 r ε 32 ε 21 three convergence conditions are possible 1 monotonic convergence mc 0 r 1 2 oscillatory convergence oc r 0 3 divergence d 1 r when 0 r 1 monotonic convergence is achieved and richardson extrapolation method can be used the estimated order of accuracy p r e was calculated as 59 p r e ln ε 21 ε 32 l n r k the ratio of p r e to p t h is used here as the distance metric p 60 p p r e p t h where p t h is an estimate for the limiting order of accuracy as spacing size goes to zero generally p t h 2 naz 2014 the factor of safety method uncertainty is given as 61 u f s 2 45 0 85 p s f s m r p r e 1 0 p 1 16 4 p 14 8 s f s m r p r e 1 p 1 three grid cases were applied to the grid uncertainty study of the computation of kcs and kp505 for discretized propeller and modified oum body force method in the computation the growth rate and the number of grid layers in the direction of i j k are changed for the grid spacing uncertainty study three different grids were generated with the grid refinement ratio 2 corresponding to coarse medium and fine the other grids for the body force methods are consistent with discretized propeller except for blades the grid sensitivity study is based on the medium time step the results simulated by the coarse medium and fine grids are listed in table 4 and table 5 three time steps cases were applied to the time step uncertainty study of the computation of kcs and kp505 for discretized propeller and modified oum body force method the time step sensitivity study was based on the medium grid and the results simulated for three time steps were shown in table 6 and table 7 as can be seen from fig 22 the slower the convergence rate is the worse the convergence of the calculation results is with the increase of time step for both grid spacing and time step the convergence factor r was between 0 and 1 which meant that monotonic convergence is achieved and richardson extrapolation method can be used from table 8 it can be observed that the uncertainties of grid and time step for discretized propeller were 1 64 d and 0 05 d where d is the experimental data the uncertainties of grid and time step for modified oum method were 2 73 d and 0 41 d as shown in table 10 in addition the uncertainties of grid and time step for towed kcs resistance were 8 73 d and 0 39 d 3 2 2 validation based on efd data validation is defined as a process for assessing computation modeling uncertainty u s m by using benchmark experimental data the comparison error e is defined as 62 e d s where d is the experimental data and s is the result from numerical computation to determine if validation has been achieved e is compared to the validation uncertainty u v given by 63 u v 2 u d 2 u s n 2 the results of validation study are shown in table 9 it is necessary for the validation uncertainty to know the uncertainty of the experimental data u d u d is provided for towed kcs resistance nabila 2014 but it isn t given for propeller thrust in any literature therefore u d for propeller is assumed as 1 00 d the result of validation study shows that all the comparison errors e are lower than the validation uncertainty u v which indicates that the computation results are validated under the u v level 3 2 kcs resistance computation the wake flow at the propeller plane is very important to describe the wake flow in detail a circular probe as shown in fig 23 is used the circle was divided into 120 parts with an interval of 3 and the 10 ratios for r r from the hub radius to propeller radius are 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 1 0 and 1 1 respectively where r denotes radial distance from shaft center r is radius of propeller r h is the hub radius wake factor 64 w n 1 v a u the simulated axial velocity distributions of kcs propeller plane 0 9825 x l p p is shown in fig 24 and compared with efd in fig 25 the wake flow is in good agreement with experiment 1 w n is calculated to be 0 731 the results of kcs resistance computation at f r 0 26 can be seen in table 10 also efd data tokyo 2015 and the computational results are listed it can be found that resistance and 2dof motion computations results matched well with test data fig 26 shows the wave patterns around the kcs model fig 27 and fig 28 shows free surface cuts of cfd and efd for kcs at three different lateral sections y l p p 0 0741 0 1509 and 0 4224 and at the hull surface the comparisons of wave computational results also show good agreement with efd the v v results had shown that the present computational approach is good for following research 3 3 open water computation of different propulsion models the open water computation conditions are set according to model tests the incoming flow velocity and rotating speed are set to 3 5 j m s and 14 r s respectively where j is the advance velocity fig 29 shows the differences of k t and k q between the computation results using different models and the experiment the maximum differences for dpm are 3 8 and 2 3 for the thrust coefficient and the torque coefficient respectively while these for modified oum are 4 32 and 3 5 in addition there is no difference between descriptive body force computation and efd since descriptive body force method used the propeller open water curve as the input so it isn t necessary to compare this one with others for open water characteristics in fig 30 the thrusts of different propulsion models are compared at j 0 8 it can be found that differences of the final stable results are very small for modified oum but results of oum are significantly different from efd the main reason for the difference of oum with other models is that the distribution of c l and c d obtained from the potential flow or empirical values is different from the modified oum and dpm wire probes at d 2d and 3d behind the propeller plane are used to compare the velocity fields of different propulsion models fig 31 shows velocity distributions of different propulsion models at wire probes comparing the velocity distributions of different propulsion models in fig 31 it can be found that the velocity field using modified oum is more similar to that of the dpm than other two body force models the difference between the velocity distribution of different propulsion models is defined as residual the integral value r of absolute value of residual can be used to evaluate different methods integral value r of absolute value of residual at wire probes is calculated in table 11 and it is obvious that modified oum body force method is more accurate than other body force methods 65 r e s i d u a l u p r o p e l l e r u b o d y f o r c e 66 r r p l p p r p l p p r e s i d u a l d r for numerical prediction computation time is also important for dpm simulation the propeller rotation angle should be less than 2 in each time step so the time step is at least equal to 0 0004 s the time step of body force methods can be the same as the ship resistance computation which could be 60 times bigger than dpm because if the time step is too large the propeller will rotate a large angle in a time step when using discretized propeller resulting in discontinuities in space and unreliable results however there is no spatial discontinuity in using body force methods so the time step can be set very large the time step sensitivity of body force methods had been discussed and δ t 0 005 l u was finally used meanwhile the grid number of the modified oum is about 2 3 of the discretized propeller it takes about 9 min to calculate the result of an advance coefficient on the open water hydrodynamic analysis by the modified oum while the discretized propeller takes 16 h 3 4 free running self propulsion computations of kcs with different propulsion models the self propulsion computation conditions are set according to model tests the computational model of body force methods is kcs only with hub while that of the discretized propeller is kcs with kp505 to ensure that the results of the two methods are not affected by the grid distribution the grids of the other parts are identical except for the grid of the propeller in two methods the blades and hub grid distributions are the same as the open water computation while tail hull refinements and numerical tank grid distributions is consistent with resistance computation in addition the grid and time step uncertainty studies of resistance and open water computation have been conducted pi control method is used to match the propeller rotating speed where the target velocity is 2 2 m s with s f c 30 3 n from the test the results of self propulsion computations of kcs with different propulsion models will be compared with experiment ship speed and propeller rotational speed have been given in fig 32 thrust of propeller and value of resistance minus sfc of body force methods stabilize faster as shown in fig 33 results of kcs self propulsion computations with different propulsion models are given in table 12 for the descriptive body force the vessel velocity or modified vessel velocity using nominal wake fraction in calm water is usually used as the advance velocity in this method the body force source term would be computed once and then input into rans solver so the interaction of the propeller and hull isn t under consideration the wake fraction is 0 so it is difficult to obtain correct self propulsion parameters in oum and modified oum body force method the local instantaneous velocity is used as advance velocity in every iteration step so that the virtual propeller and rans codes can interact with each other towards a solution and the bidirectional coupling between the local flow field and the virtual propeller can be taken into account in addition c l and c d closer to the actual ones would be obtained directly from cfd in modified oum body force method thus self propulsion parameters can be predicted more accurately by modified oum body force method thrust deduction factor 67 t t r t s f c t wake factor 68 w 1 j n d p u 0 where t and r t are thrust of propeller and resistance of ship respectively j is the advanced velocity coefficient and it is generally obtained by interpolation using the thrust identity method ittc 2014 n is rotating speed of propeller d p is diameter of propeller and u 0 is the ship velocity comparison of free surface cuts for kcs at the hull and at y lpp 0 1509 are shown in fig 34 and these show good agreement between cfd and efd free surfaces of different propulsion methods are very similar but become different around the stern tokyo 2015 provided velocity downstream of propeller plane at x l p p 0 9911 z l p p 0 03 0 03 y l p p 0 03 velocity distributions of three directions u v w are compared in fig 35 it can be found that in addition to the descriptive body force the axial velocity distributions predicted by other propulsion models agree well with experiment the body force methods tend to under predict the horizontal and vertical velocity components v w and dpm can better simulate the speed distribution in all directions fig 36 shows it depicts the vortex structure of the wake flow measured by the second invariant for the iso surface q 300 and colored by relative helicity bekhit 2018 dpm is shown to be able to capture the detailed propeller flow features 3 5 computational efficiency different propulsion models the self propulsion computations are carried on the ubuntu 16 04 lts 64 bit operating system desktop server with 2 9 ghz intel r xeon scalable platinum 8268 2cpu 48 and 512g install memory ram the discretized propeller model computation took 158 wall clock hours with δ t 0 0006 s when body force models took about 3 3 wall clock hours with δ t 0 0165 s by comparing thrust velocity of propeller plane free surface cuts and self propulsion parameters of efd and different propulsion models results show that the modified oum body force method considering three dimensional viscous and wake flow effects can accurately and quickly predict ship self propulsion the modified oum body force method supports the establishment of spare propeller banks with different airfoils which is helpful for propeller design and propeller hull rudder interference research in the ship design stage therefore it is observed that for computations focused on the ship free running study the modified oum method is a valid option to model the hydrodynamics considering the accuracy and saving computational time 4 conclusions compared with oum and other body force method modified

performance is one of the main factors considered when assessing ship hydrodynamic performance at ship design stage ittc 2014 has been proposed the procedures and methods to predict self propulsion performance the self propulsion indices can be obtained by model tests or numerical computations scale model testing is a universally applicable approach to investigate ship self propulsion performance in gothenburg 2010 and tokyo 2015 a collection of ship models such as kvlcc2 kcs dtmb 5415 jbc and onrt were selected to carry out self propulsion tests by different research institutes and all test data is available the experimental measurements provide data for both exploration of flow physics and for cfd validation cfd is an alternative and more cost effective method of studying propeller hull interaction compared with model tests cfd computation of ship self propulsion not only reduces lots of time and cost but could provide more information of ship flow ship wave and other details related to the ship hydrodynamic performance there are two self propulsion numerical simulation methods proposed by ittc 2014 interpolation method and use of a controller kim et al 2006 used interpolation method to obtain the self propulsion point by trial and error using successive iterations until the force imbalance satisfied the order of 10 6 carrica et al 2010 proposed a method using pi speed controller and discretized propellers that could be used to predicted self propulsion performance for surface ships including kcs kvlcc and dtmb 5613 the use of speed controller made the self propulsion point available in a single run thus resulting in a reduced cpu time ship self propulsion free running computation usually used discretized propeller as propulsion model shen et al 2015 performed kcs self propulsion and maneuvering computations with direct discretization of the propeller using dynamic overset grids in openfoam grid convergence studies were performed to further validate the implementation of the overset grid method song et al 2020 predicted the effect of biofouling on ship self propulsion characteristics of the full scale kcs using cfd the barnacles on the hull rudder and propeller surfaces were represented using a roughness function model in wall function finally the effect of biofouling on the ship self propulsion parameters and propulsive efficiencies as well as flow characteristics around the hull are concluded guo et al 2020 conducted numerical simulations and analysis on the self propulsion performance of a waterjet propelled trimaran mrf was used to simulate directly the waterjet comparing the numerical results of bare hull and self propulsion with efd data proved the validity of the numerical method the body force method makes self propulsion computation more easily and quickly when the detailed propeller flow is not essential for some studies like interaction of propeller hull rudder system bakica et al 2019 simulated self propulsion with an actuator disk using cfd with vof and gfm method it can be found that body force method has high cpu efficiency without external algorithm coupling both bekhit 2018 and yuting 2019 had used discretized propeller and body force method to carry out self propulsion and dynamic manoeuver simulations the body force method could be proven to be a valid option to research propeller hull rudder interference considering the accuracy and rapid computational time usually the body force approaches can be classified into descriptive and iterative body force according to the methods of coupling with the rans solver in descriptive body force method the body force source term would be computed once and then input into rans solver so that the interaction between the propeller and hull would be ignored such as the model based on the simple hough and ordway approach hough and ordway 1964 the model is based on the experiment open water curve and discretizes the thrust and torque of the propeller using a specified distribution where the vessel speed or modified vessel speed is always taken as propeller advance speed in iterative body force method the virtual propeller and rans codes interact with each other towards a solution these methods generally originate from some potential flow methods such as lift line theory and blade element theory bet villa et al 2018 2019 have calculated the hull wake field in rans solver and propeller performance in boundary element method bem code separately and their results are iterated and updated each other until the convergence is reached the explicit iteration methods are used in their study tokgoz 2015 developed viscous flow method osaka university method oum coupled with rans which uses the lifting body theory and a simplified quasi steady two dimensional bemt blade element momentum theory with the infinite bladed propeller model in the approach the local instantaneous velocity within rans code is used as advance velocity and thrust and torque distributions are calculated by bemt in every iteration step the effective propeller inflow is implicitly accounted for in the hydrodynamic coefficients derived by cfd this method uses the direct coupling of bemt and rans rather than iterating their results this fact further reduces the computational time in comparison to traditional blade element model because the iteration loop to solve for the induction is avoided c l and c d are vital for the methods based on bemt however c l and c d are obtained according to two dimensional airfoils using empirical formulas or potential flow methods without considering viscous effects for this problem li et al 2019 had obtained directly c l and c d closer to the actual ones from open water cfd simulation combining the method of computing force and torque in oum and the method of obtaining c l and c d proposed by li et al 2019 modified oum considering the three dimensional viscous effect of the propeller is developed in this paper in this paper four propulsion models are adopted to simulate the ship self propulsion using pi speed controller including discretized propeller model and three body force methods three body force models are a model based on the simple hough and ordway approach hough and ordway 1964 oum based on the simplified quasi steady two dimensional bemt blade element momentum theory tokgoz 2015 and modified oum based on bemt considering the three dimensional viscous effects for a propeller considering the three dimensional effect the airfoil and space position will affect its performance and pitch will affect the angle of attack of the airfoil so c l and c d would be fitted into functions about radius chord length and pitch for three dimensional airfoils the key objective of this study is to compare the computation time and accuracy of different methods and verify the feasibility and reliability of modified oum for ship propulsion simulation ship model kcs with propeller kp505 was used for this study the computations are set according to experiment conditions provided by gothenburg 2010 the thrust velocity of propeller plane free surface cuts self propulsion parameters and computation time of different propulsion models are compared each other all computations are carried out using hust ship rans solver in this paper urans equations are discretized by finite difference method and solved by piso algorithm computations have been made using structured grid with overset technology 2 theoretical background 2

propulsion performance tao et al 2016 wang et al 2016 2020 wei et al 2018 guo et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 in the prediction of kcs self propulsion with 2dof heave and pitch hust ship solves rans equation coupled with two degrees of freedom 2dof solid body motion equations rans equations are discretized by finite difference method and solved by piso algorithm computations have been made using structured dynamic overset grid single phase level set approach is used for free surface simulation 2 1 1 1 governing equations all the computations are carried out by hust ship rans solver in this paper it solves unsteady incompressible rans equations 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j p ˆ x i 1 r e 2 u i x j 2 x j u i u j f b i in which x i x y z is the direction of the independent coordinates and u i u v w is the component of reynolds average speed p ˆ p p ρ u 0 2 z f r 2 is the dynamic pressure coefficient and u i u j is reynolds stress tensor f b i is dimensionless improved body force source term factor f b i f b i l p p ρ u 0 2 in which f b i f b x f b y f b z is the force per unit volume of the propeller in x y and z directions they are added in momentum equation to replace the thrust and torque of the propeller ν is the kinematic viscosity and re u 0 l p p ν is reynolds number the reynolds stresses are related to the mean rate of strain through an isotropic eddy viscosity v t where δ i j the kronecker delta and k is the turbulent kinetic energy 3 u i u j v t u i x j u j x i 2 3 δ i j k then to calculate v t two equation eddy viscosity sst k ω turbulence models which was exploited and proposed by menter 1994 had been used in this study sst k ω equations are written as follows 4 v t k ω 5 k t u j σ k v t x j k x j 1 r k 2 k s k 0 6 ω t u j σ ω v t x j ω x j 1 r ω 2 ω s ω 0 where k is the turbulent kinetic energy and ω is the rate of dissipation of the turbulent energy 2 1 1 2 coordinate systems and ship motion equations ship motions are described on the basis of two right handed cartesian coordinate systems as shown in fig 2 according to momentum rigid body dynamics and momentum moment theorem ship motion equations of 6dof guo et al 2018 can be written as 7 m u v r w q x 8 m v w p u r y 9 m w u q v p z 10 i x p i z i y q r k 11 i y q i x i z r p m 12 i z r i y i x p q n in which i x i y and i z are the components of moment of inertia with respect to gravity center x y z and k m n are the components of external forces and moments acting on hull respectively the ship position is described in an earth fixed coordinate system with x pointing south y pointing east and z pointing upward the origin of the ship local coordinate system is set at the intersection of design waterline and bow the velocities for 6dof motions u v w p q r are reported in a ship local coordinate system with x axis positive toward stern y axis positive toward starboard and z axis positive upward the motions of the ship are reported at the center of gravity 2 1 1 3 free surface handling the single phase level set method is used to capture the free surface where the influence of air density and viscosity is ignored the water surface is regarded as the free interface ϕ is the distance from any point in flow field to free surface so the free surface is the iso surface with ϕ 0 the level set function burg 2005 is 13 ϕ t v ϕ 0 where v is the velocity vector in flow field in addition ϕ is zero at free surface positive in water and negative in air 14 ϕ 0 i n w a t e r 0 a t f r e e s u r f a c e 0 i n a i r the flow of water would be solved in the area of ϕ 0 and the position of free surface would be obtained by interpolation the boundary condition for the velocity at the interface n j is the normal vector 15 v n j 0 16 n j ϕ ϕ 2 1 1 4 overset grid technology the overall flow field domain is divided into a system of grids which overset one another by one or more grid cells rogers et al 2003 the ultimate goal of the overset method is to establish the relationship among grids of all regions and transfer the flow field information of boundary for computation of each region as shown in fig 1 the points of mesh 1 that fall into the solid surface of mesh 2 are marked as hole points which wouldn t participate in the calculation of flow field the points adjacent to hole points in grid 1 are hole boundary points these points accept the flow field information transmitted from mesh 2 through interpolation correspondingly the outer boundary points of mesh 2 would also receive the flow field information transmitted from mesh 1 through interpolation which is obtained by trilinear interpolation method the area between the hole boundary point of mesh 1 and the interpolation point of mesh 2 outer boundary is the overset area usually three steps are required for overset approach chan 2009 hole cutting the interpolation points identification and the donor cells identification the purpose of hole cutting is to remove the unnecessary or meaningless meshes such as the inside of a solid body before flow field computation the cutting face will be set in the area that needs to be removed and then the grid points that fall into cutting face will be identified and discarded in the cfd computation process hole mapping method is used for the hole cutting process the interpolation point identification is to identify two types of interpolation points as illustrated in fig 1 hole fringe points and outer boundary points the hole fringe points as any point near a hole point are easily identified the outer boundary point is any point that lies on the boundary of a computational mesh the donor cells identification is to identify the hexahedral donor cells with the interpolation points as the vertex the simplest and most reliable way to find donor cells is to traverse the entire mesh domains until the correct cells are found however the efficiency of this method is the lowest and the use of excellent data structure can improve the seeking speed adt attribute distributed tree is utilized for the donor search process 2 1 1 5 pi speed controller in self propulsion computation pi proportional integral speed controller carrica et al 2010 in the form of equation 13 is used is applied to match propeller rotating speed at target speed 17 n p e i 0 t e d t where n is propeller rotating speed e u t a r g e t u s h i p is the difference between instantaneous ship speed u s h i p and target speed u t a r g e t p and i are the proportional and integral constants the empirical formula for estimating p and i can be obtained by testing 18 p i n δ t 500 where δ t is time step theoretically any p and i value can finally control to reach the target speed but the value estimated by the empirical formula is more reasonable and the control process would be completed faster 2 1 2 propulsion model self propulsion computations would be carried out at model scale propulsion point using discretized propeller model and three body force methods as shown in fig 3 pi control method is used to match the propeller rotating speed where the target velocity is 2 2 m s in fig 4 three body force models are here considered a model based on the simple hough and ordway approach hough and ordway 1964 a model based on the simplified quasi steady two dimensional bemt blade element momentum theory tokgoz 2015 and a model based on bemt considering the three dimensional viscous effects the body force methods can usually be classified into descriptive and iterative body force based on the methods of obtaining the body force source term the model based on the simple hough and ordway approach is a descriptive body force the method discretizes the thrust and torque of the propeller according to the propeller open water curve using a specified distribution which is first put forward by hough and ordway the models based on bemt are iterative body force methods tokgoz 2015 developed viscous flow method osaka university method oum coupled with rans which uses the lifting body theory and a simplified quasi steady two dimensional bemt with the infinite bladed propeller model in the approach the local instantaneous velocity within rans code is used as advance velocity and thrust and torque distributions are calculated by bemt in every iteration step cl and cd are vital for the methods based on bemt and they are obtained according to two dimensional airfoils using empirical formulas or potential flow methods without considering viscous effects in oum the modified oum body force propulsion model follows oum with however an important difference regarding acquisition of cl and cd in modified oum cl and cd closer to the actual ones would be obtained directly from cfd which take the three dimensional viscous effect of propellers in account 2 1 2 1 discretized propeller model dpm the structured dynamic overset grid technique which can handle complex geometries and large amplitude motions is used to simulate the rotation of discretized propeller as shown in fig 5 the rotation of the propeller is defined in ship local frame also the propeller as a sub object will translate and rotate with hull the ship 6dof motion equations are solved in ship local frame and translation and rotation of hull with propeller are described in ship local frame the mass of propeller is much smaller than the mass of ship and the rotation acceleration is also small castro et al 2011 so the rotational acceleration of propeller is not included in the acceleration term of ship but is only used to calculate the hydrodynamic forces after calculating the hydrodynamic forces acting on propeller and hull the overall motion of hull and propeller can be solved to obtain the new position and attitude of ship from 6dof motion solver in addition the propeller rotating controller can obtain the angular position of propeller finally the propeller grid can be moved to the new position 2 1 2 2 the descriptive body force based on hough and ordway approach the body force model coupled with urans solver is to simplify the propeller into a thin cylinder for the descriptive body force method the blade surface load is substituted for the thrust and torque of the propeller area discretized with open water curve as input in calculation the idea of the force distributes along the propeller radius is first put forward by hough and ordway 1964 the relevant formula used in the process is as follows 19 f b x ρ u 2 l p p a x r 1 r 20 f b θ ρ u 2 l p p a θ r 1 r 1 y h r y h where 21 r r r h r p r h 22 y h r h r p 23 a x c t δ x 105 16 4 3 y h 1 y h 24 a θ k q j 2 δ x 105 π 4 3 y h 1 y h 25 c t 32 n 2 r p 2 k t π u 2 where f b x f b θ are the distribution of thrust and torque in the propeller virtual disk k t t ρ n 2 d p 4 is the thrust factor k q q ρ n 2 d p 5 is the torque coefficient n is propeller rotating speed r is the distance from any point in the propeller area to the propeller axis r p r h are the radius of a propeller and a hub respectively y h r h r p is hub diameter ratio d p 2 r p is propeller diameter l p p is length between perpendiculars of the vessel δ x δ x l p p is ratio of the thickness of the virtual disk to length between perpendiculars j v a n d p is propeller speed of advance factor where v a is propeller speed of advance but v a the tradition body force used is always the vessel speed the effective wake fraction is 0 so it is impossible to predict the correct self propulsion factor here k t and k q are usually based on experimental open water data and decribed to polynomials about j as input in calculation for propeller kp505 polynomials can be written as 26 k t 0 1611 j 3 0 3162 j 2 0 7004 j 0 5677 27 k q 0 0097 j 3 0 0151 j 2 0 0708 j 0 0745 2 1 2 3 osaka university method oum for body force method based on bemt the thrust and torque generated by the propeller are obtained by radial integration of the lift and drag of each blade section and the flow field around propeller will be solved by the rans the principle of this method is that there are innumerable lift lines with distributed forces rotating around the axis in the virtual disk area and the real propeller is taken the place of by the virtual disk which is added in the space occupied by the propeller as shown in fig 6 in the figure r p is the radius of the propeller d p 2r p is propeller diameter δ x is the thickness of the virtual disk the cylindrical region with a combined force t and a torque q behind the ship is formed by numerous lifting lines with distributed forces rotating along the axis shown as fig 7 the flow around the hull is calculated using the viscous flow theory and the calculation of the body force is based on lifting body and bemt the basic idea of this method is to use the local velocity field at the disk from the cfd calculation directly to calculate the blade thrust and torque the radius r p of the propeller blade is divided into 10 parts in the radial direction dr r p r h 10 where r h is the radius of the propeller hub 28 u r u 2 2 π n r u t 2 where u r is the propeller resultant speed u and u t are the axial and tangential local instantaneous velocity including the induced velocity of virtual disk from the cfd calculation respectively n is the rotation speed 29 β i a r c t a n u 2 π n r u t 30 d l 0 5 c l u r 2 c r d r 31 d d 0 5 c d u r 2 c r d r 32 d t d l cos β i d d sin β i 33 d q dl sin β i d d cos β i r 34 d p x d t n 2 π r d r 35 d p θ d q n 2 π r 2 d r 36 f b x d t δ x n 2 π r d r 37 f b θ d q δ x n 2 π r 2 d r 38 t 0 2 π r b r p f b x δ x r d r d θ q 0 2 π r b r f b θ δ x r 2 d r d θ where β i is hydrodynamic pitch angle c l is the lift coefficient and c d the drag coefficient on each airfoil profile δ x is the thickness of the virtual disk n is the number of blades in oum two dimensional bemt is used where c l and c d are obtained according to two dimensional airfoils using empirical formulas or potential flow methods without considering viscous effects the correction factor k 1 takes into account the effect of blade to blade interaction and so on yamazaki 1977 c d is assumed to be 0 01 r e is the radius of the representative blade section for a specific propeller k 1 and c d are constant just like a simple two dimensional airfoil 39 c l 2 π k 1 sin α α 0 40 k 1 1 07 1 05 c r e r p 0 375 c r e r p 2 41 c d 0 01 2 1 2 4 modified oum body force method the modified oum body force model follows oum with however an important modified regarding acquisition of c l and c d therefore the method of computing thrust and torque in modified oum is the same as that of oum except that the way of obtaining c l and c d is changed c l and c d closer to the actual ones would be obtained directly from urans cfd computation results and then they would be fitted into regression formulas about propeller parameters for different three dimensional airfoil on each section of the propeller the airfoil and space position will affect its performance and pitch will affect the angle of attack of the airfoil so radius chord length and pitch are selected as the influencing factors of c l and c d for three dimensional airfoils finally the formulas would be used in bemt instead of equations 39 41 to predict thrust and torque the method to get regression formulas of c l and c d consists of two steps discretizing blade and regression analysis 2 1 2 4 1 discretize the propeller blade at first propeller open water computation would be performed analyzing the relationship between c l c d and propeller blade section parameters is helpful to obtain the distribution of c l and c d on the propeller blade to facilitate the analysis of their relationship the blade is equally divided into ten parts as shown in fig 8 and the average c l c d on each blade section will be obtained thereby obtaining the distribution at different advance velocities of each section the sensitivity analysis on blade divisions has been discussed at j 0 8 the blade is divided into 5 10 and 20 parts along the radial direction respectively the distributions of c l and c d obtained by dividing into 10 and 20 parts are almost the same as shown in fig 9 so the 10 parts are considered to be credible 2 1 2 4 2 regression analysis multivariate regression method is used to investigate the relationship between c l c d and propeller parameters the blade shape and dimension spatial location would be major parameters to be considered for the investigations the regression formulas would be used in bemt to calculate thrust and torque for a propeller 2 1 2 4 2 1 effect of blade according to the wing theory the lift coefficient c l is related to the wing shape and their relationship can be described as 42 c l f p c α where p is the pitch c is the chord length and α is the angle of attack newman 1977 expressed the relationship between c l of the simple two dimensional airfoil and the angle of attack as 43 c l 2 π sin α c l 0 in which c l 0 is the lift coefficient at α 0 for a finite length airfoil with the same cross sectional shape the drag coefficient consists of the drag coefficient at zero lift c d 0 and induced drag coefficient 44 c d 1 π a r e c l 2 c d 0 where a r is the aspect ratio of the finite length airfoil and e is the efficiency factor lifting line theory shows that the optimum lowest induced drag occurs for an elliptic distribution of lift from tip to tip the efficiency factor is equal to 1 0 for an elliptic distribution and is some value less than 1 0 for any other lift distribution considering the influence of different three dimensional airfoil on each section of the propeller the coefficients in expressions 43 and 44 of c l and c d are considered to be no longer constant so their relationship is expressed as 45 c l k α s i n α c α 46 c d k 1 c l 2 k 2 therefore c l and c d is mainly determined by four coefficients k α c α k 1 k 2 in addition the relationship between the pitch and c l is reflected in the angle of attack α according to bet theory the angle of attack α is equal to pitch angle minus the hydrodynamic pitch angle 47 α arctan p 2 π r a r c t a n u 2 π n r u t so for the effect of the airfoil these four coefficients can be described as 48 k α c α k 1 k 2 f c 2 1 2 4 2 2 effect of spatial location the lift coefficient of each section for different radius of the propeller is closely related to the advance and the axial induced velocity compared with the circumferential and the radial the axial velocity has the greatest influence on the thrust characteristics and the lift coefficient of propellers in addition the advanced velocity at different radius is almost the same but the blade root is smaller a lot due to the influence of the hub the axial induced velocity increases with the increase of the relative radius r but at 0 8 r 1 0 r the axial induction velocity decreases rapidly due to the influence of the tip vortex so for the effect of the spatial location these four coefficients can be described as 49 k α c α k 1 k 2 f r finally they can be described as 50 k α c α k 1 k 2 f c r referring to the form of equations 39 and 40 these coefficients are described as 51 k α c α k 1 k 2 f c r 52 k α c α k 1 k 2 k 11 k 12 k 21 k 22 k 13 k 14 k 23 k 24 k 31 k 32 k 41 k 42 k 33 k 34 k 43 k 44 c r 3 c r 2 c r 1 53 k k 11 k 12 k 21 k 22 k 13 k 14 k 23 k 24 k 31 k 32 k 41 k 42 k 33 k 34 k 43 k 44 where c is the chord length r is the radius c r c r the relationship between c r and the i th coefficient can be fitted using a cubic polynomial and the coefficients of this cubic polynomial can be successively recorded as k i 1 k i 2 k i 3 k i 4 c l and c d distributions of kp505 each blade can be seen in fig 10 the coefficient matrix k can be obtained by processing the distribution of c l and c d using formats 45 46 and 52 for the 5 blades propeller with a blade section airfoil of naca66 the coefficient matrix is 54 k 1 152

small difference as shown in fig 11 it can be proved that the regression method is feasible and the regression formula is reliable 2 2 numerical model 2 2 1 geometries of ship and propeller the

kcs and kp505 model are presented in table 1 and table 2 the computational ship and propeller models are shown in fig 12 and fig 13 2 2 2 computational domain of propeller open water performances there are two different open water computational domains were created for each computation the discretized propeller model and the body force models the computational domain and the boundary conditions for the open water simulations is shown in fig 14 the grid generation had used structured dynamic overset grid technology the overset grid technique can handle complex surfaces in this study propeller kp505 would be decomposed into several simple components the blades and the hub their volume grids were generated from their own surface grids using hyperbolic solvers as shown in fig 15 finally all the grids are embedded into the numerical tank and become a whole by overset grid the interpolation relationship between each grid can be built automatically by the in house overset subroutine of which hole map is used for the hole cutting process and adt attribute distributed tree is utilized for the donor search process as shown in fig 16 for the body force methods the other grids are consistent with discretized propeller except for blades as shown in fig 17 2 2 3 computational domain of resistance and self propulsion to prevent ship waves from reflecting on the boundary and affecting the results computation domain needs to select a suitable size according to ittc recommendation ittc 2011 the inlet boundary has to be located 1 2 l p p away from hull while the outlet should be placed 3 5 l p p downstream in addition to determine the reasonable size computation domains in previous literatures similar to this study are summarized as shown in table 3 finally considering the computation experience of in house cfd code hust ship the computation domain is created as shown in fig 18 also two different computational domains were created for each simulation the discretized propeller model self propulsion simulation and the improved body force methods self propulsion simulations in addition the computational domain of resistance simulation is the same as improved body force methods application of the overset grid technique can decompose a complex model into several simple components then generate grid for each component separately and finally embed the grids of these components into the computational domain such as kcs with kp505 in this study its surface geometry is very complex so it is separated to blades hub tail and hull to create grid such as fig 19 and fig 20 the blades and hub grid distributions are the same as the open water simulation their volume grids were generated from their own surface grids using hyperbolic solvers finally blades hub tail hull grids and refinements are embedded in the numerical tank using overset grid technology the grid nodes inside the blades hub tail and hull grids are removed but several layers of oversetting nodes are remained these remaining nodes are prepared for interpolation as depicted in fig 21 for the body force methods and resistance computation the other grids are consistent with discretized propeller except for propeller 2 2 4 time step for urans for self propulsion cfd computation discretized propeller model and body force methods would be used in this study to obtain a suitable level of accuracy within a reasonable running time different time step resolutions are selected according to the related procedures and guidelines of ittc 2011 2014 1 for discretized propeller model to ensure spatial continuity the propeller rotates between 0 5 and 2 per time step and the higher number appropriate for implicit higher order numerical integration schemes the lower typical for explicit solvers 2 for body force methods where it is not necessary to consider space continuity of propeller model the time step δ t 0 005 0 01 l u of resistance computations in calm water is considered of course the time step sensitivity of body force method would also be discussed 3 cfl condition is supposed to be satisfied the courant number is typically calculated for each cell and should be less than or equal to 1 for numerical stability 55 c f l u δ t δ x where δ t is time step δ x is the grid cell dimension finally δ t 2 360 n and δ t 0 005 l u as reference time steps are used for discretized propeller model and body force methods computation where n is propeller rotating speed l and u are the ship perpendicular length and ship velocity 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation and verification validation and verification of numerical method for the discretized propeller model modified oum body force method and bare hull resistance computations will be carried out estimation the numerical modeling errors of cfd using asme v v verification and validation 2009 validation procedure requires experimental data and its uncertainties numerical computations and its uncertainties and input parameter uncertainties stern et al 2001 wilson et al 2001 xing and stern 2010 the overall cfd v v procedures can be conveniently grouped into four consecutive steps preparation verification validation and documentation 3 1 1 numerical uncertainty verification is defined as a process for assessing numerical uncertainty u s n in general the numerical uncertainty u s n consists of the iteration steps uncertainty u i the grid space uncertainty u g the time step uncertainty u t and other parameters uncertainty u p for urans solver hust ship u i and u p have been verified by lots of computation which could be ignored for the specific computation here u g and u t are the most concerned finally the estimated numerical uncertainty u s n are given by 56 u s n 2 u g 2 u t 2 in this paper results of v v of the propeller will be obtained by analyzing the propeller thrust and the kcs hull total resistance systematic grid spacing and time step study will be carried out using the richardson extrapolation method according to the literature xing and stern 2010 at first the uniform parameter refinement ratio r k between solutions is assumed 57 r k δ x 2 δ x 1 δ x 3 δ x 2 where δ x 1 δ x 2 and δ x 3 are the coarse medium and fine grid spacing or time step respectively and s 1 s 2 and s 3 are the results of coarse medium and fine grid spacing or time step respectively ε 21 s 2 s 1 and ε 32 s 3 s 2 are changes between medium fine and coarse medium solutions the convergence ratio r is defined as 58 r ε 32 ε 21 three convergence conditions are possible 1 monotonic convergence mc 0 r 1 2 oscillatory convergence oc r 0 3 divergence d 1 r when 0 r 1 monotonic convergence is achieved and richardson extrapolation method can be used the estimated order of accuracy p r e was calculated as 59 p r e ln ε 21 ε 32 l n r k the ratio of p r e to p t h is used here as the distance metric p 60 p p r e p t h where p t h is an estimate for the limiting order of accuracy as spacing size goes to zero generally p t h 2 naz 2014 the factor of safety method uncertainty is given as 61 u f s 2 45 0 85 p s f s m r p r e 1 0 p 1 16 4 p 14 8 s f s m r p r e 1 p 1 three grid cases were applied to the grid uncertainty study of the computation of kcs and kp505 for discretized propeller and modified oum body force method in the computation the growth rate and the number of grid layers in the direction of i j k are changed for the grid spacing uncertainty study three different grids were generated with the grid refinement ratio 2 corresponding to coarse medium and fine the other grids for the body force methods are consistent with discretized propeller except for blades the grid sensitivity study is based on the medium time step the results simulated by the coarse medium and fine grids are listed in table 4 and table 5 three time steps cases were applied to the time step uncertainty study of the computation of kcs and kp505 for discretized propeller and modified oum body force method the time step sensitivity study was based on the medium grid and the results simulated for three time steps were shown in table 6 and table 7 as can be seen from fig 22 the slower the convergence rate is the worse the convergence of the calculation results is with the increase of time step for both grid spacing and time step the convergence factor r was between 0 and 1 which meant that monotonic convergence is achieved and richardson extrapolation method can be used from table 8 it can be observed that the uncertainties of grid and time step for discretized propeller were 1 64 d and 0 05 d where d is the experimental data the uncertainties of grid and time step for modified oum method were 2 73 d and 0 41 d as shown in table 10 in addition the uncertainties of grid and time step for towed kcs resistance were 8 73 d and 0 39 d 3 2 2 validation based on efd data validation is defined as a process for assessing computation modeling uncertainty u s m by using benchmark experimental data the comparison error e is defined as 62 e d s where d is the experimental data and s is the result from numerical computation to determine if validation has been achieved e is compared to the validation uncertainty u v given by 63 u v 2 u d 2 u s n 2 the results of validation study are shown in table 9 it is necessary for the validation uncertainty to know the uncertainty of the experimental data u d u d is provided for towed kcs resistance nabila 2014 but it isn t given for propeller thrust in any literature therefore u d for propeller is assumed as 1 00 d the result of validation study shows that all the comparison errors e are lower than the validation uncertainty u v which indicates that the computation results are validated under the u v level 3 2 kcs resistance computation the wake flow at the propeller plane is very important to describe the wake flow in detail a circular probe as shown in fig 23 is used the circle was divided into 120 parts with an interval of 3 and the 10 ratios for r r from the hub radius to propeller radius are 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 1 0 and 1 1 respectively where r denotes radial distance from shaft center r is radius of propeller r h is the hub radius wake factor 64 w n 1 v a u the simulated axial velocity distributions of kcs propeller plane 0 9825 x l p p is shown in fig 24 and compared with efd in fig 25 the wake flow is in good agreement with experiment 1 w n is calculated to be 0 731 the results of kcs resistance computation at f r 0 26 can be seen in table 10 also efd data tokyo 2015 and the computational results are listed it can be found that resistance and 2dof motion computations results matched well with test data fig 26 shows the wave patterns around the kcs model fig 27 and fig 28 shows free surface cuts of cfd and efd for kcs at three different lateral sections y l p p 0 0741 0 1509 and 0 4224 and at the hull surface the comparisons of wave computational results also show good agreement with efd the v v results had shown that the present computational approach is good for following research 3 3 open water computation of different propulsion models the open water computation conditions are set according to model tests the incoming flow velocity and rotating speed are set to 3 5 j m s and 14 r s respectively where j is the advance velocity fig 29 shows the differences of k t and k q between the computation results using different models and the experiment the maximum differences for dpm are 3 8 and 2 3 for the thrust coefficient and the torque coefficient respectively while these for modified oum are 4 32 and 3 5 in addition there is no difference between descriptive body force computation and efd since descriptive body force method used the propeller open water curve as the input so it isn t necessary to compare this one with others for open water characteristics in fig 30 the thrusts of different propulsion models are compared at j 0 8 it can be found that differences of the final stable results are very small for modified oum but results of oum are significantly different from efd the main reason for the difference of oum with other models is that the distribution of c l and c d obtained from the potential flow or empirical values is different from the modified oum and dpm wire probes at d 2d and 3d behind the propeller plane are used to compare the velocity fields of different propulsion models fig 31 shows velocity distributions of different propulsion models at wire probes comparing the velocity distributions of different propulsion models in fig 31 it can be found that the velocity field using modified oum is more similar to that of the dpm than other two body force models the difference between the velocity distribution of different propulsion models is defined as residual the integral value r of absolute value of residual can be used to evaluate different methods integral value r of absolute value of residual at wire probes is calculated in table 11 and it is obvious that modified oum body force method is more accurate than other body force methods 65 r e s i d u a l u p r o p e l l e r u b o d y f o r c e 66 r r p l p p r p l p p r e s i d u a l d r for numerical prediction computation time is also important for dpm simulation the propeller rotation angle should be less than 2 in each time step so the time step is at least equal to 0 0004 s the time step of body force methods can be the same as the ship resistance computation which could be 60 times bigger than dpm because if the time step is too large the propeller will rotate a large angle in a time step when using discretized propeller resulting in discontinuities in space and unreliable results however there is no spatial discontinuity in using body force methods so the time step can be set very large the time step sensitivity of body force methods had been discussed and δ t 0 005 l u was finally used meanwhile the grid number of the modified oum is about 2 3 of the discretized propeller it takes about 9 min to calculate the result of an advance coefficient on the open water hydrodynamic analysis by the modified oum while the discretized propeller takes 16 h 3 4 free running self propulsion computations of kcs with different propulsion models the self propulsion computation conditions are set according to model tests the computational model of body force methods is kcs only with hub while that of the discretized propeller is kcs with kp505 to ensure that the results of the two methods are not affected by the grid distribution the grids of the other parts are identical except for the grid of the propeller in two methods the blades and hub grid distributions are the same as the open water computation while tail hull refinements and numerical tank grid distributions is consistent with resistance computation in addition the grid and time step uncertainty studies of resistance and open water computation have been conducted pi control method is used to match the propeller rotating speed where the target velocity is 2 2 m s with s f c 30 3 n from the test the results of self propulsion computations of kcs with different propulsion models will be compared with experiment ship speed and propeller rotational speed have been given in fig 32 thrust of propeller and value of resistance minus sfc of body force methods stabilize faster as shown in fig 33 results of kcs self propulsion computations with different propulsion models are given in table 12 for the descriptive body force the vessel velocity or modified vessel velocity using nominal wake fraction in calm water is usually used as the advance velocity in this method the body force source term would be computed once and then input into rans solver so the interaction of the propeller and hull isn t under consideration the wake fraction is 0 so it is difficult to obtain correct self propulsion parameters in oum and modified oum body force method the local instantaneous velocity is used as advance velocity in every iteration step so that the virtual propeller and rans codes can interact with each other towards a solution and the bidirectional coupling between the local flow field and the virtual propeller can be taken into account in addition c l and c d closer to the actual ones would be obtained directly from cfd in modified oum body force method thus self propulsion parameters can be predicted more accurately by modified oum body force method thrust deduction factor 67 t t r t s f c t wake factor 68 w 1 j n d p u 0 where t and r t are thrust of propeller and resistance of ship respectively j is the advanced velocity coefficient and it is generally obtained by interpolation using the thrust identity method ittc 2014 n is rotating speed of propeller d p is diameter of propeller and u 0 is the ship velocity comparison of free surface cuts for kcs at the hull and at y lpp 0 1509 are shown in fig 34 and these show good agreement between cfd and efd free surfaces of different propulsion methods are very similar but become different around the stern tokyo 2015 provided velocity downstream of propeller plane at x l p p 0 9911 z l p p 0 03 0 03 y l p p 0 03 velocity distributions of three directions u v w are compared in fig 35 it can be found that in addition to the descriptive body force the axial velocity distributions predicted by other propulsion models agree well with experiment the body force methods tend to under predict the horizontal and vertical velocity components v w and dpm can better simulate the speed distribution in all directions fig 36 shows it depicts the vortex structure of the wake flow measured by the second invariant for the iso surface q 300 and colored by relative helicity bekhit 2018 dpm is shown to be able to capture the detailed propeller flow features 3 5 computational efficiency different propulsion models the self propulsion computations are carried on the ubuntu 16 04 lts 64 bit operating system desktop server with 2 9 ghz intel r xeon scalable platinum 8268 2cpu 48 and 512g install memory ram the discretized propeller model computation took 158 wall clock hours with δ t 0 0006 s when body force models took about 3 3 wall clock hours with δ t 0 0165 s by comparing thrust velocity of propeller plane free surface cuts and self propulsion parameters of efd and different propulsion models results show that the modified oum body force method considering three dimensional viscous and wake flow effects can accurately and quickly predict ship self propulsion the modified oum body force method supports the establishment of spare propeller banks with different airfoils which is helpful for propeller design and propeller hull rudder interference research in the ship design stage therefore it is observed that for computations focused on the ship free running study the modified oum method is a valid option to model the hydrodynamics considering the accuracy and saving computational time 4 conclusions compared with oum and other body force method modified oum obtained the c l and c d from discretize propeller model open water characteristic cfd computation results so that the method could be more similar to the discretize propeller model coupling with the local flow field the modified oum body force method could provide higher accuracy of ship free running computation for less computational time in the present study free running self propulsion computations of kcs with different propulsion models were carried out using the urans cfd code hust ship the computations are set according to experiment conditions provided by tokyo 2015 from hsva the grid and time step uncertainty study of propeller kp505 and bare hull kcs were conducted individually results of open water performance of different propulsion models kcs resistance and free running self propulsion computations were compared with efd data the computed results the thrust wake free surface cuts and self propulsion parameters using modified oum have good agreement with benchmark experimental data from tokyo 2015 the computation time of different propulsion models are compared each other the conclusions are following as 1 it is found credible that hust ship with overset grid technology could predict free running self propulsion characteristics using different propulsion models 2 the modified oum adopting c l and c d from cfd computational results of open water performance could reflect the propeller blade effects on propulsion model the computed results of open water characteristics for modified oum are very closed to that of the discretized propeller model 3 the kcs free running self propulsion simulation results with different propulsion models show that modified oum has high accuracy than other body force models compared with the discretized propeller model and the experimental data the computed results of modified oum are very closed to that of the discretized propeller model and show more merits with respect to computational time future work includes adopting the modified oum for the free running self propulsion computations of manoeuvres and seakeeping for ship hydrodynamic performance evaluation credit authorship contribution

21613,in this study two dimensional unsteady flow between and in the downstream region of two tandem cylinders close to a free surface was numerically investigated the governing momentum equations were solved by using the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple to simulate a free surface the volume of fluid vof method was used central differences and quadratic upwind interpolation quick methods were applied to discretize the viscous and convective terms respectively non uniform grid structures were used in the simulation with denser grids near the free surface bottom plate and in the vicinity of the cylinders the working fluid was water fr 0 3 the degree of submergence of the cylinders g ranged from 0 25d to 5 5d the distance between the cylinders l ranged from 1 5d to 4 0d and the channel depths h were 16d 8d and 4d the simulations were performed for the reynolds numbers of 180 250 and 400 it was shown that the flow characteristics were influenced by the submergence depth the distance between the cylinders and the depth of the channel as well as by the reynolds numbers as the distance to the free surface increased the vortices in the downstream region were formed at longer distances as the flow depth decreased the flow parameters on the cylinders cdmean clmax and st increased due to the influence of the boundary layer that was formed on the bottom wall when the distance between the cylinders was increased l d 4 the cylinders had higher cdmean and clmax values as the vortex was formed between the cylinders increases were observed in all flow parameters as the re number increased keywords free surface laminar flow tandem cylinders simple quick vof 1 introduction the effects of flows around structures located near a free surface are important due to vital applications such as pipelines placed in the seas and oceans the structures to be built in the seas the design of power generating equipment using tide events and waves oil and gas platform construction and maintenance sewage works and road construction for the transportation of cars under water studies have mostly been conducted on the flow around a single cylinder in a free stream however there are few publications that examine the effects of the free surface on these flows these studies are based on experimental and numerical research performed when the cylinder is very close to the free surface the interaction of the separated shear layer of the cylinder with the free surface also leads to significant differences in the unsteady loading from those observed in unbounded flows one of the experimental studies on cylinders under a free surface was performed by sheridan et al 1997 they experimentally examined the flow around a cylinder with a circular cross section placed close to the surface the ratio of the distance between the free surface and the cylinder to the cylinder size was taken from 0 to 0 75 the froude fr number was between 0 47 and 0 72 and the reynolds re number was between 5990 and 9120 when the fr number was low the free surface defects were negligible they also examined the instantaneous velocities and vortex formation for the froude number of 0 6 and the low values of the distance between the free surface and the cylinder when the ratio of the distance between the free surface and the cylinder to the cylinder size was 0 24 positive vortices were expressed from the free surface and negative vortices were produced from the top of the cylinder they observed that the positive vortices formed from the free surface were more dominant in the study by lee and daichin 2004 the cylinder in the air flow was located just above the free surface the free surface and cylinder interaction was investigated experimentally the re number was 3 3 103 depending on the cylinder diameter the cylinder with a diameter of 8 mm was placed parallel to the water surface the velocity was fixed at 6 12 m s they stated that the free surface had a significant effect on the flow area behind the cylinder regular vortex was observed even when the gap ratio was 0 25 free surface deformations indicated that they were caused by pressure differences malavasi and guadagnini 2007 examined the flow around a rectangular single cylinder that was open to the atmosphere they experimented by placing cylinders at different heights from the bottom of the channel and using different flow conditions they took the re number from 1 2 104 to 3 7 104 and worked on three different experimental conditions first they tested the reliability of their work and then studied the properties of the vortices experimentally they also studied the mean force coefficient the characteristic of the strouhal st number and the spectral analysis of the power applied to the cylinders as a result the asymmetric boundary conditions had a dominant effect on the buoyancy coefficient but had a limited effect on the drag force coefficient the distortion of the free surface flow depended on the re number and the force coefficients in heidari 2016 thesis he experimentally examined wave characteristics by placing two and then a single cylinder perpendicular to the flow in the case of a single cylinder high re numbers indicated that the wave formed behind the cylinder was smaller than what was formed at lower re numbers they stated that when the distance between the cylinders was large in tandem cylinders the wave zones were clearer compared to the small distance bai et al 2017 experimentally and numerically examined the interaction between a single cylinder and the surface when the cylinder was placed near the free surface they used the volume of fluid method to capture the free surface and the rng k epsilon method to model the turbulence they concluded that the value of the wave current force was influenced by both the wave reflection and the cylinder dip rate zhang et al 2018 estimated free surface turbulence using a sensor it was found that an ultrasonic sensor sufficiently measured the free surface movements in two dimensional scenarios especially in the low frequency range hirt and nichols 1981 studied the volume of fluid method in free surface conditions many methods were used for free surfaces but the volume of fluid method was emphasized to be the simplest and best method they showed that this method was more flexible and effective than others it was recommended especially in three dimensional studies due to its ease of use hino 1993 examined the free surface for a non uniform mesh structure by the finite volume method incompressible euler equations and continuity equations were disaggregated time integration was performed with the runge kutta method reichl et al 1998 investigated the fluctuations in a free surface by using the finite volume method they placed a single cylinder in the flow field and the depth of submersion was 0 0 0 25d and 0 75d demirdzic et al 1999 presented two methods for the solution of a free surface including the interface tracking and interface detection methods the advantages and disadvantages of the two methods were discussed and various application examples were presented azcueta et al 1999 provided some application results of an interface capture method that would flow on free surfaces related to marine engineering for turbulent flow design and optimization processes the refraction waves method was determined to be accurate reichl et al 2003 studied a free surface in two dimensions by means of fluent they examined the behavior of the st numbers for the cylinder in the free surface at both low and medium fr numbers 0 0 and 0 2 were taken as the low fr numbers the values of 0 40 and 0 55 were taken as the intermediate values of fr in their study the gap ratio was in the range of 0 10 5 0 the distribution of normalized st numbers in small gap ratios is given for 3 different re numbers as the gap ratio increased the number of st numbers decreased reichl et al 2005 studied flow by taking the re number 180 for a single cylinder placed near a free surface the fr number was in the range of 0 0 7 and the ratio of the distance from the free surface to the cylinder size was taken from the range of 0 1 5 the surface deformations were small for low fr numbers when the fr number was more than 0 3 or 0 4 surface deformations started to be significant they used the fluent program in their simulations a variant of the volume of fluid method was used to model the free surface park et al 2009 examined the free surface by the liquid volume method the properties of the method were confirmed by a variety of tests they found that the vof method had simpler and higher resolution than other methods it was stated in their study that the method can be developed efficiently and easily for practical applications and for three dimensional studies lin and huang 2010 studied the flow around the cylinder in a free surface by using the lagrangian method in two dimensions it was stated in their study that this method combines the advantages of the boundary integral method with the vortex method and is capable of capturing the mixed motions of the free surface and vortices they examined the effect of the fr number the degree of submergence of the cylinder and the depth of the water on the flow with a series of calculations when the depth of the cylinder in the fluid was sufficient it was stated that free surface defects were seen to be weak and similar to being at an infinite depth they stated that when the depth is less fluctuations begin in the back flow region reichl and hourigan 2001 modeled a single cylinder under a free surface flow using fluent they used a variant of the volume of fluid method to model the free surface the gap ratio was 0 4 and the fr number was 0 55 they said that their two dimensional results were consistent with the study of sheridan et al 1997 koh and cho 2011 numerically examined the drifting force of uneven waves around a circular cylinder fixed in deep waters under a free surface they focused on calculating the high harmonic components of the wave passing over a circular cylinder immersed in water to find out why the horizontal negative drag force is formed liang et al 2014 examined the hydrodynamic characteristic and vortex areas of a circular cross section with a fixed wall on one side and an air water free boundary condition on the other side they used the lagrange method to examine the flow and the mesh free viscous discrete vortex method for the free surface they provided the hydrodynamic coefficients on the cylinder for different gap rates they observed that the free surface had a significant effect on the st number as the gap ratio decreased chen et al 2015 studied numerically the effect of a partially submerged fixed cylinder on a free surface they performed a two dimensional simulation the cylinders were square shaped with circular edges and rounded corners it was said that there is no applicability of the study in small cylinder length diameter ratios the change of drag forces relative wavelength and relative wave depth was examined the change of relative axis depth indicated that it had a direct effect chung 2015 examined the flow around a single oscillation cylinder under a free surface according to his results no significant changes in vortex formation period were observed for deeply submerged cylinders with large oscillation amplitudes but sharp decreases were observed in the lift coefficient liu et al 2016 used fluent to study flow under two dimensional free surface effects they stated that the effects of a free surface on flow dynamics were the main focus of their study they modeled the flow and the free surface using the k w turbulence model and the volume of fluid method respectively the fr numbers were 0 18 0 65 0 71 0 75 0 92 and the submergence depths were 0 75 m 0 06 m 0 05 m 0 045 m and 0 03 m as the cylinder approached the surface the drag coefficient decreased from 3 86 to 2 18 and the st number rose from 0 125 to 0 355 frey et al 2018 presented a numerical scheme for two phase flow under a free surface the interfacial or free surface was modeled using a leveling formulation while the underlying mesh was modeled by iterated flow solvents the navier stokes equations were solved by using the first order lagrange galerkin method ong et al 2017 examined the waves formed on a free surface in two dimensions the k w turbulence model and free surface waves were used to determine the level set method and the k w turbulence model was studied in the determination of free surface waves they used the level set method esmaeilifar et al 2017 examined oval shaped cylinders under different oscillations under a free surface navier stokes equations were discretized by the finite volume method by using a simple algorithm the volume of fluid method was used for the free surface the effect of the free surface was not fully apparent when the gap ratio was small the value of the drag coefficient increased significantly depending on many parameters the reason for this was the increase of the drag coefficient of unbalanced waves in this region garg et al 2018 modeled a free surface using the finite element method in this study they aimed to develop a digital wave tank for viscous and non viscous flows a separate algorithm was proposed to study the flow and mesh deformations iteratively kumar et al numerically examined the two square cylinders in a tandem layout by taking the re number 40 in their research 4 different flow states were examined in the first state the rollers were close to each other and a pair of vortexes were formed between the rollers in the second two vortices in the space were divided into four vortices in the third the second bifurcation of the flow occurred in the 4th the partition topology was described by cylinder awakenings four partition studies were submitted each one being suitable to a different state in study 1 the downstream cylinder was activated as a streamlined body li et al 2018 examined the flow characteristics of a side by side circular cylinder arranged perpendicular to a free surface in the flow area the re number was 1 0 104 the k ϵ turbulence model was selected flow was modeled in three dimensions with the help of fluent to study the effect of the distance between the cylinders the gap between them was 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 to examine the effect of the wall the distance to the wall was 1 0 and 8 0 they stated that the development of the free surface was periodic in time scale it was observed that the flow near the two cylinders was pushed outwards and the flow between the cylinder and the wall was deflected inward by the wall vortex structures on and near the free surface were related to the free surface lopes et al 2018 performed a 3d numerical study using the volume of fluid method to define a free surface this comparison was said to create a balance between experimental and theoretical study and they stated that their aim was to use the three dimensional volume of fluid method for the free surface subburaj et al 2018 took the reynolds number 180 and examined the flow through elliptic cylinders close to a free surface with variable parameters such as fr number submergence depth aspect ratio and angle of attack the immersed boundary method and the level adjustment method were used to examine the flow the most important of all alters examined with different the angle of attacks was related to the suppression of eddy shedding at a depth of 0 096 subburaj and vengadesan 2019 examined two cylinders placed in tandem close to a free surface numerically by taking the re number 180 using the level determination and the immersed boundary method the fr number was between 0 3 and 0 6 the distance between the cylinders was from 2 to 10 the free surface distance of the cylinders was taken from 0 3 to 0 55 it was observed that flow distortions decreased as the fr number increased it was noticed that when the fr number was low the change of the average lift was more dependent on the degree of submerged depth while examining free surfaces near cylinders we can see from the literature that the vof boundary method and level adjustment methods have been used many of the existing studies have used the vof method and the authors have reported that the results were better than the other approaches for this reason the vof method is preferred here also as seen from the previous studies most of the studies are related to flows around a single cylinder under free surface fluid there is a limited number of studies on successive cylinders under free surface fluid the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the free surface as well as the distance between tandem cylinders the channel depth on the flow around square cylinders and on the unstable forces exerted by the flow for this purpose the distance between the cylinders the channel depth and the proximity of the cylinders to the free surface varied in this study 2 governing equations and boundary

the equations were discretized using there finite volume method with a pressure correction equation based on the simple algorithm patankar and spalding 1972 central differences were used in the discretization of the viscous terms and the quick method was used to discretize the convection terms versteeg and malalasekera 2007 the volume of fluid method was used to evaluate the free surface flow an f value was defined for each cell f is the ratio of the liquid in the cell f was signed as zero when there was no liquid the filling rate of the liquid in the cell was determined according to a value between zero and one if the f value is 1 it means that the cell is completely filled with liquid cells with values between zero and one are defined as free surfaces the time dependent f

of our computer program a single square section cylinder with a height and width d was inserted into a free stream and the flow around the cylinder and the variation of the flow parameters were investigated the cylinder was placed at 7 5 d distance from the top and the bottom so that the effects of the lower and upper boundaries and the inlet on the flow would be negligible the cylinders and the computational domain are presented in fig 1 the two cylinders were arranged in tandem the degree of submergence of the cylinders g was 0 25d 0 5d 0 75d 1 0d 1 5 d 2 5d 4 5d and 5 5d while the distance between the cylinders l was 1 5d and 4 0d the depth of the channel h also changed as 16d 8d and 4d a non uniform grid structure with condense grids near the walls and the free surface was adapted fig 2 simulations were performed at the range of reynolds numbers from 100 to 250 first v u y 0 boundary condition was taken at the top of the computational domain and then the free surface boundary condition was added cdmean table 1 clmax table 2 and the strouhal numbers table 3 obtained in the current study were compared with the available literature data for a single square cylinder in a uniform flow field clmax shows the largest value received by the cl coefficient the largest of the values that cl received in oscillation was taken as shown in the above tables the cdmean clmax and st numbers obtained from the two dimensional simulation of the flow around the cylinder placed in the uniform flow area are compatible with the values given in the literature the deviation in cdmean varies around 3 percent the deviation in clmax is around 2 percent and the deviation in st number varies around 3 percent to verify the numerical code the flow around a cylinder in a free stream was simulated by keeping the grid structure near the cylinder the results were compared with values given in the literature fig 3 shows the comparison of the cdmean value and fig 4 shows the comparison of the normalized st numbers under the free surface of the single cylinder as seen from the figures our values showed great similarity with the values in the literature and showed minor deviations the deviation in cdmean varies around 2 percent and the deviation in st number varies around 2 5 percent the grid and time dependency tests are presented for tandem cylinders under a free surface in figs 5 and 6 in the tests the distance between the cylinders was maintained as 4 0d the cylinders were located 5 5d below the free surface the channel depth was 16d and re was 180 the cdmean and st numbers were obtained at different grids and time intervals cdmean value is the average of cd values over time the flow characteristics on both the front and rear cylinders were obtained for different minimum grid spacing near the channel wall the free surface and the cylinders fig 5 smaller differences were obtained between the minimum grid width 0 025 and 0 030 the differences of the cdmean coefficients were 0 0034 on both the front and rear cylinders consequently case b was employed to get accurate solutions with a reasonable grid structure fig 6 presents the time interval effects on the solutions for the minimum grid width 0 025 maximum deviations were 0 0014 and 0 002 on the calculated cdmean value between the time step 0 002 and 0 001 respectively therefore the time step was set to 0 002 4 results and discussions 4 1 flow structure recently flow between tandem cylinders was classified by alam 2014 with variation in re and distance between the cylinders as follows a reverse flow reattachment rfr flow b front side reattachment fsr flow c front reattachment fr flow d bi stable bs flow between front side reattachment and co shedding flow e co shedding cs flow f over shoot os flow h rear side reattachment rsr flow significant deviations on the unsteady forces on the cylinders appear when the vortex shedding is formed between the cylinders co shedding the critical spacing for this vortex shedding was given approximately as 3 5d 3 8d for circular cylinders alam 2014 zdravkovich 1977 in this study the spacing of the cylinders was taken as 4d at which the vortex is shed and 1 5d at which there was no vortex shedding the froude number was also kept constant as 0 3 4 1 1 variation of the vortex structure with submergence depth the velocity vectors between the cylinders and near wake of the cylinders are presented in fig 7 for re 180 h d 16 l d 1 5 and gap submergence depth g d 0 25 in this figure the formation of a jet like flow between the front cylinder and the free surface is evident some part of the jet flow hits the upper side of the rear cylinder and rolls between the cylinders while the remaining part moves towards the downstream region by passing through the gap between the rear cylinder and the free surface this flow structure is representative of front side reattachment fsr flow the front stagnation point is on the upper half side of the front cylinder which leads to the flow deflecting away from the bottom surface of the cylinder fig 8 presents the instantaneous iso vorticity between and downstream of the cylinders for re 180 channel depth h d 16 l d 1 5 and various gap submergence depth g d values fig 8 a represents the instantaneous vorticity corresponding to the velocity vectors in fig 7 in the figures the positive vorticity corresponds to the counterclockwise rotation of the vortical structure and presented by a dark red color the positive vortexis formed on the bottom side of the front cylinder and a relatively small portion of the flow is curled between the cylinders while the remaining part moves to the downstream region by passing through the rear cylinder and rolls in the wake region the negative vortices are formed from the upper surface of the cylinders and remain connected to the free surface therefore a single layer of vortices appears to be shed in the downstream region the oncoming flow hits the front surface of the upstream cylinder and deflects away from the down surface leading to the formation of a thicker boundary layer on the down surface of the cylinders a thick boundary layer at the downside and a thinner boundary layer at the upside of the cylinders form as the gap g d increases fig 8 b the boundary layer thickness on the upper surface of the cylinders increases a negative vortex occupies the space between the cylinders and negative and positive vortices shed alternately in the downstream region at the small gaps l d 0 25 0 5 the free surface is more deflected at the larger gap g d 1 fig 8 c positive and weak vorticity originates from the free surface and merges to the positive vortices in the wake region regular vortex street is formed in the downstream region isotherms fig 8 c resemble the vortex structure in the near downstream region however for x 20 there are no distinct recirculation regions appearing in the isotherms this indicates that high energy decays in the downstream region are faster than momentum as the gap increases the influence of the free stream on the flow behind the cylinders also gradually disappears fig 8 d e the space between the cylinders is occupied by both negative upper half and positive lower half vortices in general as the gap ratio increases the vortices are formed farther down the downstream region as the gap increases the thickness of the boundaries on the upper surface of the cylinders increases while on the down surface it decreases gradually both of them become approximately the same 4 1 2 effects of reynolds number fig 9 presents the vortex structure at the various gap ratios g d for re 250 to clarify the effect of the reynolds number on the vortex structure fig 9 can be compared with fig 8 the deviations on the flow structure are especially obvious at the small gap ratios g d 0 25 0 5 for g d 0 25 some part of the jet like flow formed between the free surface and the upstream cylinder rolls between the cylinders in the clockwise direction fig 9 a fig 10 and some part of the fluid flows back from the gap towards to the underside of the front cylinder positive shear layer separated from the down side of the front cylinder diffuses partly to the gap between the cylinders at the rear of the cylinders the jet like flow loses its strength and negative vortices attached to the free surface are formed for g d 0 5 even though only clockwise recirculation of flow takes place between the cylinders at re 180 fig 8 a in addition to this rotation backflow was also seen at the underside of the front cylinder at re 250 similar to g d 0 25 the free surface of the fluid is deform due to the interaction between the surface and the cylinders for g d 0 25 and 0 5 while there is no distinct deformation apparent at the larger gaps g d 0 5 for g d 1 positive separated vortices originating from the free surface combine with the vortices formed in the wake of the cylinders for g d 1 regular alternating negative and positive vortices are shed in the downstream region 4 1 3 the effect of the vortex shedding between the cylinders fig 11 presents the variation of the vortex structure with gap g d at l d 1 5 and 4 at l d 1 5 the jet like flow leads to the formation of curled negative structures between and behind the cylinders fig 11 a and very weak back flows occur at the downside of the cylinders at l d 4 the boundary layer separates from the front cylinder and separates into two parts while the main part of the flow produces negative vortex shed in the gap between cylinders the remaining part moves along the rear surface of the front cylinder and flows back to the underside of the cylinder fig 11 a right and fig 12 the negative separated boundary layer produces a sheet connected to the free surface upside of upper side of wake region the positive vortex formed from the down surface of the front cylinder contacts with the front down side of the rear cylinder it merges with the positive vortex formed from the rear cylinder and a row of rounded positive vortices is formed in the downstream region the deformation of the free surface is obvious for both l d ratios the flow field at the larger gap ratios g d 0 75 is shown in fig 11 b for l d 1 5 left and l d 4 right for l d 1 5 the shear layer separates from the upper and lower surface of the front cylinder and produces alternating positive and negative vortices contacting the front surface of the rear cylinder this type of flow is similar to the front reattachment mode which is observed between cylinders placed in a free stream alam 2014 but the negative vortex covers the space between the cylinders in the downstream region positive and negative vortices which are still contacting the free surface are shed sequentially at l d 4 alternating negative and positive vortices are shed between the cylinders a narrow negative vortex is formed from the upper surface of the rear cylinder while the broader positive one is initiated on the down surface they amalgamate with the vortices formed from the front cylinder at the larger gaps fig 11 c d left column the flow between the cylinders is front reattachment mode at l d 1 5 and the formation length of the vortices become longer with the increasing g d ratio fig 11 d at l d 4 vortices are shed from both cylinders co shedding mode fig 11 c d right column even though at g d 1 5 the vortices are in contact with the free surface in the downstream region for both cylinder spacings l d 1 5 and 4 the deformation of the free surface disappears 4 1 4 effect of channel depth for the simulations a uniform velocity inlet was used and the boundary layer was still developing in the downstream region assuming that the boundary layer develops at the same rate in the downstream region for different depths of the channel the effect of the channel depth on the flow structure was analyzed fig 13 and fig 14 present the variation of vortex structures between and at the rear of the cylinders with submergence ratio g d at the different channel depths h d 8 and 4 a comparison of the left and right columns of the figures reveals that the shorter channel depth leads to a blockage effect on the flow at small channel depth the negative shear layer separated from the bottom of the channel also interacts with the vortices formed in the downstream region even at very small gaps g d fig 13 a right the separated shear layer from front cylinder reattaches to the front surface of the rear cylinder at small gaps g d 0 25 for h d 8 fig 13 a left at the smaller channel depth fig 13 a right the jet like flow between the free surface and the cylinders becomes stronger the space between the cylinders is mostly occupied by a negative shear layer separated from the upper side of the front cylinder at the same time a very weak positive shear layer separates from the free surface and adheres to the free surface in the downstream region for x 18 the negative shear layer formed on the bottom of the channel is separated from the surface and joins to the negative vortices in the wake region at the gap ratios g d of 0 25 and 0 5 the negative shear layer occupying the space between the cylinders flows back towards the bottom side of the front cylinder fig 13 a and b left although relatively smaller surface deformations are presented at both h d ratios for g d 0 75 the larger surface deformations are visible at the larger gaps g d 1 and 1 5 fig 13 d and e the cylinder is under the influence of both the free surface and the bottom wall of the channel at small h d and relatively larger gap g d ratios fig 13 d e right column fig 14 presents the effect of the channel depth on the vortex structure when the vortices are formed from both cylinders for g d 0 5 the negative and positive vortices are formed from the front cylinder and by striking on the rear cylinder they combine with the vortices behind the rear cylinder fig 14 b left at small channel depths h d 4 fig 14 b right vortices are formed close to the cylinders the positive shear layer of the free surface appears to be combined with the positive vortices between the cylinders the vortices are formed near to the rear cylinder when the gap ratio between the cylinders g d is 0 75 fig 14 c back flows seen colored blue negative shear layer at the bottom side of the cylinders take place at the bottom side of the front rear cylinders at both channel depths at the larger gaps g d 1 regular vortex street is formed downstream of the cylinders for h d 8 fig 14 d e left at the small gaps g d 0 25 the jet like flow is formed in the gap region of the front cylinder and the free surface does not continue along the free surface contrary to the small cylinder spacing fig 15 fig 16 due to jet like flow the negative shear layer separated from the upper side of the front cylinder forms a vortex away from the front surface at the same time a positive vortex occurs between the cylinders from the lower side of the upstream cylinder and combines with the positive shear layer separated from the bottom of the downstream cylinder which forms a relatively larger positive vortex in the downstream region fig 14 a left and fig 15 the jet like flow that occurs between the rear cylinder and the free surface leads to the negative shear layer taking place near the free surface 4 2 unsteady force coefficients 4 2 1 drag coefficients the variation of the average drag coefficient on the upstream and downstream cylinders with channel depth is presented in fig 17 for different submergence depth 4 2 1 1 drag coefficients on the upstream cylinder the left column corresponds to l d 1 5 where there is no vortex formation between the cylinders at this l d ratio as the re number increases the average drag coefficient on the front cylinder increases when the depth of the channel is 16d fig 17 a the cdmean decreases with the increasing submergence depth on both cylinders at g d 0 5 as the block ratio increases to d h 1 8 fig 17 b the mean drag coefficient on the upstream cylinder becomes larger at all the gap ratios while the g d ratio increases the effect of the free surface is reduced and the cdmean values of the front cylinder are gradually decreased while the g d ratio increases the cdmean values of the front cylinder gradually decrease when the effect of the free surface is reduced as the blockage ratio increases d h 1 8 fig 17 b cdmean values on the upstream cylinder decrease slightly with the increasing gap ratio g d at the higher blockage ratio d h 1 4 fig 17 c the cylinders are under the influence of both the free surface and the boundary layer formed on the bottom of the channel fig 14 e right column therefore the variation of the cdmean value with g d differs than at lower blockage ratios fig 17 left column it increases with the submergence depth for g d 0 5 then decreases until g d 0 75 then slightly increases in the case of the vortex l d 4 formed between the cylinders the variation of the average drag coefficient is given in fig 17 right column at the 1 16 blockage ratio the change of cdmean value with g d is similar to that for l d 1 5 and they take slightly higher values the effect of the re number on cdmean variation appears to be more evident fig 17 d cdmean values also increase with the increasing blockage fig 17 e at the blockage ratio of 1 4 the free surface has more effect on the cdmean values so that they sharply decrease with the submergence depth at g d 0 75 then slightly decrease at g d 0 75 fig 17 f at h d 4 the noticeable effect of cylinder to cylinder distances on the variation of cdmean values are clearly seen in fig 17 f at l d 1 5 4 2 1 2 drag coefficients on the downstream cylinder the variation of the average drag force coefficient on the downstream cylinder with g d is also presented in fig 17 for l d 1 5 variations of the cdmean values with g d resemble that on the upstream 1 at h d 16 however they are less sensitive to reynolds number and take negative values for g d 1 5 where the cylinders are away from the free surface effect at h d 8 generally the cdmean decreases with the increasing g d except it differs for g d 0 5 fig 17 b at the higher blockage ratio h d 4 its variation is similar to that of the upstream cylinder for g d 0 75 while it slightly varies for g d 1 fig 17 c at l d 4 the downstream cylinder is under the influence of both the shear layer separated form upstream cylinder and the free surface this mutual interaction leads to the cdmean value to increase sharply for g d 1 at h d 16 fig 17 d for h d 8 this response becomes relatively mild then it remains almost constant fig 17 e at a higher blockage ratio h d 4 the cdmean increases with the submergence depth g d 0 75 and then decreases fig 17 f for all cases the cdmean values on the upstream cylinder are larger than that on the downstream one due to fact that the approaching fluid first strikes the front surface of the upstream cylinder in addition the blockage effect is also the cause of the increase in the cdmean values with h d on both cylinders for most g d ratios 4 2 2 lift coefficients the deviation of the maximum values of the lift coefficients with the submergence depth on the upstream and downstream cylinders are presented in fig 18 for the different blockage ratios and cylinder to cylinder distances 4 2 2 1 lift coefficients on the upstream cylinder the jet like flow between the free surface and the cylinders has a strong effect on the lift coefficient especially at g d 0 75 fig 18 a d however the increasing blockage reduces this effect fig 18 b e c f at a small blockage h d 16 and with close placement of the cylinders l d 1 5 when the cylinders are close to the free surface the maximum lift coefficients take their smallest values and sharply increase for g d 0 75 at the higher reynolds numbers while these changes are relatively mild at re 180 fig 18 a at this blockage ratio the cdmax decreases sharply for 1 5 g d 2 5 at reynolds number of 180 and 250 while this tendency shifts to 2 5 g d 4 5 for re 400 re has an increasing effect on clmax values especially when the cylinders are close to the free surface at h d 8 the effect of the submergence depth does not have strong effect so that the changes with g d are relatively minor for g d 0 75 fig 18 b for l d 4 the clmax values varies smoothly both for h d 16 and 8 indicating that the g d variation does not have a strong effect on the cl of the upstream cylinder values when the vortexis formed between the cylinders fig 8 d e at the larger block effects h d 4 the deviations become irregular near the free surface g d 0 75 fig 8 f 4 2 2 2 lift coefficients on the downstream cylinder for l d 1 5 the deviation of clmax values with g d on the downstream cylinder present a similar trend to that on the upstream cylinder for h d 16 namely they sharply increase with g d at g d 0 75 for g d 2 5 the lift coefficient oscillates with the small increments and increases for re 180 and re 250 fig 18 a the jet like flow between the free surface and the cylinders causes the clmax on the downstream cylinder to be larger than that on upstream one at h d 8 and 4 the effect of the free surface on the oscillation of the max lift coefficient is not as strong as that at h d 16 therefore the variation of clmax near the surface g d 0 75 is relatively mild fig 18 b c at h d 4 the re number has more effect on the lift coefficient than the other blockages fig 18 c therefore the larger clmax values are observed on the downstream cylinders for l d 4 the clmax variations on the downstream cylinder resemble that for l d 1 5 at h d 16 fig 18 a d the maximum values of clmax appear at the submergence ratio of 1 g d 1 5 fig 18 d at h d 8 the largest values of clmax value are observed at g d 1 similar to that at h d 16 this suggests that in the case of vortex formation between the cylinders l d 4 the channel depth does not have as much effect as it has at l d 1 5 at h d 4 the boundary layer formed on the bottom surface of the channel has more effect on the cylinders than the free surface fig 14 e right column this leads to clmax values appearing at larger g d ratios a noticeable difference at clmax values on the downstream cylinder is they take close values to that on the upstream one at small g d ratios then as the g d increases the differences between the clmax values on the downstream and upstream cylinders also increase as generally expected the clmax values on the downstream cylinder also increase with the decreasing h d ratio at the same g d ratio for l d 4 4 2 3 st number the distribution of the normalized st numbers is given when the depth of the channel is 16d and the distance between the cylinders is 1 5d and 4 0d in fig 19 a c and when the depth of the channel is 4d and the distance between the cylinders is 1 5d and 4 0d in fig 19 b d normalization was performed by dividing each value by the median value the values shown are the median values in the middle after the values were sorted from small to large the front side reattachment flow is seen in h d 16 l d 1 5 and gap g d 0 25 fig 19 a the front stagnation point is on the upper half side of the front cylinder which leads to the flow deflecting away from the bottom surface of the cylinder for this reason the st number is lower than g d 0 5 as the gap g d 0 5 increases the boundary layer thickness on the upper surface of the cylinders increases the negative vortex occupies the space between the cylinders and negative and positive vortices shed alternately in the rear region for this reason the st number is increased the number of st decreases because the deformation of the free surface disappears at the larger gaps g d 1 as the gap increases the thickness of the boundaries on the upper and down surface of the cylinders becomes approximately the same and then the st number is seen to slightly increase even when the flow depth decreases the highest st number is with a gap ratio of 0 5 fig 19 b the cylinder is under the influence of both the free surface and the bottom wall of the channel at small h d and for this reason the st number decreases at relatively larger gap g d ratios in fig 19 c the boundary layer is separated from the front cylinder into two parts at l d 4 the st number increases because the negative separated boundary layer produces a sheet connected to the free surface upside of upper side of the wake region g d 0 5 at the larger gap ratios g d 0 75 alternating negative and positive vortices are shed between the cylinders and then the st number decreases at small channel depths and l d 4 fig 19 d vortices are formed close to the cylinders the positive shear layer of the free surface appears to be combined with the positive vortices between the cylinders since all the positive and negative vortexes interact with the free surface an increase in the st number occurs g d 0 5 5 conclusion in this study the flow around two square tandem cylinders placed in a free surface channel was investigated numerically using the fortran programming language the simple algorithm was used to solve the navier stokes equations on the free surface the vof method was used the central differences were used in the discretization of viscous terms and the quick method was used for the discretization of convection terms the number of re was 180 250 and 400 and the distance between the cylinders was 1 5d and 4 0d the distance to the free surface was taken between 0 25d and 5 5d and the distance between the cylinders range were 1 5d and 4 0d as a result the farther the cylinders were from the free surface the farther the vortexes behind the downstream cylinder began to form for l d 1 5 as the distance between the cylinders increased vortexes began to form between the cylinders as the distance to the free surface increased g d 2 5 the vortex street was formed in the downstream region of the cylinders and was formed so as not to touch the free surface flow depth h 16d and small cylinder distances l d 1 5 in the case of h 4d complex vortex formations were observed in the downstream region due to the effect of the boundary layer formed on the lower surface of the channel as the cylinders were moved away from the free surface it was seen that the flow in the cylinders downstream region was affected by both the free surface and the boundary layer formed on the lower surface of the channel as the depth of the channel increased the vortices in the downstream region appeared straighter due to the decrease of the effect of the channel sub wall as the flow depth decreased the flow parameters cdmean clmax and st on the front and rear cylinders increased as the cylinders were under the effect of the boundary layer formed on the lower wall as the distance between the cylinders increased l d 4 due to the vortex formed between the cylinders both the values of the cdmean and clmax of the front and rear cylinders were different from the g d and the values were higher because the flow firstly hit the front cylinder the cdmean on the front cylinder at all flow depths and distances between the cylinders were larger than on the rear cylinder credit

21613,in this study two dimensional unsteady flow between and in the downstream region of two tandem cylinders close to a free surface was numerically investigated the governing momentum equations were solved by using the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple to simulate a free surface the volume of fluid vof method was used central differences and quadratic upwind interpolation quick methods were applied to discretize the viscous and convective terms respectively non uniform grid structures were used in the simulation with denser grids near the free surface bottom plate and in the vicinity of the cylinders the working fluid was water fr 0 3 the degree of submergence of the cylinders g ranged from 0 25d to 5 5d the distance between the cylinders l ranged from 1 5d to 4 0d and the channel depths h were 16d 8d and 4d the simulations were performed for the reynolds numbers of 180 250 and 400 it was shown that the flow characteristics were influenced by the submergence depth the distance between the cylinders and the depth of the channel as well as by the reynolds numbers as the distance to the free surface increased the vortices in the downstream region were formed at longer distances as the flow depth decreased the flow parameters on the cylinders cdmean clmax and st increased due to the influence of the boundary layer that was formed on the bottom wall when the distance between the cylinders was increased l d 4 the cylinders had higher cdmean and clmax values as the vortex was formed between the cylinders increases were observed in all flow parameters as the re number increased keywords free surface laminar flow tandem cylinders simple quick vof 1 introduction the effects of flows around structures located near a free surface are important due to vital applications such as pipelines placed in the seas and oceans the structures to be built in the seas the design of power generating equipment using tide events and waves oil and gas platform construction and maintenance sewage works and road construction for the transportation of cars under water studies have mostly been conducted on the flow around a single cylinder in a free stream however there are few publications that examine the effects of the free surface on these flows these studies are based on experimental and numerical research performed when the cylinder is very close to the free surface the interaction of the separated shear layer of the cylinder with the free surface also leads to significant differences in the unsteady loading from those observed in unbounded flows one of the experimental studies on cylinders under a free surface was performed by sheridan et al 1997 they experimentally examined the flow around a cylinder with a circular cross section placed close to the surface the ratio of the distance between the free surface and the cylinder to the cylinder size was taken from 0 to 0 75 the froude fr number was between 0 47 and 0 72 and the reynolds re number was between 5990 and 9120 when the fr number was low the free surface defects were negligible they also examined the instantaneous velocities and vortex formation for the froude number of 0 6 and the low values of the distance between the free surface and the cylinder when the ratio of the distance between the free surface and the cylinder to the cylinder size was 0 24 positive vortices were expressed from the free surface and negative vortices were produced from the top of the cylinder they observed that the positive vortices formed from the free surface were more dominant in the study by lee and daichin 2004 the cylinder in the air flow was located just above the free surface the free surface and cylinder interaction was investigated experimentally the re number was 3 3 103 depending on the cylinder diameter the cylinder with a diameter of 8 mm was placed parallel to the water surface the velocity was fixed at 6 12 m s they stated that the free surface had a significant effect on the flow area behind the cylinder regular vortex was observed even when the gap ratio was 0 25 free surface deformations indicated that they were caused by pressure differences malavasi and guadagnini 2007 examined the flow around a rectangular single cylinder that was open to the atmosphere they experimented by placing cylinders at different heights from the bottom of the channel and using different flow conditions they took the re number from 1 2 104 to 3 7 104 and worked on three different experimental conditions first they tested the reliability of their work and then studied the properties of the vortices experimentally they also studied the mean force coefficient the characteristic of the strouhal st number and the spectral analysis of the power applied to the cylinders as a result the asymmetric boundary conditions had a dominant effect on the buoyancy coefficient but had a limited effect on the drag force coefficient the distortion of the free surface flow depended on the re number and the force coefficients in heidari 2016 thesis he experimentally examined wave characteristics by placing two and then a single cylinder perpendicular to the flow in the case of a single cylinder high re numbers indicated that the wave formed behind the cylinder was smaller than what was formed at lower re numbers they stated that when the distance between the cylinders was large in tandem cylinders the wave zones were clearer compared to the small distance bai et al 2017 experimentally and numerically examined the interaction between a single cylinder and the surface when the cylinder was placed near the free surface they used the volume of fluid method to capture the free surface and the rng k epsilon method to model the turbulence they concluded that the value of the wave current force was influenced by both the wave reflection and the cylinder dip rate zhang et al 2018 estimated free surface turbulence using a sensor it was found that an ultrasonic sensor sufficiently measured the free surface movements in two dimensional scenarios especially in the low frequency range hirt and nichols 1981 studied the volume of fluid method in free surface conditions many methods were used for free surfaces but the volume of fluid method was emphasized to be the simplest and best method they showed that this method was more flexible and effective than others it was recommended especially in three dimensional studies due to its ease of use hino 1993 examined the free surface for a non uniform mesh structure by the finite volume method incompressible euler equations and continuity equations were disaggregated time integration was performed with the runge kutta method reichl et al 1998 investigated the fluctuations in a free surface by using the finite volume method they placed a single cylinder in the flow field and the depth of submersion was 0 0 0 25d and 0 75d demirdzic et al 1999 presented two methods for the solution of a free surface including the interface tracking and interface detection methods the advantages and disadvantages of the two methods were discussed and various application examples were presented azcueta et al 1999 provided some application results of an interface capture method that would flow on free surfaces related to marine engineering for turbulent flow design and optimization processes the refraction waves method was determined to be accurate reichl et al 2003 studied a free surface in two dimensions by means of fluent they examined the behavior of the st numbers for the cylinder in the free surface at both low and medium fr numbers 0 0 and 0 2 were taken as the low fr numbers the values of 0 40 and 0 55 were taken as the intermediate values of fr in their study the gap ratio was in the range of 0 10 5 0 the distribution of normalized st numbers in small gap ratios is given for 3 different re numbers as the gap ratio increased the number of st numbers decreased reichl et al 2005 studied flow by taking the re number 180 for a single cylinder placed near a free surface the fr number was in the range of 0 0 7 and the ratio of the distance from the free surface to the cylinder size was taken from the range of 0 1 5 the surface deformations were small for low fr numbers when the fr number was more than 0 3 or 0 4 surface deformations started to be significant they used the fluent program in their simulations a variant of the volume of fluid method was used to model the free surface park et al 2009 examined the free surface by the liquid volume method the properties of the method were confirmed by a variety of tests they found that the vof method had simpler and higher resolution than other methods it was stated in their study that the method can be developed efficiently and easily for practical applications and for three dimensional studies lin and huang 2010 studied the flow around the cylinder in a free surface by using the lagrangian method in two dimensions it was stated in their study that this method combines the advantages of the boundary integral method with the vortex method and is capable of capturing the mixed motions of the free surface and vortices they examined the effect of the fr number the degree of submergence of the cylinder and the depth of the water on the flow with a series of calculations when the depth of the cylinder in the fluid was sufficient it was stated that free surface defects were seen to be weak and similar to being at an infinite depth they stated that when the depth is less fluctuations begin in the back flow region reichl and hourigan 2001 modeled a single cylinder under a free surface flow using fluent they used a variant of the volume of fluid method to model the free surface the gap ratio was 0 4 and the fr number was 0 55 they said that their two dimensional results were consistent with the study of sheridan et al 1997 koh and cho 2011 numerically examined the drifting force of uneven waves around a circular cylinder fixed in deep waters under a free surface they focused on calculating the high harmonic components of the wave passing over a circular cylinder immersed in water to find out why the horizontal negative drag force is formed liang et al 2014 examined the hydrodynamic characteristic and vortex areas of a circular cross section with a fixed wall on one side and an air water free boundary condition on the other side they used the lagrange method to examine the flow and the mesh free viscous discrete vortex method for the free surface they provided the hydrodynamic coefficients on the cylinder for different gap rates they observed that the free surface had a significant effect on the st number as the gap ratio decreased chen et al 2015 studied numerically the effect of a partially submerged fixed cylinder on a free surface they performed a two dimensional simulation the cylinders were square shaped with circular edges and rounded corners it was said that there is no applicability of the study in small cylinder length diameter ratios the change of drag forces relative wavelength and relative wave depth was examined the change of relative axis depth indicated that it had a direct effect chung 2015 examined the flow around a single oscillation cylinder under a free surface according to his results no significant changes in vortex formation period were observed for deeply submerged cylinders with large oscillation amplitudes but sharp decreases were observed in the lift coefficient liu et al 2016 used fluent to study flow under two dimensional free surface effects they stated that the effects of a free surface on flow dynamics were the main focus of their study they modeled the flow and the free surface using the k w turbulence model and the volume of fluid method respectively the fr numbers were 0 18 0 65 0 71 0 75 0 92 and the submergence depths were 0 75 m 0 06 m 0 05 m 0 045 m and 0 03 m as the cylinder approached the surface the drag coefficient decreased from 3 86 to 2 18 and the st number rose from 0 125 to 0 355 frey et al 2018 presented a numerical scheme for two phase flow under a free surface the interfacial or free surface was modeled using a leveling formulation while the underlying mesh was modeled by iterated flow solvents the navier stokes equations were solved by using the first order lagrange galerkin method ong et al 2017 examined the waves formed on a free surface in two dimensions the k w turbulence model and free surface waves were used to determine the level set method and the k w turbulence model was studied in the determination of free surface waves they used the level set method esmaeilifar et al 2017 examined oval shaped cylinders under different oscillations under a free surface navier stokes equations were discretized by the finite volume method by using a simple algorithm the volume of fluid method was used for the free surface the effect of the free surface was not fully apparent when the gap ratio was small the value of the drag coefficient increased significantly depending on many parameters the reason for this was the increase of the drag coefficient of unbalanced waves in this region garg et al 2018 modeled a free surface using the finite element method in this study they aimed to develop a digital wave tank for viscous and non viscous flows a separate algorithm was proposed to study the flow and mesh deformations iteratively kumar et al numerically examined the two square cylinders in a tandem layout by taking the re number 40 in their research 4 different flow states were examined in the first state the rollers were close to each other and a pair of vortexes were formed between the rollers in the second two vortices in the space were divided into four vortices in the third the second bifurcation of the flow occurred in the 4th the partition topology was described by cylinder awakenings four partition studies were submitted each one being suitable to a different state in study 1 the downstream cylinder was activated as a streamlined body li et al 2018 examined the flow characteristics of a side by side circular cylinder arranged perpendicular to a free surface in the flow area the re number was 1 0 104 the k ϵ turbulence model was selected flow was modeled in three dimensions with the help of fluent to study the effect of the distance between the cylinders the gap between them was 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 to examine the effect of the wall the distance to the wall was 1 0 and 8 0 they stated that the development of the free surface was periodic in time scale it was observed that the flow near the two cylinders was pushed outwards and the flow between the cylinder and the wall was deflected inward by the wall vortex structures on and near the free surface were related to the free surface lopes et al 2018 performed a 3d numerical study using the volume of fluid method to define a free surface this comparison was said to create a balance between experimental and theoretical study and they stated that their aim was to use the three dimensional volume of fluid method for the free surface subburaj et al 2018 took the reynolds number 180 and examined the flow through elliptic cylinders close to a free surface with variable parameters such as fr number submergence depth aspect ratio and angle of attack the immersed boundary method and the level adjustment method were used to examine the flow the most important of all alters examined with different the angle of attacks was related to the suppression of eddy shedding at a depth of 0 096 subburaj and vengadesan 2019 examined two cylinders placed in tandem close to a free surface numerically by taking the re number 180 using the level determination and the immersed boundary method the fr number was between 0 3 and 0 6 the distance between the cylinders was from 2 to 10 the free surface distance of the cylinders was taken from 0 3 to 0 55 it was observed that flow distortions decreased as the fr number increased it was noticed that when the fr number was low the change of the average lift was more dependent on the degree of submerged depth while examining free surfaces near cylinders we can see from the literature that the vof boundary method and level adjustment methods have been used many of the existing studies have used the vof method and the authors have reported that the results were better than the other approaches for this reason the vof method is preferred here also as seen from the previous studies most of the studies are related to flows around a single cylinder under free surface fluid there is a limited number of studies on successive cylinders under free surface fluid the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the free surface as well as the distance between tandem cylinders the channel depth on the flow around square cylinders and on the unstable forces exerted by the flow for this purpose the distance between the cylinders the channel depth and the proximity of the cylinders to the free surface varied in this study 2 governing equations and boundary

the equations were discretized using there finite volume method with a pressure correction equation based on the simple algorithm patankar and spalding 1972 central differences were used in the discretization of the viscous terms and the quick method was used to discretize the convection terms versteeg and malalasekera 2007 the volume of fluid method was used to evaluate the free surface flow an f value was defined for each cell f is the ratio of the liquid in the cell f was signed as zero when there was no liquid the filling rate of the liquid in the cell was determined according to a value between zero and one if the f value is 1 it means that the cell is completely filled with liquid cells with values between zero and one are defined as free surfaces the time dependent f

of our computer program a single square section cylinder with a height and width d was inserted into a free stream and the flow around the cylinder and the variation of the flow parameters were investigated the cylinder was placed at 7 5 d distance from the top and the bottom so that the effects of the lower and upper boundaries and the inlet on the flow would be negligible the cylinders and the computational domain are presented in fig 1 the two cylinders were arranged in tandem the degree of submergence of the cylinders g was 0 25d 0 5d 0 75d 1 0d 1 5 d 2 5d 4 5d and 5 5d while the distance between the cylinders l was 1 5d and 4 0d the depth of the channel h also changed as 16d 8d and 4d a non uniform grid structure with condense grids near the walls and the free surface was adapted fig 2 simulations were performed at the range of reynolds numbers from 100 to 250 first v u y 0 boundary condition was taken at the top of the computational domain and then the free surface boundary condition was added cdmean table 1 clmax table 2 and the strouhal numbers table 3 obtained in the current study were compared with the available literature data for a single square cylinder in a uniform flow field clmax shows the largest value received by the cl coefficient the largest of the values that cl received in oscillation was taken as shown in the above tables the cdmean clmax and st numbers obtained from the two dimensional simulation of the flow around the cylinder placed in the uniform flow area are compatible with the values given in the literature the deviation in cdmean varies around 3 percent the deviation in clmax is around 2 percent and the deviation in st number varies around 3 percent to verify the numerical code the flow around a cylinder in a free stream was simulated by keeping the grid structure near the cylinder the results were compared with values given in the literature fig 3 shows the comparison of the cdmean value and fig 4 shows the comparison of the normalized st numbers under the free surface of the single cylinder as seen from the figures our values showed great similarity with the values in the literature and showed minor deviations the deviation in cdmean varies around 2 percent and the deviation in st number varies around 2 5 percent the grid and time dependency tests are presented for tandem cylinders under a free surface in figs 5 and 6 in the tests the distance between the cylinders was maintained as 4 0d the cylinders were located 5 5d below the free surface the channel depth was 16d and re was 180 the cdmean and st numbers were obtained at different grids and time intervals cdmean value is the average of cd values over time the flow characteristics on both the front and rear cylinders were obtained for different minimum grid spacing near the channel wall the free surface and the cylinders fig 5 smaller differences were obtained between the minimum grid width 0 025 and 0 030 the differences of the cdmean coefficients were 0 0034 on both the front and rear cylinders consequently case b was employed to get accurate solutions with a reasonable grid structure fig 6 presents the time interval effects on the solutions for the minimum grid width 0 025 maximum deviations were 0 0014 and 0 002 on the calculated cdmean value between the time step 0 002 and 0 001 respectively therefore the time step was set to 0 002 4 results and discussions 4 1 flow structure recently flow between tandem cylinders was classified by alam 2014 with variation in re and distance between the cylinders as follows a reverse flow reattachment rfr flow b front side reattachment fsr flow c front reattachment fr flow d bi stable bs flow between front side reattachment and co shedding flow e co shedding cs flow f over shoot os flow h rear side reattachment rsr flow significant deviations on the unsteady forces on the cylinders appear when the vortex shedding is formed between the cylinders co shedding the critical spacing for this vortex shedding was given approximately as 3 5d 3 8d for circular cylinders alam 2014 zdravkovich 1977 in this study the spacing of the cylinders was taken as 4d at which the vortex is shed and 1 5d at which there was no vortex shedding the froude number was also kept constant as 0 3 4 1 1 variation of the vortex structure with submergence depth the velocity vectors between the cylinders and near wake of the cylinders are presented in fig 7 for re 180 h d 16 l d 1 5 and gap submergence depth g d 0 25 in this figure the formation of a jet like flow between the front cylinder and the free surface is evident some part of the jet flow hits the upper side of the rear cylinder and rolls between the cylinders while the remaining part moves towards the downstream region by passing through the gap between the rear cylinder and the free surface this flow structure is representative of front side reattachment fsr flow the front stagnation point is on the upper half side of the front cylinder which leads to the flow deflecting away from the bottom surface of the cylinder fig 8 presents the instantaneous iso vorticity between and downstream of the cylinders for re 180 channel depth h d 16 l d 1 5 and various gap submergence depth g d values fig 8 a represents the instantaneous vorticity corresponding to the velocity vectors in fig 7 in the figures the positive vorticity corresponds to the counterclockwise rotation of the vortical structure and presented by a dark red color the positive vortexis formed on the bottom side of the front cylinder and a relatively small portion of the flow is curled between the cylinders while the remaining part moves to the downstream region by passing through the rear cylinder and rolls in the wake region the negative vortices are formed from the upper surface of the cylinders and remain connected to the free surface therefore a single layer of vortices appears to be shed in the downstream region the oncoming flow hits the front surface of the upstream cylinder and deflects away from the down surface leading to the formation of a thicker boundary layer on the down surface of the cylinders a thick boundary layer at the downside and a thinner boundary layer at the upside of the cylinders form as the gap g d increases fig 8 b the boundary layer thickness on the upper surface of the cylinders increases a negative vortex occupies the space between the cylinders and negative and positive vortices shed alternately in the downstream region at the small gaps l d 0 25 0 5 the free surface is more deflected at the larger gap g d 1 fig 8 c positive and weak vorticity originates from the free surface and merges to the positive vortices in the wake region regular vortex street is formed in the downstream region isotherms fig 8 c resemble the vortex structure in the near downstream region however for x 20 there are no distinct recirculation regions appearing in the isotherms this indicates that high energy decays in the downstream region are faster than momentum as the gap increases the influence of the free stream on the flow behind the cylinders also gradually disappears fig 8 d e the space between the cylinders is occupied by both negative upper half and positive lower half vortices in general as the gap ratio increases the vortices are formed farther down the downstream region as the gap increases the thickness of the boundaries on the upper surface of the cylinders increases while on the down surface it decreases gradually both of them become approximately the same 4 1 2 effects of reynolds number fig 9 presents the vortex structure at the various gap ratios g d for re 250 to clarify the effect of the reynolds number on the vortex structure fig 9 can be compared with fig 8 the deviations on the flow structure are especially obvious at the small gap ratios g d 0 25 0 5 for g d 0 25 some part of the jet like flow formed between the free surface and the upstream cylinder rolls between the cylinders in the clockwise direction fig 9 a fig 10 and some part of the fluid flows back from the gap towards to the underside of the front cylinder positive shear layer separated from the down side of the front cylinder diffuses partly to the gap between the cylinders at the rear of the cylinders the jet like flow loses its strength and negative vortices attached to the free surface are formed for g d 0 5 even though only clockwise recirculation of flow takes place between the cylinders at re 180 fig 8 a in addition to this rotation backflow was also seen at the underside of the front cylinder at re 250 similar to g d 0 25 the free surface of the fluid is deform due to the interaction between the surface and the cylinders for g d 0 25 and 0 5 while there is no distinct deformation apparent at the larger gaps g d 0 5 for g d 1 positive separated vortices originating from the free surface combine with the vortices formed in the wake of the cylinders for g d 1 regular alternating negative and positive vortices are shed in the downstream region 4 1 3 the effect of the vortex shedding between the cylinders fig 11 presents the variation of the vortex structure with gap g d at l d 1 5 and 4 at l d 1 5 the jet like flow leads to the formation of curled negative structures between and behind the cylinders fig 11 a and very weak back flows occur at the downside of the cylinders at l d 4 the boundary layer separates from the front cylinder and separates into two parts while the main part of the flow produces negative vortex shed in the gap between cylinders the remaining part moves along the rear surface of the front cylinder and flows back to the underside of the cylinder fig 11 a right and fig 12 the negative separated boundary layer produces a sheet connected to the free surface upside of upper side of wake region the positive vortex formed from the down surface of the front cylinder contacts with the front down side of the rear cylinder it merges with the positive vortex formed from the rear cylinder and a row of rounded positive vortices is formed in the downstream region the deformation of the free surface is obvious for both l d ratios the flow field at the larger gap ratios g d 0 75 is shown in fig 11 b for l d 1 5 left and l d 4 right for l d 1 5 the shear layer separates from the upper and lower surface of the front cylinder and produces alternating positive and negative vortices contacting the front surface of the rear cylinder this type of flow is similar to the front reattachment mode which is observed between cylinders placed in a free stream alam 2014 but the negative vortex covers the space between the cylinders in the downstream region positive and negative vortices which are still contacting the free surface are shed sequentially at l d 4 alternating negative and positive vortices are shed between the cylinders a narrow negative vortex is formed from the upper surface of the rear cylinder while the broader positive one is initiated on the down surface they amalgamate with the vortices formed from the front cylinder at the larger gaps fig 11 c d left column the flow between the cylinders is front reattachment mode at l d 1 5 and the formation length of the vortices become longer with the increasing g d ratio fig 11 d at l d 4 vortices are shed from both cylinders co shedding mode fig 11 c d right column even though at g d 1 5 the vortices are in contact with the free surface in the downstream region for both cylinder spacings l d 1 5 and 4 the deformation of the free surface disappears 4 1 4 effect of channel depth for the simulations a uniform velocity inlet was used and the boundary layer was still developing in the downstream region assuming that the boundary layer develops at the same rate in the downstream region for different depths of the channel the effect of the channel depth on the flow structure was analyzed fig 13 and fig 14 present the variation of vortex structures between and at the rear of the cylinders with submergence ratio g d at the different channel depths h d 8 and 4 a comparison of the left and right columns of the figures reveals that the shorter channel depth leads to a blockage effect on the flow at small channel depth the negative shear layer separated from the bottom of the channel also interacts with the vortices formed in the downstream region even at very small gaps g d fig 13 a right the separated shear layer from front cylinder reattaches to the front surface of the rear cylinder at small gaps g d 0 25 for h d 8 fig 13 a left at the smaller channel depth fig 13 a right the jet like flow between the free surface and the cylinders becomes stronger the space between the cylinders is mostly occupied by a negative shear layer separated from the upper side of the front cylinder at the same time a very weak positive shear layer separates from the free surface and adheres to the free surface in the downstream region for x 18 the negative shear layer formed on the bottom of the channel is separated from the surface and joins to the negative vortices in the wake region at the gap ratios g d of 0 25 and 0 5 the negative shear layer occupying the space between the cylinders flows back towards the bottom side of the front cylinder fig 13 a and b left although relatively smaller surface deformations are presented at both h d ratios for g d 0 75 the larger surface deformations are visible at the larger gaps g d 1 and 1 5 fig 13 d and e the cylinder is under the influence of both the free surface and the bottom wall of the channel at small h d and relatively larger gap g d ratios fig 13 d e right column fig 14 presents the effect of the channel depth on the vortex structure when the vortices are formed from both cylinders for g d 0 5 the negative and positive vortices are formed from the front cylinder and by striking on the rear cylinder they combine with the vortices behind the rear cylinder fig 14 b left at small channel depths h d 4 fig 14 b right vortices are formed close to the cylinders the positive shear layer of the free surface appears to be combined with the positive vortices between the cylinders the vortices are formed near to the rear cylinder when the gap ratio between the cylinders g d is 0 75 fig 14 c back flows seen colored blue negative shear layer at the bottom side of the cylinders take place at the bottom side of the front rear cylinders at both channel depths at the larger gaps g d 1 regular vortex street is formed downstream of the cylinders for h d 8 fig 14 d e left at the small gaps g d 0 25 the jet like flow is formed in the gap region of the front cylinder and the free surface does not continue along the free surface contrary to the small cylinder spacing fig 15 fig 16 due to jet like flow the negative shear layer separated from the upper side of the front cylinder forms a vortex away from the front surface at the same time a positive vortex occurs between the cylinders from the lower side of the upstream cylinder and combines with the positive shear layer separated from the bottom of the downstream cylinder which forms a relatively larger positive vortex in the downstream region fig 14 a left and fig 15 the jet like flow that occurs between the rear cylinder and the free surface leads to the negative shear layer taking place near the free surface 4 2 unsteady force coefficients 4 2 1 drag coefficients the variation of the average drag coefficient on the upstream and downstream cylinders with channel depth is presented in fig 17 for different submergence depth 4 2 1 1 drag coefficients on the upstream cylinder the left column corresponds to l d 1 5 where there is no vortex formation between the cylinders at this l d ratio as the re number increases the average drag coefficient on the front cylinder increases when the depth of the channel is 16d fig 17 a the cdmean decreases with the increasing submergence depth on both cylinders at g d 0 5 as the block ratio increases to d h 1 8 fig 17 b the mean drag coefficient on the upstream cylinder becomes larger at all the gap ratios while the g d ratio increases the effect of the free surface is reduced and the cdmean values of the front cylinder are gradually decreased while the g d ratio increases the cdmean values of the front cylinder gradually decrease when the effect of the free surface is reduced as the blockage ratio increases d h 1 8 fig 17 b cdmean values on the upstream cylinder decrease slightly with the increasing gap ratio g d at the higher blockage ratio d h 1 4 fig 17 c the cylinders are under the influence of both the free surface and the boundary layer formed on the bottom of the channel fig 14 e right column therefore the variation of the cdmean value with g d differs than at lower blockage ratios fig 17 left column it increases with the submergence depth for g d 0 5 then decreases until g d 0 75 then slightly increases in the case of the vortex l d 4 formed between the cylinders the variation of the average drag coefficient is given in fig 17 right column at the 1 16 blockage ratio the change of cdmean value with g d is similar to that for l d 1 5 and they take slightly higher values the effect of the re number on cdmean variation appears to be more evident fig 17 d cdmean values also increase with the increasing blockage fig 17 e at the blockage ratio of 1 4 the free surface has more effect on the cdmean values so that they sharply decrease with the submergence depth at g d 0 75 then slightly decrease at g d 0 75 fig 17 f at h d 4 the noticeable effect of cylinder to cylinder distances on the variation of cdmean values are clearly seen in fig 17 f at l d 1 5 4 2 1 2 drag coefficients on the downstream cylinder the variation of the average drag force coefficient on the downstream cylinder with g d is also presented in fig 17 for l d 1 5 variations of the cdmean values with g d resemble that on the upstream 1 at h d 16 however they are less sensitive to reynolds number and take negative values for g d 1 5 where the cylinders are away from the free surface effect at h d 8 generally the cdmean decreases with the increasing g d except it differs for g d 0 5 fig 17 b at the higher blockage ratio h d 4 its variation is similar to that of the upstream cylinder for g d 0 75 while it slightly varies for g d 1 fig 17 c at l d 4 the downstream cylinder is under the influence of both the shear layer separated form upstream cylinder and the free surface this mutual interaction leads to the cdmean value to increase sharply for g d 1 at h d 16 fig 17 d for h d 8 this response becomes relatively mild then it remains almost constant fig 17 e at a higher blockage ratio h d 4 the cdmean increases with the submergence depth g d 0 75 and then decreases fig 17 f for all cases the cdmean values on the upstream cylinder are larger than that on the downstream one due to fact that the approaching fluid first strikes the front surface of the upstream cylinder in addition the blockage effect is also the cause of the increase in the cdmean values with h d on both cylinders for most g d ratios 4 2 2 lift coefficients the deviation of the maximum values of the lift coefficients with the submergence depth on the upstream and downstream cylinders are presented in fig 18 for the different blockage ratios and cylinder to cylinder distances 4 2 2 1 lift coefficients on the upstream cylinder the jet like flow between the free surface and the cylinders has a strong effect on the lift coefficient especially at g d 0 75 fig 18 a d however the increasing blockage reduces this effect fig 18 b e c f at a small blockage h d 16 and with close placement of the cylinders l d 1 5 when the cylinders are close to the free surface the maximum lift coefficients take their smallest values and sharply increase for g d 0 75 at the higher reynolds numbers while these changes are relatively mild at re 180 fig 18 a at this blockage ratio the cdmax decreases sharply for 1 5 g d 2 5 at reynolds number of 180 and 250 while this tendency shifts to 2 5 g d 4 5 for re 400 re has an increasing effect on clmax values especially when the cylinders are close to the free surface at h d 8 the effect of the submergence depth does not have strong effect so that the changes with g d are relatively minor for g d 0 75 fig 18 b for l d 4 the clmax values varies smoothly both for h d 16 and 8 indicating that the g d variation does not have a strong effect on the cl of the upstream cylinder values when the vortexis formed between the cylinders fig 8 d e at the larger block effects h d 4 the deviations become irregular near the free surface g d 0 75 fig 8 f 4 2 2 2 lift coefficients on the downstream cylinder for l d 1 5 the deviation of clmax values with g d on the downstream cylinder present a similar trend to that on the upstream cylinder for h d 16 namely they sharply increase with g d at g d 0 75 for g d 2 5 the lift coefficient oscillates with the small increments and increases for re 180 and re 250 fig 18 a the jet like flow between the free surface and the cylinders causes the clmax on the downstream cylinder to be larger than that on upstream one at h d 8 and 4 the effect of the free surface on the oscillation of the max lift coefficient is not as strong as that at h d 16 therefore the variation of clmax near the surface g d 0 75 is relatively mild fig 18 b c at h d 4 the re number has more effect on the lift coefficient than the other blockages fig 18 c therefore the larger clmax values are observed on the downstream cylinders for l d 4 the clmax variations on the downstream cylinder resemble that for l d 1 5 at h d 16 fig 18 a d the maximum values of clmax appear at the submergence ratio of 1 g d 1 5 fig 18 d at h d 8 the largest values of clmax value are observed at g d 1 similar to that at h d 16 this suggests that in the case of vortex formation between the cylinders l d 4 the channel depth does not have as much effect as it has at l d 1 5 at h d 4 the boundary layer formed on the bottom surface of the channel has more effect on the cylinders than the free surface fig 14 e right column this leads to clmax values appearing at larger g d ratios a noticeable difference at clmax values on the downstream cylinder is they take close values to that on the upstream one at small g d ratios then as the g d increases the differences between the clmax values on the downstream and upstream cylinders also increase as generally expected the clmax values on the downstream cylinder also increase with the decreasing h d ratio at the same g d ratio for l d 4 4 2 3 st number the distribution of the normalized st numbers is given when the depth of the channel is 16d and the distance between the cylinders is 1 5d and 4 0d in fig 19 a c and when the depth of the channel is 4d and the distance between the cylinders is 1 5d and 4 0d in fig 19 b d normalization was performed by dividing each value by the median value the values shown are the median values in the middle after the values were sorted from small to large the front side reattachment flow is seen in h d 16 l d 1 5 and gap g d 0 25 fig 19 a the front stagnation point is on the upper half side of the front cylinder which leads to the flow deflecting away from the bottom surface of the cylinder for this reason the st number is lower than g d 0 5 as the gap g d 0 5 increases the boundary layer thickness on the upper surface of the cylinders increases the negative vortex occupies the space between the cylinders and negative and positive vortices shed alternately in the rear region for this reason the st number is increased the number of st decreases because the deformation of the free surface disappears at the larger gaps g d 1 as the gap increases the thickness of the boundaries on the upper and down surface of the cylinders becomes approximately the same and then the st number is seen to slightly increase even when the flow depth decreases the highest st number is with a gap ratio of 0 5 fig 19 b the cylinder is under the influence of both the free surface and the bottom wall of the channel at small h d and for this reason the st number decreases at relatively larger gap g d ratios in fig 19 c the boundary layer is separated from the front cylinder into two parts at l d 4 the st number increases because the negative separated boundary layer produces a sheet connected to the free surface upside of upper side of the wake region g d 0 5 at the larger gap ratios g d 0 75 alternating negative and positive vortices are shed between the cylinders and then the st number decreases at small channel depths and l d 4 fig 19 d vortices are formed close to the cylinders the positive shear layer of the free surface appears to be combined with the positive vortices between the cylinders since all the positive and negative vortexes interact with the free surface an increase in the st number occurs g d 0 5 5 conclusion in this study the flow around two square tandem cylinders placed in a free surface channel was investigated numerically using the fortran programming language the simple algorithm was used to solve the navier stokes equations on the free surface the vof method was used the central differences were used in the discretization of viscous terms and the quick method was used for the discretization of convection terms the number of re was 180 250 and 400 and the distance between the cylinders was 1 5d and 4 0d the distance to the free surface was taken between 0 25d and 5 5d and the distance between the cylinders range were 1 5d and 4 0d as a result the farther the cylinders were from the free surface the farther the vortexes behind the downstream cylinder began to form for l d 1 5 as the distance between the cylinders increased vortexes began to form between the cylinders as the distance to the free surface increased g d 2 5 the vortex street was formed in the downstream region of the cylinders and was formed so as not to touch the free surface flow depth h 16d and small cylinder distances l d 1 5 in the case of h 4d complex vortex formations were observed in the downstream region due to the effect of the boundary layer formed on the lower surface of the channel as the cylinders were moved away from the free surface it was seen that the flow in the cylinders downstream region was affected by both the free surface and the boundary layer formed on the lower surface of the channel as the depth of the channel increased the vortices in the downstream region appeared straighter due to the decrease of the effect of the channel sub wall as the flow depth decreased the flow parameters cdmean clmax and st on the front and rear cylinders increased as the cylinders were under the effect of the boundary layer formed on the lower wall as the distance between the cylinders increased l d 4 due to the vortex formed between the cylinders both the values of the cdmean and clmax of the front and rear cylinders were different from the g d and the values were higher because the flow firstly hit the front cylinder the cdmean on the front cylinder at all flow depths and distances between the cylinders were larger than on the rear cylinder credit

21614,the dependence of the degree of biofouling on the magnitude of the contact angle θ during temporary degradation of the superhydrophobic coating of shipbuilding steel a40s in the process of being under water is examined the experiment showed that the gas gap between the liquid and the structured surface makes it difficult for the first settlements to appear at θ 130 in 35 days of being underwater and losing the hydrophobic properties of the coating there were discovered the serpules serpula vermicularis bryozoans bryozoa and green algae chlorophyta but there is no balanus balanidae chthamalus stellatus and sponges porifera which are observed on the untreated opposite sample side the results of an in vivo experiment were used to cfd the dependence of water s flow velocity along the plate surface numerical calculation was determined the ratio of the initial flow velocity rate to its value at the end of the model plates the transition from the hydrophilic state to the hydrophobic state reduces the value of the surface resistance by 1 44 times changes in the velocity ν0 ν 2 6 are hydrophilic ν0 ν 1 8 hydrophobic an increase in surface roughness due to fouling will further increase the speed ratio by another 1 19 1 22 times keywords superhydrophobicity contact angle fouling shipbuilding steel roughness cfd 1 introduction with the long term presence of structural materials under water their surfaces are subject to biological fouling which causes significant damage to the functioning of the equipment periodically in the literature there are works with an assessment of the economic damage associated with violations of the functions of the mechanisms used in the marine environment due to biofouling hellio and yebra 2009 milosavljevic and heikkilä 2001 pimentel et al 2000 vedaprakash et al 2013 most significantly this problem manifests itself in shipping especially if the vessel is operated in warm the seas self polishing tributyltin copolymers c4h9 3sn are effective in protecting the surface from fouling evans 1999 but these substances are toxins however despite all the modifications of this method environmental losses that are palpable throughout the world limited the use of tributyl tin until its final ban in 2008 gipperth 2009 at the same time attempts to avoid the use of poisonous biocides in coatings of surfaces interacting with an aqueous medium lead to a deterioration of the anti fouling properties of the surface and reduce the interdock maintenance period one of the fields of development of protective coatings that do not contain biocides is the search and use of materials with low surface energy zhao q et al 2004 chen et al 2017 lei et al 2018 the decrease in the wettability of such surfaces leads to a weak attachment of the first settlements of spores larvae algae which are washed out under the influence of water flow the quantitative characteristic of wettability is the contact angle θ ca it is defined as the angle between the tangent at the triple point of the interface and the solid surface droplet angle θ is related to interphase energies acting between the boundaries of the solid liquid interface γ sl surface energy solid vapor γ sv and liquid vapor energy γ lv by 1 c o s θ γ s v γ s l γ l v from 1 it follows that the lower the surface energy the greater the contact angle and the less wettability of a solid if the contact angle θ 90 the surface has hydrophilic properties θ 90 corresponds to the hydrophobic interaction an increase in ca to θ 150 indicates a transition to the superhydrophobic sh state the wettability properties of a solid surface can be interpreted using wenzel and cassie baxter models that take into account surface roughness assuming that the fluid fills the space between the protrusions on the surface the wenzel approach correlates with the apparent contact angle θ and the thermodynamic contact angle θ as 2 cos θ r cos θ where r roughness coefficient the ratio between the true surface area and its horizontal projection cassie and baxter presented the idea that a surface traps air in hollow roughness spaces interpreting the apparent contact angle θ as 3 cos θ f l s cos θ f l v where f ls the fraction of the area of liquid in contact with a solid f lv is the fraction of the area of liquid in contact with trapped air another indicator of superhydrophobicity is the difference between upcoming θ adv and back angles θ res contact angle hysteresis with greater hysteresis the droplets will be considered to belong to the wenzel solution which enters the roughness whereas the sh state is characterized by small hysteresis values θ adv θ res 10 and the surface can be considered as a columnar structure with a large roughness coefficient supporting the fluid and decreasing the available area the described properties of superhydrophobic coatings as well as the phenomenon of superhydrophobicity can be used to design self cleaning and anti fouling surfaces with minimal viscous resistance genzer and efimenko 2006 samaha et al 2012 ferrari and benedetti 2015 in general studies of the effect of wettability on the degree of fouling are accompanied by the presentation of a new method for producing an sh surface liu et al 2012 in order to prevent bacterial adhesion a super hydrophobic coating consisting of silver nanoparticles enclosed in multilayer polyelectrolyte films was deposited on copper pu et al 2016 applied biomimetic sharks skin prepared by elastomeric stamping using polydimethylsiloxane the anti fouling properties of the surface of biomimetic sharks skin with microstructures exceeded the smooth surface from the same polymers as the substrates used in addition it was found that the air layer fixed to the surface of the biomimetic sharks skin plays a key role in their antibiotic adhesion zhang b et al 2016 prepared structured superhydrophobic surfaces using one step electrodeposition the results showed that the synthetic surface demonstrates elevated corrosion resistance and biomass prevention li et al 2014 found good effects to counteract biological fouling on a nanohybrid coating capable of biomimetic modeling of the lotus microstructure sun et al 2018 manufactured sh surfaces with controlled periodic structures on aisi304 stainless steel plates using a picosecond laser and their anti fouling characteristics were investigated by immersion in seawater for five weeks in the summer samples with sh surface showed a significant effect against fouling compared to untreated stainless steel plates the results of many studies on the creation of sh surfaces are difficult to put into an industrial scale especially for use in shipbuilding it is known that in the main ship hulls are assembled from certain types of steel with appropriate physical characteristics therefore to protect such surfaces from biofouling it is possible to offer only sh coatings that are able to plant on the necessary material accordingly in the process of developing an anti fouling layer methods for applying and preparing the surface of the steel before deposition will be obtained then experiments on the fouling of such samples will have a greater practical value care must be taken to check the counteraction fouling of the resulting surface most authors analyze only the first settlements in the laboratory using artificial bacteria and sea water ekblad et al 2008 liu et al 2012 li et al 2014 it is not always possible to correctly predict the behavior of the protective layer in real sea conditions the set of bionts is original and depends on many factors the geographical location the time of year in which the test was performed the depth of the dive the temperature and salinity of the water the wind speed and consequently the magnitude of sea waves are just some of them if we add to the consideration of edge effects the shape and orientation of the samples in space then a certain range of tasks will emerge that need to be solved in order to advance the idea of using superhydrophobicity in shipbuilding uzun et al 2019 an urgent problem is the increase in the resistance of the hull of the vessel due to the roughness of the surface as a result of the growth of bacteria algae and seashells taylan 2010 reported an increase in resistance to 40 munk 2006 found that additional resistance due to contamination of the body and screw varies from 6 to 80 the surface roughness is the defining characteristic of many high reynolds number flows encountered in engineering characterizing the drag of a rough surface implies finding the velocity decrement caused by the frictional drag of the surface as a function of the roughness reynolds number this relationship is commonly known as a roughness function δu f k clauser 1956 hama 1954 and is unique for any particular surface roughness geometry once the roughness function for a given rough surface is known it can be used in a numerical analysis to predict the drag of any body covered with that roughness schultz m p 2003 three main methods for determining the drag coefficient can be distinguished flow in a pipe nikuradse 1933 colebrook and white 1937 flow in a boundary layer with a flat plate hama 1954 and a disk rotating in a fluid granville 1982 in addition there are attempts to develop methods for predicting the roughness function based on its height density shape and other parameters that are obtained experimentally access to ships is carried out using computational fluid dynamics computational fluid dynamics cfd has recently acquired significant interest and has become an important tool for studying the fouling effect and protection against fouling including in the seawater khor and xiao 2011 used the capabilities of the commercial fluent computational fluid dynamics package to study the fouling effect and antifouling on the lift and drag of marine devices with relatively simple geometry the simulation was performed for the aerodynamic profile of naca 4424 and the submarine hull of the defence research establishment atlantic drea the main attention was paid to the effect of fouling on flow separation surface pressure distribution and turbulent kinetic energy distribution surface roughness is quantitatively different in height and fouling density modeling showed that for the case of drea drag coefficient increases to 20 when using anti fouling coating the authors associated this increase with an increase in turbulence near the boundary layer for the case of drea demirel et al 2017 cfd modeling of the effect of roughness on the resistance and effective power of the kriso container ship full scale 3d hull was proposed the total drag coefficient of the full scale model was obtained at a vessel speed of 24 knots and compared with the drag coefficient extrapolated using the experiment it was shown that the total resistance coefficient was overestimated by 1 17 with a numerical uncertainty of 0 74 after this systematic researches were conducted by using the kriso container ship hull with the addition of a rudder with a smooth surface to conduct a grid sensitivity study and predict cfd uncertainties a completely nonlinear non stationary simulation for predicting the effect of a number of characteristic coating conditions and biological fouling conditions in the seawater on the friction resistance of a flat plate representing the kriso container ship and on the friction resistance residual wave and impedance and effective power were carried out at two speeds corresponding to the service speed and low speed steaming the predicted increase in the effective power of the full blown kcs hull was 18 1 for poor coverage or light mucus whereas due to strong mucus it was predicted to be 38 at a ship speed of 24 knots in addition it was noted that the wave resistance and consequently the viscosity have a significant effect on the impedance and wave systems owen et al 2017 investigated the detrimental effect of fouling on the performance of the propeller of the potsdam propeller using computational fluid dynamics cfd the initial stage of the study consisted of testing the approach of numerical simulation in open water by comparing the results with experimental values on a model scale for the well known example of comparative analysis the potsdam propeller test then the numerical model was modified to take into account the effects of biological fouling of varying degrees in order to analyze the effect on the characteristics of the screw the results then represent the effect that different levels of pollution have on the thrust and torque ratios and therefore the efficiency of using the propeller in open water at different feed ratios the results showed that with an increase in contamination of the screw surface the value of the screw traction coefficient decreases and the value of the torque coefficient increases this leads to a net decrease in the efficiency of using open water up to 30 at the highest simulated pollution level atencio and chernoray 2019 examined in detail the theory of the function of roughness as well as indirect methods for its determination resistance characterization and roughness function definition farkas et al 2018 models of the roughness function for biofilms were created based on experimental data presented in schultz et al 2015 using the modified wall function in commercial cfd software star ccm it was shown that evaluating the effect of a biofilm on the resistance of any arbitrary body is possible using only measurements of the height of the biofilm and the percentage of surface coverage with the biofilm song et al 2019 developed cfd models to imitate realistic surface roughness by using a roughness function model representing shell fouling and conducting a comprehensive study of the effect of shell roughness on the hydrodynamic characteristics of a vessel using the proposed cfd model an increase in the frictional resistance due to various fouling conditions was predicted and compared with the results obtained using the analysis of the boundary layer similarity law the effect of roughness on the wave profile the distribution of pressure along the body the distribution of velocity around the body and its trace is shown demirel et al 2019 proposed additional resistance diagrams based on the similarity law scaling procedure explained by schultz 2007 which allow predicting the effect of coating roughness and biofouling on the friction resistance of a vessel for various lengths and speeds a model for predicting the effect of biofouling on the resistance and power of a vessel is presented for daily assessment over time taking into account the profile of the vessel and the delivery route uzun et al 2019 the roughness functions for various surface conditions as well as the predicted equivalent roughness heights were used to scale the granville s similarity law to investigate the effect of roughness on the full scale resistance of the vessel further continuation of the use of cfd modeling for improvement the assessment of the effect of biofouling on the thrust characteristics of a ship with shells on the hull rudder and propeller surfaces is shown in song et al 2020 cfd modeling was carried out in various configurations of pollution degree and pollution scenarios it has been shown that fouling of the body increases the overall resistance coefficients up to 52 under the most severe conditions of surface contamination while the effect of propeller contamination on the values is negligible in general the models described in the literature only once again confirm the harmful effect of increased roughness due to pollution and fouling of the vessel and do not provide information on alternative solutions to reduce the effect of this phenomenon herein a quantitative assessment of the increase in resistance has a significant scatter of data depending on the modeling conditions the analysis of research status of sh surfaces made it possible to make the following generalizations 1 the prospects for the use of self cleaning surfaces as well as the results of studying the properties of sh surfaces and their biofouling obtained by various authors make further research relevant to the search for new coatings capable of counteracting fouling genzer and efimenko 2006 samaha et al 2012 ferrari and benedetti 2015 et al 2 the sh layer is obtained on various surfaces using expensive materials and rather complicated methods liu et al 2012 pu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 li et al 2014 and others which are difficult to massively apply in shipbuilding 3 biofouling has a strong influence on the dynamics of the vessel s movement in the aquatic environment taylan 2010 munk 2006 etc the study of which is important for navigation in many ways the questions posed concretize the main goals of research in this direction and determine the scientific novelty of the work based on the relevance of using sh surfaces the lack of information in the literature on the surface of shipbuilding steel in the marine environment we chose shipbuilding steel of the a40s brand on the surface of which the sh layer was first created using the rust oleum neverwet system performed an analysis of the influence of the sh state of the surface of shipbuilding steel samples on the dynamics of fouling and in contrast to previous works investigated the resistance to fouling obtained by the sh layer under actual operating conditions of the selected material using the goniometric method via the measurement of ca we examined the stages of sh coating degradation under the influence of the marine environment and its relationship with fouling over time 7 35 days established the relationship between the amount of surface wetting and the degree of fouling using optical observations and the calculation of the density and size of the detected biological species by the cfd simulation method an estimate was made of the decrease in the water flow rate over the surface of the sample depending on its roughness and degree of hydrophobicity the simulation is based on the obtained quantitative data on the measurement of ca and surface roughness caused by fouling and is concentrated on the flow details along the surface for all stages of the experiment the practical significance of the work lies in the fact that such studies contribute to the development of the application of sh surfaces as an anti fouling agent and a way to increase the streamlining of marine engineering mechanisms the materials and methods used by us will be described in more detail below 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples and contact angle measurement for carrying out an experiment to study the dynamics of biofouling in the natural environment shipbuilding steel of the brand a40s was chosen which has high strength and plasticity steel of this brand is intended for the manufacture of hulls or other welding structures of ships and floating structures samples of size 8 90 50 mm were used one large range remained untreated after rolling fig 1 a the reverse was pre sanded with a decrease in the grain size of the abrasive and its final mechanical polishing was carried out with a solution of chromium dioxide cr2o3 in pure kerosene until a mirror surface was reached fig 1 b the superhydrophobic layer was created on a polished surface with using the super hydrophobic system rust oleum neverwet this is a water repellent aerosol coating widely used in the study of sh properties gupta 2016 jiang et al 2017 rajaram et al 2016 sharifi et al 2019 it was applied to the steel plates in accordance with the instructions for its use the base layer containing methyl isobutyl ketone ch3coch2ch ch3 2 butyl acetate c6h12o2 and mineral spirits was first deposited on the sample surface by spraying in 2 3 passes from a distance of about 15 cm for 3 4 s after that the layer dried out under normal conditions created in the laboratory for 30 min then the deposition of the finish coating was carried out by spraying silica particles sio2 suspended in acetone from a cylinder with a suitable spray the surface was preserved for further drying under normal laboratory conditions for at least 12 h prior to the tests surface topography details were investigated using an optical profilometer wyko nt9080 bruker axs observation and photography of drops to determine contact angle ca was carried out on a designed installation which is shown in fig 1 c and according to a scheme similar to zhao t and jiang 2018 an optical source 1 is mounted on the optical bench to obtain coaxiality of the image which through the frosted glass 2 illuminates the drop 5 deposited on the sample 4 mounted on the holder 3 a collecting lens 6 and a digital camera canon eos 550d 7 paired with a computer 8 register a drop of water on the sh surface of the steel the image of the drop is captured after the optical zoom with the viewfinder in real time the inclined plane method elsherbini and jacobi 2006 is used to record measurements and capture images of incidence profiles immediately before the start of descent to determine the contact angle hysteresis the experiment used natural seawater which salinity was measured by the multifunctional instrument az86031 and amounted to 16 5 0 2 ppm the coefficient of surface tension was determined by the method of separation of the ring on a torsion balance and was equal to 74 5 0 8 mn m liquid was deposited on the sh surface by dripping from the tip with the formation of a drop of 10 μl in most cases in studies of droplets on sh surfaces an accurate analysis of ca is hampered by the distortion of their shape due to gravity the use of small droplets avoids the deformation of water droplets caused by gravity however due to the lack of proper wetting of the sh surface the placement of water droplets of less than 4 μl in volume causes difficulty zhang x at al 2004 to determine the optimal modes for observing a drop of sea water on the sh surface we performed an experiment ukolov a i and popova t n 2018 in which a 10 μl drop of sea water was placed on the sample and ca was measured periodically during evaporation under ambient conditions despite the increase in salt concentration due to the evaporation of water ca at the initial stage increases 150 θ 168 reaching its maximum for a volume of 0 5 μl the minimum deviation from the spherical shape coincides with the beginning of the active process of salt crystallization in the drop volume this evaporation stage already corresponds to a teardrop shaped distortion and makes it difficult to measure ca a similar technique was used in these measurements with further evaporation photographing was carried out until a droplet reached a volume of 3 μl this made it possible to reduce the shape deformation due to gravity and did not distort the measurements associated with the onset of the crystallization process 2 2 immersion of samples in sea water and observation of biofouling the experiment was carried out for three months august october in the kerch strait 45 16ʹ15 0ʺ n 36 25ʹ18 0ʺ e samples were mounted on a special holder fig 1 d installed on the quay and immersed in sea water in august at a depth of more than 1 m 15 steel plates were used for the whole experiment the distance between the rows is 30 cm one side of all the plates was covered with a superhydrophobic layer the reverse side remained unprocessed after rolling contact angle measurements optical observations and fouling samples for biological analysis were performed every seven days after the start of the experiment weather conditions were recorded daily at the same time at 12 00 throughout the entire period of the experiment the air temperature 25 4 32 3 c and water 23 9 26 4 c remained fairly stable the wind speed had its maximum of august 9 11 10 12 m s with its average value of 6 48 m s during the entire observation period detailed information on the composition of the fouling layer made it possible to obtain microscopic studies performed using a zoom szm 45t2 stereomicroscope and its associated digital camera for microscope dcm130 digital camera the size of attached microorganisms was estimated optically by the difference in the stroke of the micrometer screw by sequentially focusing the lens on different parts of the thallus the surface area of the fouling was determined graphically by applying a millimeter grid to the image and by calculating the ratio of the nodes that fell into the populated and clean areas when sampling for biological analysis the samples were placed in a container of water to avoid the loss of organisms in the laboratory organisms were washed off with water in a sorting sieve and larger attached forms were removed from the surface with tweezers samples were disassembled no more than 3 h later when observing part of the mixture with organisms in a petri dish at 8 fold magnification selected organisms with tweezers were placed in a test tube with 4 formalin solution the analyzed sample was sorted into systematic groups up to families the number of organisms of this species was determined by direct counting of individuals in the sample 2 3 numerical modeling in this paper the evaluation of the effect of wetting and adhesion of the surface on the flow velocity along the sample plane was made using the capabilities of mathematical modeling of hydrodynamic processes using the ansys fluent finite element package the basis for solving the standard equations of mass conservation 4 ρ t ρ υ s m where s m additional mass ρ the density averaged ov er the volume υ the flow velocity and impulse 5 t ρ υ ρ υ υ p τ ρ g f where p static pressure τ stress tensor ρ g gravitational force and f external forces to include the effect of surface tension along the interface between each pair of phases the volume of fluid vof model is used which can be supplemented by the values of contact angles between the phases as well as an indication of the surface tension coefficient as a constant the continuum surface force csf model proposed by brackbill et al 1992 implemented by adding surface tension to the calculation vof in ansys fluent a formulation of the csf model is used where the surface curvature is computed from local gradients in the surface normal at the interface let n be the surface normal defined as the gradient of α q the volume fraction of the qth phase 6 n α q the curvature k is defined in terms of the divergence of the unit normal n ˆ 7 k n ˆ where 8 n ˆ n n the surface tension can be written in terms of the pressure jump across the surface the force at the surface can be expressed as a volume force using the divergence theorem it is this volume force that is the source term that is added to the momentum equation it has the following form 9 f v o l p a i r s i j σ i j α i ρ i k j α j α j ρ j k i α i 1 2 ρ i ρ j this expression allows for a smooth superposition of forces near cells where more than two phases are present if only two phases are present in a cell then k i k j and α i α j and equation 9 simplifies to 10 f v o l σ i j ρ k i α j 1 2 ρ ρ j together with the surface tension in the model used option wall adhesion rather than impose this boundary condition at the wall itself the contact angle that the fluid is assumed to make with the wall is used to adjust the surface normal in cells near the wall this so called dynamic boundary condition results in the adjustment of the curvature of the surface near the wall if θ is the contact angle at the wall then the surface normal at the live cell next to the wall is 11 n ˆ n w ˆ c o s θ t w ˆ s i n θ where n w ˆ and t w ˆ are the unit vectors normal and tangential to the wall respectively the combination of this contact angle with the normally calculated surface normal one cell away from the wall determine the local curvature of the surface and this curvature is used to adjust the body force term in the surface tension calculation the geometry of the model fig 2 is constructed using the designmodeler option with wall dimensions corresponding to the real sample the generated grid with the number of cells 3 6 million had a condensation on the plane of the wall with a further decrease in the cell the scatter of results did not exceed 1 transition sst turbulence model is selected liquid is water boundary conditions inlet velocity ν 0 10 m s turbulence

specified under the boundary conditions wall when using standard and nonequilibrium wall functions in the option group wall roughness the values are set to roughness height rh absolute roughness height and roughness constant rc the roughness height is set in meters and in this work varied from 10 4 to 3 10 3 m from the roughness height of the sh layer to the maximum size of biofouling during the experiment the value of the roughness constant in fluent is determined by the type of wall roughness the set value rc 0 5 corresponds to a close packed uniform sand roughness the performed cfd simulation consisted in calculating the average velocity of the sublayers of a fluid flow with a thickness of 5 10 3 m moving along a rough wall in the direction of the x axis in fig 2 the ratio of the initial velocity at the plate inlet to the final ν 0 ν was determined for a sublayer located at a distance from the surface equal to the roughness height z 0 1 mm 3 mm 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface wettability compliance with all the deposition conditions of the coating made it possible to obtain an sh layer on the surface of the shipbuilding steel of the a40s grade which was confirmed by measuring the contact angle θ fig 3 a shows a drop on the sh surface with ca θ 151 the results of optical profilometry are shown in fig 4 the polished surface is coated with a hydrophobic coating material clustering agglomeration of particles presented in the solution leads to the formation of roughness the arithmetic mean of the profile deviation is ra 11 36 μm and the total height rt 127 59 μm fig 4 a a typical cross section roughness profile traced by an optical profilometer over the entire surface is shown in fig 4 b microscopic hemispherical protrusions provide the necessary roughness for the appearance of non wetting effect the stability of the state which is described by the cassie baxter model is determined by the ratio of the size of surface protrusions to the size of droplets that interact with the substrate bushan et al 2009 the transition from the cassie baxter state to the wenzel state will be carried out in the case when the maximum sagging depth δ of a drop of radius r described by the laplace equation is greater than the height of the surface roughness h which can be expressed by the inequality 12 δ p 2 d 2 r h where h is the height of the protrusions d is the diameter of the base p is the distance between them δ is the maximum sagging depth of the drop according to the measurements made for the sh layer used in the paper h 0 1 mm d 0 1 mm p 0 05 mm the ratio h δ 72 in this state the liquid lies on top of the structured surface above the gas layer this gas gap is an effective medium that provides a drop slip at the liquid gas interface the measured contact angle hysteresis is found to be 7 4 confirmed sh coatings observation of the evaporation of a drop of seawater shown in fig 3 and helped to reduce its deviation from a spherical shape the contact angle was determined θ 168 at a droplet volume of 0 5 μl this is the maximum result that we were able to get when using neverwet on shipbuilding steel the problem with the use of sh coatings is the stability of the cassie baxter state with increasing hydrostatic pressure pcrit the pcrit value can vary from 0 2 to 38 6 kpa depending on the method of manufacturing the sh coating and the research method zheng et al 2005 amrei and tafreshi 2015 xue et al 2017 forsberg et al 2011 liravi et al 2020 the analytical critical pressure formula for superhydrophobic surfaces consisting of orderedly packed spherical particles according to emami et al 2011 is based on the balance of forces for the meniscus surrounding this particle 13 p l s 2 π d s 2 4 sin 2 α π σ d s sin α cos 3 π 2 θ α where d s is the diameter of the sphere and l s is the distance from the center to the center to the center between two adjacent spheres α is the angle characterizing the height at which the meniscus

coatings consisting of randomly distributed particles a numerical method based on complete morphology is used emami et al 2011 the fundamental principle of the method is that at a given capillary pressure p cr the pore space available for the non wettable phase is determined by the pore size 15 p c r 2 σ cos π θ r c r our mathematical estimates of the critical pressure according to 14 and 15 based on the results of optical profilometry showed the presence of a boundary state for ds 2 10 μm and ls 6 10 μm and contact angles θ 150 168 if σ 74 5 mn m we obtained the interval p cr 8 25 kpa which coincides with the pressure in the natural experiment 10 13 kpa to clarify the situation we observed the state of the air layer during the gradual immersion of the sample in water fig 5 a shows the initial state of a fragment of an underwater air gap hydrostatic pressure 30 pa the observation surface is uniformly covered with gas formations which can combine increasing in size fig 5 a insert moves under wave action continued immersion does not visually affect gas bubbles in the center of the steel plate however we noticed that the wetting process begins exclusively at the edge of the sample fig 5 b that is the mechanism of transition from the cassie baxter state to wenzel is performed not by lowering the meniscus level between the protrusions of the sh layer but by blotting the relief with water from the boundary of the solid with the liquid immersion of the sample at the experimental depth increases the region of water penetration fig 5 c however this process stops 10 15 of the surface at the edges of the plate is wetted naturally our observations are subjective in nature since such a behavior of the gas layer depends on the shape size material of the sample and the method of creating the sh layer under the conditions of the chosen experimental procedure the air layer was partially preserved during immersion and movement of the liquid near the sample it was stable until the beginning of the first settlements and the degradation of the sh layer as a result of being under water for 7 days the contact angle decreases and on average reaches the value θ 135 fig 3 b and for different sides of the drop the spread could be up to 10 the active action of wave processes flushes silica particles from the polymer matrix unevenly accordingly various conditions arise at the points of contact between the liquid and the solid for this reason the measured hysteresis of the contact angle had a strong scatter depending on the slip region of the drop and was determined in the range of 24 60 after 14 days fig 3 c ca filed up to θ 130 however the spread between measurements for different sides of the drop was reduced to 1 after 21 days underwater ca θ 121 fig 3 d is also with slight deviations the time interval of 28 days fig 3 e coincides with the transition to the hydrophilic state ca again receives a strong dependence on the location of the drop and is in the range 105 θ 88 apparently this time interval corresponds to the beginning of the destruction of the coating and the appearance of sections of the natural surface of the steel at the final stage after 35 days fig 3 f the state is completely hydrophilic 76 θ 66 and the spread of the contact angle value is associated with the asperities of the sample surface itself the measurement of the hysteresis of the contact angle in the hydrophilic state caused difficulties associated with the surface features with biofouling the settled biofouling during this period of time not only is wetted by water but absorb it forcing the contact line to behave unnaturally and immediately distorting the shape of the droplet when sliding 3 2 monitoring of biofouling surface fouling for the first 14 days at θ 130 fig 3 b d was absent or easily washed off by the flow of sea water after a longer stay under water 21 days the experimental plates are covered with green algae the fouling density is the same for the sh layer and the reverse unprotected surface of the sample but algae are characterized by a lower thallus height on the super hydrophobic coating fig 6 to settle larvae of aquatic organisms and algal spores on a new substrate the formation of a bacterial film on its surface is necessary the bacterial layer forms more quickly on a hydrophilic natural after rolling surface than on a superhydrophobic one that is the larvae spores of fouling agents interact faster with surfaces that have a large surface energy respectively settle on them earlier and have a larger size after 28 days fouling of bulanus balanidae chthamalus stellatus with a size of 1 3 mm and a density of 0 5 ind cm2 over the entire surface of the sample fig 7 is present on the back untreated sh layer there are also single serpules serpula vermicularis about 7 mm long after 35 days the samples were found under water on a natural surface after rolling there are fouling agents of the following groups bowery crustaceans balanidae chthamalus stellatus sitting polychaetians serpula vermicularis bryozoans bryozoa and sponges porifera on the sh surface fig 8 there is no balyanus even after 35 days of testing taking into account the fact that overgrowing of the bulbous is characterized by a significant adhesion force which is the main influence on the hydrodynamics of the vessel one can judge about the significant advantage of the sh coating over the entire surface one individual is serpula with a tube size of 10 mm 90 of the surface is covered with bryozoa and algae with a thallus size less than 1 mm fig 8 in this case the algae cover only the zone filled with bryozoa using them as a substrate for attachment algae are absent in areas without them repetition of the experiment in the period from september to october gave similar results for the degradation of the sh layer in the marine environment and the same gradual decrease in the contact angle wear sh coating depends on weather conditions which determine the amount of sea waves as it turned out the main damage to the structure of the sh surface is caused by particles of sand and other impurities suspended in sea water which act as a natural abrasive at the initial stage when the roughness of the layer is maximum small sand granules get stuck between the projections sh of the coating clogging it up as in fig 6 this is mainly a consequence of the experiment close to the coastal strip or at a depth not large enough however this phenomenon should be taken into account when testing for wear developed sh coatings for use in marine environments when quantifying the dynamics of fouling expressed as a relative change in the average density of biofouling per unit area the initial state of the surface is taken as the zero level as the samples are under water the area of the fouling layer increases until the surface is completely covered taken as 100 the results of calculating the average density of fouling and relative error are given in the table for all stages of the experiment season the duration of the experiment days 1 14 21 28 35 august september 17 5 3 30 3 78 3 90 5 september october 6 1 5 13 2 42 2 64 3 fouling in the colder time of the year was delayed in comparison with the summer autumn period and the first appearance of the notable biological species described above arose later after the loss of hydrophobic surface properties 3 3 results numerical simulation the results of the native experiment described above helped to identify the stages of changing the wetting properties of the surface and its relief due to biofouling each state determines the kinetics of the flow of the liquid layer near the wall of the sample on fig 8 shows the results of modeling the flow of water along the plate surface with an initial inlet velocity ν 0 10 m s fig 2 the contact angle θ 151 and the roughness height rh 0 1 mm correspond to the wetting and relief of the sh layer before testing under water roughness constant was 0 5 for all calculations the flow velocity was determined along the larger side of the sample coordinate x for various distances z from the plane of the rough wall fig 2 thus the energy loss in the liquid sublayer to overcome the friction forces along the length of the flow stream is analyzed velocity ν undergoes the most noticeable changes at the initial stage x 0 04 m of interaction with the plate wall the layers close to the surface z 0 1 mm experience maximum drag their velocity decreases from ν 0 10 m s at the input to ν 5 5 m s at the end of the sample x 0 09 m with increasing distance from the rough wall z 0 9 mm the velocity from ν 0 10 m s decreases at the exit to 8 6 m s to identify the relationship between the wetting value expressed by the contact angle and the loss of velocity dependences similar to fig 9 were obtained for all experimental experiments θ 135 130 121 90 70 the value of rh did not change and was equal in all models to 0 1 mm the results of the final velocity ν depending on ca for z 0 1 mm are shown in the table θ 151 135 130 121 90 70 ν m s 5 459 5 457 5 454 5 451 3 786 3 766 numerical modeling revealed a clear boundary between the flow resistance between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface properties for the hydrophobic state the ratio ν 0 ν 1 8 after the transition to the hydrophobic state ν 0 ν 2 6 this phenomenon should manifest itself in the real interaction of a liquid and a solid it can be explained by the occurrence of slippage due to a lower adhesion force with a hydrophobic surface molecular slippage is based on the assumption that liquid molecules directly slide over a solid surface calculations barrat and bocquet 1999a b using the nonequilibrium molecular dynamics method showed that for a sufficiently large contact angle the microscopic boundary conditions differ from the sticking conditions the theory predicts a slip length of about 30 molecular diameters starting at θ 140 another model associates slippage with a decrease in the viscosity of the boundary layer of a fluid near a hydrophobic surface vinogradova o i 1995 vinogradova o i 1999 if the viscosity of the boundary layer can be characterized by an average value of ηs then the order of magnitude of the slip length b can be estimated as 16 b δ η b η s 1 where δ is the thickness of the layer with altered viscosity and ηb is the bulk viscosity b 0 corresponds to sticking conditions b corresponds to the condition of the absence of viscous friction at the liquid gas interface the next step in the numerical calculation we repeated the changes in the wetting of the surface and its relief observed when in the marine environment the simulation result of a simultaneous increase in the contact angle of ca and the roughness height rh of the surface are shown in fig 10 as in the case of the layer by layer analysis of the fluid flow along a rough wall described above the main attention is paid to the change in the flow velocity depending on the distance x the velocity distribution along the surface ν f x depending on the roughness height was calculated for the initial stage θ 151 rh 0 1 mm and for the subsequent stages of degradation of the superhydrophobic layer taking into account the size of the fouling appearing θ 121 rh 0 5 mm θ 90 rh 1 mm θ 70 rh 3 mm fig 10 the calculation was performed for a liquid sublayer located at a distance z 3 mm fig 2 from the surface this value cannot be set less than the roughness height which was determined by the size of the fouling obtained after 35 days of testing the initial velocity at the front edge of the plate ν 0 10 m s varied along the entire length of the model 90 mm for all the considered conditions given by the wall the dependence ν f x had an extremum in the first stage of the flow turbulent flow can be represented as a spectrum of vortices of various scales the largest eddies are determined by a scale commensurate with the geometry for example the thickness of the boundary layer vortices of this order at the initial stage of vortex formation receive kinetic energy from the average flow which leads to an increase in speed further the kinetic energy of large vortices is transmitted to smaller scale vortices which interact with them for small vortices viscous friction forces become significant and kinetic energy dissipates into the internal one the vortex formation region for rh 0 1 1 mm has the same characteristic size 0 03 m the transition to the hydrophilic state θ 70 and rh 3 mm leads to an increase in the vortex formation region which is 0 04 m however the maximum turbulent flow velocity remains constant for rh in the range of 0 5 3 mm it should be noted that a noticeable difference in the nature of the flow for rh 0 5 mm is observed only at the initial stage of interaction with a solid surface the resulting decrease in speed under the selected conditions is shown in the table θ 151 135 130 121 90 70 rh mm 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 5 1 3 ν m s 8 84 8 84 8 84 8 37 8 20 8 15 prior to the appearance of the first fouling the surface roughness did not change and the final flow rate at z 3 mm differed for different ca s in the 10 000th digit number therefore the results of the velocity distribution at θ 151 130 practically coincide and are presented on the graph ν f x of one curve fig 10 an increase in the roughness after the appearance of fouling and a decrease in ca θ 121 70 due to the degradation of the sh layer leads to an increase in the ratio ν 0 ν 1 19 1 22 respectively 4 conclusions while researching the wetting effect of shipbuilding steel on its fouling in natural marine conditions showed that for a surface with a contact angle of up to 130 there is effective protection against the attachment of the first bacteria and larvae however the weather conditions contributing to the appearance of storm winds during the test period accelerated the degradation of the superhydrophobic layer which led to an increase in the rate of surface fouling after 35 days there were found single serpules serpula vermicularis bryozoa bryozoa and green algae chlorophyta with a thallus 1 3 mm however the density and size of the fouling was lower than on the side after testing on which during this time period barnacle crustaceans c stellatus and sponges porifera were added the absence of balianus c stellatus is a significant positive effect of the presence of the sh layer this species is one of the most common and difficult to remove fouling from the hull as a variety of barnacle crayfish balyanus has a hard calcareous shell that is fixed to the substrate using a special substance to settle animal larvae and algal spores on a new substrate the formation of a bacterial film on its surface is necessary the bacterial layer forms more quickly on the hydrophilic natural surface of the steel than on the superhydrophobic one thus a certain period is observed on the sh surface after which the first settlements of attached living beings appear creating a substrate for the next fouling layer the duration of this period depends on how long the surface retains its hydrophobic properties at the level of θ 130 to obtain quantitative data for the fluid flow we simulated all the situations that we observed at the stages of the native experiment a decrease in the flow velocity along the surface is a characteristic that indirectly determines the magnitude of the resistance force the nature of the fluid flow in the boundary layer of the rectangular plate model located along the stream and streamlined at a certain speed corresponds to the regime inherent in the real movement of the vessel the result of numerical modeling showed that the transition from the hydrophilic state to the hydrophobic state reduces the surface resistance by 1 44 times changes in velocity ν 0 ν 2 6 hydrophilic ν 0 ν 1 8 hydrophobic an increase in surface roughness due to fouling will further increase the velocity ratio by 1 19 1 22 times these relations obtained at the initial stage distance 9 cm of fluid flow along the surface introduce the main difference between the two states since the decrease in velocity slows down with increasing flow length of course we understand that the numbers of the ratio of speeds will vary depending on the thickness of the liquid layer on the distribution of fouling on the surface on the magnitude of the initial velocity and other factors however the general pattern remains the coating providing a contact angle 130 at the same time reduces the friction resistance and prevents the attachment of the first fouling settlements which further improves the flow around the material due to the absence of roughness growth the main problem for large scale tests of sh coatings in the marine environment remains their weak resistance to mechanical wear the strength of the neverwet layer is on average comparable to the mechanical properties of most sh coatings known in the literature thus for the experiment we have 20 30 days which does not meet the time requirements for the devices used in the marine industry funding this

21614,the dependence of the degree of biofouling on the magnitude of the contact angle θ during temporary degradation of the superhydrophobic coating of shipbuilding steel a40s in the process of being under water is examined the experiment showed that the gas gap between the liquid and the structured surface makes it difficult for the first settlements to appear at θ 130 in 35 days of being underwater and losing the hydrophobic properties of the coating there were discovered the serpules serpula vermicularis bryozoans bryozoa and green algae chlorophyta but there is no balanus balanidae chthamalus stellatus and sponges porifera which are observed on the untreated opposite sample side the results of an in vivo experiment were used to cfd the dependence of water s flow velocity along the plate surface numerical calculation was determined the ratio of the initial flow velocity rate to its value at the end of the model plates the transition from the hydrophilic state to the hydrophobic state reduces the value of the surface resistance by 1 44 times changes in the velocity ν0 ν 2 6 are hydrophilic ν0 ν 1 8 hydrophobic an increase in surface roughness due to fouling will further increase the speed ratio by another 1 19 1 22 times keywords superhydrophobicity contact angle fouling shipbuilding steel roughness cfd 1 introduction with the long term presence of structural materials under water their surfaces are subject to biological fouling which causes significant damage to the functioning of the equipment periodically in the literature there are works with an assessment of the economic damage associated with violations of the functions of the mechanisms used in the marine environment due to biofouling hellio and yebra 2009 milosavljevic and heikkilä 2001 pimentel et al 2000 vedaprakash et al 2013 most significantly this problem manifests itself in shipping especially if the vessel is operated in warm the seas self polishing tributyltin copolymers c4h9 3sn are effective in protecting the surface from fouling evans 1999 but these substances are toxins however despite all the modifications of this method environmental losses that are palpable throughout the world limited the use of tributyl tin until its final ban in 2008 gipperth 2009 at the same time attempts to avoid the use of poisonous biocides in coatings of surfaces interacting with an aqueous medium lead to a deterioration of the anti fouling properties of the surface and reduce the interdock maintenance period one of the fields of development of protective coatings that do not contain biocides is the search and use of materials with low surface energy zhao q et al 2004 chen et al 2017 lei et al 2018 the decrease in the wettability of such surfaces leads to a weak attachment of the first settlements of spores larvae algae which are washed out under the influence of water flow the quantitative characteristic of wettability is the contact angle θ ca it is defined as the angle between the tangent at the triple point of the interface and the solid surface droplet angle θ is related to interphase energies acting between the boundaries of the solid liquid interface γ sl surface energy solid vapor γ sv and liquid vapor energy γ lv by 1 c o s θ γ s v γ s l γ l v from 1 it follows that the lower the surface energy the greater the contact angle and the less wettability of a solid if the contact angle θ 90 the surface has hydrophilic properties θ 90 corresponds to the hydrophobic interaction an increase in ca to θ 150 indicates a transition to the superhydrophobic sh state the wettability properties of a solid surface can be interpreted using wenzel and cassie baxter models that take into account surface roughness assuming that the fluid fills the space between the protrusions on the surface the wenzel approach correlates with the apparent contact angle θ and the thermodynamic contact angle θ as 2 cos θ r cos θ where r roughness coefficient the ratio between the true surface area and its horizontal projection cassie and baxter presented the idea that a surface traps air in hollow roughness spaces interpreting the apparent contact angle θ as 3 cos θ f l s cos θ f l v where f ls the fraction of the area of liquid in contact with a solid f lv is the fraction of the area of liquid in contact with trapped air another indicator of superhydrophobicity is the difference between upcoming θ adv and back angles θ res contact angle hysteresis with greater hysteresis the droplets will be considered to belong to the wenzel solution which enters the roughness whereas the sh state is characterized by small hysteresis values θ adv θ res 10 and the surface can be considered as a columnar structure with a large roughness coefficient supporting the fluid and decreasing the available area the described properties of superhydrophobic coatings as well as the phenomenon of superhydrophobicity can be used to design self cleaning and anti fouling surfaces with minimal viscous resistance genzer and efimenko 2006 samaha et al 2012 ferrari and benedetti 2015 in general studies of the effect of wettability on the degree of fouling are accompanied by the presentation of a new method for producing an sh surface liu et al 2012 in order to prevent bacterial adhesion a super hydrophobic coating consisting of silver nanoparticles enclosed in multilayer polyelectrolyte films was deposited on copper pu et al 2016 applied biomimetic sharks skin prepared by elastomeric stamping using polydimethylsiloxane the anti fouling properties of the surface of biomimetic sharks skin with microstructures exceeded the smooth surface from the same polymers as the substrates used in addition it was found that the air layer fixed to the surface of the biomimetic sharks skin plays a key role in their antibiotic adhesion zhang b et al 2016 prepared structured superhydrophobic surfaces using one step electrodeposition the results showed that the synthetic surface demonstrates elevated corrosion resistance and biomass prevention li et al 2014 found good effects to counteract biological fouling on a nanohybrid coating capable of biomimetic modeling of the lotus microstructure sun et al 2018 manufactured sh surfaces with controlled periodic structures on aisi304 stainless steel plates using a picosecond laser and their anti fouling characteristics were investigated by immersion in seawater for five weeks in the summer samples with sh surface showed a significant effect against fouling compared to untreated stainless steel plates the results of many studies on the creation of sh surfaces are difficult to put into an industrial scale especially for use in shipbuilding it is known that in the main ship hulls are assembled from certain types of steel with appropriate physical characteristics therefore to protect such surfaces from biofouling it is possible to offer only sh coatings that are able to plant on the necessary material accordingly in the process of developing an anti fouling layer methods for applying and preparing the surface of the steel before deposition will be obtained then experiments on the fouling of such samples will have a greater practical value care must be taken to check the counteraction fouling of the resulting surface most authors analyze only the first settlements in the laboratory using artificial bacteria and sea water ekblad et al 2008 liu et al 2012 li et al 2014 it is not always possible to correctly predict the behavior of the protective layer in real sea conditions the set of bionts is original and depends on many factors the geographical location the time of year in which the test was performed the depth of the dive the temperature and salinity of the water the wind speed and consequently the magnitude of sea waves are just some of them if we add to the consideration of edge effects the shape and orientation of the samples in space then a certain range of tasks will emerge that need to be solved in order to advance the idea of using superhydrophobicity in shipbuilding uzun et al 2019 an urgent problem is the increase in the resistance of the hull of the vessel due to the roughness of the surface as a result of the growth of bacteria algae and seashells taylan 2010 reported an increase in resistance to 40 munk 2006 found that additional resistance due to contamination of the body and screw varies from 6 to 80 the surface roughness is the defining characteristic of many high reynolds number flows encountered in engineering characterizing the drag of a rough surface implies finding the velocity decrement caused by the frictional drag of the surface as a function of the roughness reynolds number this relationship is commonly known as a roughness function δu f k clauser 1956 hama 1954 and is unique for any particular surface roughness geometry once the roughness function for a given rough surface is known it can be used in a numerical analysis to predict the drag of any body covered with that roughness schultz m p 2003 three main methods for determining the drag coefficient can be distinguished flow in a pipe nikuradse 1933 colebrook and white 1937 flow in a boundary layer with a flat plate hama 1954 and a disk rotating in a fluid granville 1982 in addition there are attempts to develop methods for predicting the roughness function based on its height density shape and other parameters that are obtained experimentally access to ships is carried out using computational fluid dynamics computational fluid dynamics cfd has recently acquired significant interest and has become an important tool for studying the fouling effect and protection against fouling including in the seawater khor and xiao 2011 used the capabilities of the commercial fluent computational fluid dynamics package to study the fouling effect and antifouling on the lift and drag of marine devices with relatively simple geometry the simulation was performed for the aerodynamic profile of naca 4424 and the submarine hull of the defence research establishment atlantic drea the main attention was paid to the effect of fouling on flow separation surface pressure distribution and turbulent kinetic energy distribution surface roughness is quantitatively different in height and fouling density modeling showed that for the case of drea drag coefficient increases to 20 when using anti fouling coating the authors associated this increase with an increase in turbulence near the boundary layer for the case of drea demirel et al 2017 cfd modeling of the effect of roughness on the resistance and effective power of the kriso container ship full scale 3d hull was proposed the total drag coefficient of the full scale model was obtained at a vessel speed of 24 knots and compared with the drag coefficient extrapolated using the experiment it was shown that the total resistance coefficient was overestimated by 1 17 with a numerical uncertainty of 0 74 after this systematic researches were conducted by using the kriso container ship hull with the addition of a rudder with a smooth surface to conduct a grid sensitivity study and predict cfd uncertainties a completely nonlinear non stationary simulation for predicting the effect of a number of characteristic coating conditions and biological fouling conditions in the seawater on the friction resistance of a flat plate representing the kriso container ship and on the friction resistance residual wave and impedance and effective power were carried out at two speeds corresponding to the service speed and low speed steaming the predicted increase in the effective power of the full blown kcs hull was 18 1 for poor coverage or light mucus whereas due to strong mucus it was predicted to be 38 at a ship speed of 24 knots in addition it was noted that the wave resistance and consequently the viscosity have a significant effect on the impedance and wave systems owen et al 2017 investigated the detrimental effect of fouling on the performance of the propeller of the potsdam propeller using computational fluid dynamics cfd the initial stage of the study consisted of testing the approach of numerical simulation in open water by comparing the results with experimental values on a model scale for the well known example of comparative analysis the potsdam propeller test then the numerical model was modified to take into account the effects of biological fouling of varying degrees in order to analyze the effect on the characteristics of the screw the results then represent the effect that different levels of pollution have on the thrust and torque ratios and therefore the efficiency of using the propeller in open water at different feed ratios the results showed that with an increase in contamination of the screw surface the value of the screw traction coefficient decreases and the value of the torque coefficient increases this leads to a net decrease in the efficiency of using open water up to 30 at the highest simulated pollution level atencio and chernoray 2019 examined in detail the theory of the function of roughness as well as indirect methods for its determination resistance characterization and roughness function definition farkas et al 2018 models of the roughness function for biofilms were created based on experimental data presented in schultz et al 2015 using the modified wall function in commercial cfd software star ccm it was shown that evaluating the effect of a biofilm on the resistance of any arbitrary body is possible using only measurements of the height of the biofilm and the percentage of surface coverage with the biofilm song et al 2019 developed cfd models to imitate realistic surface roughness by using a roughness function model representing shell fouling and conducting a comprehensive study of the effect of shell roughness on the hydrodynamic characteristics of a vessel using the proposed cfd model an increase in the frictional resistance due to various fouling conditions was predicted and compared with the results obtained using the analysis of the boundary layer similarity law the effect of roughness on the wave profile the distribution of pressure along the body the distribution of velocity around the body and its trace is shown demirel et al 2019 proposed additional resistance diagrams based on the similarity law scaling procedure explained by schultz 2007 which allow predicting the effect of coating roughness and biofouling on the friction resistance of a vessel for various lengths and speeds a model for predicting the effect of biofouling on the resistance and power of a vessel is presented for daily assessment over time taking into account the profile of the vessel and the delivery route uzun et al 2019 the roughness functions for various surface conditions as well as the predicted equivalent roughness heights were used to scale the granville s similarity law to investigate the effect of roughness on the full scale resistance of the vessel further continuation of the use of cfd modeling for improvement the assessment of the effect of biofouling on the thrust characteristics of a ship with shells on the hull rudder and propeller surfaces is shown in song et al 2020 cfd modeling was carried out in various configurations of pollution degree and pollution scenarios it has been shown that fouling of the body increases the overall resistance coefficients up to 52 under the most severe conditions of surface contamination while the effect of propeller contamination on the values is negligible in general the models described in the literature only once again confirm the harmful effect of increased roughness due to pollution and fouling of the vessel and do not provide information on alternative solutions to reduce the effect of this phenomenon herein a quantitative assessment of the increase in resistance has a significant scatter of data depending on the modeling conditions the analysis of research status of sh surfaces made it possible to make the following generalizations 1 the prospects for the use of self cleaning surfaces as well as the results of studying the properties of sh surfaces and their biofouling obtained by various authors make further research relevant to the search for new coatings capable of counteracting fouling genzer and efimenko 2006 samaha et al 2012 ferrari and benedetti 2015 et al 2 the sh layer is obtained on various surfaces using expensive materials and rather complicated methods liu et al 2012 pu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 li et al 2014 and others which are difficult to massively apply in shipbuilding 3 biofouling has a strong influence on the dynamics of the vessel s movement in the aquatic environment taylan 2010 munk 2006 etc the study of which is important for navigation in many ways the questions posed concretize the main goals of research in this direction and determine the scientific novelty of the work based on the relevance of using sh surfaces the lack of information in the literature on the surface of shipbuilding steel in the marine environment we chose shipbuilding steel of the a40s brand on the surface of which the sh layer was first created using the rust oleum neverwet system performed an analysis of the influence of the sh state of the surface of shipbuilding steel samples on the dynamics of fouling and in contrast to previous works investigated the resistance to fouling obtained by the sh layer under actual operating conditions of the selected material using the goniometric method via the measurement of ca we examined the stages of sh coating degradation under the influence of the marine environment and its relationship with fouling over time 7 35 days established the relationship between the amount of surface wetting and the degree of fouling using optical observations and the calculation of the density and size of the detected biological species by the cfd simulation method an estimate was made of the decrease in the water flow rate over the surface of the sample depending on its roughness and degree of hydrophobicity the simulation is based on the obtained quantitative data on the measurement of ca and surface roughness caused by fouling and is concentrated on the flow details along the surface for all stages of the experiment the practical significance of the work lies in the fact that such studies contribute to the development of the application of sh surfaces as an anti fouling agent and a way to increase the streamlining of marine engineering mechanisms the materials and methods used by us will be described in more detail below 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples and contact angle measurement for carrying out an experiment to study the dynamics of biofouling in the natural environment shipbuilding steel of the brand a40s was chosen which has high strength and plasticity steel of this brand is intended for the manufacture of hulls or other welding structures of ships and floating structures samples of size 8 90 50 mm were used one large range remained untreated after rolling fig 1 a the reverse was pre sanded with a decrease in the grain size of the abrasive and its final mechanical polishing was carried out with a solution of chromium dioxide cr2o3 in pure kerosene until a mirror surface was reached fig 1 b the superhydrophobic layer was created on a polished surface with using the super hydrophobic system rust oleum neverwet this is a water repellent aerosol coating widely used in the study of sh properties gupta 2016 jiang et al 2017 rajaram et al 2016 sharifi et al 2019 it was applied to the steel plates in accordance with the instructions for its use the base layer containing methyl isobutyl ketone ch3coch2ch ch3 2 butyl acetate c6h12o2 and mineral spirits was first deposited on the sample surface by spraying in 2 3 passes from a distance of about 15 cm for 3 4 s after that the layer dried out under normal conditions created in the laboratory for 30 min then the deposition of the finish coating was carried out by spraying silica particles sio2 suspended in acetone from a cylinder with a suitable spray the surface was preserved for further drying under normal laboratory conditions for at least 12 h prior to the tests surface topography details were investigated using an optical profilometer wyko nt9080 bruker axs observation and photography of drops to determine contact angle ca was carried out on a designed installation which is shown in fig 1 c and according to a scheme similar to zhao t and jiang 2018 an optical source 1 is mounted on the optical bench to obtain coaxiality of the image which through the frosted glass 2 illuminates the drop 5 deposited on the sample 4 mounted on the holder 3 a collecting lens 6 and a digital camera canon eos 550d 7 paired with a computer 8 register a drop of water on the sh surface of the steel the image of the drop is captured after the optical zoom with the viewfinder in real time the inclined plane method elsherbini and jacobi 2006 is used to record measurements and capture images of incidence profiles immediately before the start of descent to determine the contact angle hysteresis the experiment used natural seawater which salinity was measured by the multifunctional instrument az86031 and amounted to 16 5 0 2 ppm the coefficient of surface tension was determined by the method of separation of the ring on a torsion balance and was equal to 74 5 0 8 mn m liquid was deposited on the sh surface by dripping from the tip with the formation of a drop of 10 μl in most cases in studies of droplets on sh surfaces an accurate analysis of ca is hampered by the distortion of their shape due to gravity the use of small droplets avoids the deformation of water droplets caused by gravity however due to the lack of proper wetting of the sh surface the placement of water droplets of less than 4 μl in volume causes difficulty zhang x at al 2004 to determine the optimal modes for observing a drop of sea water on the sh surface we performed an experiment ukolov a i and popova t n 2018 in which a 10 μl drop of sea water was placed on the sample and ca was measured periodically during evaporation under ambient conditions despite the increase in salt concentration due to the evaporation of water ca at the initial stage increases 150 θ 168 reaching its maximum for a volume of 0 5 μl the minimum deviation from the spherical shape coincides with the beginning of the active process of salt crystallization in the drop volume this evaporation stage already corresponds to a teardrop shaped distortion and makes it difficult to measure ca a similar technique was used in these measurements with further evaporation photographing was carried out until a droplet reached a volume of 3 μl this made it possible to reduce the shape deformation due to gravity and did not distort the measurements associated with the onset of the crystallization process 2 2 immersion of samples in sea water and observation of biofouling the experiment was carried out for three months august october in the kerch strait 45 16ʹ15 0ʺ n 36 25ʹ18 0ʺ e samples were mounted on a special holder fig 1 d installed on the quay and immersed in sea water in august at a depth of more than 1 m 15 steel plates were used for the whole experiment the distance between the rows is 30 cm one side of all the plates was covered with a superhydrophobic layer the reverse side remained unprocessed after rolling contact angle measurements optical observations and fouling samples for biological analysis were performed every seven days after the start of the experiment weather conditions were recorded daily at the same time at 12 00 throughout the entire period of the experiment the air temperature 25 4 32 3 c and water 23 9 26 4 c remained fairly stable the wind speed had its maximum of august 9 11 10 12 m s with its average value of 6 48 m s during the entire observation period detailed information on the composition of the fouling layer made it possible to obtain microscopic studies performed using a zoom szm 45t2 stereomicroscope and its associated digital camera for microscope dcm130 digital camera the size of attached microorganisms was estimated optically by the difference in the stroke of the micrometer screw by sequentially focusing the lens on different parts of the thallus the surface area of the fouling was determined graphically by applying a millimeter grid to the image and by calculating the ratio of the nodes that fell into the populated and clean areas when sampling for biological analysis the samples were placed in a container of water to avoid the loss of organisms in the laboratory organisms were washed off with water in a sorting sieve and larger attached forms were removed from the surface with tweezers samples were disassembled no more than 3 h later when observing part of the mixture with organisms in a petri dish at 8 fold magnification selected organisms with tweezers were placed in a test tube with 4 formalin solution the analyzed sample was sorted into systematic groups up to families the number of organisms of this species was determined by direct counting of individuals in the sample 2 3 numerical modeling in this paper the evaluation of the effect of wetting and adhesion of the surface on the flow velocity along the sample plane was made using the capabilities of mathematical modeling of hydrodynamic processes using the ansys fluent finite element package the basis for solving the standard equations of mass conservation 4 ρ t ρ υ s m where s m additional mass ρ the density averaged ov er the volume υ the flow velocity and impulse 5 t ρ υ ρ υ υ p τ ρ g f where p static pressure τ stress tensor ρ g gravitational force and f external forces to include the effect of surface tension along the interface between each pair of phases the volume of fluid vof model is used which can be supplemented by the values of contact angles between the phases as well as an indication of the surface tension coefficient as a constant the continuum surface force csf model proposed by brackbill et al 1992 implemented by adding surface tension to the calculation vof in ansys fluent a formulation of the csf model is used where the surface curvature is computed from local gradients in the surface normal at the interface let n be the surface normal defined as the gradient of α q the volume fraction of the qth phase 6 n α q the curvature k is defined in terms of the divergence of the unit normal n ˆ 7 k n ˆ where 8 n ˆ n n the surface tension can be written in terms of the pressure jump across the surface the force at the surface can be expressed as a volume force using the divergence theorem it is this volume force that is the source term that is added to the momentum equation it has the following form 9 f v o l p a i r s i j σ i j α i ρ i k j α j α j ρ j k i α i 1 2 ρ i ρ j this expression allows for a smooth superposition of forces near cells where more than two phases are present if only two phases are present in a cell then k i k j and α i α j and equation 9 simplifies to 10 f v o l σ i j ρ k i α j 1 2 ρ ρ j together with the surface tension in the model used option wall adhesion rather than impose this boundary condition at the wall itself the contact angle that the fluid is assumed to make with the wall is used to adjust the surface normal in cells near the wall this so called dynamic boundary condition results in the adjustment of the curvature of the surface near the wall if θ is the contact angle at the wall then the surface normal at the live cell next to the wall is 11 n ˆ n w ˆ c o s θ t w ˆ s i n θ where n w ˆ and t w ˆ are the unit vectors normal and tangential to the wall respectively the combination of this contact angle with the normally calculated surface normal one cell away from the wall determine the local curvature of the surface and this curvature is used to adjust the body force term in the surface tension calculation the geometry of the model fig 2 is constructed using the designmodeler option with wall dimensions corresponding to the real sample the generated grid with the number of cells 3 6 million had a condensation on the plane of the wall with a further decrease in the cell the scatter of results did not exceed 1 transition sst turbulence model is selected liquid is water boundary conditions inlet velocity ν 0 10 m s turbulence intensity 0 5 and turbulence length 0 5 mm outlet static pressure for the other three faces symmetry the surface tension and adhesion of the wall are specified in the vof tab the surface roughness is specified under the boundary conditions wall when using standard and nonequilibrium wall functions in the option group wall roughness the values are set to roughness height rh absolute roughness height and roughness constant rc the roughness height is set in meters and in this work varied from 10 4 to 3 10 3 m from the roughness height of the sh layer to the maximum size of biofouling during the experiment the value of the roughness constant in fluent is determined by the type of wall roughness the set value rc 0 5 corresponds to a close packed uniform sand roughness the performed cfd simulation consisted in calculating the average velocity of the sublayers of a fluid flow with a thickness of 5 10 3 m moving along a rough wall in the direction of the x axis in fig 2 the ratio of the initial velocity at the plate inlet to the final ν 0 ν was determined for a sublayer located at a distance from the surface equal to the roughness height z 0 1 mm 3 mm 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface wettability compliance with all the deposition conditions of the coating made it possible to obtain an sh layer on the surface of the shipbuilding steel of the a40s grade which was confirmed by measuring the contact angle θ fig 3 a shows a drop on the sh surface with ca θ 151 the results of optical profilometry are shown in fig 4 the polished surface is coated with a hydrophobic coating material clustering agglomeration of particles presented in the solution leads to the formation of roughness the arithmetic mean of the profile deviation is ra 11 36 μm and the total height rt 127 59 μm fig 4 a a typical cross section roughness profile traced by an optical profilometer over the entire surface is shown in fig 4 b microscopic hemispherical protrusions provide the necessary roughness for the appearance of non wetting effect the stability of the state which is described by the cassie baxter model is determined by the ratio of the size of surface protrusions to the size of droplets that interact with the substrate bushan et al 2009 the transition from the cassie baxter state to the wenzel state will be carried out in the case when the maximum sagging depth δ of a drop of radius r described by the laplace equation is greater than the height of the surface roughness h which can be expressed by the inequality 12 δ p 2 d 2 r h where h is the height of the protrusions d is the diameter of the base p is the distance between them δ is the maximum sagging depth of the drop according to the measurements made for the sh layer used in the paper h 0 1 mm d 0 1 mm p 0 05 mm the ratio h δ 72 in this state the liquid lies on top of the structured surface above the gas layer this gas gap is an effective medium that provides a drop slip at the liquid gas interface the measured contact angle hysteresis is found to be 7 4 confirmed sh coatings observation of the evaporation of a drop of seawater shown in fig 3 and helped to reduce its deviation from a spherical shape the contact angle was determined θ 168 at a droplet volume of 0 5 μl this is the maximum result that we were able to get when using neverwet on shipbuilding steel the problem with the use of sh coatings is the stability of the cassie baxter state with increasing hydrostatic pressure pcrit the pcrit value can vary from 0 2 to 38 6 kpa depending on the method of manufacturing the sh coating and the research method zheng et al 2005 amrei and tafreshi 2015 xue et al 2017 forsberg et al 2011 liravi et al 2020 the analytical critical pressure formula for superhydrophobic surfaces consisting of orderedly packed spherical particles according to emami et al 2011 is based on the balance of forces for the meniscus surrounding this particle 13 p l s 2 π d s 2 4 sin 2 α π σ d s sin α cos 3 π 2 θ α where d s is the diameter of the sphere and l s is the distance from the center to the center to the center between two adjacent spheres α is the angle characterizing the height at which the meniscus is located then 14 p c r 4 π σ d s sin α cos 3 π 2 θ α d s 4 π 6 ε 2 3 π sin 2 α c r where solid volume fraction ε is given as ε π d s 2 6 l s 2 to study the characteristics of superhydrophobic coatings consisting of randomly distributed particles a numerical method based on complete morphology is used emami et al 2011 the fundamental principle of the method is that at a given capillary pressure p cr the pore space available for the non wettable phase is determined by the pore size 15 p c r 2 σ cos π θ r c r our mathematical estimates of the critical pressure according to 14 and 15 based on the results of optical profilometry showed the presence of a boundary state for ds 2 10 μm and ls 6 10 μm and contact angles θ 150 168 if σ 74 5 mn m we obtained the interval p cr 8 25 kpa which coincides with the pressure in the natural experiment 10 13 kpa to clarify the situation we observed the state of the air layer during the gradual immersion of the sample in water fig 5 a shows the initial state of a fragment of an underwater air gap hydrostatic pressure 30 pa the observation surface is uniformly covered with gas formations which can combine increasing in size fig 5 a insert moves under wave action continued immersion does not visually affect gas bubbles in the center of the steel plate however we noticed that the wetting process begins exclusively at the edge of the sample fig 5 b that is the mechanism of transition from the cassie baxter state to wenzel is performed not by lowering the meniscus level between the protrusions of the sh layer but by blotting the relief with water from the boundary of the solid with the liquid immersion of the sample at the experimental depth increases the region of water penetration fig 5 c however this process stops 10 15 of the surface at the edges of the plate is wetted naturally our observations are subjective in nature since such a behavior of the gas layer depends on the shape size material of the sample and the method of creating the sh layer under the conditions of the chosen experimental procedure the air layer was partially preserved during immersion and movement of the liquid near the sample it was stable until the beginning of the first settlements and the degradation of the sh layer as a result of being under water for 7 days the contact angle decreases and on average reaches the value θ 135 fig 3 b and for different sides of the drop the spread could be up to 10 the active action of wave processes flushes silica particles from the polymer matrix unevenly accordingly various conditions arise at the points of contact between the liquid and the solid for this reason the measured hysteresis of the contact angle had a strong scatter depending on the slip region of the drop and was determined in the range of 24 60 after 14 days fig 3 c ca filed up to θ 130 however the spread between measurements for different sides of the drop was reduced to 1 after 21 days underwater ca θ 121 fig 3 d is also with slight deviations the time interval of 28 days fig 3 e coincides with the transition to the hydrophilic state ca again receives a strong dependence on the location of the drop and is in the range 105 θ 88 apparently this time interval corresponds to the beginning of the destruction of the coating and the appearance of sections of the natural surface of the steel at the final stage after 35 days fig 3 f the state is completely hydrophilic 76 θ 66 and the spread of the contact angle value is associated with the asperities of the sample surface itself the measurement of the hysteresis of the contact angle in the hydrophilic state caused difficulties associated with the surface features with biofouling the settled biofouling during this period of time not only is wetted by water but absorb it forcing the contact line to behave unnaturally and immediately distorting the shape of the droplet when sliding 3 2 monitoring of biofouling surface fouling for the first 14 days at θ 130 fig 3 b d was absent or easily washed off by the flow of sea water after a longer stay under water 21 days the experimental plates are covered with green algae the fouling density is the same for the sh layer and the reverse unprotected surface of the sample but algae are characterized by a lower thallus height on the super hydrophobic coating fig 6 to settle larvae of aquatic organisms and algal spores on a new substrate the formation of a bacterial film on its surface is necessary the bacterial layer forms more quickly on a hydrophilic natural after rolling surface than on a superhydrophobic one that is the larvae spores of fouling agents interact faster with surfaces that have a large surface energy respectively settle on them earlier and have a larger size after 28 days fouling of bulanus balanidae chthamalus stellatus with a size of 1 3 mm and a density of 0 5 ind cm2 over the entire surface of the sample fig 7 is present on the back untreated sh layer there are also single serpules serpula vermicularis about 7 mm long after 35 days the samples were found under water on a natural surface after rolling there are fouling agents of the following groups bowery crustaceans balanidae chthamalus stellatus sitting polychaetians serpula vermicularis bryozoans bryozoa and sponges porifera on the sh surface fig 8 there is no balyanus even after 35 days of testing taking into account the fact that overgrowing of the bulbous is characterized by a significant adhesion force which is the main influence on the hydrodynamics of the vessel one can judge about the significant advantage of the sh coating over the entire surface one individual is serpula with a tube size of 10 mm 90 of the surface is covered with bryozoa and algae with a thallus size less than 1 mm fig 8 in this case the algae cover only the zone filled with bryozoa using them as a substrate for attachment algae are absent in areas without them repetition of the experiment in the period from september to october gave similar results for the degradation of the sh layer in the marine environment and the same gradual decrease in the contact angle wear sh coating depends on weather conditions which determine the amount of sea waves as it turned out the main damage to the structure of the sh surface is caused by particles of sand and other impurities suspended in sea water which act as a natural abrasive at the initial stage when the roughness of the layer is maximum small sand granules get stuck between the projections sh of the coating clogging it up as in fig 6 this is mainly a consequence of the experiment close to the coastal strip or at a depth not large enough however this phenomenon should be taken into account when testing for wear developed sh coatings for use in marine environments when quantifying the dynamics of fouling expressed as a relative change in the average density of biofouling per unit area the initial state of the surface is taken as the zero level as the samples are under water the area of the fouling layer increases until the surface is completely covered taken as 100 the results of calculating the average density of fouling and relative error are given in the table for all stages of the experiment season the duration of the experiment days 1 14 21 28 35 august september 17 5 3 30 3 78 3 90 5 september october 6 1 5 13 2 42 2 64 3 fouling in the colder time of the year was delayed in comparison with the summer autumn period and the first appearance of the notable biological species described above arose later after the loss of hydrophobic surface properties 3 3 results numerical simulation the results of the native experiment described above helped to identify the stages of changing the wetting properties of the surface and its relief due to biofouling each state determines the kinetics of the flow of the liquid layer near the wall of the sample on fig 8 shows the results of modeling the flow of water along the plate surface with an initial inlet velocity ν 0 10 m s fig 2 the contact angle θ 151 and the roughness height rh 0 1 mm correspond to the wetting and relief of the sh layer before testing under water roughness constant was 0 5 for all calculations the flow velocity was determined along the larger side of the sample coordinate x for various distances z from the plane of the rough wall fig 2 thus the energy loss in the liquid sublayer to overcome the friction forces along the length of the flow stream is analyzed velocity ν undergoes the most noticeable changes at the initial stage x 0 04 m of interaction with the plate wall the layers close to the surface z 0 1 mm experience maximum drag their velocity decreases from ν 0 10 m s at the input to ν 5 5 m s at the end of the sample x 0 09 m with increasing distance from the rough wall z 0 9 mm the velocity from ν 0 10 m s decreases at the exit to 8 6 m s to identify the relationship between the wetting value expressed by the contact angle and the loss of velocity dependences similar to fig 9 were obtained for all experimental experiments θ 135 130 121 90 70 the value of rh did not change and was equal in all models to 0 1 mm the results of the final velocity ν depending on ca for z 0 1 mm are shown in the table θ 151 135 130 121 90 70 ν m s 5 459 5 457 5 454 5 451 3 786 3 766 numerical modeling revealed a clear boundary between the flow resistance between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface properties for the hydrophobic state the ratio ν 0 ν 1 8 after the transition to the hydrophobic state ν 0 ν 2 6 this phenomenon should manifest itself in the real interaction of a liquid and a solid it can be explained by the occurrence of slippage due to a lower adhesion force with a hydrophobic surface molecular slippage is based on the assumption that liquid molecules directly slide over a solid surface calculations barrat and bocquet 1999a b using the nonequilibrium molecular dynamics method showed that for a sufficiently large contact angle the microscopic boundary conditions differ from the sticking conditions the theory predicts a slip length of about 30 molecular diameters starting at θ 140 another model associates slippage with a decrease in the viscosity of the boundary layer of a fluid near a hydrophobic surface vinogradova o i 1995 vinogradova o i 1999 if the viscosity of the boundary layer can be characterized by an average value of ηs then the order of magnitude of the slip length b can be estimated as 16 b δ η b η s 1 where δ is the thickness of the layer with altered viscosity and ηb is the bulk viscosity b 0 corresponds to sticking conditions b corresponds to the condition of the absence of viscous friction at the liquid gas interface the next step in the numerical calculation we repeated the changes in the wetting of the surface and its relief observed when in the marine environment the simulation result of a simultaneous increase in the contact angle of ca and the roughness height rh of the surface are shown in fig 10 as in the case of the layer by layer analysis of the fluid flow along a rough wall described above the main attention is paid to the change in the flow velocity depending on the distance x the velocity distribution along the surface ν f x depending on the roughness height was calculated for the initial stage θ 151 rh 0 1 mm and for the subsequent stages of degradation of the superhydrophobic layer taking into account the size of the fouling appearing θ 121 rh 0 5 mm θ 90 rh 1 mm θ 70 rh 3 mm fig 10 the calculation was performed for a liquid sublayer located at a distance z 3 mm fig 2 from the surface this value cannot be set less than the roughness height which was determined by the size of the fouling obtained after 35 days of testing the initial velocity at the front edge of the plate ν 0 10 m s varied along the entire length of the model 90 mm for all the considered conditions given by the wall the dependence ν f x had an extremum in the first stage of the flow turbulent flow can be represented as a spectrum of vortices of various scales the largest eddies are determined by a scale commensurate with the geometry for example the thickness of the boundary layer vortices of this order at the initial stage of vortex formation receive kinetic energy from the average flow which leads to an increase in speed further the kinetic energy of large vortices is transmitted to smaller scale vortices which interact with them for small vortices viscous friction forces become significant and kinetic energy dissipates into the internal one the vortex formation region for rh 0 1 1 mm has the same characteristic size 0 03 m the transition to the hydrophilic state θ 70 and rh 3 mm leads to an increase in the vortex formation region which is 0 04 m however the maximum turbulent flow velocity remains constant for rh in the range of 0 5 3 mm it should be noted that a noticeable difference in the nature of the flow for rh 0 5 mm is observed only at the initial stage of interaction with a solid surface the resulting decrease in speed under the selected conditions is shown in the table θ 151 135 130 121 90 70 rh mm 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 5 1 3 ν m s 8 84 8 84 8 84 8 37 8 20 8 15 prior to the appearance of the first fouling the surface roughness did not change and the final flow rate at z 3 mm differed for different ca s in the 10 000th digit number therefore the results of the velocity distribution at θ 151 130 practically coincide and are presented on the graph ν f x of one curve fig 10 an increase in the roughness after the appearance of fouling and a decrease in ca θ 121 70 due to the degradation of the sh layer leads to an increase in the ratio ν 0 ν 1 19 1 22 respectively 4 conclusions while researching the wetting effect of shipbuilding steel on its fouling in natural marine conditions showed that for a surface with a contact angle of up to 130 there is effective protection against the attachment of the first bacteria and larvae however the weather conditions contributing to the appearance of storm winds during the test period accelerated the degradation of the superhydrophobic layer which led to an increase in the rate of surface fouling after 35 days there were found single serpules serpula vermicularis bryozoa bryozoa and green algae chlorophyta with a thallus 1 3 mm however the density and size of the fouling was lower than on the side after testing on which during this time period barnacle crustaceans c stellatus and sponges porifera were added the absence of balianus c stellatus is a significant positive effect of the presence of the sh layer this species is one of the most common and difficult to remove fouling from the hull as a variety of barnacle crayfish balyanus has a hard calcareous shell that is fixed to the substrate using a special substance to settle animal larvae and algal spores on a new substrate the formation of a bacterial film on its surface is necessary the bacterial layer forms more quickly on the hydrophilic natural surface of the steel than on the superhydrophobic one thus a certain period is observed on the sh surface after which the first settlements of attached living beings appear creating a substrate for the next fouling layer the duration of this period depends on how long the surface retains its hydrophobic properties at the level of θ 130 to obtain quantitative data for the fluid flow we simulated all the situations that we observed at the stages of the native experiment a decrease in the flow velocity along the surface is a characteristic that indirectly determines the magnitude of the resistance force the nature of the fluid flow in the boundary layer of the rectangular plate model located along the stream and streamlined at a certain speed corresponds to the regime inherent in the real movement of the vessel the result of numerical modeling showed that the transition from the hydrophilic state to the hydrophobic state reduces the surface resistance by 1 44 times changes in velocity ν 0 ν 2 6 hydrophilic ν 0 ν 1 8 hydrophobic an increase in surface roughness due to fouling will further increase the velocity ratio by 1 19 1 22 times these relations obtained at the initial stage distance 9 cm of fluid flow along the surface introduce the main difference between the two states since the decrease in velocity slows down with increasing flow length of course we understand that the numbers of the ratio of speeds will vary depending on the thickness of the liquid layer on the distribution of fouling on the surface on the magnitude of the initial velocity and other factors however the general pattern remains the coating providing a contact angle 130 at the same time reduces the friction resistance and prevents the attachment of the first fouling settlements which further improves the flow around the material due to the absence of roughness growth the main problem for large scale tests of sh coatings in the marine environment remains their weak resistance to mechanical wear the strength of the neverwet layer is on average comparable to the mechanical properties of most sh coatings known in the literature thus for the experiment we have 20 30 days which does not meet the time requirements for the devices used in the marine industry funding this
