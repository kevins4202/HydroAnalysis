2715,commonly adopted procedures for flood damage assessment are based on functions of the hazard that depend on the item under investigation e g an area a building and on the vulnerability of exposed items available flood damage models make use of summary indicators usually correspondent to the worst conditions expected during the flood event e g the maximum flooded area the envelop of maximum water depths the maximum presence of people in the area etc which cannot properly describe the time evolution of hazard and exposure during the flood event this is an important limitation as the flood damage also depends on how the involved processes evolve in time in the present work we propose a new framework for the assessment of flood damage that considers how damage evolves in time within a single flood event the goal is achieved by computing flood damage by integrating over time the rate at which damage progresses which in turn depends on time varying hydraulic conditions and exposure application to schematic yet realistic examples shows the effectiveness of the method and its potential in flood risk assessment and management keywords damage flood exposure hazard vulnerability flood risk data availability the data on which this article is based are available in the cited literature 1 introduction with the shift from hazard control to integrated risk management the estimation of flood damage has gained increased importance in the last decades as the base for the evaluation of costs and benefits of risk mitigation actions both in the peace time and during the emergency at the same time flood damage modelling capability increased as well starting from the simple concept of depth damage curve introduced in the fifties for the estimation of flood damage to residential buildings white 1945 1964 flood damage models have progressively improved resulting in the current availability of more comprehensive and complex estimation tools on the one hand research on flood damage expanded to include the main typologies of exposed assets flood damage models are now available for assessing damage to people e g arrighi et al 2017 cox et al 2010 milanesi et al 2015

e g arrighi et al 2018 figueiredo et al 2021 on the other hand complexity of models increased although in an unbalanced way for the different exposed assets with the residential sector being the most investigated one multi variable models have been developed allowing to consider the role of several hazard and vulnerability variables in shaping damage besides the one played by water depth with respect to the hazard models are now available to consider the combined effect of water depth water velocity water contamination and flood duration brémond et al 2013 chen et al 2016 de moel and aerts 2011 merz et al 2010 pita et al 2021 likewise most of existing damage models allow including at least one significant vulnerability variable with the number and typology of them strongly depending on the asset under investigation see gerl et al 2016 for an overview literature on flood damage modelling is unambiguous in evaluating multi variable models as outperforming simple uni variable tools such as depth damage functions carisi et al 2018 schröter et al 2014 wagenaar et al 2017 still the calibration and implementation of multi variable models are often hampered by the paucity of reliable data for example it is not always straightforward to evaluate hazard variables such as flood duration and contamination or to acquire sufficiently accurate information e g on vulnerability of the ground floor of buildings on physical characteristics of exposed people on types of crops etc the increased availability of ex post damage data and innovative modelling techniques like bayesian frameworks machine learning algorithms etc promoted then the development of advanced probabilistic approaches that allow to consider uncertainty of both input data and damage mechanisms carisi et al 2018 kreibich et al 2017 lüdtke et al 2019 sairam et al 2020 despite the strong heterogeneity of current flood damage models in terms of investigated assets number of input variables and modelling approaches available models all disregard the time evolution of the damaging processes within the flood event they estimate the damage as a function of fixed values of the input variables being them related to hazard exposure or vulnerability usually corresponding to the worst conditions expected during a flood the maximum water depth and velocity the maximum exposure etc in other words a time dependent problem is reduced to the estimation of the final state of damage as a function of some summary indicators that briefly describe the hazard and exposure associated to a flood event here we question the general validity of this paradigm as neglecting the time evolution of the multiple and complex processes that produce the flood damage is likely oversimplified estimating the damage by considering the time evolution of the flood characteristics and hence of the hazard variables as well as how exposure and vulnerability change during the flood event is more adherent to reality and likely more appropriate and effective than the standard approach this is the reason why we propose a model for direct damage assessment that explicitly considers the temporal evolution of the flooding characteristics as well as those of exposure and vulnerability scenarios while entailing an increased number of parameters with associated uncertainties the new framework paves the way to a wealth of promising applications for example it may allow i to estimate flood damage more accurately in cases of markedly time varying hazard and or time dependent exposure and vulnerability scenarios ii to estimate the effectiveness of disaster countermeasures and civil protection activities that can be undertaken in the course of a flood event in order to rescue and protect human lives and properties and iii to explicitly evaluate the advantages related to the availability and reliability of real time flood forecasts the proposed model is described in section 2 section 3 presents and discusses some examples of model application aiming at providing information about the model capability in predicting the damage produced by flood events rather than supporting a validation of the model for the selected assets some additional remarks and a set of conclusions close the paper 2 the mathematical model the model aims at describing the time evolution of damage within a single flood event as driven by the time varying flood hazard which is the independent variable of the problem the model is spatially distributed in its nature and is meant to estimate the local damage as the sum of damage suffered by homogeneous categories of items exposed to flooding this means that the overall damage is obtained by summation on the exposed item categories and by spatial integration on the flooded area hereinafter the model structure is explained with reference to a single item category and to a generic point x x y within the flooded area i e the dependence of variables on position x and on the specific item category is implicitly assumed the basic idea is that items exposed to flooding are progressively eroded by the flood this can be the case of the many categories of assets for which damage progresses gradually e g buildings however this damage mechanism can be extended also to the case of objects that can be either safe or fully damaged hereinafter denoted as on off objects when they are hit by floodwaters by considering the damaging process from a statistical point of view in case of on off items the vulnerability of the object is the probability of being fully damaged when stressed by a constant hydrodynamic forcing lazzarin et al 2022 this probability typically increases with the time the object is exposed to the flow therefore we may also consider on off objects as gradually eroded by the flood a representative category of on off objects is that of people the probability of being swept away by floodwaters depends on the duration of the flooding because i the longer a person remains in floodwaters the smaller is his resistance and ii the probability of being hit by large scale energetic turbulent flow events not resolved by the hydrodynamic model or e g by floating debris increases with time 2 1 the model variables in the model the intensity of the hydrodynamic forcing i e the hazard at a given location as it varies in time is measured using a single parameter w w t for instance a basic choice would be assuming w equal to the water depth here we choose the w parameter proposed by lazzarin et al 2022 which stems from a combination of flow mechanical energy per unit weight and momentum per unit width and specific weight it is written as 1 w y y w α 1 β f 2 with y w 0 α 1 β 0 in which f u gy 1 2 is the froude number with y the water depth and u the flow velocity y w is a reference depth introduced to scale the water depth and α and β are two calibration factors that measure the relative importance of static versus dynamic energy force component it is worth noting that w can recover the water depth y y w 1 α 1 and β 0 the flow energy per unit weight h y w 1 α 1 and β 0 5 and the momentum per unit width and specific weight m y w 2 α 2 and β 2 by suitably choosing the reference depth and the two calibration factors lazzarin et al 2022 we denote with e 0 the quantity or the value of potentially exposed items belonging to a single homogeneous category present in a unit area at the initial time t 0 for instance e 0 may be the number of exposed people or the economic value of exposed buildings such quantity value can reduce in time due to countermeasures and rescue activities performed in the course of the flood event and is denoted by e e t we then introduce the following non dimensional time dependent specific variables that range in the interval 0 1 the damage d d t which is the damaged fraction of e at time t the vulnerability v w which is here defined to be the fraction of e that can be damaged if subject to constant hydrodynamic forcing w lasting for a reasonably long period of time since w depends on time vulnerability depends on changes in time as well v w can be interpreted as the potential damage associated to the given hazard degree the rescue function r r t which is the fraction of e 0 that has been rescued the meaning of these variables is clarified in the schematics of fig 1 we stress that all variables actually depend on the position x and provide the spatial distribution of hazard exposure vulnerability outcome of rescue activities and damage 2 2 the model equations the model is built upon a basic conservation principle applied to items exposed to flooding the quantity or the value of potentially exposed items as it decreases in time depending on the rescue function is expressed as 2 e e 0 1 r given that damaged items cannot be rescued any more r in eq 2 must satisfy the constraint r 1 d e e 0 possibly limiting the rescue the rescue function r depends on several factors the kind of asset under investigation the hydrodynamic forcing and external factors such as the availability and efficiency of rescue services kienzler et al 2015 thieken et al 2007 the key dependence of r on external factors makes it extremely case dependent thus unsuitable for a general theoretical assessment the core of the model is predicting the growth of damage in time d t as a function of the hydrodynamic forcing i e of the hazard degree w t typically for a generic object affected by flooding the early stage of damaging starts slowly then develops faster and faster this is because an exposed item has an initial resistance that progressively reduces in fact with the damaging process progressing exposed objects weaken and hence become more susceptible to being damaged on the contrary at the later stage of the process damaging slows down and the maximum damage is reached gradually breaden 1971 at this stage the damaging rate becomes nearly proportional to the undamaged fraction of the objects effectively exposed to the action of floodwaters v d fig 1 scaled by the relative potential damage v mathematically this behaviour can be described by the following equation 3 d dt d e cd e 1 d v with c a damage rate factor that controls the speed at which the damage progresses reasonably the damage rate factor increases with the hazard increasing making c c w a monotone increasing function the above equation belongs to the family of the so called logistic equations with the damaged items d e corresponding to a growing population and the maximum quantity of damageable items v e corresponding to the so called carrying capacity i e the maximum population size compatible with external constraints chapman and byron 2018 as the flood evolves in times particularly during the receding phase when w t becomes gradually smaller the fraction of potentially damageable items v w may reduce to values smaller than the current damage d t whereas eq 3 is strictly valid when v d to account for this and to extend the adaptability of the proposed equation to a wider range of cases we rewrite eq 3 in the more general form 4 d dt d e e c d 1 γ 1 d max v d 1 γ with γ a calibration parameter in the range 0 γ 1 when γ 0 the solution to eq 4 is the well known logistic function as γ increases the duration of the initial stage of fast damaging reduces see sect 2 3 1 as a first approximation γ is here assumed to be constant for a given category of exposed assets as the initial delay at which damage begins to develop mainly depends on the characteristics of assets rather than on hazard intensity the logistic equation in the differential form eq 4 along with eq 2 allows predicting the evolution of d once the model parameters have been assessed eq 4 can be integrated at each point x within the flooded area with any simple numerical approach e g finite difference using the results y x t and u x t and hence w x t provided by suitable hydrodynamic models specific damage times the potential exposure d x t e x t gives the spatial distribution of the damage per unit area integration over the flooded area yields the time evolution of the damage and at the end of the flood event the total damage hereinafter for a general assessment of the model we assume that the rescue function is identically zero so that the potential exposure is constant in time i e e t e 0 the logistic equation then reduces to 5 dd dt c d 1 γ 1 d max v d 1 γ which has a close form analytical solution if v is constant in time which corresponds to assuming a constant hazard degree w 2 3 assessment of model parameters and functions to estimate the time evolution of the damage d t for each asset category the parameters and variables appearing in eq 5 need to be evaluated by calibration using available experimental data information and or phenomenological models considering that γ can be taken as a constant parameter whereas c and v actually depend on the impact parameter w calibrating the model means determining one parameter γ and two univariate functions c c w and v v w as the procedure to calibrate the model parameters is different for the categories of gradually damaging assets and on off objects they are dealt with separately in the next sections 2 3 1 the case of gradually damaging assets in order to determine γ c and v for a given asset category we use the solution of eq 5 when w is constant in time so that c w and v w turn out to be constant as well by prescribing d 0 when t 0 the solution of eq 5 reads 6 d t v 1 v cγ t 1 γ assuming a constant value of w is convenient because available information and data on gradually damaging assets typically refer to constant hydraulic forcing which means knowing the damage produced by constant values of w for different flood durations τ yet in this case the time t coincides with the flood duration τ and hence d t d τ close inspection of eq 6 shows that c controls the speed at which the damage progresses fig 2a shows that during the early stage of the damaging process dd dt increases with c increasing for a given value of c γ controls the delay with which damage starts increasing that is the smaller is γ the more delayed is the damaging process fig 2b these behaviors can be of help in calibrating c and γ the calibration procedure is outlined as follows 1 the first preliminary step is assessing the structure of the impact parameter w to describe the hydrodynamic forcing by means of a single parameter lazzarin et al 2022 2 a set of damage values d at different times t and for different values of w is extracted from available data 3 for each value of w the best fit of eq 6 to the d t couples provides a set of c w and v w couples as well as an estimate of the parameter γ 4 finally the functions c w and v w can be obtained by interpolating the set of c w and v w couples respectively the above procedure is applied in the two examples of sections 3 1 and 3 2 for the sake of illustration 2 3 2 the case of on off damaging objects for on off objects v w is actually the probability of occurrence of an off event for example for the category of people vulnerability is the probability of being swept away by floodwaters of given depth and velocity hence w this probability depends on many factors such as weight height sex age clothes physical condition as well as on ground topography and why not on fate arrighi et al 2017 jonkman and penning rowsell 2008 lind et al 2004 accordingly v w can be assessed using a statistical approach based on a significant set of off event data and the corresponding w values v w is then given by the cumulative distribution function cdf of w associated to the off events a more detailed description of this procedure is given by lazzarin et al 2022 finding a suitable relationship for the damaging rate factor c w is not straightforward as it is affected by manifold aspects off events in floodwaters can be triggered by strong macroturbulent events as well as by floating and suspended debris hence the probability of occurrence of an off event i e the damage increases as time passes in addition for some on off objects like people or animals fatigue plays a role as well anyway the damaging process for on off objects is typically fast compared to the flooding time scale so that approximations affecting the estimation of c w have a minor impact on the accuracy of model predictions see section 3 for on off damaging objects the procedure to calibrate the model is summarized as follows 1 the first preliminary step is assessing the structure of the impact parameter w lazzarin et al 2022 2 then available data are used to provide a statistically significant set of w values corresponding to off events the cumulative distribution of w values provides the vulnerability function v w 3 the damage rate factor c w can be inferred by a best fit of eq 6 to available experimental data in the absence of experimental data or theoretical evaluations a possible reasonable function c w should be assumed the above procedure is applied in the example of section 3 3 for the sake of illustration 3 model applications of the three illustrative applications shown in this section the first two examples consider crops and buildings as gradually damaging assets the third example that considers the category of people shows how the procedure is extended to an on off object category the purpose of the examples discussed in this section is to exemplify the above calibration procedure and to show the model ability in describing the time evolution of damage as determined by the time varying flow conditions that occur in the course of a synthetic flood event the present model applications also suggest the importance of considering the evolution of the damaging process for an improved assessment of flood risk the application to a real flood event with inclusion of the rescue function is beyond the scope of the present methodological study in real case modelling applications the results from a hydrodynamic model provide the spatial distribution of water depth and velocity within the flooded area as they vary in time during the flood event such data allows computing the spatial and temporal distribution of the impact parameter w for each investigated category of exposed assets by means of eq 1 how to assess the w parameter to actually represent the hazard degree for different object categories is described in lazzarin et al 2022 here for the sake of the exercise we consider a generic spatial position within the flooded area and we introduce some synthetic hydrographs describing the local time variation of w the selected hydrographs shown in fig 3 have different shapes but the same peak value 3 1 flood damage to crops flood duration is one of the key explicative variable of flood damage to crops berning et al 2000 forster et al 2008 mao et al 2016 merz et al 2010 scawthorn et al 2006 vozinaki et al 2015 as plants resist differently to ponding water persisting few hours rather than several days in fact most of the existing models for estimating flood damage to agriculture consider flood duration as an important explicative variable complementing the maximum flow depth e g agenais et al 2013 brémond et al 2013 dutta et al 2003 molinari et al 2019 nevertheless the dynamics of flood damage mechanisms is not considered by the models with the proposed approach the temporal evolution of the flood is instead implicitly accounted for as demonstrated by the following examples among crops we choose rice as its damaging is perhaps the most well documented e g khairul et al 2022 nguyen et al 2021 samantaray et al 2015 singh et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 in particular we use the data and damage functions for rice at maturity stage as given by shrestha et al 2016 given that the damage is given as a function of water depth in this model we assume α 1 β 0 and y w 1 0 m in eq 1 so that w exactly corresponds to the water depth according to the model by shrestha et al 2016 the damage attains the maximum value when w 1 2 fig 4a and it strongly depends on the duration of the flood the model calibration which means determining γ c w and v w is based on the use of eq 6 which holds when the impact parameter w t is constant in time accordingly we extract from the data of fig 4a all the couples d τ for some constant values of w these set of iso w data dots in fig 4b is fitted with eq 6 lines in fig 4b to find γ 0 6 and the values of vulnerability and damage rate factor reported in table 1 the next step is obtaining suitable expressions for v w and c w valid possibilities are interpolating the data of table 1 with a piecewise linear function or using a higher order polynomial approximation an effective solution is using suitable algebraic expressions containing few calibration factors as those reported in the following equations 7 v w 1 1 a w b 8 c w p w q where a b p and q are calibration coefficients for rice during the maturity stage data in table 1 the vulnerability function v w is well described by a 0 85 and b 7 fig 5a and the damage rate factor c w by p 0 4 d 1 and q 1 5 fig 5b once calibrated the model is used to predict the damage produced by the synthetic flood events of fig 3 by integrating eq 5 the results obtained by assuming t max 1 d are shown in fig 6a for w max 1 5 and in fig 6b for w max 1 0 we recall that in this specific application the w parameter represents the water depth expressed in meters both in the case of w max 1 5 and w max 1 0 in the rising phase of the flood the damage increases slowly with a temporal evolution that is almost the same for the different hydrographs for the longest flood labelled as 4 and w max 1 5 the damage is smaller than 20 at the flood peak in the receding phase i e for t 1 day in the steeper hydrograph labelled as 1 water levels decrease fast and after approximatively t 2 days damage does not increase anymore reaching d 0 32 and d 0 11 for w max 1 5 and of w max 1 0 respectively for the longest hydrograph labelled as 4 relatively high water depths last for several days after the peak and damage continues to increase until t 5 days for w max 1 5 where d 0 63 and t 3 days for w max 1 0 where d 0 27 hence the hydrograph n 4 produces a final damage approximately two times higher than hydrograph n 1 due to the longer persistence of high water levels model parameters are also evaluated for the three growing stages of rice vegetative i e after newly planted reproductive and maturity stage we followed the same calibration procedure outlined for the maturity stage using data of shrestha et al 2016 interestingly while vulnerability shows a marked dependence on the growing stage fig 7a the damage rate factor c w is approximately the same for the three stages fig 7b finally we use the model of agenais et al 2013 to consider other crops specifically we consider grapevine and maize both at the maturity stage and compare the time evolution of the specific damage d t with those obtained for rice using the hydrograph 4 of fig 3 with t max 1 day and w max 1 5 the damaging of grapevine and maize shows a different temporal evolution compared to rice fig 8 the initial stage of the damaging process is delayed however damage progresses faster in time and the final value is higher particularly for grapevine crops which is characterized by a lower value of γ and a higher value of p not reported here again the persistence of flood plays a major role in determining the growth of damage 3 2 flood damage to residential buildings flood duration is one of the most important factors together with water depth and flow velocity also in assessing damage to residential buildings carisi et al 2018 chen et al 2016 grahn and nyberg 2014 kellermann et al 2020 kelman and spence 2004 martínez gomariz et al 2020 merz et al 2013 indeed both structures and contents are typically made of porous materials therefore the longer is the flood duration the more is the water absorbed and the greater is the damage marvi 2020 nofal et al 2020 soetanto and proverbs 2004 in this example we use relative damage data provided by the what if synthetic damage model insyde dottori et al 2016 molinari and scorzini 2017 forced by a set of couples u y lasting different durations τ in this case the use of a what if model is appropriate since we need values of damage for the same building but for different flood durations and these values are not directly available from experimental data differently from the previous example in this case the structure of the impact parameter w is not known and must be assessed since the energy head as well as the flow depth are suitable flood impact parameters for reliable forecasting of damage to residential buildings kreibich et al 2009 lazzarin et al 2022 we assume α 1 in eq 1 and chose y w 3 5 m i e approximately the typical inter floor height as reference depth so that β remains the only calibration factor the vulnerability v w is here defined as the damage produced by a constant hydrodynamic forcing w lasting for a sufficiently long time in other words v w is the asymptotic value of the specific damage d t considering the flood event time scale accordingly to calibrate β we use a sub set of the damage values provided by the insyde model in particular we consider the damage produced by velocity and flow depth couples lasting τ 60 h so that d w v w since iso v lines in the u y plane are also iso w lines we find β through a best fit procedure such that the shape of iso w lines matches the shape of iso v lines as well as possible this procedure is detailed in lazzarin et al 2022 once the parameter w is assessed we use the full set of data to construct a series of couples w d for each duration τ hereafter the procedure is the same as that described in the previous application sect 3 1 as an example we consider a concrete 2 storey building with a footprint area of 100 m2 in this case we find β 0 3 and the w d couples plotted in fig 9a for each duration τ we then draw a continuous damage curve d w from the set of couples w d the large scatter of computed damage around the curves are mainly because insyde considers a stepwise effect of flood duration in particular the flood duration starts affecting the damage at τ 30 h and reaches its maximum effect at τ 42 h this is the reason why the damage predicted by the model is constant when the duration is in the ranges τ 30 h and τ 42 h fig 9b we use the curves of fig 9a to extract a set of points d τ w for some values of the impact parameter w 0 w 1 at a constant step δw 0 2 and for durations τ 60 h at a constant step of 6 h fig 9b these points are then fitted by eq 6 to give γ 1 0 and the values of vulnerability and damage rate factor reported in table 2 and plotted in fig 9 here too the large scatter of computed values data around the interpolating iso w curves of fig 9b is mainly ascribable to the stepped impact of the flood duration considered in the insyde model vulnerability and damage rate factor values given in table 2 could be interpolated using eqs 7 and 8 respectively however when the upper limit of vulnerability v 100 in eq 7 is far from being reached as in the present case a simpler power law like eq 9 can be used to interpolate the data fig 10 9 v w b w a for the present case we find a 0 8 b 0 22 and p 0 04 h 1 q 1 3 the calibrated model is used to estimate the damage produced by the flood hydrographs of fig 3 with t max 1 h and w max 1 numerical integration of eq 5 with boundary condition d 0 at t 0 yields the results shown in fig 11a even though the peak value of the impact parameter is the same for the four scenarios the damage at the end of the flood event varies with the hydrograph shape significantly with the hydrograph n 4 which is characterized by the longer duration the final damage is roughly doubled if compared with results obtained using the shortest hydrograph n 1 this confirms the importance of considering the time evolution of the flood the above calibration procedure is applied also to the cases of concrete 1 storey and masonry 1 and 2 storey buildings fig 11b d shows the results of the model application for each building the damage evolution depends on the hydrograph shape only slightly up to t 2 h however after the flood peak the damage is strongly affected by the shape of the hydrograph again the final damage for hydrograph n 4 is approximatively two times the final damage for hydrograph n 1 fig 11 also shows that for equivalent hydrodynamic forcing the specific damage d t is larger for 1 storey buildings panels b and d then for 2 storey buildings panels a and c this is because the vulnerability v w which in turn depends on the number of floors and the building structure e g masonry 1 floor buildings are more vulnerable than concrete 2 floors building is higher for 1 storey buildings 3 3 flood damage to people a significant category in the class of on off objects is that of people many experimental data are available to calibrate the model in the form of u y couples associated to off events as a preliminarily step the structure of the impact parameter is assessed by imposing that the iso w line in the u y plane corresponding to w 1 well envelops 95 of the off events i e 95 of off events have w 1 we find α 2 β 4 and y w 1 25 m additional details can be found in lazzarin et al 2022 for classes of on off objects vulnerability is the probability of having an off event lazzarin et al 2022 accordingly v w is given by the cumulative distribution function cdf of w associated to the off events in practical applications it is often convenient to interpolate the w v couples of discrete cdfs with an analytical function to this purpose eq 7 turns out to be simple and effective for different kind of on off objects in the example at hand for the coefficients of eq 7 we find a 0 6 and b 5 0 fig 12a as regards the damage rate factor c w it has to be admitted that suitable data and theoretical models are unavailable to describe the time dependence of the probability that a person is swept away by floodwaters for given hydrodynamic forcing accordingly c w must be assumed sensibly however the damaging process for people is typically fast compared to the flooding time scale so that approximations affecting the estimating of c w have a minor impact on the accuracy of model predictions to show this we assume that c w is given by eq 8 with q 2 and consider some values of the parameter p that to a reasonable extent represent different rates at which damage progresses fig 12b shows the time course of the probability of occurrence of an off event conditional to a constant w 1 hydrodynamic forcing and p 10 25 50 h 1 in other words fig 12b shows how long floodwaters characterized by w 1 take to sweep away 95 of exposed adults or how long an adult can roughly cope with floodwaters characterized by w 1 before being swept away according to the equation chosen for c w this time is approximately 10 min 30 min and 1 h for p 50 25 10 h 1 respectively we then apply the model considering the steepest hydrograph of fig 3 i e n 1 and assume w max 1 and t max 1 h fig 12c compares the vulnerability v t with the damage d t for the three values of p the final damage that exactly corresponds to the point of intersection between v t and d t is not much smaller than the maximum possible damage d max v max v w max this holds even in the very improbable case of p 10 h 1 in which a person exposed to a very hazardous hydrodynamic condition i e w 1 would resist for more than one hour before being swept away this behaviour confirms that an accurate assessing of c w for the category of people and possibly for most of on off categories is important but not crucial in determining the accuracy of the model 3 4 additional remarks to apply the proposed model the key point is the calibration of γ and the estimation of the vulnerability function v and damage growth rate factor c in the present formulation of the model both v and c only depend on the intensity of the hydrodynamic forcing w the vulnerability v w which is here defined as the potential damage produced in a sufficiently long period by a given hazard degree is very similar to the specific damage estimated by classical models in the present time dependent approach v w modulates in time the damage growth the damage rate factor c w expresses in mathematical form the idea that the flood damage develops at a rate that increases with the hazard the previous model applications showed that a significant amount of data is needed to assess c w for on off items such as people exposed to floodwaters available data is almost useless to determine c w nonetheless the model application suggests that when the damaging process is fast compared to the flooding time scale as it is for people even large uncertainties on c w have a minor impact on the accuracy of model prediction in other words for item category subject to fast damaging the present model remains useful to track the time evolution of damage which is essentially driven by the time variation of hazard and to consider the effect of countermeasures and rescue activities undertaken during the course of the flood event for items subject to progressive damaging the schematic applications shown above suggest that considering the real time evolution of the flood event is key for reliable damage estimation in the model applications to crops and buildings figs 6 8 and 11 the specific damage is still very low at the time of the flood peak and mainly develops during the receding phase of the flood the peak flood condition alone as well as long standing shallow water depths can play a minor role in determining the final damage this means that the successful application of the classic approach for damage estimation requires defining and estimating hazard indicators i e an effective equivalent water depth and an effective equivalent flood duration that are truly representative of the time varying flood conditions this is not straightforward and can be especially challenging when the shape of the flood hydrograph is very irregular as e g in the case of multi peak hydrographs this issue is overcome in the time dependent framework here proposed which naturally accounts for the time evolution of damage during the flood thus retaining the full information of the damaging states contained in a flood hydrograph the effectiveness of the method is intimately related to the use of numerical flood models typically based on the shallow water equations which are now consolidated tools in supporting flood damage and flood risk analyses costabile et al 2020 ernst et al 2010 ferrari et al 2019 ferrari and viero 2020 jamali et al 2018 sanders and schubert 2019 teng et al 2017 viero et al 2019 these models provide water depth and velocity at each time step and at each point of the flooded area and hence the time course and spatial distribution of the impact parameter w at each computational grid point time integration of eq 5 can advance simultaneously with the hydrodynamic model to provide the spatial distribution of the damage d x t e x t the latter once the flood receded gives the spatial distribution of the flood damage 4 conclusions the present work introduces a new framework for flood damage assessment which considers the time evolution of the entire damaging process within a single flood event this is a new perspective since the many models for flood damage assessment developed up to now either physics or data based uni or multi variate deterministic or probabilistic correlate the damage produced by a flood event to some summary indicators of hazard and exposure thus disregarding the time course of the flood event and of the processes that lead to flood damage a logistic type equation is here chosen to predict at each point within the flooded area the time evolution of damage driven by the time varying features of the flood event accounting for the fractions of damaged exposed vulnerable and possibly rescued items the total damage is then obtained through spatial integration over the flooded area model applications to crops residential buildings and people exposed to floodwaters are used to show how to assess the model parameters and functions based on available data and to demonstrate some of the advantage of the proposed approach specifically the model allows to assess flood damage of different asset categories yet retaining a common structure i e the different damage processes are described by the same equations and just different values of the calibration parameters the duration of the flood event is accounted for implicitly and effectively and the strong hypothesis that the final damage may be completely described by a limited set of characteristic parameters such as the maximum water depth and flow velocity is relaxed importantly the main model components have a precise physical meaning which is of help to the modelers in case data or synthetic models are scarce or unavailable although further research is definitely needed to obtain a reliable model applicable to real world general cases the proposed framework suggests a different point of view in flood risk assessment closer to the damaging processes that actually occur during a flood and paves the way to a set of innovative applications towards a more effective flood risk assessment and management the proposed approach also allows to account for the impact of countermeasures and of rescue activities that may be undertaken during the flood event aimed at reducing the exposed items this aspect is not analyzed in the paper mainly because of the many diverse factors on which rescue activities depend on including the availability and efficiency of rescue services the quantity of items to be rescued and the hydrodynamic forcing as well accounting for the mutual feedbacks between the emergency rescue activities and the dynamics of hazard and damage requires the coupling of the damage and hydrodynamic models this occurrence suggests the opportunity of coupling of the present model for time dependent flood damage with available or advanced versions of agent based models e g dawson et al 2011 zhuo and han 2020 which can provide effective estimates of the rescue function r for on off fast damaging item categories like people and cattle rescue activities are expected to play a key role also for long and slowly varying flood events for which the quantity of exposed assets can decrease because of rescue activities performed by civil protection actors or citizens like evacuating people and cattle moving vulnerable contents at upper level etc disregarding the fraction of assets that can actually be rescued or moved during such flood events may lead to significant overestimations of damage as for further future activities model application to significant real cases having sufficiently accurate data of both the hydrodynamic and damaging processes of a few categories is needed to more clearly demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach furthermore the general time dependent framework here proposed could be useful for modelling other time dependent flood related processes e g soil alteration biological degradation indirect damages business

2715,commonly adopted procedures for flood damage assessment are based on functions of the hazard that depend on the item under investigation e g an area a building and on the vulnerability of exposed items available flood damage models make use of summary indicators usually correspondent to the worst conditions expected during the flood event e g the maximum flooded area the envelop of maximum water depths the maximum presence of people in the area etc which cannot properly describe the time evolution of hazard and exposure during the flood event this is an important limitation as the flood damage also depends on how the involved processes evolve in time in the present work we propose a new framework for the assessment of flood damage that considers how damage evolves in time within a single flood event the goal is achieved by computing flood damage by integrating over time the rate at which damage progresses which in turn depends on time varying hydraulic conditions and exposure application to schematic yet realistic examples shows the effectiveness of the method and its potential in flood risk assessment and management keywords damage flood exposure hazard vulnerability flood risk data availability the data on which this article is based are available in the cited literature 1 introduction with the shift from hazard control to integrated risk management the estimation of flood damage has gained increased importance in the last decades as the base for the evaluation of costs and benefits of risk mitigation actions both in the peace time and during the emergency at the same time flood damage modelling capability increased as well starting from the simple concept of depth damage curve introduced in the fifties for the estimation of flood damage to residential buildings white 1945 1964 flood damage models have progressively improved resulting in the current availability of more comprehensive and complex estimation tools on the one hand research on flood damage expanded to include the main typologies of exposed assets flood damage models are now available for assessing damage to people e g arrighi et al 2017 cox et al 2010 milanesi et al 2015

e g arrighi et al 2018 figueiredo et al 2021 on the other hand complexity of models increased although in an unbalanced way for the different exposed assets with the residential sector being the most investigated one multi variable models have been developed allowing to consider the role of several hazard and vulnerability variables in shaping damage besides the one played by water depth with respect to the hazard models are now available to consider the combined effect of water depth water velocity water contamination and flood duration brémond et al 2013 chen et al 2016 de moel and aerts 2011 merz et al 2010 pita et al 2021 likewise most of existing damage models allow including at least one significant vulnerability variable with the number and typology of them strongly depending on the asset under investigation see gerl et al 2016 for an overview literature on flood damage modelling is unambiguous in evaluating multi variable models as outperforming simple uni variable tools such as depth damage functions carisi et al 2018 schröter et al 2014 wagenaar et al 2017 still the calibration and implementation of multi variable models are often hampered by the paucity of reliable data for example it is not always straightforward to evaluate hazard variables such as flood duration and contamination or to acquire sufficiently accurate information e g on vulnerability of the ground floor of buildings on physical characteristics of exposed people on types of crops etc the increased availability of ex post damage data and innovative modelling techniques like bayesian frameworks machine learning algorithms etc promoted then the development of advanced probabilistic approaches that allow to consider uncertainty of both input data and damage mechanisms carisi et al 2018 kreibich et al 2017 lüdtke et al 2019 sairam et al 2020 despite the strong heterogeneity of current flood damage models in terms of investigated assets number of input variables and modelling approaches available models all disregard the time evolution of the damaging processes within the flood event they estimate the damage as a function of fixed values of the input variables being them related to hazard exposure or vulnerability usually corresponding to the worst conditions expected during a flood the maximum water depth and velocity the maximum exposure etc in other words a time dependent problem is reduced to the estimation of the final state of damage as a function of some summary indicators that briefly describe the hazard and exposure associated to a flood event here we question the general validity of this paradigm as neglecting the time evolution of the multiple and complex processes that produce the flood damage is likely oversimplified estimating the damage by considering the time evolution of the flood characteristics and hence of the hazard variables as well as how exposure and vulnerability change during the flood event is more adherent to reality and likely more appropriate and effective than the standard approach this is the reason why we propose a model for direct damage assessment that explicitly considers the temporal evolution of the flooding characteristics as well as those of exposure and vulnerability scenarios while entailing an increased number of parameters with associated uncertainties the new framework paves the way to a wealth of promising applications for example it may allow i to estimate flood damage more accurately in cases of markedly time varying hazard and or time dependent exposure and vulnerability scenarios ii to estimate the effectiveness of disaster countermeasures and civil protection activities that can be undertaken in the course of a flood event in order to rescue and protect human lives and properties and iii to explicitly evaluate the advantages related to the availability and reliability of real time flood forecasts the proposed model is described in section 2 section 3 presents and discusses some examples of model application aiming at providing information about the model capability in predicting the damage produced by flood events rather than supporting a validation of the model for the selected assets some additional remarks and a set of conclusions close the paper 2 the mathematical model the model aims at describing the time evolution of damage within a single flood event as driven by the time varying flood hazard which is the independent variable of the problem the model is spatially distributed in its nature and is meant to estimate the local damage as the sum of damage suffered by homogeneous categories of items exposed to flooding this means that the overall damage is obtained by summation on the exposed item categories and by spatial integration on the flooded area hereinafter the model structure is explained with reference to a single item category and to a generic point x x y within the flooded area i e the dependence of variables on position x and on the specific item category is implicitly assumed the basic idea is that items exposed to flooding are progressively eroded by the flood this can be the case of the many categories of assets for which damage progresses gradually e g buildings however this damage mechanism can be extended also to the case of objects that can be either safe or fully damaged hereinafter denoted as on off objects when they are hit by floodwaters by considering the damaging process from a statistical point of view in case of on off items the vulnerability of the object is the probability of being fully damaged when stressed by a constant hydrodynamic forcing lazzarin et al 2022 this probability typically increases with the time the object is exposed to the flow therefore we may also consider on off objects as gradually eroded by the flood a representative category of on off objects is that of people the probability of being swept away by floodwaters depends on the duration of the flooding because i the longer a person remains in floodwaters the smaller is his resistance and ii the probability of being hit by large scale energetic turbulent flow events not resolved by the hydrodynamic model or e g by floating debris increases with time 2 1 the model variables in the model the intensity of the hydrodynamic forcing i e the hazard at a given location as it varies in time is measured using a single parameter w w t for instance a basic choice would be assuming w equal to the water depth here we choose the w parameter proposed by lazzarin et al 2022 which stems from a combination of flow mechanical energy per unit weight and momentum per unit width and specific weight it is written as 1 w y y w α 1 β f 2 with y w 0 α 1 β 0 in which f u gy 1 2 is the froude number with y the water depth and u the flow velocity y w is a reference depth introduced to scale the water depth and α and β are two calibration factors that measure the relative importance of static versus dynamic energy force component it is worth noting that w can recover the water depth y y w 1 α 1 and β 0 the flow energy per unit weight h y w 1 α 1 and β 0 5 and the momentum per unit width and specific weight m y w 2 α 2 and β 2 by suitably choosing the reference depth and the two calibration factors lazzarin et al 2022 we denote with e 0 the quantity or the value of potentially exposed items belonging to a single homogeneous category present in a unit area at the initial time t 0 for instance e 0 may be the number of exposed people or the economic value of exposed buildings such quantity value can reduce in time due to countermeasures and rescue activities performed in the course of the flood event and is denoted by e e t we then introduce the following non dimensional time dependent specific variables that range in the interval 0 1 the damage d d t which is the damaged fraction of e at time t the vulnerability v w which is here defined to be the fraction of e that can be damaged if subject to constant hydrodynamic forcing w lasting for a reasonably long period of time since w depends on time vulnerability depends on changes in time as well v w can be interpreted as the potential damage associated to the given hazard degree the rescue function r r t which is the fraction of e 0 that has been rescued the meaning of these variables is clarified in the schematics of fig 1 we stress that all variables actually depend on the position x and provide the spatial distribution of hazard exposure vulnerability outcome of rescue activities and damage 2 2 the model equations the model is built upon a basic conservation principle applied to items exposed to flooding the quantity or the value of potentially exposed items as it decreases in time depending on the rescue function is expressed as 2 e e 0 1 r given that damaged items cannot be rescued any more r in eq 2 must satisfy the constraint r 1 d e e 0 possibly limiting the rescue the rescue function r depends on several factors the kind of asset under investigation the hydrodynamic forcing and external factors such as the availability and efficiency of rescue services kienzler et al 2015 thieken et al 2007 the key dependence of r on external factors makes it extremely case dependent thus unsuitable for a general theoretical assessment the core of the model is predicting the growth of damage in time d t as a function of the hydrodynamic forcing i e of the hazard degree w t typically for a generic object affected by flooding the early stage of damaging starts slowly then develops faster and faster this is because an exposed item has an initial resistance that progressively reduces in fact with the damaging process progressing exposed objects weaken and hence become more susceptible to being damaged on the contrary at the later stage of the process damaging slows down and the maximum damage is reached gradually breaden 1971 at this stage the damaging rate becomes nearly proportional to the undamaged fraction of the objects effectively exposed to the action of floodwaters v d fig 1 scaled by the relative potential damage v mathematically this behaviour can be described by the following equation 3 d dt d e cd e 1 d v with c a damage rate factor that controls the speed at which the damage progresses reasonably the damage rate factor increases with the hazard increasing making c c w a monotone increasing function the above equation belongs to the family of the so called logistic equations with the damaged items d e corresponding to a growing population and the maximum quantity of damageable items v e corresponding to the so called carrying capacity i e the maximum population size compatible with external constraints chapman and byron 2018 as the flood evolves in times particularly during the receding phase when w t becomes gradually smaller the fraction of potentially damageable items v w may reduce to values smaller than the current damage d t whereas eq 3 is strictly valid when v d to account for this and to extend the adaptability of the proposed equation to a wider range of cases we rewrite eq 3 in the more general form 4 d dt d e e c d 1 γ 1 d max v d 1 γ with γ a calibration parameter in the range 0 γ 1 when γ 0 the solution to eq 4 is the well known logistic function as γ increases the duration of the initial stage of fast damaging reduces see sect 2 3 1 as a first approximation γ is here assumed to be constant for a given category of exposed assets as the initial delay at which damage begins to develop mainly depends on the characteristics of assets rather than on hazard intensity the logistic equation in the differential form eq 4 along with eq 2 allows predicting the evolution of d once the model parameters have been assessed eq 4 can be integrated at each point x within the flooded area with any simple numerical approach e g finite difference using the results y x t and u x t and hence w x t provided by suitable hydrodynamic models specific damage times the potential exposure d x t e x t gives the spatial distribution of the damage per unit area integration over the flooded area yields the time evolution of the damage and at the end of the flood event the total damage hereinafter for a general assessment of the model we assume that the rescue function is identically zero so that the potential exposure is constant in time i e e t e 0 the logistic equation then reduces to 5 dd dt c d 1 γ 1 d max v d 1 γ which has a close form analytical solution if v is constant in time which corresponds to assuming a constant hazard degree w 2 3 assessment of model parameters and functions to estimate the time evolution of the damage d t for each asset category the parameters and variables appearing in eq 5 need to be evaluated by calibration using available experimental data information and or phenomenological models considering that γ can be taken as a constant parameter whereas c and v actually depend on the impact parameter w calibrating the model means determining one parameter γ and two univariate functions c c w and v v w as the procedure to calibrate the model parameters is different for the categories of gradually damaging assets and on off objects they are dealt with separately in the next sections 2 3 1 the case of gradually damaging assets in order to determine γ c and v for a given asset category we use the solution of eq 5 when w is constant in time so that c w and v w turn out to be constant as well by prescribing d 0 when t 0 the solution of eq 5 reads 6 d t v 1 v cγ t 1 γ assuming a constant value of w is convenient because available information and data on gradually damaging assets typically refer to constant hydraulic forcing which means knowing the damage produced by constant values of w for different flood durations τ yet in this case the time t coincides with the flood duration τ and hence d t d τ close inspection of eq 6 shows that c controls the speed at which the damage progresses fig 2a shows that during the early stage of the damaging process dd dt increases with c increasing for a given value of c γ controls the delay with which damage starts increasing that is the smaller is γ the more delayed is the damaging process fig 2b these behaviors can be of help in calibrating c and γ the calibration procedure is outlined as follows 1 the first preliminary step is assessing the structure of the impact parameter w to describe the hydrodynamic forcing by means of a single parameter lazzarin et al 2022 2 a set of damage values d at different times t and for different values of w is extracted from available data 3 for each value of w the best fit of eq 6 to the d t couples provides a set of c w and v w couples as well as an estimate of the parameter γ 4 finally the functions c w and v w can be obtained by interpolating the set of c w and v w couples respectively the above procedure is applied in the two examples of sections 3 1 and 3 2 for the sake of illustration 2 3 2 the case of on off damaging objects for on off objects v w is actually the probability of occurrence of an off event for example for the category of people vulnerability is the probability of being swept away by floodwaters of given depth and velocity hence w this probability depends on many factors such as weight height sex age clothes physical condition as well as on ground topography and why not on fate arrighi et al 2017 jonkman and penning rowsell 2008 lind et al 2004 accordingly v w can be assessed using a statistical approach based on a significant set of off event data and the corresponding w values v w is then given by the cumulative distribution function cdf of w associated to the off events a more detailed description of this procedure is given by lazzarin et al 2022 finding a suitable relationship for the damaging rate factor c w is not straightforward as it is affected by manifold aspects off events in floodwaters can be triggered by strong macroturbulent events as well as by floating and suspended debris hence the probability of occurrence of an off event i e the damage increases as time passes in addition for some on off objects like people or animals fatigue plays a role as well anyway the damaging process for on off objects is typically fast compared to the flooding time scale so that approximations affecting the estimation of c w have a minor impact on the accuracy of model predictions see section 3 for on off damaging objects the procedure to calibrate the model is summarized as follows 1 the first preliminary step is assessing the structure of the impact parameter w lazzarin et al 2022 2 then available data are used to provide a statistically significant set of w values corresponding to off events the cumulative distribution of w values provides the vulnerability function v w 3 the damage rate factor c w can be inferred by a best fit of eq 6 to available experimental data in the absence of experimental data or theoretical evaluations a possible reasonable function c w should be assumed the above procedure is applied in the example of section 3 3 for the sake of illustration 3 model applications of the three illustrative applications shown in this section the first two examples consider crops and buildings as gradually damaging assets the third example that considers the category of people shows how the procedure is extended to an on off object category the purpose of the examples discussed in this section is to exemplify the above calibration procedure and to show the model ability in describing the time evolution of damage as determined by the time varying flow conditions that occur in the course of a synthetic flood event the present model applications also suggest the importance of considering the evolution of the damaging process for an improved assessment of flood risk the application to a real flood event with inclusion of the rescue function is beyond the scope of the present methodological study in real case modelling applications the results from a hydrodynamic model provide the spatial distribution of water depth and velocity within the flooded area as they vary in time during the flood event such data allows computing the spatial and temporal distribution of the impact parameter w for each investigated category of exposed assets by means of eq 1 how to assess the w parameter to actually represent the hazard degree for different object categories is described in lazzarin et al 2022 here for the sake of the exercise we consider a generic spatial position within the flooded area and we introduce some synthetic hydrographs describing the local time variation of w the selected hydrographs shown in fig 3 have different shapes but the same peak value 3 1 flood damage to crops flood duration is one of the key explicative variable of flood damage to crops berning et al 2000 forster et al 2008 mao et al 2016 merz et al 2010 scawthorn et al 2006 vozinaki et al 2015 as plants resist differently to ponding water persisting few hours rather than several days in fact most of the existing models for estimating flood damage to agriculture consider flood duration as an important explicative variable complementing the maximum flow depth e g agenais et al 2013 brémond et al 2013 dutta et al 2003 molinari et al 2019 nevertheless the dynamics of flood damage mechanisms is not considered by the models with the proposed approach the temporal evolution of the flood is instead implicitly accounted for as demonstrated by the following examples among crops we choose rice as its damaging is perhaps the most well documented e g khairul et al 2022 nguyen et al 2021 samantaray et al 2015 singh et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 in particular we use the data and damage functions for rice at maturity stage as given by shrestha et al 2016 given that the damage is given as a function of water depth in this model we assume α 1 β 0 and y w 1 0 m in eq 1 so that w exactly corresponds to the water depth according to the model by shrestha et al 2016 the damage attains the maximum value when w 1 2 fig 4a and it strongly depends on the duration of the flood the model calibration which means determining γ c w and v w is based on the use of eq 6 which holds when the impact parameter w t is constant in time accordingly we extract from the data of fig 4a all the couples d τ for some constant values of w these set of iso w data dots in fig 4b is fitted with eq 6 lines in fig 4b to find γ 0 6 and the values of vulnerability and damage rate factor reported in table 1 the next step is obtaining suitable expressions for v w and c w valid possibilities are interpolating the data of table 1 with a piecewise linear function or using a higher order polynomial approximation an effective solution is using suitable algebraic expressions containing few calibration factors as those reported in the following equations 7 v w 1 1 a w b 8 c w p w q where a b p and q are calibration coefficients for rice during the maturity stage data in table 1 the vulnerability function v w is well described by a 0 85 and b 7 fig 5a and the damage rate factor c w by p 0 4 d 1 and q 1 5 fig 5b once calibrated the model is used to predict the damage produced by the synthetic flood events of fig 3 by integrating eq 5 the results obtained by assuming t max 1 d are shown in fig 6a for w max 1 5 and in fig 6b for w max 1 0 we recall that in this specific application the w parameter represents the water depth expressed in meters both in the case of w max 1 5 and w max 1 0 in the rising phase of the flood the damage increases slowly with a temporal evolution that is almost the same for the different hydrographs for the longest flood labelled as 4 and w max 1 5 the damage is smaller than 20 at the flood peak in the receding phase i e for t 1 day in the steeper hydrograph labelled as 1 water levels decrease fast and after approximatively t 2 days damage does not increase anymore reaching d 0 32 and d 0 11 for w max 1 5 and of w max 1 0 respectively for the longest hydrograph labelled as 4 relatively high water depths last for several days after the peak and damage continues to increase until t 5 days for w max 1 5 where d 0 63 and t 3 days for w max 1 0 where d 0 27 hence the hydrograph n 4 produces a final damage approximately two times higher than hydrograph n 1 due to the longer persistence of high water levels model parameters are also evaluated for the three growing stages of rice vegetative i e after newly planted reproductive and maturity stage we followed the same calibration procedure outlined for the maturity stage using data of shrestha et al 2016 interestingly while vulnerability shows a marked dependence on the growing stage fig 7a the damage rate factor c w is approximately the same for the three stages fig 7b finally we use the model of agenais et al 2013 to consider other crops specifically we consider grapevine and maize both at the maturity stage and compare the time evolution of the specific damage d t with those obtained for rice using the hydrograph 4 of fig 3 with t max 1 day and w max 1 5 the damaging of grapevine and maize shows a different temporal evolution compared to rice fig 8 the initial stage of the damaging process is delayed however damage progresses faster in time and the final value is higher particularly for grapevine crops which is characterized by a lower value of γ and a higher value of p not reported here again the persistence of flood plays a major role in determining the growth of damage 3 2 flood damage to residential buildings flood duration is one of the most important factors together with water depth and flow velocity also in assessing damage to residential buildings carisi et al 2018 chen et al 2016 grahn and nyberg 2014 kellermann et al 2020 kelman and spence 2004 martínez gomariz et al 2020 merz et al 2013 indeed both structures and contents are typically made of porous materials therefore the longer is the flood duration the more is the water absorbed and the greater is the damage marvi 2020 nofal et al 2020 soetanto and proverbs 2004 in this example we use relative damage data provided by the what if synthetic damage model insyde dottori et al 2016 molinari and scorzini 2017 forced by a set of couples u y lasting different durations τ in this case the use of a what if model is appropriate since we need values of damage for the same building but for different flood durations and these values are not directly available from experimental data differently from the previous example in this case the structure of the impact parameter w is not known and must be assessed since the energy head as well as the flow depth are suitable flood impact parameters for reliable forecasting of damage to residential buildings kreibich et al 2009 lazzarin et al 2022 we assume α 1 in eq 1 and chose y w 3 5 m i e approximately the typical inter floor height as reference depth so that β remains the only calibration factor the vulnerability v w is here defined as the damage produced by a constant hydrodynamic forcing w lasting for a sufficiently long time in other words v w is the asymptotic value of the specific damage d t considering the flood event time scale accordingly to calibrate β we use a sub set of the damage values provided by the insyde model in particular we consider the damage produced by velocity and flow depth couples lasting τ 60 h so that d w v w since iso v lines in the u y plane are also iso w lines we find β through a best fit procedure such that the shape of iso w lines matches the shape of iso v lines as well as possible this procedure is detailed in lazzarin et al 2022 once the parameter w is assessed we use the full set of data to construct a series of couples w d for each duration τ hereafter the procedure is the same as that described in the previous application sect 3 1 as an example we consider a concrete 2 storey building with a footprint area of 100 m2 in this case we find β 0 3 and the w d couples plotted in fig 9a for each duration τ we then draw a continuous damage curve d w from the set of couples w d the large scatter of computed damage around the curves are mainly because insyde considers a stepwise effect of flood duration in particular the flood duration starts affecting the damage at τ 30 h and reaches its maximum effect at τ 42 h this is the reason why the damage predicted by the model is constant when the duration is in the ranges τ 30 h and τ 42 h fig 9b we use the curves of fig 9a to extract a set of points d τ w for some values of the impact parameter w 0 w 1 at a constant step δw 0 2 and for durations τ 60 h at a constant step of 6 h fig 9b these points are then fitted by eq 6 to give γ 1 0 and the values of vulnerability and damage rate factor reported in table 2 and plotted in fig 9 here too the large scatter of computed values data around the interpolating iso w curves of fig 9b is mainly ascribable to the stepped impact of the flood duration considered in the insyde model vulnerability and damage rate factor values given in table 2 could be interpolated using eqs 7 and 8 respectively however when the upper limit of vulnerability v 100 in eq 7 is far from being reached as in the present case a simpler power law like eq 9 can be used to interpolate the data fig 10 9 v w b w a for the present case we find a 0 8 b 0 22 and p 0 04 h 1 q 1 3 the calibrated model is used to estimate the damage produced by the flood hydrographs of fig 3 with t max 1 h and w max 1 numerical integration of eq 5 with boundary condition d 0 at t 0 yields the results shown in fig 11a even though the peak value of the impact parameter is the same for the four scenarios the damage at the end of the flood event varies with the hydrograph shape significantly with the hydrograph n 4 which is characterized by the longer duration the final damage is roughly doubled if compared with results obtained using the shortest hydrograph n 1 this confirms the importance of considering the time evolution of the flood the above calibration procedure is applied also to the cases of concrete 1 storey and masonry 1 and 2 storey buildings fig 11b d shows the results of the model application for each building the damage evolution depends on the hydrograph shape only slightly up to t 2 h however after the flood peak the damage is strongly affected by the shape of the hydrograph again the final damage for hydrograph n 4 is approximatively two times the final damage for hydrograph n 1 fig 11 also shows that for equivalent hydrodynamic forcing the specific damage d t is larger for 1 storey buildings panels b and d then for 2 storey buildings panels a and c this is because the vulnerability v w which in turn depends on the number of floors and the building structure e g masonry 1 floor buildings are more vulnerable than concrete 2 floors building is higher for 1 storey buildings 3 3 flood damage to people a significant category in the class of on off objects is that of people many experimental data are available to calibrate the model in the form of u y couples associated to off events as a preliminarily step the structure of the impact parameter is assessed by imposing that the iso w line in the u y plane corresponding to w 1 well envelops 95 of the off events i e 95 of off events have w 1 we find α 2 β 4 and y w 1 25 m additional details can be found in lazzarin et al 2022 for classes of on off objects vulnerability is the probability of having an off event lazzarin et al 2022 accordingly v w is given by the cumulative distribution function cdf of w associated to the off events in practical applications it is often convenient to interpolate the w v couples of discrete cdfs with an analytical function to this purpose eq 7 turns out to be simple and effective for different kind of on off objects in the example at hand for the coefficients of eq 7 we find a 0 6 and b 5 0 fig 12a as regards the damage rate factor c w it has to be admitted that suitable data and theoretical models are unavailable to describe the time dependence of the probability that a person is swept away by floodwaters for given hydrodynamic forcing accordingly c w must be assumed sensibly however the damaging process for people is typically fast compared to the flooding time scale so that approximations affecting the estimating of c w have a minor impact on the accuracy of model predictions to show this we assume that c w is given by eq 8 with q 2 and consider some values of the parameter p that to a reasonable extent represent different rates at which damage progresses fig 12b shows the time course of the probability of occurrence of an off event conditional to a constant w 1 hydrodynamic forcing and p 10 25 50 h 1 in other words fig 12b shows how long floodwaters characterized by w 1 take to sweep away 95 of exposed adults or how long an adult can roughly cope with floodwaters characterized by w 1 before being swept away according to the equation chosen for c w this time is approximately 10 min 30 min and 1 h for p 50 25 10 h 1 respectively we then apply the model considering the steepest hydrograph of fig 3 i e n 1 and assume w max 1 and t max 1 h fig 12c compares the vulnerability v t with the damage d t for the three values of p the final damage that exactly corresponds to the point of intersection between v t and d t is not much smaller than the maximum possible damage d max v max v w max this holds even in the very improbable case of p 10 h 1 in which a person exposed to a very hazardous hydrodynamic condition i e w 1 would resist for more than one hour before being swept away this behaviour confirms that an accurate assessing of c w for the category of people and possibly for most of on off categories is important but not crucial in determining the accuracy of the model 3 4 additional remarks to apply the proposed model the key point is the calibration of γ and the estimation of the vulnerability function v and damage growth rate factor c in the present formulation of the model both v and c only depend on the intensity of the hydrodynamic forcing w the vulnerability v w which is here defined as the potential damage produced in a sufficiently long period by a given hazard degree is very similar to the specific damage estimated by classical models in the present time dependent approach v w modulates in time the damage growth the damage rate factor c w expresses in mathematical form the idea that the flood damage develops at a rate that increases with the hazard the previous model applications showed that a significant amount of data is needed to assess c w for on off items such as people exposed to floodwaters available data is almost useless to determine c w nonetheless the model application suggests that when the damaging process is fast compared to the flooding time scale as it is for people even large uncertainties on c w have a minor impact on the accuracy of model prediction in other words for item category subject to fast damaging the present model remains useful to track the time evolution of damage which is essentially driven by the time variation of hazard and to consider the effect of countermeasures and rescue activities undertaken during the course of the flood event for items subject to progressive damaging the schematic applications shown above suggest that considering the real time evolution of the flood event is key for reliable damage estimation in the model applications to crops and buildings figs 6 8 and 11 the specific damage is still very low at the time of the flood peak and mainly develops during the receding phase of the flood the peak flood condition alone as well as long standing shallow water depths can play a minor role in determining the final damage this means that the successful application of the classic approach for damage estimation requires defining and estimating hazard indicators i e an effective equivalent water depth and an effective equivalent flood duration that are truly representative of the time varying flood conditions this is not straightforward and can be especially challenging when the shape of the flood hydrograph is very irregular as e g in the case of multi peak hydrographs this issue is overcome in the time dependent framework here proposed which naturally accounts for the time evolution of damage during the flood thus retaining the full information of the damaging states contained in a flood hydrograph the effectiveness of the method is intimately related to the use of numerical flood models typically based on the shallow water equations which are now consolidated tools in supporting flood damage and flood risk analyses costabile et al 2020 ernst et al 2010 ferrari et al 2019 ferrari and viero 2020 jamali et al 2018 sanders and schubert 2019 teng et al 2017 viero et al 2019 these models provide water depth and velocity at each time step and at each point of the flooded area and hence the time course and spatial distribution of the impact parameter w at each computational grid point time integration of eq 5 can advance simultaneously with the hydrodynamic model to provide the spatial distribution of the damage d x t e x t the latter once the flood receded gives the spatial distribution of the flood damage 4 conclusions the present work introduces a new framework for flood damage assessment which considers the time evolution of the entire damaging process within a single flood event this is a new perspective since the many models for flood damage assessment developed up to now either physics or data based uni or multi variate deterministic or probabilistic correlate the damage produced by a flood event to some summary indicators of hazard and exposure thus disregarding the time course of the flood event and of the processes that lead to flood damage a logistic type equation is here chosen to predict at each point within the flooded area the time evolution of damage driven by the time varying features of the flood event accounting for the fractions of damaged exposed vulnerable and possibly rescued items the total damage is then obtained through spatial integration over the flooded area model applications to crops residential buildings and people exposed to floodwaters are used to show how to assess the model parameters and functions based on available data and to demonstrate some of the advantage of the proposed approach specifically the model allows to assess flood damage of different asset categories yet retaining a common structure i e the different damage processes are described by the same equations and just different values of the calibration parameters the duration of the flood event is accounted for implicitly and effectively and the strong hypothesis that the final damage may be completely described by a limited set of characteristic parameters such as the maximum water depth and flow velocity is relaxed importantly the main model components have a precise physical meaning which is of help to the modelers in case data or synthetic models are scarce or unavailable although further research is definitely needed to obtain a reliable model applicable to real world general cases the proposed framework suggests a different point of view in flood risk assessment closer to the damaging processes that actually occur during a flood and paves the way to a set of innovative applications towards a more effective flood risk assessment and management the proposed approach also allows to account for the impact of countermeasures and of rescue activities that may be undertaken during the flood event aimed at reducing the exposed items this aspect is not analyzed in the paper mainly because of the many diverse factors on which rescue activities depend on including the availability and efficiency of rescue services the quantity of items to be rescued and the hydrodynamic forcing as well accounting for the mutual feedbacks between the emergency rescue activities and the dynamics of hazard and damage requires the coupling of the damage and hydrodynamic models this occurrence suggests the opportunity of coupling of the present model for time dependent flood damage with available or advanced versions of agent based models e g dawson et al 2011 zhuo and han 2020 which can provide effective estimates of the rescue function r for on off fast damaging item categories like people and cattle rescue activities are expected to play a key role also for long and slowly varying flood events for which the quantity of exposed assets can decrease because of rescue activities performed by civil protection actors or citizens like evacuating people and cattle moving vulnerable contents at upper level etc disregarding the fraction of assets that can actually be rescued or moved during such flood events may lead to significant overestimations of damage as for further future activities model application to significant real cases having sufficiently accurate data of both the hydrodynamic and damaging processes of a few categories is needed to more clearly demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach furthermore the general time dependent framework here proposed could be useful for modelling other time dependent flood related processes e g soil alteration biological degradation indirect damages business interruption etc possibly including additional or different damage determinants e g pollutants funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial

2716,china has implemented some of the world s most ambitious ecological restoration er programs over the past two decades these large scale multi billion dollar projects have achieved widespread greening across the country however the impacts of different er driven land cover modifications on total water resources remain largely unknown particularly over areas characterized by complex environments of coupled human and natural systems here we quantified ecohydrological impacts of multiple er programs applied over various parts of china s yellow river basin yrb with their lumped effects being partitioned into individual ones er related drivers were disentangled leading in individual attribution of inter annual climatic variability and agricultural activity with cross sensor satellite observations and statistical modelling our results showed an ecohydrological decoupling of water storage and vegetation greenness attributed to er programs increases in natural land cover types e g forest and grassland were found at the expense of human intensive land use such as farmland with the combined changes resulting in a concurrent dramatic water storage loss of 3 70 billion tons year from 2002 to 2021 er was the dominant driver of water loss 66 among all factors considered commensurate with areal land cover change and er program cost the entire basin was divided into two regions with opposite water trends by the er activities with different restoration strategies this study s framework is applicable to substantial part of the globe like yrb and is encouraged to be applied for more wholistic er impact evaluations keywords ecological restoration total water storage land use and land cover change grace human activities sdgs data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in response to extreme societal consequences of ecosystem degradation and climate change governments around the world have increasingly recognized the importance of large scale ecological restoration er lv et al 2019 china alone has invested more than usd 378 5 billion over the past decade in a series of ambitious national er programs that focused on revegetation and land use and land cover lulc modifications li et al 2021a including natural forest land resource conservation grain for green three north shelterbelt forest system beijing and tianjin sandstorm source controlling wildlife conservation and natural reserve development and key shelterbelt construction programs pang et al 2020 viña et al 2016 wang et al 2014 yuan et al 2014 amongst others often in combination with small projects engaged by the local governments these programs have made pronounced changes to the ecological environment across many parts of china for example ecological restoration projects were found to result in socio economic improvements liu et al 2008 and reductions of aeolian erosion intensity lü et al 2012 these were attributed to an increasing ecological rehabilitation within various environments and climatic regions such as in northern gao et al 2015 and hilly southern china wang et al 2015 beijing tianjin sand source region li et al 2016c horqin sandy land zhang et al 2012 the karst region in southwest china qi et al 2013 and loess plateau shao et al 2021 wu et al 2019 while changes in ecosystems may have a notable influence on hydrological fluxes e g runoff or evapotranspiration or individual water storage components e g soil moisture their net impacts on total water resources remains unclear and depends on the local environment such as land use and land cover soil terrain climate dong et al 2020 venkatesh et al 2022 for instance some research showed vegetation expansion reduced runoff feng et al 2016 mcvicar et al 2007 zhang et al 2018 and soil moisture jia et al 2017 yang et al 2014a in semiarid regions while others observed the opposite result in wet regions lian et al 2020 in addition previous studies mostly focused on either water decline or vegetation increase under only one er project or the summative impact from all i e the total er projects in a single region greatly hindering efficient policy evaluation and decision making a recent study over a desert area named mu us sandy land in northern china without agricultural activities found ecological restoration programs induced significant water storage depletion over time zhao et al 2020 this indicates that large scale vegetation greening in water limited and densely populated areas may cause increasingly conflicted demands for water between ecosystems and human usage however current understanding of such conflicts particularly over complex environments of coupled human and natural systems has still been absent zhao et al 2020 the yellow river basin yrb located in an arid and semiarid region of north china is a large with an area of approximately 0 81 million km2 but environmentally vulnerable basin with severe water shortages wang et al 2019 as one of the most densely populated basin around 0 42 billion people it is also of utmost importance for china s food production natural resources and socioeconomic development cai and rosegrant 2004 due to rapid population and economic growth yrb has been converted from a nature dominated to a human dominated environment to curb environmental degradation and improve human well being major ecological restoration projects a total investment of roughly usd 109 7 billion have been implemented over the yrb since the 1990s as a result yrb hosts one of the most complex environments in the world in which landscape have been shaped by changing climate agricultural activities e g irrigation of cropland and large scale ecological restoration projects previous studies have shown increases in total vegetation greenness li et al 2016a and productivity feng et al 2013 over large parts of yrb during the past two decades this was also accompanied by a decline in runoff bao et al 2019 wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 zhong et al 2021 and soil moisture jian et al 2015 but an increase in actual evapotranspiration ma et al 2019 despite a body of studies that have been conducted to study changes in vegetation greenness or individual hydrological fluxes over the yrb the impacts and drivers of different er driven land use and land cover modifications on total water resources and the quantitative contribution of individual er programs remain largely unknown this is particularly true in the areas with high climatic variability and intensive agricultural activities which cover substantial part of the globe thus instead of focusing on changes in either ecological or hydrological components under single or summative er projects that have been done in previous studies this study aims to closely link the ecohydrological interactions across respective er projects apart to the effects of climate change and agricultural activities by integrating cross sensor satellite observations of terrestrial water storage as well as land use and land cover data in this study we developed an innovative approach to investigate the er driven lulc changes to quantify the associated impacts on total freshwater resources in the yellow river basin in china er related drivers were disentangled leading in individual attribution of inter annual climatic variability and agricultural activity with statistical modelling to remove the effects of rainfall irrigation etc specifically we aimed to 1 map spatiotemporal changes in lulc types driven by respective ecological restoration programs 2 quantify the total water storage tws changes induced by lulc conversions and 3 separate er impacts on total water resources from those attributed to climate change and agricultural activities the proposed methodological framework here based on the publicly freely and globally available datasets and methods will allow the maximum simplicity and benefits of such study for assessments of conservation strategies across most parts of the world 2 ecological restoration programs in yrb four major ecological restoration er programs have been implemented during the last two decades to address various environmental problems over different parts of yrb table 1 fig 1 a including the grain for green project ggp natural forest land resource conservation project nfcp ecological protection project of sanjiangyuan natural reserve epsnr and three north shelterbelt project tnsp afforestation area completed and the state investment of these key ecological restoration projects in china were obtained from the 2018 china forestry and grassland development report table 1 and fig 1b ggp focusing on the upper and middle reaches of yrb except the source region fig 1a is the biggest ecological restoration program in china feng et al 2013 xu et al 2004 with a total investment of over usd 61 billion this er program has an ambitious goal to extensively plant vegetation which includes converting substantial degraded farm lands into forests and grassland feng et al 2016 the largest afforestation under ggp took place in 2003 which increased 61 960 km2 forest area with half from previous farmland fig 1b the first phase of ggp finished in 2010 before it went into the second phrase in 2012 restoring farmland for trees under ggp ceased between 2009 and 2013 before it continued rapidly in 2014 fig 1b nfcp has been another large scale ecological restoration program applied over the same area as ggp since 1998 li and zhai 2002 the primary goal of the nfcp is to protect and restore natural forests through means such as logging ban replanting etc the nfcp has three stages of short medium and long term goals the short term stage 1998 2000 reduced timber harvesting from natural forests and offered alternative employment for staff from the traditional forest enterprises the medium term stage 2001 2010 aimed to protect forests for ecological benefits and increase the capacity of timber harvesting by planting new trees the final long term stage 2011 2050 aims to restore natural forests and meet the increasing domestic demand for timber with the planted forests nfcp focused on protecting existing forests and planted less trees than ggp with the main nfcp afforestation event occurring in 2009 fig 1b tnsp started in 1979 and has the longest history among all er programs in china this program is designed to plant trees and protect local forest grassland in order to reduce sand and wind erosion over desert areas of the three north region i e northeast north and northwest china li et al 2012 in total 336 200 km2 of desertification land over the three north region were restored with widely planted trees fig 1b with total 0 38 million km2 forest area from 1979 to 2018 and protection for millions of hectares of desert grassland epsnr was launched in 2005 aiming to fully restore the ecological environment over the sanjiangyuan region which comprises the source zone of yrb syrb it consists of two phases 2005 2012 and 2013 2020 with the latter having considerably more investment in contrast to the er programs applied to other areas of yrb with intense planting of tree or grass epsnr focused on restoring degraded grasslands over syrb by various measures such as grazing regulation prohibition of land clearing for cropland ecological migration water conservation and artificial rain etc therefore this program aims to enable the self recovery of the local grass species through time rather than extensively planting new ones 3 materials and methods 3 1 study area yellow river basin yrb is china s second largest river basin which ranges from 95 87 e to 119 06 e and 32 16 n to 41 86 n with an area of approximately 0 81 million km2 fig 1a yrb plays an important role in china s social political and economic development by supporting around 30 of china s population bai et al 2016 and 15 of china s total cultivated area si and cai 2017 this eventually led to a long term national strategy proposed by the government of china in 2019 xi 2019 for the ecological protection and high quality development of the yrb as the cradle of chinese civilization the yellow river originates in the northern tibetan plateau flows through the loess plateau and the north china plain and eventually meets the bohai sea to the east of china fig 1a although the second largest river basin in china yrb s actual water storage is low relative to the average of chinese river basins with its climate being driven by the arid and semiarid continental monsoon wu et al 2013 annual precipitation increases from 123 mm over the northwestern yrb to 1021 mm over southeastern yrb she and xia 2013 annual pan evaporation ranges from 700 to 1800

rich in natural resources and is of great importance for agricultural production water safety ecological and environmental protection and sustainable development in the middle and lower reaches of the yrb which together is hereafter referred to as oyrb i e other part of yrb 3 2 data collection 3 2 1 total water storage anomaly the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and the grace follow on grace fo satellites provide detailed measurements of earth s gravity variations which on the land are mainly driven by the changes of total water storage tws including groundwater soil moisture surface water such as rivers lakes wetlands reservoirs and snow ice and canopy water xie et al 2016b in this work we investigated tws dynamics across yrb at 0 25 degree for the period between april 2002 and december 2021 using the newly released grace and grace fo product rl06 mascon solutions save et al 2016 from the center for space research https www2 csr utexas edu grace rl06 mascons html the data have grids at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and a monthly timescale derived as tws anomalies twsa relative to the baseline average from january 2004 to december 2009 previous studies showed that the grace mascon solutions have advantages over traditional spherical harmonic gravity solutions in reducing leakage errors across land ocean boundaries cao et al 2018 wiese et al 2016 during our study period twsa was further calculated by removing mean values from the raw data for each pixel in addition missing monthly data were filled by linear interpolation based on values corresponding to the previous and following month xie et al 2016a we conducted annual analyses over the period from 2002 to 2021 in this study for which the annual twsa was calculated as the average of the monthly data in the year 3 2 2 land use and land cover land use and land cover lulc change in the study region were monitored by the european space agency s esa climate change initiative cci

and conducted quality control on the data using the quality flag attached the land use and land cover types were reclassified into 9 categories to correspond with yrb natural environment including grassland cropland forest shrubland mosaic vegetation including lichens mosses sparse vegetation tree cover shrub or herbaceous cover urban and built up bareland water and permanent snow ice 3 2 3 normalized difference vegetation index the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi has been widely used as a proxy of greenness to show vegetation vigour and growth de jong et al 2011 detsch et al 2016 in this study we used the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis ndvi product mod13c2 collection 6 which were obtained from the nasa distributed active archive center https ladsweb

provided in the product such as atmospheric and adjacency corrections removal of observations with low pixel reliability vi quality and usefulness as well as pixels with high climatology aerosol snow ice cover water etc finally gaps in the images due to qa filtering were filled via temporal linear interpolation the seasonal and annual ndvi were aggregated as the average of the monthly ndvi for correlation analysis 3 2 4 precipitation precipitation data in this study were obtained from the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd he et al 2020 and in situ observations of weather gauge stations cmfd is a high spatial temporal resolution gridded near surface meteorological dataset that was developed specifically for research of land surface processes across china the dataset was produced through fusion of remote sensing imagery princeton reanalysis data and in situ observations at weather stations the dataset covers a period from january 1979 to december 2018 with a temporal resolution of three hours and a spatial resolution of 0 1 ground based precipitation observations from 82 meteorological stations were used to make up for the lack of cmfd 2019 2020 as depicted in fig 1a the stations are evenly distributed across yrb daily precipitation observations from the meteorological stations for the period 2019 2020 provided by the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration were obtained from the china meteorological data service center at the website http data cma cn all the precipitation measurements have undergone strict quality controls and could be utilized as the ground reference 3 2 5 other hydrological data to quantify the impacts of agricultural activities on the total water resources in yrb we used annual agricultural water consumption observations during our study period obtained from yellow river water resources bulletin https www yrcc gov cn agricultural water consumption including surface water and groundwater accounts for 60 of the water supply in the yrb ma et al 2020 monthly and annual in situ runoff data of the tangnaihai and lijin hydrological stations were collected from the yellow river sediment bulletin https www yrcc gov cn managed by yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources the tangnaihai hydrological station measures the total runoff out of syrb and the lijin hydrological station is the terminal hydrological station of the yellow river before it meets the bohai sea the monthly soil moisture and groundwater data of yrb for our study time were derived from watergap global hydrological model wghm döll et al 2003 this model simulates groundwater soil moisture and surface water at a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 and considers impacts from human water consumption döll et al 2003 3 3 trend and correlation analysis the theil sen median trend analysis method ts is a non parametric test for robust linear regression which doesn t require the data to be normally distributed and is resistant to outliers when assessing the rate of change in short or noisy time series data eastman et al 2009 the mann kendall test mk is commonly used as a trend test for the ts median slope operator eastman et al 2009 offering outputs of z scores for both the significance and direction of the trend as a result a positive slope z 1 96 represents a significant increase α 0 05 while a negative slope z 1 96 indicates a significant decrease fensholt and proud 2012 the combined ts and mk approaches have been widely used for analyzing trends in long time series of ecohydrological variables fensholt et al 2012 gao et al 2022 jiang et al 2015 we used the ts mk in this study to determine the trend and its significance in twsa and precipitation over yrb during study time the trend was calculated from the median of the slopes between all n n 1 2 pair wise combinations of time series data jiang et al 2015 preserving of the full temporal resolution of the twsa precipitation data rather than analyzing annually integrated values the pearson s correlation coefficient was applied to quantify the temporal relationships between tws ndvi and precipitation at annual seasonal and monthly scales over syrb oyrb and the entire yrb the seasonal trends in the monthly data of all variables were eliminated by subtracting the monthly time series from the monthly climatology means for the years evaluated we also examined the relationships among the three variables on pixel level across yrb at an annual scales xie et al 2019b correlation significance was computed at a 95 level using the t test 3 4 statistical analysis and modelling previous studies investigated the impacts of er projects but under the mixed context of climate change and agricultural activities leading to incomplete or qualitative conclusions over specific regions this study addressed this important knowledge gap by quantitatively separating er impacts from those of inter annual climatic variability and agricultural activity this also enables the methodological framework to be much more applicable to other parts of the world with complex environments we used generalized additive mixed models gamms for capturing the relationships between tws as the dependent variable and a set of independent predictor variables that represent climate variability agricultural activities and ecological restoration programs respectively gamms as semi parametric multivariate regression models can efficiently incorporate mixed linear and non linear model terms to account for different types of effects heimhuber et al 2019 the potential nonlinear effects of er agricultural activities and natural factors on total water storage for the whole yrb at the yearly scale could be modeled with the nonparametric smoothing function in model 1 eq 1 as ecohydrological processes and er vary across yrb different independent predictor variables were also used to identify the relationships between water storage change and explanatory variables at the monthly scale model 2 eq 2 is for the yrb and model 3 eq 3 is for syrb the impacts on water storage from er programs were mainly driven by the conversion of certain land use and land cover types such as farmland to forest and grassland or vice versa in addition as yrb is a densely populated basin the impacts from agricultural activities e g irrigation cannot be discounted in addition to human activities in agriculture and er climatic variability effects e g precipitation et must also be considered before modeling correlation analysis and a variance inflation factor vif function were used to select variables and test the multicollinearity between candidate explanatory variables firstly factors with strong correlation r 0 85 were eliminated from models by correlation analysis then the vif function was used for collinear analysis to choose one variable to represent the variables that are collinear e g the grassland area and forest area more details on the correlation and collinear analysis are included in the supplementary material figurea1 figurea2 and figurea3 based on this analysis we selected precipitation runoff agricultural water consumption grassland area as the ideal candidates for modeling the relationships among total water resources climate change agricultural water consumption and er at annual scale the vif value of the selected explanatory variations was at an acceptable level vif 9 table a1 in the supplementary material which indicates that there is no multicollinearity problem between the selected explanatory variations however much more vairables e g evapotranspiration industrial water consumption forest area were not considered in the optimal model the optimal explanatory model variables were determined based on the significance p value and the lower akaike information criterion weights of the explanatory variables derived from the gamms the model performance was at last evaluated by residual distributions and the difference between model fitting values and observations to avoid model overfitting the wiggliness penalty function was used which was designed to maximize the fit of the spline to the data while minimizing model noise gamms are especially suited for modeling variable relationships among multiple time series variables where cyclical model terms and residual autocorrelation cannot be ignored in addition a first order autoregressive moving average arma structure was applied to the residuals to minimize residual autocorrelation on different time scales the driving variables of tws change in the same region are different in this paper we analyzed from two time scales the annual scale and the monthly scale finally we used the following gamms models to quantify the importance of individual explanatory variables for tws changes at annual monthly temporal scales over yrb syrb areas eq 1 model 1 is for yrb at annual scale while eq 2 model 2 and eq 3 model 3 are for yrb and syrb at monthly scale 1 tw s t α 0 s log 10 p t s log 10 q t s log 10 l c g s t a w c e 2 tw s t α 0 α 1 t i m e year s log 10 p t s

driven land use and land cover changes in yrb at the initial er period in 2001 there were nine major land use and land cover lulc types across yrb fig 2 a with grassland being the dominant lulc over syrb and north oyrb and covering around 61 89 of the entire basin cropland covered the second largest area 28 93 followed by forest 3 99 both of which were mostly located in the south eastern part of yrb bare ground composed of sand and desert accounted for 3 14 of yrb locating in the far northern part of the basin we found large increases in natural land cover types at the expense of human intensive land use cover since large scale er programs took effect fig 2b for example consistent and significant increases were found in the coverage of both grass and forest land types during our study time this was also evidenced by the spatial match between such increases and the scope of ggp and tnsp programs spatial map in fig 1a this er related expansion of grasslands and forests was in contrast to the decline of cropland and bare ground which showed opposite trajectories fig 2b in addition fast urbanization in yrb was observed to impose a triple growth in the area of built up land from 2002 to 2020 fig 2b which indicated the growing confict between eochydrological resources and human habitation we found the abovementioned overall lulc changes of the entire yrb were mainly driven by those in oyrb because syrb exhibited distinct changes in land use and land cover types fig 2c before 2005 when the er program epsnr was applied in syrb it was mostly covered by grassland around 86 21 in 2001 fig 2c it however dramatically declined from 2002 to 2005 due to reckless land clearing for agriculture e g cropping land and land degradation caused by overgrazing li et al 2013 this can be reflected by the concurrent rapid increase in the cropland area in syrb fig 2c as epsnr focused on self recovery of the local grassland instead of active planting the impact took effect slowly but clearly stopped the continuing decline of grassland area in 2013 thus grassland area stabilized in syrb before it started increasing in 2016 in addition the grassland area in syrb decreased significantly between 2018 and 2020 while bareland increased significantly distinct lulc changes across syrb and oyrb indicated the different impacts of various large scale er programs on landscapes vegetation showed sharp long term greening trends over the yrb during our study time fig 3 a which was likely related to er effects i e more grassland and forest but less bare ground large grassland degradation and increases in cropland area were reported over syrb by multiple studies before the epsnr applied in 2005 li et al 2013 however ndvi profile of syrb still presents overall increase in greenness during our study period fig 3b this indicates that some land changes like conversion from degraded grazing lands to croplands driven by financial incentive might not be reflected in vegetation greenness which could also confound the interpretation of er impacts e g epsnr over syrb in this case 4 2 tws changes during er programs the trajectories of the total water resources over yrb fig 4 a represented by the time series of tws anomalies twsa were driven by the combined impacts of both natural climate and human activities ecological restoration programs and agriculture monthly twsa was observed to fluctuate at both seasonal and inter annual scales from 2002 to 2021 with seasonal values normally peaking in autumn and being lowest in spring fig 4a despite the variations the inter annual trend in twsa over yrb presented clear and consistent water storage depletion during our study period with a significant loss rate p 0 001 of 3 70 km3 yr in volume equivalent to 3 70 billion tons yr in mass fig 4b such a dramatic decline in twsa showed that yrb water budget was under an overall imbalance during our study time with water loss largely overweighing water gain we found both land use and land cover changes fig 2b and twsa fig 4b approached their multi year average in the year 2011 which indicated that tws changes over yrb coincided with er driven land use and land cover changes the trend in twsa over the entire yrb was largely driven by that over oyrb presenting a similar twsa trajectory throughout the study period fig 4a c by contrast twsa over the syrb with a distinct er program than in the oyrb did not exhibit similar changes over time to those of the entire basin fig 4d in particular twsa over syrb showed an overall increasing trend from 2002 to 2012 before it started to decline then to steep rise between 2018 and 2021 fig 4d opposite twsa change trends across syrb and oyrb demonstrated the distinct impacts of various large scale er programs on hydrology changes in water storage across space over the yrb during our study period were investigated using theil sen median trend analysis method ts and mann kendall test mk spatial tws trends during 2002 and 2021 showed a distinct geographic difference partitioning the yrb into two spatial zones the syrb had significant positive trends while the oyrb showed the opposite ranging from 31 mm y 1 to 5 mm y 1 fig 5 a an area located in the east central region was observed to have the highest loss in tws during our study period corresponding to the hotspot of er programs with ggp nfcp and tnsp all being applied to focus upon soil erosion forest conservation protection of agricultural and pastoral land and human settlements viña et al 2016 wang et al 2010 wei et al 2020 we also observed that tws declines were greatly accelerated by er related land use and land cover changes e g grassland and forest of which the magnitude varied among different land use and land cover types fig 5b the rate of decline in tws was observed to be doubled in planted areas than those over natural areas for both grassland and forest fig 5b in addition tws in both natural and manmade forest areas showed higher water depletion rates than those in grassland areas 4 3 decoupled relationship between water storage and vegetation greenness under er the results in the previous sections indicated the potential impacts of er programs on ecosystems and water resources across the yrb which may in turn disrupt their natural connections we thus investigated these relationships over the yrb and focused on syrb and oyrb since they had distinct ecohydrological responses representing the final water availability within the water cycle tws showed negative correlations with ndvi in oyrb at monthly seasonal and annual scales table 2 similarly negative correlations were also found between precipitation and tws in oyrb by contrast tws was positively correlated with precipitation and ndvi over the syrb which is commonly expected from previous studies over different parts of the world ndehedehe and ferreira 2020 penatti et al 2015 xie et al 2019a yang et al 2014b overall tws was negatively correlated with precipitation and ndvi across the entire yrb table 2 compared with tws precipitation retained notably positive correlations with ndvi as expected over all parts of the yrb at different temporal scales these negative correlations between vegetation and water storage over oyrb may be largely attributed to an imbalanced water budget caused by the er programs applied there which involved intensive land use and land cover changes although these er activities along with a slight increasing trend in precipitation over oyrb fig 6 e would favour vegetation growth and be reflected by an increasing ndvi large consumption of water storage required by the er programs may have well exceeded the precipitation supply leading to tws decline this may eventually cause relationship between the final water availability tws and vegetation to break down as shown in table 2 the common positive correlations between precipitation and tws over syrb uncommon negative correlations over oyrb table 2 both illustrated the interference of human activities e g ecological restoration and agriculture irrigation activities on oyrb s water resources precipitation in syrb contributed to its water resource increase and the oyrb had less precipitation than its human consumption water resulting in its water resource losses spatial correlations between vegetation and hydrological variables further validated the abovementioned disrupted relationships fig 6 on an annual basis tws showed significant negative correlations with ndvi over most of the oyrb grid averaged r 0 85 while positive correlations existed over a large part of the syrb fig 6a precipitation had positive correlations with ndvi across the yrb although these were only significant in the north central oyrb fig 6b precipitation and tws generally showed no significant correlations over yrb fig 6c precipitation presented an increasing trend over 67 of yrb fig 6d concentrating in the oyrb these contrary spatial trends between precipitation and tws over the oyrb explained their lack of correlation during our study period which was likely to be caused by human activities such as large scale er programs overall precipitation increased over oyrb fig 6e precipitation over syrb increased between 2002 and 2012 then decreased and began to increase in 2015 especially after 2018 fig 6f when a corresponding change in tws was also observed there fig 4b 4 4 separation of er impact on water resources our results showed a significant depletion of tws 3 70 billion tons yr over the yrb during the post er period fig 4a which was a result of combined climate and human influences ecological restoration and agricultural activities thus based on the combined use of meteorological land use and land cover and water storage data we used statistical modelling of generalized additive mixed models gamms to disentangle human versus climatic drivers for evaluating er impacts after the removal of collinearity and optimal regression model analysis four independent predictor variables were chosen for the dependent variable tws on an annual basis representing the respective impacts of inter annual climate variability precipitation agricultural activities agricultural water consumption ecological restoration programs grassland area change and mix of other potential natural and human factors runoff the model performance r2 for all models built with these four predictor variables were shown in fig 7 a the goodness of the fit for the models built with different variables varied greatly in performance the optimal model model 1 eq 1 with the highest performance r2 0 94 rmse 5 63 mm auc 0 96 table 3 among all variable combinations contained all these four variables fig 7a of which each showed significant correlation p 0 01 with tws table a2 in the supplementary material larger r2 value r2 0 94 was associated with stronger explanatory ability of the model the smaller root mean square error rmse 5 63 mm was associated with good prediction ability of gamms the area under curve auc value of the receiver operating characteristic roc curve was 0 96 which indicates a good prediction of tws via the model furthermore the autocorrelation coefficients of the residuals for model 1 s prediction was 0 showing that model 1 can well simulate the tws data the individual contributions of the four predicting variables grassland area change runoff precipitation and agricultural water consumption to the changes in tws at the annual scale were estimated as 66 31 26 12 11 73 and 5 86 respectively this indicates that dramatic water storage loss in the yrb were mostly attributed to land use and land cover change driven by large scale ecological restoration programs e g grass area changes in contrast only around 11 73 of tws changes were attributed to inter annual variability in precipitation relatively agricultural activities in the yrb were found to provide little inconsequentiality on water resources during the study period 5 86 in addition the high contribution of runoff to tws 26 12 may reflect potential factors not included in other dependent variables such as reservoir regulation at the monthly scale the optimal model for tws in the yrb was composed of precipitation groundwater runoff and ndvi the model performance r2 for models built with these four predictor variables were shown in figurea4 supplementary material the goodness of fit for models built with different variables varied in performance r2 0 70 the optimal model model 2 eq 2 with the highest performance r2 0 93 rmse 8 47 mm auc 0 92 table 3 among all variable combinations contained all these four variables figurea4 in the supplementary material of which each showed significant correlation p 0 001 with tws table a4 in the supplementary material at the monthly scale the optimal model for tws in the syrb was composed of precipitation et soil moisture runoff and ndvi while the goodness of fit for models was generally high with r2 0 76 the optimal model model 3 eq 3 with the highest performance r2 0 87 rmse 13 56 mm auc 0 90 table 3 among all variable combinations contained all these five variables figurea5 in the supplementary material of which each showed significant correlation p 0 05 with tws table a6 in the supplementary material groundwater which reflected the impacts from human activities e g agricultural irrigation and er programs was the highest contributor approximately 9 88 to tws depletion followed by the vegetation greenness represented by ndvi fig 7b monthly precipitation variability was observed to be the least influential on water changes over the yrb the impacts of human activities represented by groundwater on the syrb was almost negligible compared with that in oyrb fig 7b with the optimal model consisting of precipitation evapotranspiration et runoff ndvi and soil moisture sm sm had the highest contribution to tws changes over syrb followed by et ndvi and precipitation 1 49 1 38 and 0 57 respectively similar to the whole yrb runoff had little influences on tws changes in the syrb at monthly scale distinct climate e g precipitation and evaportranspiration and human activities e g er programs agriculture and grazing across yrb and syrb led to various quantitative attribution of changes in water storage 5 discussion 5 1 land use and land cover changes explained by individual er programs changes in land use and land cover types across the yrb have been driven by multiple large scale er programs implemented since 1998 fig 8 these er programs have different restoration strategies such as the grassland restoration over syrb under epsnr as well as the extensive revegetation of forest and grassland over oyrb under ggp nfcp and tnsp fig 8 our results showed er programs had induced a total area of lulc changes over 187 093 km2 from 2002 to 2020 in yrb figs 2 8 most of these changes were found over oyrb in the form of grassland and forest expansion at the expense of farmland and bare ground fig 8 overall ggp replaced many farm and abandoned lands with trees and grass over the central part of oyrb while nfcp and tnsp focused on natural forests and afforestation in the northern oyrb fig 8 these er programs all had multiple phases with most of their first phases concluding in 2010 before the next phase that involved more financial and labor investment which might be associated with the larger water storage loss rate from 2012 to 2021 table 1 fig 4b by contrast epsnr driven vegetation expansion over the syrb was far less extensive than those in oyrb under er programs fig 8 this was because epsnr focused on natural restoration such as grazing restriction or termination and prohibition of land clearing for cropland instead of intensive lulc changes in addition substantial tree plantation under other er programs would be challenging due to the continental plateau climate in syrb thus epsnr mainly reduced the interference of human activities and the intensity of land use in syrb forming a significant contrast to er programs applied over oyrb these results indicate the need of partitioning the combined ecohydrological effects from multiple er programs which will allow decision makers to draw quantitative insights on whether different er policies that cover specific regions outperformed others and why 5 2 partitioned impacts of multiple er programs on total freshwater resources previous studies investigated the impacts of er projects but under the mixed context of climate change and agricultural activities leading to incomplete or qualitative conclusions for example large water storage losses in yrb over the recent two decades have been identified in previous studies jing et al 2019 lv et al 2019 of which the main drivers were considered to be climate change or more often the agricultural activities such as irrigation xie et al 2019a zhang et al 2019 however a recent study over dryland area in northern china brought attention on side effect of large scale er programs on total water resources zhao et al 2020 nevertheless the population density of the northern china is low with few human activities e g agricultural irrigation leading to limited applications of the study to many of the er areas in other parts of the world adding to this work our study addressed the important knowledge gap by quantitatively disentangling human versus climatic drivers for evaluating er impacts this is especially essential over the yellow river basin s complex environment of high climatic variability and intensive agricultural activities coinciding with concentrated er efforts which is also commonly seen across the world as a result this study s framework is applicable to other parts of the globe and is encouraged to be applied for wholistic er impact evaluations our study over yrb found that the contribution of er programs to tws changes was more than double as those combined from inter annual climatic variability and agricultural activities in particular the water resources over yrb experienced a consistent decline regardless of the overall increase in precipitation during the study time eventually causing the correlation between the total water storage and vegetation greenness to break down table 2 widespread vegetation greening was promoted due to significant er driven lulc changes such as conversion of farmland to forest and extensive revegetation of grass and trees especially over the oyrb these activities across the years have inevitably required increasingly more water use leading to substantial water loss this was also evdiented by our finding that the rate of decline in tws was observed to be doubled in planted areas than those over natural areas for both grassland and forest fig 5b furthermore large scale modifications to the land surface in water limited regions like afforestation and grass planting from bare land could gradually alter hydrological processes shao et al 2021 which in turn change the regional climate to favor or degrade existing ecosystems ge et al 2020 yin et al 2021 in contrast to the consistent tws decline over the oyrb despite increase in precipitation fig 6e tws in syrb had a statistically significant upward trend p 0 01 from 2002 to 2011 before it started declining in 2012 then significantly increased since 2017 fig 4b such a tws trajectory in the syrb was found to closely follow that of precipitation over the same region fig 6f these results indicated that tws variations in oyrb had been driven by er programs while those in syrb had been driven by natural climatic variability other studies also showed that climate change contributied much more to runoff change in the syrb yan et al 2020 water storage change was attributed to the climatic variability while the intense human activities e g reservoir operation also generated a significant effect on twsc in the yrb xie et al 2019a furthermore we found the difference in er programs over the oyrb and the syrb expressed as different trajectories in tws showed that water depletion was largely associated with intense land use and land cover changes driven er programs as a result this study highlights the use of combined land use and land cover data and grace derived tws changes to better evaluate large scale er programs than the applications with solely vegetation indices for future improved decision making of environmental management the quantitative attribution of changes in lulc and water storage to individual er programs and the novel finding of er induced ecohydrological decoupling have not been published in previous studies all of which are critical for policy evaluation and decision making 5 3 balance between future er programs and water resources in a densely populated environment motivated by the united nations un 2030 agenda for sustainable development goals sdgs countries around the world have been actively seeking for the actions to combat climate change fitoka et al 2020 maeda et al 2021 playing a crucial role in realizing these sdgs china s passion for ecological civilization over the recent years has been unprecedented li et al 2021a while increasing amount of national ecological restoration programs have been launched or proposed this study showed pronounced but different impacts on water storage can be imposed by various large scale policy driven er activities through the time water resource conservation has rarely been considered in large scale er programs yet will eventually determine the fate of the restored landscape this led to an important question on how to achieve sustainable utilization of freshwater resources in restoration practices especially in water limited environment with dense population a decreasing trend in water resources over the restored areas will continue or reverse may be largely dependent on the interactions between future er policies and hydrometeorological conditions for instance precipitation is projected to increase across yrb in the coming years wang et al 2021b which may favor both the vegetation growth and water storage slowing water loss however both this study and previous studies showed that large scale plantation tends to trigger much more water loss than natural rehabilitation particularly in water limited areas wang et al 2021a wang et al 2008 yan et al 2017 therefore sustainable conservation policies are required under future er programs to balance land restoration and water resources this would involve careful decision making by policy makers on the opportunity cost of water storage for revegetation li 2021 zhao et al 2020 including 1 easing of er programs focusing less on extensive replantation and thinning dense vegetation of some areas or selecting for the specific vegetation types in ers for different areas and climate conditions 2 maintenance of the current level of er programs or 3 application of larger scale er programs with strong revegetation efforts strategy 1 will reduce ecosystem water consumption and slow down or reverse the current tws decreasing trend but at the expense of rapid green up over the restored areas brancalion and holl 2020 ellison et al 2012 on the other hand strategies 2 and 3 are expected to see an improved ecological environment across the basin but at the risk of exacerbating water use and maintaining the current decreasing trend in tws herron et al 2002 schwärzel et al 2020 under an arid or semi arid climate a sustained decline in water storage will eventually elevate plant water stress reducing the survival rates of the artificially restored vegetation and even harming the local vegetation holl and brancalion 2020 therefore the adoption of strategies 2 and 3 will need close monitoring of groundwater and plants over the long term in addition farming and grazing have been greatly enhanced to meet the increasing demand for the fast growing population urban and industrial areas uses all over the world for example monthly groundwater observations over yrb through the last ten years showed similar decreasing trend as that in tws observed in this study zhang et al 2019 indicating a need to regularize agricultural activities such irrigation especially under large scale er programs soil moisture in different layers has diverse ecohydrological processes surface soil moisture 100 cm an important water resource for plant growth was positively correlated with prcipitation and more sensitive than groundwater to precipitation in the yrb li et al 2016b while deep soil moisture 100 cm depletion and recovery processes are related to vegetation types liu et al 2022 and afforestation can deplete deep soil moisture kong et al 2022 by incorporating total water storage change information derived from gravitational satellite observations this study provides a new perspective of water use assessment for er programs which may make a valuable contribution towards improving future er strategies directly relevant to multiple un sustainable development goals 5 4 novelty limitations and uncertainties of this study the novelty of this paper are 1 many previous studies focused on either water decline or vegetation increase under only one er project or the impact from the total er projects in a region li et al 2020 song et al 2022 sun et al 2020 in contrast our study aimed to compare the respective ecohydrological impacts from multiple er projects this allowed our study to draw the conclusion on which er policies over which regions outperformed others and why 2 there were studies that investigated the impacts of er projects but under the context of both climate change and agricultural activities li et al 2021b lv et al 2019 zhai et al 2022 leading to indirect or qualitative conclusions this study addressed this important knowledge gap by quantitatively separating er impacts from those of inter annual climatic variability and agricultural activity this enables the methodological framework to be much more applicable to other parts of the world with complex environments 3 this study aimed to investigate the impacts of er on both ecology and hydrology we firstly quantified land use changes driven by different er projects then associated such changes to changes in water resources therefore not like many previous studies that focused on changes in either ecological or hydrological components this study closely linked the ecohydrological interactions under respective er projects our study showed that the gamm models have value of quantifying the potential nonlinear relationships between ecological restoration programs agricultural activities natural factors and the total water storage however there were a few uncertainties in such contribution analysis need to be discussed for example many other anthropological driver factors e g reservoir water domestic water use etc could not be included in the analysis which would affect the performance of the final model moreover uncertainties could result from rather coarse resolution datasets such as grace which inevitably ignored details in the interactions between driving factors and tws over small regional areas in addition uncertainties could also result from the use of mixed observed and simulation data as well as the data resampling etc despite these uncertainties and limitations results from this study can still offer valuable insights of how what and why different er programs affected the total water resources across the yellow river basin which can guide future large scale ecological and conservation programs future work with more advanced models more driving factors and datasets of higher spatial resolutions are needed to reduce the uncertainties and improve the model performance 6 conclusions while ambitious national ecological restoration programs have been increasingly implemented or proposed in china to balance economic development and environmental protection a quantitative evaluation on the ecohydrological impacts of large scale ecological restoration er programs particularly over water limited areas with complex environment of high climatic variability and intensive human activities has been absent in the current study we investigated the er driven land use and land cover changes and quantified the associated loss and gain in the total water storage across the yellow river basin in china er impacts were disentangled leading in individual attribution of inter annual climatic variability and agricultural activity with statistical modelling our results showed large increases in natural land cover types e g forest and grassland at the expense of human intensive land use cover such as farmland with the combined changes resulting in a concurrent dramatic water storage loss of 3 70 billion tons yr across the basin over the 20 year study period investigated this eventually led to a decoupled relationship between water storage and vegetation over the yrb we found er played the dominant role in water loss 66 among all factors considered with high investment er programs that were involved in intense land cover changes over oyrb causing the highest water deficits therefore the findings observed from this study can provide critical lessons for large scale restoration efforts globally more importantly this study provides a framework based on the publicly freely and globally available datasets that is applicable to substantial part of the global like yrb and can help decision makers to directly inform the water cost and changes in different land use and land cover types of er for future sustainable er strategies declaration of competing interest the authors

2716,china has implemented some of the world s most ambitious ecological restoration er programs over the past two decades these large scale multi billion dollar projects have achieved widespread greening across the country however the impacts of different er driven land cover modifications on total water resources remain largely unknown particularly over areas characterized by complex environments of coupled human and natural systems here we quantified ecohydrological impacts of multiple er programs applied over various parts of china s yellow river basin yrb with their lumped effects being partitioned into individual ones er related drivers were disentangled leading in individual attribution of inter annual climatic variability and agricultural activity with cross sensor satellite observations and statistical modelling our results showed an ecohydrological decoupling of water storage and vegetation greenness attributed to er programs increases in natural land cover types e g forest and grassland were found at the expense of human intensive land use such as farmland with the combined changes resulting in a concurrent dramatic water storage loss of 3 70 billion tons year from 2002 to 2021 er was the dominant driver of water loss 66 among all factors considered commensurate with areal land cover change and er program cost the entire basin was divided into two regions with opposite water trends by the er activities with different restoration strategies this study s framework is applicable to substantial part of the globe like yrb and is encouraged to be applied for more wholistic er impact evaluations keywords ecological restoration total water storage land use and land cover change grace human activities sdgs data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in response to extreme societal consequences of ecosystem degradation and climate change governments around the world have increasingly recognized the importance of large scale ecological restoration er lv et al 2019 china alone has invested more than usd 378 5 billion over the past decade in a series of ambitious national er programs that focused on revegetation and land use and land cover lulc modifications li et al 2021a including natural forest land resource conservation grain for green three north shelterbelt forest system beijing and tianjin sandstorm source controlling wildlife conservation and natural reserve development and key shelterbelt construction programs pang et al 2020 viña et al 2016 wang et al 2014 yuan et al 2014 amongst others often in combination with small projects engaged by the local governments these programs have made pronounced changes to the ecological environment across many parts of china for example ecological restoration projects were found to result in socio economic improvements liu et al 2008 and reductions of aeolian erosion intensity lü et al 2012 these were attributed to an increasing ecological rehabilitation within various environments and climatic regions such as in northern gao et al 2015 and hilly southern china wang et al 2015 beijing tianjin sand source region li et al 2016c horqin sandy land zhang et al 2012 the karst region in southwest china qi et al 2013 and loess plateau shao et al 2021 wu et al 2019 while changes in ecosystems may have a notable influence on hydrological fluxes e g runoff or evapotranspiration or individual water storage components e g soil moisture their net impacts on total water resources remains unclear and depends on the local environment such as land use and land cover soil terrain climate dong et al 2020 venkatesh et al 2022 for instance some research showed vegetation expansion reduced runoff feng et al 2016 mcvicar et al 2007 zhang et al 2018 and soil moisture jia et al 2017 yang et al 2014a in semiarid regions while others observed the opposite result in wet regions lian et al 2020 in addition previous studies mostly focused on either water decline or vegetation increase under only one er project or the summative impact from all i e the total er projects in a single region greatly hindering efficient policy evaluation and decision making a recent study over a desert area named mu us sandy land in northern china without agricultural activities found ecological restoration programs induced significant water storage depletion over time zhao et al 2020 this indicates that large scale vegetation greening in water limited and densely populated areas may cause increasingly conflicted demands for water between ecosystems and human usage however current understanding of such conflicts particularly over complex environments of coupled human and natural systems has still been absent zhao et al 2020 the yellow river basin yrb located in an arid and semiarid region of north china is a large with an area of approximately 0 81 million km2 but environmentally vulnerable basin with severe water shortages wang et al 2019 as one of the most densely populated basin around 0 42 billion people it is also of utmost importance for china s food production natural resources and socioeconomic development cai and rosegrant 2004 due to rapid population and economic growth yrb has been converted from a nature dominated to a human dominated environment to curb environmental degradation and improve human well being major ecological restoration projects a total investment of roughly usd 109 7 billion have been implemented over the yrb since the 1990s as a result yrb hosts one of the most complex environments in the world in which landscape have been shaped by changing climate agricultural activities e g irrigation of cropland and large scale ecological restoration projects previous studies have shown increases in total vegetation greenness li et al 2016a and productivity feng et al 2013 over large parts of yrb during the past two decades this was also accompanied by a decline in runoff bao et al 2019 wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 zhong et al 2021 and soil moisture jian et al 2015 but an increase in actual evapotranspiration ma et al 2019 despite a body of studies that have been conducted to study changes in vegetation greenness or individual hydrological fluxes over the yrb the impacts and drivers of different er driven land use and land cover modifications on total water resources and the quantitative contribution of individual er programs remain largely unknown this is particularly true in the areas with high climatic variability and intensive agricultural activities which cover substantial part of the globe thus instead of focusing on changes in either ecological or hydrological components under single or summative er projects that have been done in previous studies this study aims to closely link the ecohydrological interactions across respective er projects apart to the effects of climate change and agricultural activities by integrating cross sensor satellite observations of terrestrial water storage as well as land use and land cover data in this study we developed an innovative approach to investigate the er driven lulc changes to quantify the associated impacts on total freshwater resources in the yellow river basin in china er related drivers were disentangled leading in individual attribution of inter annual climatic variability and agricultural activity with statistical modelling to remove the effects of rainfall irrigation etc specifically we aimed to 1 map spatiotemporal changes in lulc types driven by respective ecological restoration programs 2 quantify the total water storage tws changes induced by lulc conversions and 3 separate er impacts on total water resources from those attributed to climate change and agricultural activities the proposed methodological framework here based on the publicly freely and globally available datasets and methods will allow the maximum simplicity and benefits of such study for assessments of conservation strategies across most parts of the world 2 ecological restoration programs in yrb four major ecological restoration er programs have been implemented during the last two decades to address various environmental problems over different parts of yrb table 1 fig 1 a including the grain for green project ggp natural forest land resource conservation project nfcp ecological protection project of sanjiangyuan natural reserve epsnr and three north shelterbelt project tnsp afforestation area completed and the state investment of these key ecological restoration projects in china were obtained from the 2018 china forestry and grassland development report table 1 and fig 1b ggp focusing on the upper and middle reaches of yrb except the source region fig 1a is the biggest ecological restoration program in china feng et al 2013 xu et al 2004 with a total investment of over usd 61 billion this er program has an ambitious goal to extensively plant vegetation which includes converting substantial degraded farm lands into forests and grassland feng et al 2016 the largest afforestation under ggp took place in 2003 which increased 61 960 km2 forest area with half from previous farmland fig 1b the first phase of ggp finished in 2010 before it went into the second phrase in 2012 restoring farmland for trees under ggp ceased between 2009 and 2013 before it continued rapidly in 2014 fig 1b nfcp has been another large scale ecological restoration program applied over the same area as ggp since 1998 li and zhai 2002 the primary goal of the nfcp is to protect and restore natural forests through means such as logging ban replanting etc the nfcp has three stages of short medium and long term goals the short term stage 1998 2000 reduced timber harvesting from natural forests and offered alternative employment for staff from the traditional forest enterprises the medium term stage 2001 2010 aimed to protect forests for ecological benefits and increase the capacity of timber harvesting by planting new trees the final long term stage 2011 2050 aims to restore natural forests and meet the increasing domestic demand for timber with the planted forests nfcp focused on protecting existing forests and planted less trees than ggp with the main nfcp afforestation event occurring in 2009 fig 1b tnsp started in 1979 and has the longest history among all er programs in china this program is designed to plant trees and protect local forest grassland in order to reduce sand and wind erosion over desert areas of the three north region i e northeast north and northwest china li et al 2012 in total 336 200 km2 of desertification land over the three north region were restored with widely planted trees fig 1b with total 0 38 million km2 forest area from 1979 to 2018 and protection for millions of hectares of desert grassland epsnr was launched in 2005 aiming to fully restore the ecological environment over the sanjiangyuan region which comprises the source zone of yrb syrb it consists of two phases 2005 2012 and 2013 2020 with the latter having considerably more investment in contrast to the er programs applied to other areas of yrb with intense planting of tree or grass epsnr focused on restoring degraded grasslands over syrb by various measures such as grazing regulation prohibition of land clearing for cropland ecological migration water conservation and artificial rain etc therefore this program aims to enable the self recovery of the local grass species through time rather than extensively planting new ones 3 materials and methods 3 1 study area yellow river basin yrb is china s second largest river basin which ranges from 95 87 e to 119 06 e and 32 16 n to 41 86 n with an area of approximately 0 81 million km2 fig 1a yrb plays an important role in china s social political and economic development by supporting around 30 of china s population bai et al 2016 and 15 of china s total cultivated area si and cai 2017 this eventually led to a long term national strategy proposed by the government of china in 2019 xi 2019 for the ecological protection and high quality development of the yrb as the cradle of chinese civilization the yellow river originates in the northern tibetan plateau flows through the loess plateau and the north china plain and eventually meets the bohai sea to the east of china fig 1a although the second largest river basin in china yrb s actual water storage is low relative to the average of chinese river basins with its climate being driven by the arid and semiarid

on grace fo satellites provide detailed measurements of earth s gravity variations which on the land are mainly driven by the changes of total water storage tws including groundwater soil moisture surface water such as rivers lakes wetlands reservoirs and snow ice and canopy water xie et al 2016b in this work we investigated tws dynamics across yrb at 0 25 degree for the period between april 2002 and december 2021 using the newly released grace and grace fo product rl06 mascon solutions save et al 2016 from the center for space research https www2 csr utexas edu grace rl06 mascons html the data have grids at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and a monthly timescale derived as tws anomalies twsa relative to the baseline average from january 2004 to december 2009 previous studies showed that the grace mascon solutions have advantages over traditional spherical harmonic gravity solutions in reducing leakage errors across land ocean boundaries cao et al 2018 wiese et al 2016 during our study period twsa was further calculated by removing mean values from the raw data for each pixel in addition missing monthly data were filled by linear interpolation based on values corresponding to the previous and following month xie et al 2016a we conducted annual analyses over the period from 2002 to 2021 in this study for which the annual twsa was calculated as the average of the monthly data in the year 3 2 2 land use and land cover land use and land cover lulc change in the study region were monitored by the european space agency s esa climate change initiative cci

grassland cropland forest shrubland mosaic vegetation including lichens mosses sparse vegetation tree cover shrub or herbaceous cover urban and built up bareland water and permanent snow ice 3 2 3 normalized difference vegetation index the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi has been widely used as a proxy of greenness to show vegetation vigour and growth de jong et al 2011 detsch et al 2016 in this study we used the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis ndvi product mod13c2 collection 6 which were obtained from the nasa distributed active archive center https ladsweb

correlation analysis 3 2 4 precipitation precipitation data in this study were obtained from the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd he et al 2020 and in situ observations of weather gauge stations cmfd is a high spatial temporal resolution gridded near surface meteorological dataset that was developed specifically for research of land surface processes across china the dataset was produced through fusion of remote sensing imagery princeton reanalysis data and in situ observations at weather stations the dataset covers a period from january 1979 to december 2018 with a temporal resolution of three hours and a spatial resolution of 0 1 ground based precipitation observations from 82 meteorological stations were used to make up for the lack of cmfd 2019 2020 as depicted in fig 1a the stations are evenly distributed across yrb daily precipitation observations from the meteorological stations for the period 2019 2020 provided by the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration were obtained from the china meteorological data service center at the website http data cma cn all the precipitation measurements have undergone strict quality controls and could be utilized as the ground reference 3 2 5 other hydrological data to quantify the impacts of agricultural activities on the total water resources in yrb we used annual agricultural water consumption observations during our study period obtained from yellow river water resources bulletin https www yrcc gov cn agricultural water consumption including surface water and groundwater accounts for 60 of the water supply in the yrb ma et al 2020 monthly and annual in situ runoff data of the tangnaihai and lijin hydrological stations were collected from the yellow river sediment bulletin https www yrcc gov cn managed by yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources the tangnaihai hydrological station measures the total runoff out of syrb and the lijin hydrological station is the terminal hydrological station of the yellow river before it meets the bohai sea the monthly soil moisture and groundwater data of yrb for our study time were derived from watergap global hydrological model wghm döll et al 2003 this model simulates groundwater soil moisture and surface water at a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 and considers impacts from human water consumption döll et al 2003 3 3 trend and correlation analysis the theil sen median trend analysis method ts is a non parametric test for robust linear regression which doesn t require the data to be normally distributed and is resistant to outliers when assessing the rate of change in short or noisy time series data eastman et al 2009 the mann kendall test mk is commonly used as a trend test for the ts median slope operator eastman et al 2009 offering outputs of z scores for both the significance and direction of the trend as a result a positive slope z 1 96 represents a significant increase α 0 05 while a negative slope z 1 96 indicates a significant decrease fensholt and proud 2012 the combined ts and mk approaches have been widely used for analyzing trends in long time series of ecohydrological variables fensholt et al 2012 gao et al 2022 jiang et al 2015 we used the ts mk in this study to determine the trend and its significance in twsa and precipitation over yrb during study time the trend was calculated from the median of the slopes between all n n 1 2 pair wise combinations of time series data jiang et al 2015 preserving of the full temporal resolution of the twsa precipitation data rather than analyzing annually integrated values the pearson s correlation coefficient was applied to quantify the temporal relationships between tws ndvi and precipitation at annual seasonal and monthly scales over syrb oyrb and the entire yrb the seasonal trends in the monthly data of all variables were eliminated by subtracting the monthly time series from the monthly climatology means for the years evaluated we also examined the relationships among the three variables on pixel level across yrb at an annual scales xie et al 2019b correlation significance was computed at a 95 level using the t test 3 4 statistical analysis and modelling previous studies investigated the impacts of er projects but under the mixed context of climate change and agricultural activities leading to incomplete or qualitative conclusions over specific regions this study addressed this important knowledge gap by quantitatively separating er impacts from those of inter annual climatic variability and agricultural activity this also enables the methodological framework to be much more applicable to other parts of the world with complex environments we used generalized additive mixed models gamms for capturing the relationships between tws as the dependent variable and a set of independent predictor variables that represent climate variability agricultural activities and ecological restoration programs respectively gamms as semi parametric multivariate regression models can efficiently incorporate mixed linear and non linear model terms to account for different types of effects heimhuber et al 2019 the potential nonlinear effects of er agricultural activities and natural factors on total water storage for the whole yrb at the yearly scale could be modeled with the nonparametric smoothing function in model 1 eq 1 as ecohydrological processes and er vary across yrb different independent predictor variables were also used to identify the relationships between water storage change and explanatory variables at the monthly scale model 2 eq 2 is for the yrb and model 3 eq 3 is for syrb the impacts on water storage from er programs were mainly driven by the conversion of certain land use and land cover types such as farmland to forest and grassland or vice versa in addition as yrb is a densely populated basin the impacts from agricultural activities e g irrigation cannot be discounted in addition to human activities in agriculture and er climatic variability effects e g precipitation et must also be considered before modeling correlation analysis and a variance inflation factor vif function were used to select variables and test the multicollinearity between candidate explanatory variables firstly factors with strong correlation r 0 85 were eliminated from models by correlation analysis then the vif function was used for collinear analysis to choose one variable to represent the variables that are collinear e g the grassland area and forest area more details on the correlation and collinear analysis are included in the supplementary material figurea1 figurea2 and figurea3 based on this analysis we selected precipitation runoff agricultural water consumption grassland area as the ideal candidates for modeling the relationships among total water resources climate change agricultural water consumption and er at annual scale the vif value of the selected explanatory variations was at an acceptable level vif 9 table a1 in the supplementary material which indicates that there is no multicollinearity problem between the selected explanatory variations however much more vairables e g evapotranspiration industrial water consumption forest area were not considered in the optimal model the optimal explanatory model variables were determined based on the significance p value and the lower akaike information criterion weights of the explanatory variables derived from the gamms the model performance was at last evaluated by residual distributions and the difference between model fitting values and observations to avoid model overfitting the wiggliness penalty function was used which was designed to maximize the fit of the spline to the data while minimizing model noise gamms are especially suited for modeling variable relationships among multiple time series variables where cyclical model terms and residual autocorrelation cannot be ignored in addition a first order autoregressive moving average arma structure was applied to the residuals to minimize residual autocorrelation on different time scales the driving variables of tws change in the same region are different in this paper we analyzed from two time scales the annual scale and the monthly scale finally we used the following gamms models to quantify the importance of individual explanatory variables for tws changes at annual monthly temporal scales over yrb syrb areas eq 1 model 1 is for yrb at annual scale while eq 2 model 2 and eq 3 model 3 are for yrb and syrb at monthly scale 1 tw s t α 0 s log 10 p t s log 10 q t s log 10 l c g s t a w c e 2 tw s t α 0 α 1 t i m e year s log 10 p t s

driven land use and land cover changes in yrb at the initial er period in 2001 there were nine major land use and land cover lulc types across yrb fig 2 a with grassland being the dominant lulc over syrb and north oyrb and covering around 61 89 of the entire basin cropland covered the second largest area 28 93 followed by forest 3 99 both of which were mostly located in the south eastern part of yrb bare ground composed of sand and desert accounted for 3 14 of yrb locating in the far northern part of the basin we found large increases in natural land cover types at the expense of human intensive land use cover since large scale er programs took effect fig 2b for example consistent and significant increases were found in the coverage of both grass and forest land types during our study time this was also evidenced by the spatial match between such increases and the scope of ggp and tnsp programs spatial map in fig 1a this er related expansion of grasslands and forests was in contrast to the decline of cropland and bare ground which showed opposite trajectories fig 2b in addition fast urbanization in yrb was observed to impose a triple growth in the area of built up land from 2002 to 2020 fig 2b which indicated the growing confict between eochydrological resources and human habitation we found the abovementioned overall lulc changes of the entire yrb were mainly driven by those in oyrb because syrb exhibited distinct changes in land use and land cover types fig 2c before 2005 when the er program epsnr was applied in syrb it was mostly covered by grassland around 86 21 in 2001 fig 2c it however dramatically declined from 2002 to 2005 due to reckless land clearing for agriculture e g cropping land and land degradation caused by overgrazing li et al 2013 this can be reflected by the concurrent rapid increase in the cropland area in syrb fig 2c as epsnr focused on self recovery of the local grassland instead of active planting the impact took effect slowly but clearly stopped the continuing decline of grassland area in 2013 thus grassland area stabilized in syrb before it started increasing in 2016 in addition the grassland area in syrb decreased significantly between 2018 and 2020 while bareland increased significantly distinct lulc changes across syrb and oyrb indicated the different impacts of various large scale er programs on landscapes vegetation showed sharp long term greening trends over the yrb during our study time fig 3 a which was likely related to er effects i e more grassland and forest but less bare ground large grassland degradation and increases in cropland area were reported over syrb by multiple studies before the epsnr applied in 2005 li et al 2013 however ndvi profile of syrb still presents overall increase in greenness during our study period fig 3b this indicates that some land changes like conversion from degraded grazing lands to croplands driven by financial incentive might not be reflected in vegetation greenness which could also confound the interpretation of er impacts e g epsnr over syrb in this case 4 2 tws changes during er programs the trajectories of the total water resources over yrb fig 4 a represented by the time series of tws anomalies twsa were driven by the combined impacts of both natural climate and human activities ecological restoration programs and agriculture monthly twsa was observed to fluctuate at both seasonal and inter annual scales from 2002 to 2021 with seasonal values normally peaking in autumn and being lowest in spring fig 4a despite the variations the inter annual trend in twsa over yrb presented clear and consistent water storage depletion during our study period with a significant loss rate p 0 001 of 3 70 km3 yr in volume equivalent to 3 70 billion tons yr in mass fig 4b such a dramatic decline in twsa showed that yrb water budget was under an overall imbalance during our study time with water loss largely overweighing water gain we found both land use and land cover changes fig 2b and twsa fig 4b approached their multi year average in the year 2011 which indicated that tws changes over yrb coincided with er driven land use and land cover changes the trend in twsa over the entire yrb was largely driven by that over oyrb presenting a similar twsa trajectory throughout the study period fig 4a c by contrast twsa over the syrb with a distinct er program than in the oyrb did not exhibit similar changes over time to those of the entire basin fig 4d in particular twsa over syrb showed an overall increasing trend from 2002 to 2012 before it started to decline then to steep rise between 2018 and 2021 fig 4d opposite twsa change trends across syrb and oyrb demonstrated the distinct impacts of various large scale er programs on hydrology changes in water storage across space over the yrb during our study period were investigated using theil sen median trend analysis method ts and mann kendall test mk spatial tws trends during 2002 and 2021 showed a distinct geographic difference partitioning the yrb into two spatial zones the syrb had significant positive trends while the oyrb showed the opposite ranging from 31 mm y 1 to 5 mm y 1 fig 5 a an area located in the east central region was observed to have the highest loss in tws during our study period corresponding to the hotspot of er programs with ggp nfcp and tnsp all being applied to focus upon soil erosion forest conservation protection of agricultural and pastoral land and human settlements viña et al 2016 wang et al 2010 wei et al 2020 we also observed that tws declines were greatly accelerated by er related land use and land cover changes e g grassland and forest of which the magnitude varied among different land use and land cover types fig 5b the rate of decline in tws was observed to be doubled in planted areas than those over natural areas for both grassland and forest fig 5b in addition tws in both natural and manmade forest areas showed higher water depletion rates than those in grassland areas 4 3 decoupled relationship between water storage and vegetation greenness under er the results in the previous sections indicated the potential impacts of er programs on ecosystems and water resources across the yrb which may in turn disrupt their natural connections we thus investigated these relationships over the yrb and focused on syrb and oyrb since they had distinct ecohydrological responses representing the final water availability within the water cycle tws showed negative correlations with ndvi in oyrb at monthly seasonal and annual scales table 2 similarly negative correlations were also found between precipitation and tws in oyrb by contrast tws was positively correlated with precipitation and ndvi over the syrb which is commonly expected from previous studies over different parts of the world ndehedehe and ferreira 2020 penatti et al 2015 xie et al 2019a yang et al 2014b overall tws was negatively correlated with precipitation and ndvi across the entire yrb table 2 compared with tws precipitation retained notably positive correlations with ndvi as expected over all parts of the yrb at different temporal scales these negative correlations between vegetation and water storage over oyrb may be largely attributed to an imbalanced water budget caused by the er programs applied there which involved intensive land use and land cover changes although these er activities along with a slight increasing trend in precipitation over oyrb fig 6 e would favour vegetation growth and be reflected by an increasing ndvi large consumption of water storage required by the er programs may have well exceeded the precipitation supply leading to tws decline this may eventually cause relationship between the final water availability tws and vegetation to break down as shown in table 2 the common positive correlations between precipitation and tws over syrb uncommon negative correlations over oyrb table 2 both illustrated the interference of human activities e g ecological restoration and agriculture irrigation activities on oyrb s water resources precipitation in syrb contributed to its water resource increase and the oyrb had less precipitation than its human consumption water resulting in its water resource losses spatial correlations between vegetation and hydrological variables further validated the abovementioned disrupted relationships fig 6 on an annual basis tws showed significant negative correlations with ndvi over most of the oyrb grid averaged r 0 85 while positive correlations existed over a large part of the syrb fig 6a precipitation had positive correlations with ndvi across the yrb although these were only significant in the north central oyrb fig 6b precipitation and tws generally showed no significant correlations over yrb fig 6c precipitation presented an increasing trend over 67 of yrb fig 6d concentrating in the oyrb these contrary spatial trends between precipitation and tws over the oyrb explained their lack of correlation during our study period which was likely to be caused by human activities such as large scale er programs overall precipitation increased over oyrb fig 6e precipitation over syrb increased between 2002 and 2012 then decreased and began to increase in 2015 especially after 2018 fig 6f when a corresponding change in tws was also observed there fig 4b 4 4 separation of er impact on water resources our results showed a significant depletion of tws 3 70 billion tons yr over the yrb during the post er period fig 4a which was a result of combined climate and human influences ecological restoration and agricultural activities thus based on the combined use of meteorological land use and land cover and water storage data we used statistical modelling of generalized additive mixed models gamms to disentangle human versus climatic drivers for evaluating er impacts after the removal of collinearity and optimal regression model analysis four independent predictor variables were chosen for the dependent variable tws on an annual basis representing the respective impacts of inter annual climate variability precipitation agricultural activities agricultural water consumption ecological restoration programs grassland area change and mix of other potential natural and human factors runoff the model performance r2 for all models built with these four predictor variables were shown in fig 7 a the goodness of the fit for the models built with different variables varied greatly in performance the optimal model model 1 eq 1 with the highest performance r2 0 94 rmse 5 63 mm auc 0 96 table 3 among all variable combinations contained all these four variables fig 7a of which each showed significant correlation p 0 01 with tws table a2 in the supplementary material larger r2 value r2 0 94 was associated with stronger explanatory ability of the model the smaller root mean square error rmse 5 63 mm was associated with good prediction ability of gamms the area under curve auc value of the receiver operating characteristic roc curve was 0 96 which indicates a good prediction of tws via the model furthermore the autocorrelation coefficients of the residuals for model 1 s prediction was 0 showing that model 1 can well simulate the tws data the individual contributions of the four predicting variables grassland area change runoff precipitation and agricultural water consumption to the changes in tws at the annual scale were estimated as 66 31 26 12 11 73 and 5 86 respectively this indicates that dramatic water storage loss in the yrb were mostly attributed to land use and land cover change driven by large scale ecological restoration programs e g grass area changes in contrast only around 11 73 of tws changes were attributed to inter annual variability in precipitation relatively agricultural activities in the yrb were found to provide little inconsequentiality on water resources during the study period 5 86 in addition the high contribution of runoff to tws 26 12 may reflect potential factors not included in other dependent variables such as reservoir regulation at the monthly scale the optimal model for tws in the yrb was composed of precipitation groundwater runoff and ndvi the model performance r2 for models built with these four predictor variables were shown in figurea4 supplementary material the goodness of fit for models built with different variables varied in performance r2 0 70 the optimal model model 2 eq 2 with the highest performance r2 0 93 rmse 8 47 mm auc 0 92 table 3 among all variable combinations contained all these four variables figurea4 in the supplementary material of which each showed significant correlation p 0 001 with tws table a4 in the supplementary material at the monthly scale the optimal model for tws in the syrb was composed of precipitation et soil moisture runoff and ndvi while the goodness of fit for models was generally high with r2 0 76 the optimal model model 3 eq 3 with the highest performance r2 0 87 rmse 13 56 mm auc 0 90 table 3 among all variable combinations contained all these five variables figurea5 in the supplementary material of which each showed significant correlation p 0 05 with tws table a6 in the supplementary material groundwater which reflected the impacts from human activities e g agricultural irrigation and er programs was the highest contributor approximately 9 88 to tws depletion followed by the vegetation greenness represented by ndvi fig 7b monthly precipitation variability was observed to be the least influential on water changes over the yrb the impacts of human activities represented by groundwater on the syrb was almost negligible compared with that in oyrb fig 7b with the optimal model consisting of precipitation evapotranspiration et runoff ndvi and soil moisture sm sm had the highest contribution to tws changes over syrb followed by et ndvi and precipitation 1 49 1 38 and 0 57 respectively similar to the whole yrb runoff had little influences on tws changes in the syrb at monthly scale distinct climate e g precipitation and evaportranspiration and human activities e g er programs agriculture and grazing across yrb and syrb led to various quantitative attribution of changes in water storage 5 discussion 5 1 land use and land cover changes explained by individual er programs changes in land use and land cover types across the yrb have been driven by multiple large scale er programs implemented since 1998 fig 8 these er programs have different restoration strategies such as the grassland restoration over syrb under epsnr as well as the extensive revegetation of forest and grassland over oyrb under ggp nfcp and tnsp fig 8 our results showed er programs had induced a total area of lulc changes over 187 093 km2 from 2002 to 2020 in yrb figs 2 8 most of these changes were found over oyrb in the form of grassland and forest expansion at the expense of farmland and bare ground fig 8 overall ggp replaced many farm and abandoned lands with trees and grass over the central part of oyrb while nfcp and tnsp focused on natural forests and afforestation in the northern oyrb fig 8 these er programs all had multiple phases with most of their first phases concluding in 2010 before the next phase that involved more financial and labor investment which might be associated with the larger water storage loss rate from 2012 to 2021 table 1 fig 4b by contrast epsnr driven vegetation expansion over the syrb was far less extensive than those in oyrb under er programs fig 8 this was because epsnr focused on natural restoration such as grazing restriction or termination and prohibition of land clearing for cropland instead of intensive lulc changes in addition substantial tree plantation under other er programs would be challenging due to the continental plateau climate in syrb thus epsnr mainly reduced the interference of human activities and the intensity of land use in syrb forming a significant contrast to er programs applied over oyrb these results indicate the need of partitioning the combined ecohydrological effects from multiple er programs which will allow decision makers to draw quantitative insights on whether different er policies that cover specific regions outperformed others and why 5 2 partitioned impacts of multiple er programs on total freshwater resources previous studies investigated the impacts of er projects but under the mixed context of climate change and agricultural activities leading to incomplete or qualitative conclusions for example large water storage losses in yrb over the recent two decades have been identified in previous studies jing et al 2019 lv et al 2019 of which the main drivers were considered to be climate change or more often the agricultural activities such as irrigation xie et al 2019a zhang et al 2019 however a recent study over dryland area in northern china brought attention on side effect of large scale er programs on total water resources zhao et al 2020 nevertheless the population density of the northern china is low with few human activities e g agricultural irrigation leading to limited applications of the study to many of the er areas in other parts of the world adding to this work our study addressed the important knowledge gap by quantitatively disentangling human versus climatic drivers for evaluating er impacts this is especially essential over the yellow river basin s complex environment of high climatic variability and intensive agricultural activities coinciding with concentrated er efforts which is also commonly seen across the world as a result this study s framework is applicable to other parts of the globe and is encouraged to be applied for wholistic er impact evaluations our study over yrb found that the contribution of er programs to tws changes was more than double as those combined from inter annual climatic variability and agricultural activities in particular the water resources over yrb experienced a consistent decline regardless of the overall increase in precipitation during the study time eventually causing the correlation between the total water storage and vegetation greenness to break down table 2 widespread vegetation greening was promoted due to significant er driven lulc changes such as conversion of farmland to forest and extensive revegetation of grass and trees especially over the oyrb these activities across the years have inevitably required increasingly more water use leading to substantial water loss this was also evdiented by our finding that the rate of decline in tws was observed to be doubled in planted areas than those over natural areas for both grassland and forest fig 5b furthermore large scale modifications to the land surface in water limited regions like afforestation and grass planting from bare land could gradually alter hydrological processes shao et al 2021 which in turn change the regional climate to favor or degrade existing ecosystems ge et al 2020 yin et al 2021 in contrast to the consistent tws decline over the oyrb despite increase in precipitation fig 6e tws in syrb had a statistically significant upward trend p 0 01 from 2002 to 2011 before it started declining in 2012 then significantly increased since 2017 fig 4b such a tws trajectory in the syrb was found to closely follow that of precipitation over the same region fig 6f these results indicated that tws variations in oyrb had been driven by er programs while those in syrb had been driven by natural climatic variability other studies also showed that climate change contributied much more to runoff change in the syrb yan et al 2020 water storage change was attributed to the climatic variability while the intense human activities e g reservoir operation also generated a significant effect on twsc in the yrb xie et al 2019a furthermore we found the difference in er programs over the oyrb and the syrb expressed as different trajectories in tws showed that water depletion was largely associated with intense land use and land cover changes driven er programs as a result this study highlights the use of combined land use and land cover data and grace derived tws changes to better evaluate large scale er programs than the applications with solely vegetation indices for future improved decision making of environmental management the quantitative attribution of changes in lulc and water storage to individual er programs and the novel finding of er induced ecohydrological decoupling have not been published in previous studies all of which are critical for policy evaluation and decision making 5 3 balance between future er programs and water resources in a densely populated environment motivated by the united nations un 2030 agenda for sustainable development goals sdgs countries around the world have been actively seeking for the actions to combat climate change fitoka et al 2020 maeda et al 2021 playing a crucial role in realizing these sdgs china s passion for ecological civilization over the recent years has been unprecedented li et al 2021a while increasing amount of national ecological restoration programs have been launched or proposed this study showed pronounced but different impacts on water storage can be imposed by various large scale policy driven er activities through the time water resource conservation has rarely been considered in large scale er programs yet will eventually determine the fate of the restored landscape this led to an important question on how to achieve sustainable utilization of freshwater resources in restoration practices especially in water limited environment with dense population a decreasing trend in water resources over the restored areas will continue or reverse may be largely dependent on the interactions between future er policies and hydrometeorological conditions for instance precipitation is projected to increase across yrb in the coming years wang et al 2021b which may favor both the vegetation growth and water storage slowing water loss however both this study and previous studies showed that large scale plantation tends to trigger much more water loss than natural rehabilitation particularly in water limited areas wang et al 2021a wang et al 2008 yan et al 2017 therefore sustainable conservation policies are required under future er programs to balance land restoration and water resources this would involve careful decision making by policy makers on the opportunity cost of water storage for revegetation li 2021 zhao et al 2020 including 1 easing of er programs focusing less on extensive replantation and thinning dense vegetation of some areas or selecting for the specific vegetation types in ers for different areas and climate conditions 2 maintenance of the current level of er programs or 3 application of larger scale er programs with strong revegetation efforts strategy 1 will reduce ecosystem water consumption and slow down or reverse the current tws decreasing trend but at the expense of rapid green up over the restored areas brancalion and holl 2020 ellison et al 2012 on the other hand strategies 2 and 3 are expected to see an improved ecological environment across the basin but at the risk of exacerbating water use and maintaining the current decreasing trend in tws herron et al 2002 schwärzel et al 2020 under an arid or semi arid climate a sustained decline in water storage will eventually elevate plant water stress reducing the survival rates of the artificially restored vegetation and even harming the local vegetation holl and brancalion 2020 therefore the adoption of strategies 2 and 3 will need close monitoring of groundwater and plants over the long term in addition farming and grazing have been greatly enhanced to meet the increasing demand for the fast growing population urban and industrial areas uses all over the world for example monthly groundwater observations over yrb through the last ten years showed similar decreasing trend as that in tws observed in this study zhang et al 2019 indicating a need to regularize agricultural activities such irrigation especially under large scale er programs soil moisture in different layers has diverse ecohydrological processes surface soil moisture 100 cm an important water resource for plant growth was positively correlated with prcipitation and more sensitive than groundwater to precipitation in the yrb li et al 2016b while deep soil moisture 100 cm depletion and recovery processes are related to vegetation types liu et al 2022 and afforestation can deplete deep soil moisture kong et al 2022 by incorporating total water storage change information derived from gravitational satellite observations this study provides a new perspective of water use assessment for er programs which may make a valuable contribution towards improving future er strategies directly relevant to multiple un sustainable development goals 5 4 novelty limitations and uncertainties of this study the novelty of this paper are 1 many previous studies focused on either water decline or vegetation increase under only one er project or the impact from the total er projects in a region li et al 2020 song et al 2022 sun et al 2020 in contrast our study aimed to compare the respective ecohydrological impacts from multiple er projects this allowed our study to draw the conclusion on which er policies over which regions outperformed others and why 2 there were studies that investigated the impacts of er projects but under the context of both climate change and agricultural activities li et al 2021b lv et al 2019 zhai et al 2022 leading to indirect or qualitative conclusions this study addressed this important knowledge gap by quantitatively separating er impacts from those of inter annual climatic variability and agricultural activity this enables the methodological framework to be much more applicable to other parts of the world with complex environments 3 this study aimed to investigate the impacts of er on both ecology and hydrology we firstly quantified land use changes driven by different er projects then associated such changes to changes in water resources therefore not like many previous studies that focused on changes in either ecological or hydrological components this study closely linked the ecohydrological interactions under respective er projects our study showed that the gamm models have value of quantifying the potential nonlinear relationships between ecological restoration programs agricultural activities natural factors and the total water storage however there were a few uncertainties in such contribution analysis need to be discussed for example many other anthropological driver factors e g reservoir water domestic water use etc could not be included in the analysis which would affect the performance of the final model moreover uncertainties could result from rather coarse resolution datasets such as grace which inevitably ignored details in the interactions between driving factors and tws over small regional areas in addition uncertainties could also result from the use of mixed observed and simulation data as well as the data resampling etc despite these uncertainties and limitations results from this study can still offer valuable insights of how what and why different er programs affected the total water resources across the yellow river basin which can guide future large scale ecological and conservation programs future work with more advanced models more driving factors and datasets of higher spatial resolutions are needed to reduce the uncertainties and improve the model performance 6 conclusions while ambitious national ecological restoration programs have been increasingly implemented or proposed in china to balance economic development and environmental protection a quantitative evaluation on the ecohydrological impacts of large scale ecological restoration er programs particularly over water limited areas with complex environment of high climatic variability and intensive human activities has been absent in the current study we investigated the er driven land use and land cover changes and quantified the associated loss and gain in the total water storage across the yellow river basin in china er impacts were disentangled leading in individual attribution of inter annual climatic variability and agricultural activity with statistical modelling our results showed large increases in natural land cover types e g forest and grassland at the expense of human intensive land use cover such as farmland with the combined changes resulting in a concurrent dramatic water storage loss of 3 70 billion tons yr across the basin over the 20 year study period investigated this eventually led to a decoupled relationship between water storage and vegetation over the yrb we found er played the dominant role in water loss 66 among all factors considered with high investment er programs that were involved in intense land cover changes over oyrb causing the highest water deficits therefore the findings observed from this study can provide critical lessons for large scale restoration efforts globally more importantly this study provides a framework based on the publicly freely and globally available datasets that is applicable to substantial part of the global like yrb and can help decision makers to directly inform the water cost and changes in different land use and land cover types of er for future sustainable er strategies declaration of competing interest the authors

2717,crop transpiration is the main dissipation way of agricultural water accurate and effective estimation of crop transpiration is of great significance for the study of the carbon water cycle relationship and efficient water saving irrigation this study uses infrared thermal imaging technology to accurately extract the average temperature of the plant canopy as a key input for the new model three dimensional temperature 3d 3t model which is an extension of the three temperature 3t model and applied to estimate the canopy transpiration rate of typical citrus trees variety named guoqing no 1 from 8 00 to 18 00 on may 7 to 11 2021 and a processing method for extracting green plants in visible light images based on the normalized difference ratio index ndri is proposed for the first time which can distinguish green plants from other ground objects backgrounds and shadows in the visible light image and then help to accurately extract the average canopy temperature from infrared thermal images for this experiment the canopy structure characteristics of the selected experimental subjects and the measurement methods used were considered so the 3d 3t model was converted to a 5 point three temperature model 5p 3t model to estimate the canopy transpiration rate of citrus trees and evaluate the plant water status and then the sap flow measurement was used for validation the results showed that 1 the 3t model overestimated the transpiration rate of the citrus tree while the 5p 3t model underestimated it the estimated values of the 5p 3t model have a good correlation with the measured values of the packaged stem sap flow gauge method with a determination coefficient r2 of 0 72 and root mean square error rmse of 0 35 mm d 2 in this model the plant transpiration transfer coefficient h at can evaluate the water shortage of plants where the value of h at increased with the aggravation of plant water stress 3 the citrus trees have lower transpiration rates under water stress ranging from 0 06 to 0 12 mm h in the daytime from 8 10 may 2021 the model used in this study only needs the input of temperature information and net radiation and would not depend on aerodynamic resistance the method in this paper can realize the non contact and non invasive measurement of crop transpiration and it provides a feasible way to use a portable thermal imager to accurately obtain the temperature for estimating plant canopy transpiration rate keywords transpiration three temperature model infrared thermal imaging technology plant transpiration transfer coefficient water stress data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction china is a large agricultural country according to the 2020 china water resources bulletin the total national water consumption in 2020 is 581 29 billion cubic meters among them agricultural water consumption is 361 24 billion cubic meters accounting for 62 1 of the total water china is the largest country in citrus plantations and the citrus tree is a major characteristic cash crop in yichang although a wide variety of citrus can be planted and the cultivation techniques are becoming more and more perfect le and chunjie 2016 considering the issues of water trading and water allocation danso et al 2021 the current citrus tree irrigation technology are still flood irrigation drip irrigation sprinkler irrigation etc bryla et al 2005 chen et al 2018 romeo et al 2004 terry and nelson 1986 moreover the plants in some areas of yichang city are sparse and short making it difficult to accurately measure and estimate their transpiration and it is also difficult to evaluate the water status of plants therefore which method to choose to evaluate the water status and growth environment of fruit trees and determine how much irrigation water accounts for the field water holding capacity is a problem that needs further research to achieve high efficiency water saving irrigation liu et al 2012 milly and dunne 1994 evapotranspiration et includes soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration wang and yamanaka 2014 and crop transpiration is the main dissipation way of agricultural water accurate and effective estimation of crop transpiration is of great significance for studying the relationship between carbon and water cycle and for efficient water saving irrigation at present the acquisition of evapotranspiration can be divided into two categories the land et measurement method and the et model estimation method song et al 2012 while et measurement methods can be roughly divided into four categories hydrological methods micrometeorological methods plant physiology methods and infrared remote sensing methods rampazo et al 2021 and the research on the et model estimation method has made great progress penman 1948 combined the energy balance with the mass transfer method and derived an equation to compute the evaporation from an open water surface from standard climatological the method was further developed by many researchers and extended to calculate the evaporation of crop surface by introducing resistance factors such as the penman monteith method monteith 1965 and subsequently various models for estimating evapotranspiration were established however due to the spatial complexity of the underlying surface and the numerous control factors involved it is difficult to accurately quantify et monteith 1965 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 to obtain true evapotranspiration values many measurement methods are generally used to measure or estimate et e g weighing lysimeter ding et al 2010 wullschleger et al 1998 water balance method vandewiele et al 1992 bowen ratio energy balance method fritschen and fritschen 2005 eddy covariance method barr et al 2006 however most methods require expensive equipment site specific measured data or large uniform fields for vegetation with thin stems distributed in a small area the packaged stem sap flow gauge method has become a reliable method to measure the transpiration of vegetation jiang et al 2016 ma et al 2020 o keefe et al 2020 for instance ehoková et al 2022 compared the sap flow and tree growth in adult high and overaged coppice oak forests and found that the older root system of coppice provides better access to soil water and thus coppice can withstand drought stress better than high forest the abovementioned indicate that the system can be configured with multiple sensors to measure the plant stem flow and water consumption of various outdoor or indoor small vegetation it is already an advanced and convenient method and is now widely used in research and practice bo et al 2017 zha et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 however due to the diversity of tree species age size and habitat it is difficult to represent the results of a single tree on behalf of other trees and although these methods can provide high precision et values they can only be applied to point or field scales xiong and qiu 2014 due to the non uniformity of the underlying surface and water and heat transfer on a larger spatial scale it is difficult to obtain regional evapotranspiration with traditional methods while the rise of remote sensing technology makes it possible to estimate regional evapotranspiration gao and long 2008 many traditional methods to estimate evapotranspiration are also expanded on the spatial temporal scale due to the information extracted from remote sensing data however remote sensing can not directly obtain and estimate some parameters such as wind speed humidity aerodynamic resistance etc french et al 2005 li et al 2005 sánchez et al 2008 xiong and qiu 2014 the above shows that various methods of estimating et have limitations and uncertainty remains in et estimates and products for example yu et al 2022 reported that the multi year mean terrestrial et values retrieved from 6 et products ranged from 423 to 563 mm yr therefore simpler algorithms without resistance parameterization yao et al 2021 and variable calibration requirements are necessary to reduce uncertainty in et estimation and choosing a method to accurately estimate et has become a key issue in various et related studies tian et al 2014 this study uses infrared thermal imaging technology accurately extract the average canopy temperature of sparse and dwarf plants as a key input parameter for the new model three dimensional temperature 3d 3t model qiu et al 2020 that can estimate the transpiration rate of the plant canopy which is derived from the three temperature 3t model also called the two dimensional temperature 2d 3t model qiu 1996 while the three temperature 3t model is based on surface energy balance analysis without calibration and resistance parameterization requirements it consists of 5 parts soil evaporation model soil evaporation transfer coefficient evaluation of soil moisture status and environmental quality vegetation transpiration model plant transpiration transfer coefficient evaluation of vegetation moisture status and environmental quality and crop water stress index qiu et al 1999a qiu et al 1996a qiu et al 1999b qiu et al 1996b qiu et al 1998 the 3t model introduces the imitation leaf dry leaf without transpiration to estimate canopy transpiration and eliminates aerodynamic resistance qiu et al 2006a the main advantages of this method for estimating canopy evapotranspiration are that the input factors are easy to obtain the required input factors such as leaf temperature t c imitation leaf temperature t p air temperature t a and solar radiation without canopy resistance and aerodynamic resistance easy for remote sensing observation and there is no contact damage to plants when photographed with a portable thermal imager gao et al 2014 qiu et al 2006b the three temperature 3t model have been used to estimate accurate et at various scales such as green spaces urban trees shrubs and river basin qiu et al 2017 qiu et al 2021 wang et al 2016 xiong et al 2019 however the original 3t model hypothesizes that the energy for transpiration came from vertical solar radiation at the top of the plant canopy considering sparse plants or some regular blocky shrubs solar radiation in different directions can also provide additional energy for transpiration which may lead to uncertainties in transpiration estimates so the 3t model was improved into the three dimensional temperature 3d 3t model and the model has been evaluated with acceptable accuracy for example qiu et al 2020 used the 3d 3t model to estimate the transpiration rate of individual urban trees and the results were in good agreement with the sap flow method r2 0 88 root mean square error rmse 0 01 mm h and qiu et al 2021 used the modified 3d 3t model estimates transpiration rates for urban shrubs also show that the modified 3d 3t model is a reliable method for estimating urban shrub transpiration r2 0 61 mean absolute error mae 0 10 mm h since there is no accepted method to accurately measure the et of sparse and dwarf fruit trees we used infrared thermal imaging to obtain the relevant temperature parameters and validated the 3d 3t model with the et results from the weighing method and the packaged stem sap flow gauge method therefore the objectives of this research are to 1 test a new model 3d 3t model for estimating canopy transpiration rate by using infrared thermal imaging technology and 2 construct a visible light image processing method for the normalized difference ratio index ndri and modified the 3d 3t model to accurately obtain the canopy transpiration rate of the citrus tree 3 preliminary analysis the feasibility of the 3d 3t model to calculate the canopy transpiration rate analyzed the transpiration law and evaluate the water status of plants the research presented here provides a feasible way for thermal imaging technology to accurately estimate plant canopy transpiration rate 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the study area is located in the hydrology and water resources research center of china three gorges university in yichang city hubei province china 111 18 20 45 n 30 43 45 35 e with an altitude of 79m the area is located in the subtropical monsoon humid climate zone with an average annual precipitation of 1100 1200 mm the southeast wind prevails throughout the year the annual average temperature is about 16 17 the highest temperature is in july and august 38 40 and its monthly average temperature is about 27 28 the daily average net solar radiation was measured to be 125 3 w m2 in a transparent rain proof shelter and the average sunshine hours are 6 09 h this experiment selects a locally widely planted citrus species guoqing no 1 citrus tree 3 5 years old in yichang as the research object according to the plant height and crown width the plants were divided into 3 groups with 3 plants in each group for a total of 9 plants different groups have different soil moisture content and plants are not adjacent to each other and have no shelter only one tree was selected as the measurement object the observation test is carried out in sunny weather in a rain proof shelter with sufficient light and good ventilation growth room rain shelter rain shelter area 3 m 6 m may 5 11 2021 a potted citrus tree 5 year old was used for the experiment with a plant height of 156 cm crown width of 110 cm and an average trunk diameter of 20 mm the top diameter of the pot was 50 cm the bottom diameter was 30 cm and the pot height was 40 cm the soil type was red soil the soil bulk density was 1 32 g cm3 and the ph value was between 5 and 7 5 the field capacity of the soil as measured by the indoor ring knife method was 31 72 the day before the experiment the soil moisture content of the potted citrus tree was the maximum field water holding capacity sufficient irrigation and no water replenishment in one experiment period the soil surface was covered with plastic film to avoid evaporation of the soil in the pot lei et al 2014 the fertilizer was uniform and consisted of 150 g of 7 14 16 n p k compound fertilizer lu et al 2004 there was no topdressing in the experimental stage and the fertilizer amount used per plant was equal the experiment lasted for 7 consecutive days 2 2 measurement and data collection 2 2 1 stem sap flow measurement in this experiment the stem sap flow measurement data was used to verify the estimated transpiration rate of citrus trees the sap flow rate of citrus trees was continuously observed and recorded by the sap flow system flow32 1k sap flow system dynamax inc houston texas usa the sensor probe sgex16 dynamax inc usa was wrapped in an appropriate position of the trunk at a height of 5cm from the soil install tarps thermal insulation and radiation shields around the sensor to minimize the effects of temperature fluctuations and rain erosion at the package from may 5 to may 11 2021 set the sap flow system operating parameters and every 15 min were recorded on a data logger cr1000 dynamax inc houston texas usa to prevent the influence of soil evaporation it is necessary to cover the soil surface of potted citrus trees with plastic film at the same time to ensure the accuracy of the measured data the weight of the whole pot of citrus trees was measured every 15 minutes with an electronic balance es60k 16d shenyang china and the average value of the weight difference between the current time and 1 hour before and after was calculated as the hourly transpiration rate 2 2 2 measurement of input parameters for the 5p 3tmodel this observation experiment was carried out in fine weather from may 5 to may 11 2021 in a rain shelter with good light transmission and ventilation the canopy leaf temperature t c and imitation leaf temperature t p were measured by a thermal imager testo 890 thermal imager testo asia ltd germany the medium and low crown citrus trees with good growth were selected considering that the crown of citrus trees is medium to small and the transpiration rate of the crown area in different directions may be different a thermal imager should be placed at the corresponding fixed positions on the top east south west and north of the tree crown to obtain the thermal image of the tree crown and monitor the temperature distribution of the canopy and the shooting angle should be adjusted at an angle to all vertical sides of the tree canopy guillevic 2003 the vegetation canopy temperature t c and imitation leaf temperature t p are obtained by non contact measurement every 1 hour from 8 00 to 18 00 the resolution of the infrared thermal imager is 640 pixels 480 pixels the spectral range of 8 14 μm and the accuracy is 2 assuming that there is an imitation leaf canopy in the plant canopy which has a relatively small volume and is representative the temperature humidity wind speed and other parameters of the plant canopy are not significantly modified by the imitation leaf canopy in this test we use dry and thin green paper 10 mm 10 mm as the imitation leaf the material color and roughness shall be similar to the actual leaf as much as possible install imitation leaves at appropriate locations around the canopy and fixed them with slender green branches and measure 10 imitation leaves in total 30 minutes before the start of the test the imitation leaf was placed at about 2 cm of the observation point to provide situational conditions similar to canopy leaves as shown in fig 1 the imitation leaves should be located at the central viewing angle of the shot approximately the geometric center of the vertical plane in each direction of the citrus canopy and place 2 imitation leaves parallel to the vertical plane when measuring the net radiation meter cannot completely cover the imitation leaf in addition the fsr 4 portable meteorological instrument beijing tianyude technology corp china monitors the meteorological factors around citrus trees in a transparent rain sheltered greenhouse the meteorological data in the same period were measured and recorded every 15 minutes including solar radiation wind speed soil temperature air temperature t a and humidity 2 3 data processing methods and model modification 2 3 1 thermal infrared image calibration in this experiment a 5 point observation method is established to measure the canopy temperature and imitation leaf temperature the original image obtained by the infrared thermal imager needs to be imported into the built in irsoft software for temperature correction and the emissivity is set to 0 97 by setting the image color and adjusting the parameters the plant canopy in the image is clear and easy to identify then we use the image superposition function twinpix in the software for the preliminary registration of the visible image and the calibrated thermal infrared image to make the resolution and size of the visible image consistent with the thermal infrared image 640 pixels 480 pixels while making the area in the visible image fully cover and coincide with the area in the thermal image since the special format of the thermal infrared image it is a file in bmt format the export of temperature information is an excel file containing only the temperature value matrix so further processing of the image is required 2 3 2 image processing based on the ndri index method by using the envi software to read the original visible light image identify green plants in the image and synthesize false color to highlight and enhance the characteristics of the recognized object and then construct the normalized difference ratio index ndri in addition the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is one of the important parameters reflecting crop growth and nutrition information govaerts and verhulst 2010 it can quantify vegetation by measuring the difference between near infrared vegetation strong reflection and red light vegetation absorption which can be expressed as 1 ndvi nir r nir r where nir is the near infrared band r is the red band the image digital number dn value can be normalized to enhance the response of the image to vegetation the visible image is a three channel layer image red green and blue bands in which the green waveband is more sensitive to the green reflection of plants and the red band has strong penetration therefore the ndri normalized difference ratio index index can be constructed to distinguish green plants from other ground objects shadows and backgrounds the formula is as follows 2 ndri ban d red b a n d green ban d red b a n d green where ban d green is the green band and ban d red is the red band in the visible light image applying eq 2 to envi 5 3 software the dn value of the visible image can be subjected to band operation and the normalized difference ratio index distribution histogram ndri fig 2 can be obtained to determine the classification threshold of the object and then the region of interest crop crown can be outlined from the visible light image and green plants can be identified fig 3 is a step by step process then the recognized clipped image is transformed into a pixel image through vba programming the pixel image cell and temperature table cell are imported into excel software correspondingly the value of the background pixel cell is defined as 0 and the value of the green plant pixel cell is defined as 1 which is superimposed with thermal infrared temperature value information at this time the temperature value is displayed in the cells of the green plant canopy in the pixel image finally the average temperature of the green plant canopy is statistically analyzed for the calculation of the 3t fig 4 shows the canopy temperature distribution in different directions after image processing 2 3 3 heat balance packaged stem sap flow gauge method the stem sap flow rate of the citrus tree is continuously observed and recorded by using the packaged stem sap flow gauge method girardi et al 2010 ham and heilman 1990 he et al 2018 sakuratani 1981 according to the principle of heat balance it is calculated according to eq 3 3 t r s a p p in q r q v c p d t where t r s a p g h is the stem sap flow rate of the citrus tree p in w is the heat input power q v w is the heat conducted by the vertical stalk q r w is the heat dissipation to the surroundings in the form of radiation c p j g is the specific heat of water dt is the increased value of the temperature between the two monitoring points of the sap the unit conversion relationship of the stem sap flux density is expressed in the radiant energy unit as follows 4 f d t r s a p a s 1 3600 5 l e c s a p f d a s a c 3600 10 3 24 28 4 where f d g m2 s is the stem flux density l e c s a p w m2 is the average transpiration rate of the canopy which represents the stem sap flow rate in the radiant energy unit a s m2 is the cross sectional area of the stem of the tree a c m2 is the area of citrus canopy 2 3 4 the process of modifying the 3t model to the 5p 3t model the three temperature model 3t is a dual source evapotranspiration model based on energy balance that can be described as 6 le r n g h where le is the latent heat flux w m2 h is the sensible heat flux w m2 rn is the net radiation w m2 and g is the soil heat flux w m2 the preconditions involved in the derivation of the model formula are summarized as follows condition 1 there is an imitation leaf canopy in the plant canopy which has a relatively small volume and is representative the temperature humidity wind speed and other parameters of the plant canopy are not significantly modified by the imitation leaf canopy qiu et al 1996a qiu et al 2009 condition 2 the radiation absorption and albedo characteristics of this imitation leaf are similar to those of plant leaves and there is no latent heat flux in the reference leaf if the ground is completely covered by this imitation leaf imitation leaf canopy l e cp 0 l e cp represents the latent heat flux of the imitation leaf canopy the subscripts cp or p represents the imitation leaf canopy condition 3 when the ground surface is completely covered by vegetation the incident radiation in the canopy cover area is intercepted by the canopy and the energy distribution on the soil surface is not significant therefore the soil evaporation under the canopy is generally low and the latent heat flux is considered to be the transpiration of the plant leaf canopy and the soil heat flux can be ignored according to conditions 1 3 the original 3t model introduces the imitation leaf dry leaf without transpiration to estimate canopy transpiration rate and eliminates aerodynamic resistance for details please refer to tian et al 2014 so canopy transpiration rate l e c w m2 can be expressed as 7 l e c r n c r n c p t c t a t p t a the variables to be input in eq are temperature where t c t a t p are canopy temperature air temperature and imitation canopy temperature the unit for temperature is c r n c is the net radiation of the canopy and r n c p is the net radiation of the imitation canopy both units are in w m2 net radiation can be measured or calculated here l e c is the transpiration rate of the plant canopy in w m2 the plant transpiration transfer coefficient h at is defined as 8 h at t c t a t p t a the plant transpiration transfer coefficient h at can evaluate the water status of vegetation qiu et al 2003 theoretically the value range is h at 1 the larger the value of h at the lower the transpiration rate of the plant due to lack of water and the smaller the value of h at which indicates that the plant has a good water condition and the transpiration rate has the maximum value the three dimensional temperature model 3d 3t model was proposed by qiu et al 2020 which is a method based on a three temperature 3t model for estimating the canopy transpiration of large trees under urban conditions for a large individual tree canopy under urban conditions differences in the energy budget occurred among different parts of the crown qiu et al 2020 based on these conditions the original 3d 3t model can be expressed as 9 l e c 1 n l e c i l i 1 n r c i r cp i t c i t a i t cp i t a i l i where l e c i w m2 is the latent heat flux of part i of the canopy l i is the ratio of the surface area of each part of the canopy to the total surface area of the canopy for small fruit trees generally the crown structure is small and the stem is thin the transpiration at the bottom is relatively small and negligible although the spatial stratification is not obvious there may still be differences in the energy budgets of different sides of the canopy and we assume that the energy of solar radiation received by the surface on the same side of the tree crown is uniformly distributed therefore we shoot at 5 fixed points in 5 directions east south west north and top of the canopy and established a 5 point temperature measurement method to obtain the average canopy temperature from the five directions of the fruit tree by using thermal imaging technology and estimated the transpiration rate of the top of the canopy and the east south west and north sides of the canopy then estimates the average transpiration rate of the entire tree the eq 9 can be rewritten as 5p 3t model 10 l e c i r c i r cp i t c i t a i t cp i t a i 11 l e c 1 n 1 n r c i r cp i t c i t a i t cp i t a i where i is the various sides of the canopy i 1 n where n is equal to 5 in this study l e c i w m2 is the latent heat flux of transpiration average transpiration rate of each side canopy refer to eq 10 r c i and r cp i are the net radiation of side i of the canopy and imitation leaves respectively t c i t cp i and t a i are the canopy surface average temperature reference leaf surface average temperature and air temperature c on the i side of the canopy respectively here l e c is the average transpiration rate of the plant canopy in w m2 according to the unit conversion eq 4 and eq 5 the transpiration rate of the canopy on each side can be expressed as follows 12 t r i l e c i a c i 10 3 24 28 4 1 467 l e c i a c i where t r i g h is the average transpiration rate of each side canopy here a c i m2 is the orthographic projection area of the solar radiation part of each side canopy the conversion from energy values to the weight of water or vice versa is given by 13 τ transpiration weight o f w a t e r watts e n e r g y s u r f a c e 1 467 where τ is the conversion coefficient to obtain energy received on a unit surface per unit time which is a constant coefficient τ 1 467 weight o f w a t e r is expressed in g h e n e r g y s u r f a c e is expressed in w and energy is the latent heat of vaporization expressed in units of radiant energy w m2 therefore the 3d 3t model is converted to calculate the transpiration rate of the entire tree t r g h which can be expressed as 14 t r 1 5 i 1 5 τ l e c i a c i 3 results 3 1 temporal variation of solar net radiation and air temperature the variation characteristics of solar net radiation and air temperature are obvious the variation trend is similar fig 5 and the downward trend of night temperature is slow the peak value of daytime radiation in this area generally appears between 11 00 13 00 while the peak value of air temperature appears between 12 00 15 00 the time when the daytime net radiation begins to rise generally appears around 5 00 while the extremely low value of daily temperature appears around 6 00 and then the temperature rises rapidly it can be seen that the extreme value of daytime temperature has a time lag compared to the extreme value of solar net radiation which is roughly 1 hour behind it can be seen that the air temperature reaches the maximum value only after a certain amount of energy is accumulated on the surface and the two together affect the transpiration of vegetation in addition the maximum temperature during the experiment was 36 8 on may 9 and the corresponding maximum solar net radiation was 283 w m2 due to the transparent plastic ceiling on the experimental site to isolate rainfall the radiation value measured in the laboratory is less than the outdoor radiation value does not affect the purpose of the experiment and on may 10 the whole day was cloudy with showers 3 2 hourly variation of imitation leaf temperature tp canopy temperature tc and air temperature ta the hourly variation of leaf temperature imitation leaf temperature and air temperature on different sides of citrus trees was measured on may 9 2021 as shown in fig 6 in the daytime the imitation leaf temperature was always higher than the canopy leaf temperature and air temperature while the t c value was between the t p value and the t a value during the day there is little difference between the canopy leaf temperature and the imitation leaf temperature the difference range is generally 1 3 and the maximum temperature difference is 3 5 the temperature difference in the morning and near evening is smaller and almost equal which may be related to the physiological characteristics leaf surface structure of citrus leaves and canopy geometry guillevic and p 2003 the changes of t c t p and t a on the top of the citrus tree in different periods also have similar results fig 7 and all data in all directions on other days during the experiment showed similar results we can also find that the rapid rise period of all these temperatures is between 9 00 and 10 00 especially in the east of the tree the daytime average leaf temperatures in the east south west north and top of the tree are 34 7 34 4 34 5 33 9 and 34 6 respectively the difference between the maximum and minimum values is only 0 8 and the minimum value appears in the north of the tree on the whole there is little difference in the average temperature of different surfaces of the citrus tree indicating that the spatial difference in the canopy temperature of the selected citrus tree is not very obvious we can refer to the temperature distribution diagram fig 4 3 3 characteristics of plant transpiration transfer coefficient hat data measured during an irrigation cycle may 8 10 were used fig 9 the average values of h at were 0 39 0 46 and 0 55 respectively showing a steady upward trend during these three days the average values of crop water stress index cwsi 1 et e t p where et and etp are evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration were 0 4 0 51 and 0 72 respectively the statistical results showed that the values of h at were in agreement with the cwsi with a determination coefficient r2 of 0 962 because no water was added during the experiment the citrus trees lost water due to transpiration as a result the soil moisture is reduced and the citrus tree is under water stress the citrus trees have lower transpiration rates under water stress ranging from 0 06 to 0 12 mm h in the daytime from 8 10 may 2021 therefore with the increase of plant water stress every day the h at shows an upward trend which is basically in line with the changes in the characteristics of water shortage this also shows that the value of h at increases with water shortage in the change of one day with the increase of solar radiation in the morning the air temperature gradually increased and the air relative humidity decreases the vapor pressure difference inside and outside the leaves increases the water evaporation of the plant canopy increases and the water loss of plants increased while the value of h at showed a rapid upward trend and then gradually calmed down and the value of h at showed an insignificant slow downward trend in the afternoon there is a small difference in the value of h at at the corresponding time point of each side fig 8 on may 9 the average value of h at in the north of the tree is 0 33 which may be under the same soil water conditions the north of the tree is less affected by radiation or environmental stress and the value of h at is generally small however it is also possible that due to the small crown width of the tree there is little difference in leaf water status and environmental conditions on each side and there is no obvious difference in the daily average value of h at in all directions 3 4 transpiration rate considering that the energy budget in different directions of the canopy may be different and the transpiration rate will be different guillevic and p 2003 qiu et al 2020 the temperature acquisition and transpiration rate calculation in five directions are carried out for the canopy of the whole tree the hourly variation curve of transpiration rates on the different sides of the citrus canopy 3t model on may 9 2021 was shown in fig 10 the transpiration rate on each side increased from morning to noon and then decreased the maximum transpiration rate was 0 19 mm h between 12 00 and 14 00 the maximum difference between the values of each side is 0 07 mm h at 13 00 it can be seen that although there are differences in the transpiration rates of the canopy on the different sides the difference is relatively small it may be that the canopy width of the experimental object is relatively small the leaf water status and environmental conditions on each side have little difference and the spatial difference of transpiration rates in different directions is not obvious during the experiment all data on all sides on other days showed similar results for the hourly scale the results of the three methods have similar trends as shown in fig 11 the transpiration rate increases from morning to noon and then decreased the data of weighing and the packaged stem sap flow gauge data on some days show that citrus trees will have a lunch break from 12 00 to 13 00 but the 5p 3t model does not reflect this there will be differences between the calculation of the 5p 3t model and the two measured calculated values the maximum difference is 0 08 mm h at 18 00 on may 8 2021 furthermore for the period from 8 00 to 18 00 on may 7 to 11 2021 the relationship between the hourly transpiration rates estimated by the 5p 3t model and by the weighing method was shown in fig 12 the transpiration rates measured by the packaged stem sap flow gauge method and the transpiration rates estimated by the 5p 3t model have good correlations with the transpiration rates measured by the weighing method both r2 0 6 with root mean square error rmse of 0 02 0 04 mm h respectively the regression line slope values of 0 9 1 2 respectively and the data points were distributed close to the 1 1 line this accuracy is sufficient for application purposes in addition in this experiment the soil of the entire pot was covered with plastic film and there was no water leakage the results showed that the values measured by the weighing method were lower than the values measured by the packaged stem sap flow gauge method which is because the water storage capacity of the plant causes a time lag between stem sap flow and transpiration bo et al 2017 that is the measured flow of stem sap includes water stored by plants microscopic water droplets adhering to leaf surfaces and water vapor that evaporates into the air for the day timescale the results were shown in fig 13 and table 1 the transpiration rate showed a gradual downward trend fig 13 and according to the actual measurement and calculation table 1 the 5 day average water demand of the citrus tree excluding soil evaporation was 0 96 mm d the measured maximum daily transpiration on may 7 was 1 3mm d and the minimum daily transpiration on may 10 was 0 7mm d fig 13 shows that the daytime water consumption measured by the packaged stem sap flow gauge method and estimated by the 5p 3t model were both less than 2 mm d while the daytime water consumption of the 2d 3t model was more than 2 mm d this means that the water consumption was overestimated by the 2d 3t model for a citrus tree while the 5p 3t model slightly underestimates it the statistical results showed that the results measured by the packaged stem sap flow gauge method have a poor correlation with the transpiration estimated by the 2d 3t model r2 0 5 rmse 0 83 mm d and have a good correlation with the results estimated by the 5p 3t model r2 0 72 rmse 0 35 mm d as shown in table 1 the daily water consumption for five consecutive days is counted it can be found that the maximum difference between the calculation of the 5p 3t model and the measured by the packaged stem sap flow gauge method values is 0 51 mm d on may 7 and 0 5 mm d on may 10 respectively the estimated results of the 5p 3t model were in good agreement with the measured results of the weighing r2 0 84 rmse 0 27 mm d this means that the plant transpiration rate calculated by the 5p 3t model is closer to the measured by the weighing method value the estimation of the model will be underestimated around 8 00 a m and near night fig 11 and may 10 is a cloudy and rainy day and the estimation value of the model is generally low the reason for analysis is that too low or too high radiation has an impact on object reflectivity air humidity and water vapor pressure and will have an impact on measurement and calculation according to the theoretical calculation eq 6 the calculated value is not only related to temperature but also related to net radiation the statistical analysis results show that when the net radiation is less than 100 w m2 the 5p 3t model will underestimate the transpiration rate when the net radiation is 0 at night the transpiration rate calculated by the 5p 3t model is also zero combined with fig 8 and fig 11 it is found that although the 5p 3t model is not suitable for cloudy days or nights the index h at still conforms to the characteristics of water shortage the results of qiu et al 2020 also show the applicability of h at in the estimation of night transpiration combined with fig 9 the average transpiration rate calculated by the measured method of the packaged stem sap flow gauge from may 8 to 10 is 0 12 0 10 and 0 06 mm h respectively this means that with the aggravation of water stress the daily transpiration rate shows a downward trend while the daily average h at value shows an upward trend therefore it can be considered that h at can evaluate plant water status 4 discussion since the validation of some methods for calculating transpiration rate are limited by the current availability of observational data and rely on ground based auxiliary measurements tian et al 2014 some parameters such as aerodynamic resistance r a canopy resistance r c etc are difficult to obtain or calculate and it is difficult to accurately estimate transpiration rate by traditional methods we used a new method 3d 3t model to estimate the transpiration rate its advantages are fewer input parameters ease to obtain and evaluate no need for plant correction factors canopy resistance and aerodynamic resistance easy remote sensing observation and it can be applied to actual field situations or even larger scale areas qiu et al 1996a the input factors required by this method were leaf temperature imitation leaf temperature air temperature and solar radiation these factors are easy to obtain and will not damage the measurement object itself in this research the transpiration rate of potted citrus was measured by the weighing method and the packaged stem sap flow gauge method a processing method for extracting green plants in visible light images based on the normalized difference ratio index ndri is proposed for the first time which can distinguish green plants from other ground objects backgrounds and shadows in the visible light image and then help to accurately extract the average canopy temperature from infrared thermal images we set up 5 observation positions around the trees to obtain the thermal images and the original 3d 3t model was converted to a 5 point three temperature model 5p 3t model the difference between the original 3d 3t model and the 5p 3t model is that we consider that the solar azimuth changes with time in a day the projection areas of the canopy in different azimuths are different and the received solar radiation energy is different the crown of the tree is small and only the orthogonal projection area of the solar radiation part in five directions is considered so the formula of energy conversion energy value is converted into equivalent evaporation was used and the transpiration latent heat of the canopy in each direction is multiplied by the corresponding projected area to obtain the average value of the transpiration rate of the whole tree canopy instead of the area proportion method used in the original 3d 3t model the results were shown in fig 14 and fig 15 in terms of daily average transpiration rate the variation trend of the original 3d 3t model and the 5p 3t model is similar to that of the packaged stem sap flow gauge method the 5p 3t model is more consistent with the packaged stem sap flow gauge method but the difference between the results calculated by the two models is not significant from the hourly scale during 8 00 9 00 and 16 00 18 00 the overall difference between the two methods was small on the contrary during 11 00 14 00 the difference gradually increased furthermore the results of both models either underestimate or overestimate the transpiration rate compared to the measured values as can be seen in fig 14 b and fig 14 c in other words although the difference between the results of the two models is not significant compared to the measured values the results of both models appear to be underestimation when the solar net radiation value is low and overestimation when the solar net radiation value is high the reason is that the model formula itself does not reflect the physiological characteristics of plants such as stomata of leaves ball et al 1987 and the regulation of plant physiology doupis et al 2013 nor does it consider the spatial distribution of meteorological conditions around the canopy qiu et al 2020 we should consider that when solar radiation is small the sensible heat flux from the surrounding warm air to the cooler canopy is an important energy source of transpiration from the tree boegh et al 1999 we can also find that there is a time lag between the peak daytime temperature and the peak solar net radiation fig 5 which is roughly 1 hour late and the spatial difference in canopy temperature of the selected citrus trees is not very obvious which will lead to the small difference of average temperature on different surfaces of citrus trees fig 6 and fig 7 during the day there is little difference between the canopy leaf temperature and the imitation leaf temperature these findings will have a deviation impact on the estimated transpiration rate of the model in particular neither the 3t model the 3d 3t model nor the 5p 3t model is suitable for estimating et when the value of net radiation tends to 0 r n c 0 or r n c p 0 or the imitation leaf temperature is close to the air temperature t p t a therefore other tree species need to be further verified and the model should be improved by taking into account the physiological characteristics of plants the spatial distribution of meteorological conditions around the canopy and energy transfer such as the surrounding warm air to the cooler canopy in addition this study takes individual local trees as the research object discusses their basic mechanism and verifies the model method although the 5p 3t model is only applicable to the calculation of the transpiration rate of a single tree in this paper for trees or large areas of vegetation we can refer to the method of obtaining temperature or we can obtain temperature data through infrared remote sensing including uav thermal infrared remote sensing and use the original 3t model to estimate the transpiration of vegetation on a larger spatial scale compared with traditional remote sensing observation high resolution vegetation surface temperature data can be obtained by near ground uav thermal infrared remote sensing and the vegetation transpiration rate can be estimated more accurately by using the original 3t model the model has application prospects for the estimation of other tree species and multi scale evapotranspiration yan and qiu 2016 5 conclusions 1 according to the actual measurement and calculation the 5 day average water demand of the citrus tree excluding soil evaporation was 0 96 mm d the transpiration rates estimated by the 5p 3t model are in good agreement with the results measured by the weighing method with a determination coefficient r2 of 0 84 and the root mean square error rmse of 0 27 mm d the water consumption was overestimated by the original 3t model for a citrus tree while the 5p 3t model slightly underestimates it the results measured by the packaged stem sap flow gauge method have a poor correlation with the transpiration rates estimated by the 3t model r2 0 5 rmse 0 83 mm d and have a good correlation with the 5p 3t model r2 0 72 rmse 0 35 mm d in terms of daily average transpiration rate the variation trend of the original 3d 3t model and the 5p 3t model is similar to that of the packaged stem sap flow gauge method while the 5p 3t model is more consistent with the packaged stem sap flow gauge method but the difference between the results calculated by the two models is not significant 2 the results showed that the value of h at increased with the aggravation of plant water stress the citrus trees have lower transpiration rates under water stress ranging from 0 06 to 0 12 mm h in the daytime from 8 10 may 2021 although the 3d 3t model is not suitable for cloudy days or nights the index still conforms to the characteristics of water shortage further verification of the h at value at night is needed 3 this research presented here provides a feasible way for thermal imaging technology to accurately estimate plant canopy transpiration rate which provides a certain reference for crop water demand estimation and efficient water saving irrigation in addition the model has application prospects for the estimation of other tree species and multi scale evapotranspiration this study takes a single native tree species as the research object discusses its basic mechanism and verifies the model method it is necessary to further verify other tree species and improve the model by considering the physiological characteristics of plants and the spatial

2717,crop transpiration is the main dissipation way of agricultural water accurate and effective estimation of crop transpiration is of great significance for the study of the carbon water cycle relationship and efficient water saving irrigation this study uses infrared thermal imaging technology to accurately extract the average temperature of the plant canopy as a key input for the new model three dimensional temperature 3d 3t model which is an extension of the three temperature 3t model and applied to estimate the canopy transpiration rate of typical citrus trees variety named guoqing no 1 from 8 00 to 18 00 on may 7 to 11 2021 and a processing method for extracting green plants in visible light images based on the normalized difference ratio index ndri is proposed for the first time which can distinguish green plants from other ground objects backgrounds and shadows in the visible light image and then help to accurately extract the average canopy temperature from infrared thermal images for this experiment the canopy structure characteristics of the selected experimental subjects and the measurement methods used were considered so the 3d 3t model was converted to a 5 point three temperature model 5p 3t model to estimate the canopy transpiration rate of citrus trees and evaluate the plant water status and then the sap flow measurement was used for validation the results showed that 1 the 3t model overestimated the transpiration rate of the citrus tree while the 5p 3t model underestimated it the estimated values of the 5p 3t model have a good correlation with the measured values of the packaged stem sap flow gauge method with a determination coefficient r2 of 0 72 and root mean square error rmse of 0 35 mm d 2 in this model the plant transpiration transfer coefficient h at can evaluate the water shortage of plants where the value of h at increased with the aggravation of plant water stress 3 the citrus trees have lower transpiration rates under water stress ranging from 0 06 to 0 12 mm h in the daytime from 8 10 may 2021 the model used in this study only needs the input of temperature information and net radiation and would not depend on aerodynamic resistance the method in this paper can realize the non contact and non invasive measurement of crop transpiration and it provides a feasible way to use a portable thermal imager to accurately obtain the temperature for estimating plant canopy transpiration rate keywords transpiration three temperature model infrared thermal imaging technology plant transpiration transfer coefficient water stress data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction china is a large agricultural country according to the 2020 china water resources bulletin the total national water consumption in 2020 is 581 29 billion cubic meters among them agricultural water consumption is 361 24 billion cubic meters accounting for 62 1 of the total water china is the largest country in citrus plantations and the citrus tree is a major characteristic cash crop in yichang although a wide variety of citrus can be planted and the cultivation techniques are becoming more and more perfect le and chunjie 2016 considering the issues of water trading and water allocation danso et al 2021 the current citrus tree irrigation technology are still flood irrigation drip irrigation sprinkler irrigation etc bryla et al 2005 chen et al 2018 romeo et al 2004 terry and nelson 1986 moreover the plants in some areas of yichang city are sparse and short making it difficult to accurately measure and estimate their transpiration and it is also difficult to evaluate the water status of plants therefore which method to choose to evaluate the water status and growth environment of fruit trees and determine how much irrigation water accounts for the field water holding capacity is a problem that needs further research to achieve high efficiency water saving irrigation liu et al 2012 milly and dunne 1994 evapotranspiration et includes soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration wang and yamanaka 2014 and crop transpiration is the main dissipation way of agricultural water accurate and effective estimation of crop transpiration is of great significance for studying the relationship between carbon and water cycle and for efficient water saving irrigation at present the acquisition of evapotranspiration can be divided into two categories the land et measurement method and the et model estimation method song et al 2012 while et measurement methods can be roughly divided into four categories hydrological methods micrometeorological methods plant physiology methods and infrared remote sensing methods rampazo et al 2021 and the research on the et model estimation method has made great progress penman 1948 combined the energy balance with the mass transfer method and derived an equation to compute the evaporation from an open water surface from standard climatological the method was further developed by many researchers and extended to calculate the evaporation of crop surface by introducing resistance factors such as the penman monteith method monteith 1965 and subsequently various models for estimating evapotranspiration were established however due to the spatial complexity of the underlying surface and the numerous control factors involved it is difficult to accurately quantify et monteith 1965 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 to obtain true evapotranspiration values many measurement methods are generally used to measure or estimate et e g weighing lysimeter ding et al 2010 wullschleger et al 1998 water balance method vandewiele et al 1992 bowen ratio energy balance method fritschen and fritschen 2005 eddy covariance method barr et al 2006 however most methods require expensive equipment site specific measured data or large uniform fields for vegetation with thin stems distributed in a small area the packaged stem sap flow gauge method has become a reliable method to measure the transpiration of vegetation jiang et al 2016 ma et al 2020 o keefe et al 2020 for instance ehoková et al 2022 compared the sap flow and tree growth in adult high and overaged coppice oak forests and found that the older root system of coppice provides better access to soil water and thus coppice can withstand drought stress better than high forest the abovementioned indicate that the system can be configured with multiple sensors to measure the plant stem flow and water consumption of various outdoor or indoor small vegetation it is already an advanced and convenient method and is now widely used in research and practice bo et al 2017 zha et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 however due to the diversity of tree species age size and habitat it is difficult to represent the results of a single tree on behalf of other trees and although these methods can provide high precision et values they can only be applied to point or field scales xiong and qiu 2014 due to the non uniformity of the underlying surface and water and heat transfer on a larger spatial scale it is difficult to obtain regional evapotranspiration with traditional methods while the rise of remote sensing technology makes it possible to estimate regional evapotranspiration gao and long 2008 many traditional methods to estimate evapotranspiration are also expanded on the spatial temporal scale due to the information extracted from remote sensing data however remote sensing can not directly obtain and estimate some parameters such as wind speed humidity aerodynamic resistance etc french et al 2005 li et al 2005 sánchez et al 2008 xiong and qiu 2014 the above shows that various methods of estimating et have limitations and uncertainty remains in et estimates and products for example yu et al 2022 reported that the multi year mean terrestrial et values retrieved from 6 et products ranged from 423 to 563 mm yr therefore simpler algorithms without resistance parameterization yao et al 2021 and variable calibration requirements are necessary to reduce uncertainty in et estimation and choosing a method to accurately estimate et has become a key issue in various et related studies tian et al 2014 this study uses infrared thermal imaging technology accurately extract the average canopy temperature of sparse and dwarf plants as a key input parameter for the new model three dimensional temperature 3d 3t model qiu et al 2020 that can estimate the transpiration rate of the plant canopy which is derived from the three temperature 3t model also called the two dimensional temperature 2d 3t model qiu 1996 while the three temperature 3t model is based on surface energy balance analysis without calibration and resistance parameterization requirements it consists of 5 parts soil evaporation model soil evaporation transfer coefficient evaluation of soil moisture status and environmental quality vegetation transpiration model plant transpiration transfer coefficient evaluation of vegetation moisture status and environmental quality and crop water stress index qiu et al 1999a qiu et al 1996a qiu et al 1999b qiu et al 1996b qiu et al 1998 the 3t model introduces the imitation leaf dry leaf without transpiration to estimate canopy transpiration and eliminates aerodynamic resistance qiu et al 2006a the main advantages of this method for estimating canopy evapotranspiration are that the input factors are easy to obtain the required input factors such as leaf temperature t c imitation leaf temperature t p air temperature t a and solar radiation without canopy resistance and aerodynamic resistance easy for remote sensing observation and there is no contact damage to plants when photographed with a portable thermal imager gao et al 2014 qiu et al 2006b the three temperature 3t model have been used to estimate accurate et at various scales such as green spaces urban trees shrubs and river basin qiu et al 2017 qiu et al 2021 wang et al 2016 xiong et al 2019 however the original 3t model hypothesizes that the energy for transpiration came from vertical solar radiation at the top of the plant canopy considering sparse plants or some regular blocky shrubs solar radiation in different directions can also provide additional energy for transpiration which may lead to uncertainties in transpiration estimates so the 3t model was improved into the three dimensional temperature 3d 3t model and the model has been evaluated with acceptable accuracy for example qiu et al 2020 used the 3d 3t model to estimate the transpiration rate of individual urban trees and the results were in good agreement with the sap flow method r2 0 88 root mean square error rmse 0 01 mm h and qiu et al 2021 used the modified 3d 3t model estimates transpiration rates for urban shrubs also show that the modified 3d 3t model is a reliable method for estimating urban shrub transpiration r2 0 61 mean absolute error mae 0 10 mm h since there is no accepted method to accurately measure the et of sparse and dwarf fruit trees we used infrared thermal imaging to obtain the relevant temperature parameters and validated the 3d 3t model with the et results from the weighing method and the packaged stem sap flow gauge method therefore the objectives of this research are to 1 test a new model 3d 3t model for estimating canopy transpiration rate by using infrared thermal imaging technology and 2 construct a visible light image processing method for the normalized difference ratio index ndri and modified the 3d 3t model to accurately obtain the canopy transpiration rate of the citrus tree 3 preliminary analysis the feasibility of the 3d 3t model to calculate the canopy transpiration rate analyzed the transpiration law and evaluate the water status of plants the research presented here provides a feasible way for thermal imaging technology to accurately estimate plant canopy transpiration rate 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the study area is located in the hydrology and water resources research center of china three gorges university in yichang city hubei

2004 there was no topdressing in the experimental stage and the fertilizer amount used per plant was equal the experiment lasted for 7 consecutive days 2 2 measurement and data collection 2 2 1 stem sap flow measurement in this experiment the stem sap flow measurement data was used to verify the estimated transpiration rate of citrus trees the sap flow rate of citrus trees was continuously observed and recorded by the sap flow system flow32 1k sap flow system dynamax inc houston texas usa the sensor probe sgex16 dynamax inc usa was wrapped in an appropriate position of the trunk at a height of 5cm from the soil install tarps thermal insulation and radiation shields around the sensor to minimize the effects of temperature fluctuations and rain erosion at the package from may 5 to may 11 2021 set the sap flow system operating parameters and every 15 min were recorded on a data logger cr1000 dynamax inc houston texas usa to prevent the influence of soil evaporation it is necessary to cover the soil surface of potted citrus trees with plastic film at the same time to ensure the accuracy of the measured data the weight of the whole pot of citrus trees was measured every 15 minutes with an electronic balance es60k 16d shenyang china and the average value of the weight difference between the current time and 1 hour before and after was calculated as the hourly transpiration rate 2 2 2 measurement of input parameters for the 5p 3tmodel this observation experiment was carried out in fine weather from may 5 to may 11 2021 in a rain shelter with good light transmission and ventilation the canopy leaf temperature t c and imitation leaf temperature t p were measured by a thermal imager testo 890 thermal imager testo asia ltd germany the medium and low crown citrus trees with good growth were selected considering that the crown of citrus trees is medium to small and the transpiration rate of the crown area in different directions may be different a thermal imager should be placed at the corresponding fixed positions on the top east south west and north of the tree crown to obtain the thermal image of the tree crown and monitor the temperature distribution of the canopy and the shooting angle should be adjusted at an angle to all vertical sides of the tree canopy guillevic 2003 the vegetation canopy temperature t c and imitation leaf temperature t p are obtained by non contact measurement every 1 hour from 8 00 to 18 00 the resolution of the infrared thermal imager is 640 pixels 480 pixels the spectral range of 8 14 μm and the accuracy is 2 assuming that there is an imitation leaf canopy in the plant canopy which has a relatively small volume and is representative the temperature humidity wind speed and other parameters of the plant canopy are not significantly modified by the imitation leaf canopy in this test we use dry and thin green paper 10 mm 10 mm as the imitation leaf the material color and roughness shall be similar to the actual leaf as much as possible install imitation leaves at appropriate locations around the canopy and fixed them with slender green branches and measure 10 imitation leaves in total 30 minutes before the start of the test the imitation leaf was placed at about 2 cm of the observation point to provide situational conditions similar to canopy leaves as shown in fig 1 the imitation leaves should be located at the central viewing angle of the shot approximately the geometric center of the vertical plane in each direction of the citrus canopy and place 2 imitation leaves parallel to the vertical plane when measuring the net radiation meter cannot completely cover the imitation leaf in addition the fsr 4 portable meteorological instrument beijing tianyude technology corp china monitors the meteorological factors around citrus trees in a transparent rain sheltered greenhouse the meteorological data in the same period were measured and recorded every 15 minutes including solar radiation wind speed soil temperature air temperature t a and humidity 2 3 data processing methods and model modification 2 3 1 thermal infrared image calibration in this experiment a 5 point observation method is established to measure the canopy temperature and imitation leaf temperature the original image obtained by the infrared thermal imager needs to be imported into the built in irsoft software for temperature correction and the emissivity is set to 0 97 by setting the image color and adjusting the parameters the plant canopy in the image is clear and easy to identify then we use the image superposition function twinpix in the software for the preliminary registration of the visible image and the calibrated thermal infrared image to make the resolution and size of the visible image consistent with the thermal infrared image 640 pixels 480 pixels while making the area in the visible image fully cover and coincide with the area in the thermal image since the special format of the thermal infrared image it is a file in bmt format the export of temperature information is an excel file containing only the temperature value matrix so further processing of the image is required 2 3 2 image processing based on the ndri index method by using the envi software to read the original visible light image identify green plants in the image and synthesize false color to highlight and enhance the characteristics of the recognized object and then construct the normalized difference ratio index ndri in addition the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is one of the important parameters reflecting crop growth and nutrition information govaerts and verhulst 2010 it can quantify vegetation by measuring the difference between near infrared vegetation strong reflection and red light vegetation absorption which can be expressed as 1 ndvi nir r nir r where nir is the near infrared band r is the red band the image digital number dn value can be normalized to enhance the response of the image to vegetation the visible image is a three channel layer image red green and blue bands in which the green waveband is more sensitive to the green reflection of plants and the red band has strong penetration therefore the ndri normalized difference ratio index index can be constructed to distinguish green plants from other ground objects shadows and backgrounds the formula is as follows 2 ndri ban d red b a n d green ban d red b a n d green where ban d green is the green band and ban d red is the red band in the visible light image applying eq 2 to envi 5 3 software the dn value of the visible image can be subjected to band operation and the normalized difference ratio index distribution histogram ndri fig 2 can be obtained to determine the classification threshold of the object and then the region of interest crop crown can be outlined from the visible light image and green plants can be identified fig 3 is a step by step process then the recognized clipped image is transformed into a pixel image through vba programming the pixel image cell and temperature table cell are imported into excel software correspondingly the value of the background pixel cell is defined as 0 and the value of the green plant pixel cell is defined as 1 which is superimposed with thermal infrared temperature value information at this time the temperature value is displayed in the cells of the green plant canopy in the pixel image finally the average temperature of the green plant canopy is statistically analyzed for the calculation of the 3t fig 4 shows the canopy temperature distribution in different directions after image processing 2 3 3 heat balance packaged stem sap flow gauge method the stem sap flow rate of the citrus tree is continuously observed and recorded by using the packaged stem sap flow gauge method girardi et al 2010 ham and heilman 1990 he et al 2018 sakuratani 1981 according to the principle of heat balance it is calculated according to eq 3 3 t r s a p p in q r q v c p d t where t r s a p g h is the stem sap flow rate of the citrus tree p in w is the heat input power q v w is the heat conducted by the vertical stalk q r w is the heat dissipation to the surroundings in the form of radiation c p j g is the specific heat of water dt is the increased value of the temperature between the two monitoring points of the sap the unit conversion relationship of the stem sap flux density is expressed in the radiant energy unit as follows 4 f d t r s a p a s 1 3600 5 l e c s a p f d a s a c 3600 10 3 24 28 4 where f d g m2 s is the stem flux density l e c s a p w m2 is the average transpiration rate of the canopy which represents the stem sap flow rate in the radiant energy unit a s m2 is the cross sectional area of the stem of the tree a c m2 is the area of citrus canopy 2 3 4 the process of modifying the 3t model to the 5p 3t model the three temperature model 3t is a dual source evapotranspiration model based on energy balance that can be described as 6 le r n g h where le is the latent heat flux w m2 h is the sensible heat flux w m2 rn is the net radiation w m2 and g is the soil heat flux w m2 the preconditions involved in the derivation of the model formula are summarized as follows condition 1 there is an imitation leaf canopy in the plant canopy which has a relatively small volume and is representative the temperature humidity wind speed and other parameters of the plant canopy are not significantly modified by the imitation leaf canopy qiu et al 1996a qiu et al 2009 condition 2 the radiation absorption and albedo characteristics of this imitation leaf are similar to those of plant leaves and there is no latent heat flux in the reference leaf if the ground is completely covered by this imitation leaf imitation leaf canopy l e cp 0 l e cp represents the latent heat flux of the imitation leaf canopy the subscripts cp or p represents the imitation leaf canopy condition 3 when the ground surface is completely covered by vegetation the incident radiation in the canopy cover area is intercepted by the canopy and the energy distribution on the soil surface is not significant therefore the soil evaporation under the canopy is generally low and the latent heat flux is considered to be the transpiration of the plant leaf canopy and the soil heat flux can be ignored according to conditions 1 3 the original 3t model introduces the imitation leaf dry leaf without transpiration to estimate canopy transpiration rate and eliminates aerodynamic resistance for details please refer to tian et al 2014 so canopy transpiration rate l e c w m2 can be expressed as 7 l e c r n c r n c p t c t a t p t a the variables to be input in eq are temperature where t c t a t p are canopy temperature air temperature and imitation canopy temperature the unit for temperature is c r n c is the net radiation of the canopy and r n c p is the net radiation of the imitation canopy both units are in w m2 net radiation can be measured or calculated here l e c is the transpiration rate of the plant canopy in w m2 the plant transpiration transfer coefficient h at is defined as 8 h at t c t a t p t a the plant transpiration transfer coefficient h at can evaluate the water status of vegetation qiu et al 2003 theoretically the value range is h at 1 the larger the value of h at the lower the transpiration rate of the plant due to lack of water and the smaller the value of h at which indicates that the plant has a good water condition and the transpiration rate has the maximum value the three dimensional temperature model 3d 3t model was proposed by qiu et al 2020 which is a method based on a three temperature 3t model for estimating the canopy transpiration of large trees under urban conditions for a large individual tree canopy under urban conditions differences in the energy budget occurred among different parts of the crown qiu et al 2020 based on these conditions the original 3d 3t model can be expressed as 9 l e c 1 n l e c i l i 1 n r c i r cp i t c i t a i t cp i t a i l i where l e c i w m2 is the latent heat flux of part i of the canopy l i is the ratio of the surface area of each part of the canopy to the total surface area of the canopy for small fruit trees generally the crown structure is small and the stem is thin the transpiration at the bottom is relatively small and negligible although the spatial stratification is not obvious there may still be differences in the energy budgets of different sides of the canopy and we assume that the energy of solar radiation received by the surface on the same side of the tree crown is uniformly distributed therefore we shoot at 5 fixed points in 5 directions east south west north and top of the canopy and established a 5 point temperature measurement method to obtain the average canopy temperature from the five directions of the fruit tree by using thermal imaging technology and estimated the transpiration rate of the top of the canopy and the east south west and north sides of the canopy then estimates the average transpiration rate of the entire tree the eq 9 can be rewritten as 5p 3t model 10 l e c i r c i r cp i t c i t a i t cp i t a i 11 l e c 1 n 1 n r c i r cp i t c i t a i t cp i t a i where i is the various sides of the canopy i 1 n where n is equal to 5 in this study l e c i w m2 is the latent heat flux of transpiration average transpiration rate of each side canopy refer to eq 10 r c i and r cp i are the net radiation of side i of the canopy and imitation leaves respectively t c i t cp i and t a i are the canopy surface average temperature reference leaf surface average temperature and air temperature c on the i side of the canopy respectively here l e c is the average transpiration rate of the plant canopy in w m2 according to the unit conversion eq 4 and eq 5 the transpiration rate of the canopy on each side can be expressed as follows 12 t r i l e c i a c i 10 3 24 28 4 1 467 l e c i a c i where t r i g h is the average transpiration rate of each side canopy here a c i m2 is the orthographic projection area of the solar radiation part of each side canopy the conversion from energy values to the weight of water or vice versa is given by 13 τ transpiration weight o f w a t e r watts e n e r g y s u r f a c e 1 467 where τ is the conversion coefficient to obtain energy received on a unit surface per unit time which is a constant coefficient τ 1 467 weight o f w a t e r is expressed in g h e n e r g y s u r f a c e is expressed in w and energy is the latent heat of vaporization expressed in units of radiant energy w m2 therefore the 3d 3t model is converted to calculate the transpiration rate of the entire tree t r g h which can be expressed as 14 t r 1 5 i 1 5 τ l e c i a c i 3 results 3 1 temporal variation of solar net radiation and air temperature the variation characteristics of solar net radiation and air temperature are obvious the variation trend is similar fig 5 and the downward trend of night temperature is slow the peak value of daytime radiation in this area generally appears between 11 00 13 00 while the peak value of air temperature appears between 12 00 15 00 the time when the daytime net radiation begins to rise generally appears around 5 00 while the extremely low value of daily temperature appears around 6 00 and then the temperature rises rapidly it can be seen that the extreme value of daytime temperature has a time lag compared to the extreme value of solar net radiation which is roughly 1 hour behind it can be seen that the air temperature reaches the maximum value only after a certain amount of energy is accumulated on the surface and the two together affect the transpiration of vegetation in addition the maximum temperature during the experiment was 36 8 on may 9 and the corresponding maximum solar net radiation was 283 w m2 due to the transparent plastic ceiling on the experimental site to isolate rainfall the radiation value measured in the laboratory is less than the outdoor radiation value does not affect the purpose of the experiment and on may 10 the whole day was cloudy with showers 3 2 hourly variation of imitation leaf temperature tp canopy temperature tc and air temperature ta the hourly variation of leaf temperature imitation leaf temperature and air temperature on different sides of citrus trees was measured on may 9 2021 as shown in fig 6 in the daytime the imitation leaf temperature was always higher than the canopy leaf temperature and air temperature while the t c value was between the t p value and the t a value during the day there is little difference between the canopy leaf temperature and the imitation leaf temperature the difference range is generally 1 3 and the maximum temperature difference is 3 5 the temperature difference in the morning and near evening is smaller and almost equal which may be related to the physiological characteristics leaf surface structure of citrus leaves and canopy geometry guillevic and p 2003 the changes of t c t p and t a on the top of the citrus tree in different periods also have similar results fig 7 and all data in all directions on other days during the experiment showed similar results we can also find that the rapid rise period of all these temperatures is between 9 00 and 10 00 especially in the east of the tree the daytime average leaf temperatures in the east south west north and top of the tree are 34 7 34 4 34 5 33 9 and 34 6 respectively the difference between the maximum and minimum values is only 0 8 and the minimum value appears in the north of the tree on the whole there is little difference in the average temperature of different surfaces of the citrus tree indicating that the spatial difference in the canopy temperature of the selected citrus tree is not very obvious we can refer to the temperature distribution diagram fig 4 3 3 characteristics of plant transpiration transfer coefficient hat data measured during an irrigation cycle may 8 10 were used fig 9 the average values of h at were 0 39 0 46 and 0 55 respectively showing a steady upward trend during these three days the average values of crop water stress index cwsi 1 et e t p where et and etp are evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration were 0 4 0 51 and 0 72 respectively the statistical results showed that the values of h at were in agreement with the cwsi with a determination coefficient r2 of 0 962 because no water was added during the experiment the citrus trees lost water due to transpiration as a result the soil moisture is reduced and the citrus tree is under water stress the citrus trees have lower transpiration rates under water stress ranging from 0 06 to 0 12 mm h in the daytime from 8 10 may 2021 therefore with the increase of plant water stress every day the h at shows an upward trend which is basically in line with the changes in the characteristics of water shortage this also shows that the value of h at increases with water shortage in the change of one day with the increase of solar radiation in the morning the air temperature gradually increased and the air relative humidity decreases the vapor pressure difference inside and outside the leaves increases the water evaporation of the plant canopy increases and the water loss of plants increased while the value of h at showed a rapid upward trend and then gradually calmed down and the value of h at showed an insignificant slow downward trend in the afternoon there is a small difference in the value of h at at the corresponding time point of each side fig 8 on may 9 the average value of h at in the north of the tree is 0 33 which may be under the same soil water conditions the north of the tree is less affected by radiation or environmental stress and the value of h at is generally small however it is also possible that due to the small crown width of the tree there is little difference in leaf water status and environmental conditions on each side and there is no obvious difference in the daily average value of h at in all directions 3 4 transpiration rate considering that the energy budget in different directions of the canopy may be different and the transpiration rate will be different guillevic and p 2003 qiu et al 2020 the temperature acquisition and transpiration rate calculation in five directions are carried out for the canopy of the whole tree the hourly variation curve of transpiration rates on the different sides of the citrus canopy 3t model on may 9 2021 was shown in fig 10 the transpiration rate on each side increased from morning to noon and then decreased the maximum transpiration rate was 0 19 mm h between 12 00 and 14 00 the maximum difference between the values of each side is 0 07 mm h at 13 00 it can be seen that although there are differences in the transpiration rates of the canopy on the different sides the difference is relatively small it may be that the canopy width of the experimental object is relatively small the leaf water status and environmental conditions on each side have little difference and the spatial difference of transpiration rates in different directions is not obvious during the experiment all data on all sides on other days showed similar results for the hourly scale the results of the three methods have similar trends as shown in fig 11 the transpiration rate increases from morning to noon and then decreased the data of weighing and the packaged stem sap flow gauge data on some days show that citrus trees will have a lunch break from 12 00 to 13 00 but the 5p 3t model does not reflect this there will be differences between the calculation of the 5p 3t model and the two measured calculated values the maximum difference is 0 08 mm h at 18 00 on may 8 2021 furthermore for the period from 8 00 to 18 00 on may 7 to 11 2021 the relationship between the hourly transpiration rates estimated by the 5p 3t model and by the weighing method was shown in fig 12 the transpiration rates measured by the packaged stem sap flow gauge method and the transpiration rates estimated by the 5p 3t model have good correlations with the transpiration rates measured by the weighing method both r2 0 6 with root mean square error rmse of 0 02 0 04 mm h respectively the regression line slope values of 0 9 1 2 respectively and the data points were distributed close to the 1 1 line this accuracy is sufficient for application purposes in addition in this experiment the soil of the entire pot was covered with plastic film and there was no water leakage the results showed that the values measured by the weighing method were lower than the values measured by the packaged stem sap flow gauge method which is because the water storage capacity of the plant causes a time lag between stem sap flow and transpiration bo et al 2017 that is the measured flow of stem sap includes water stored by plants microscopic water droplets adhering to leaf surfaces and water vapor that evaporates into the air for the day timescale the results were shown in fig 13 and table 1 the transpiration rate showed a gradual downward trend fig 13 and according to the actual measurement and calculation table 1 the 5 day average water demand of the citrus tree excluding soil evaporation was 0 96 mm d the measured maximum daily transpiration on may 7 was 1 3mm d and the minimum daily transpiration on may 10 was 0 7mm d fig 13 shows that the daytime water consumption measured by the packaged stem sap flow gauge method and estimated by the 5p 3t model were both less than 2 mm d while the daytime water consumption of the 2d 3t model was more than 2 mm d this means that the water consumption was overestimated by the 2d 3t model for a citrus tree while the 5p 3t model slightly underestimates it the statistical results showed that the results measured by the packaged stem sap flow gauge method have a poor correlation with the transpiration estimated by the 2d 3t model r2 0 5 rmse 0 83 mm d and have a good correlation with the results estimated by the 5p 3t model r2 0 72 rmse 0 35 mm d as shown in table 1 the daily water consumption for five consecutive days is counted it can be found that the maximum difference between the calculation of the 5p 3t model and the measured by the packaged stem sap flow gauge method values is 0 51 mm d on may 7 and 0 5 mm d on may 10 respectively the estimated results of the 5p 3t model were in good agreement with the measured results of the weighing r2 0 84 rmse 0 27 mm d this means that the plant transpiration rate calculated by the 5p 3t model is closer to the measured by the weighing method value the estimation of the model will be underestimated around 8 00 a m and near night fig 11 and may 10 is a cloudy and rainy day and the estimation value of the model is generally low the reason for analysis is that too low or too high radiation has an impact on object reflectivity air humidity and water vapor pressure and will have an impact on measurement and calculation according to the theoretical calculation eq 6 the calculated value is not only related to temperature but also related to net radiation the statistical analysis results show that when the net radiation is less than 100 w m2 the 5p 3t model will underestimate the transpiration rate when the net radiation is 0 at night the transpiration rate calculated by the 5p 3t model is also zero combined with fig 8 and fig 11 it is found that although the 5p 3t model is not suitable for cloudy days or nights the index h at still conforms to the characteristics of water shortage the results of qiu et al 2020 also show the applicability of h at in the estimation of night transpiration combined with fig 9 the average transpiration rate calculated by the measured method of the packaged stem sap flow gauge from may 8 to 10 is 0 12 0 10 and 0 06 mm h respectively this means that with the aggravation of water stress the daily transpiration rate shows a downward trend while the daily average h at value shows an upward trend therefore it can be considered that h at can evaluate plant water status 4 discussion since the validation of some methods for calculating transpiration rate are limited by the current availability of observational data and rely on ground based auxiliary measurements tian et al 2014 some parameters such as aerodynamic resistance r a canopy resistance r c etc are difficult to obtain or calculate and it is difficult to accurately estimate transpiration rate by traditional methods we used a new method 3d 3t model to estimate the transpiration rate its advantages are fewer input parameters ease to obtain and evaluate no need for plant correction factors canopy resistance and aerodynamic resistance easy remote sensing observation and it can be applied to actual field situations or even larger scale areas qiu et al 1996a the input factors required by this method were leaf temperature imitation leaf temperature air temperature and solar radiation these factors are easy to obtain and will not damage the measurement object itself in this research the transpiration rate of potted citrus was measured by the weighing method and the packaged stem sap flow gauge method a processing method for extracting green plants in visible light images based on the normalized difference ratio index ndri is proposed for the first time which can distinguish green plants from other ground objects backgrounds and shadows in the visible light image and then help to accurately extract the average canopy temperature from infrared thermal images we set up 5 observation positions around the trees to obtain the thermal images and the original 3d 3t model was converted to a 5 point three temperature model 5p 3t model the difference between the original 3d 3t model and the 5p 3t model is that we consider that the solar azimuth changes with time in a day the projection areas of the canopy in different azimuths are different and the received solar radiation energy is different the crown of the tree is small and only the orthogonal projection area of the solar radiation part in five directions is considered so the formula of energy conversion energy value is converted into equivalent evaporation was used and the transpiration latent heat of the canopy in each direction is multiplied by the corresponding projected area to obtain the average value of the transpiration rate of the whole tree canopy instead of the area proportion method used in the original 3d 3t model the results were shown in fig 14 and fig 15 in terms of daily average transpiration rate the variation trend of the original 3d 3t model and the 5p 3t model is similar to that of the packaged stem sap flow gauge method the 5p 3t model is more consistent with the packaged stem sap flow gauge method but the difference between the results calculated by the two models is not significant from the hourly scale during 8 00 9 00 and 16 00 18 00 the overall difference between the two methods was small on the contrary during 11 00 14 00 the difference gradually increased furthermore the results of both models either underestimate or overestimate the transpiration rate compared to the measured values as can be seen in fig 14 b and fig 14 c in other words although the difference between the results of the two models is not significant compared to the measured values the results of both models appear to be underestimation when the solar net radiation value is low and overestimation when the solar net radiation value is high the reason is that the model formula itself does not reflect the physiological characteristics of plants such as stomata of leaves ball et al 1987 and the regulation of plant physiology doupis et al 2013 nor does it consider the spatial distribution of meteorological conditions around the canopy qiu et al 2020 we should consider that when solar radiation is small the sensible heat flux from the surrounding warm air to the cooler canopy is an important energy source of transpiration from the tree boegh et al 1999 we can also find that there is a time lag between the peak daytime temperature and the peak solar net radiation fig 5 which is roughly 1 hour late and the spatial difference in canopy temperature of the selected citrus trees is not very obvious which will lead to the small difference of average temperature on different surfaces of citrus trees fig 6 and fig 7 during the day there is little difference between the canopy leaf temperature and the imitation leaf temperature these findings will have a deviation impact on the estimated transpiration rate of the model in particular neither the 3t model the 3d 3t model nor the 5p 3t model is suitable for estimating et when the value of net radiation tends to 0 r n c 0 or r n c p 0 or the imitation leaf temperature is close to the air temperature t p t a therefore other tree species need to be further verified and the model should be improved by taking into account the physiological characteristics of plants the spatial distribution of meteorological conditions around the canopy and energy transfer such as the surrounding warm air to the cooler canopy in addition this study takes individual local trees as the research object discusses their basic mechanism and verifies the model method although the 5p 3t model is only applicable to the calculation of the transpiration rate of a single tree in this paper for trees or large areas of vegetation we can refer to the method of obtaining temperature or we can obtain temperature data through infrared remote sensing including uav thermal infrared remote sensing and use the original 3t model to estimate the transpiration of vegetation on a larger spatial scale compared with traditional remote sensing observation high resolution vegetation surface temperature data can be obtained by near ground uav thermal infrared remote sensing and the vegetation transpiration rate can be estimated more accurately by using the original 3t model the model has application prospects for the estimation of other tree species and multi scale evapotranspiration yan and qiu 2016 5 conclusions 1 according to the actual measurement and calculation the 5 day average water demand of the citrus tree excluding soil evaporation was 0 96 mm d the transpiration rates estimated by the 5p 3t model are in good agreement with the results measured by the weighing method with a determination coefficient r2 of 0 84 and the root mean square error rmse of 0 27 mm d the water consumption was overestimated by the original 3t model for a citrus tree while the 5p 3t model slightly underestimates it the results measured by the packaged stem sap flow gauge method have a poor correlation with the transpiration rates estimated by the 3t model r2 0 5 rmse 0 83 mm d and have a good correlation with the 5p 3t model r2 0 72 rmse 0 35 mm d in terms of daily average transpiration rate the variation trend of the original 3d 3t model and the 5p 3t model is similar to that of the packaged stem sap flow gauge method while the 5p 3t model is more consistent with the packaged stem sap flow gauge method but the difference between the results calculated by the two models is not significant 2 the results showed that the value of h at increased with the aggravation of plant water stress the citrus trees have lower transpiration rates under water stress ranging from 0 06 to 0 12 mm h in the daytime from 8 10 may 2021 although the 3d 3t model is not suitable for cloudy days or nights the index still conforms to the characteristics of water shortage further verification of the h at value at night is needed 3 this research presented here provides a feasible way for thermal imaging technology to accurately estimate plant canopy transpiration rate which provides a certain reference for crop water demand estimation and efficient water saving irrigation in addition the model has application prospects for the estimation of other tree species and multi scale evapotranspiration this study takes a single native tree species as the research object discusses its basic mechanism and verifies the model method it is necessary to further verify other tree species and improve the model by considering the physiological characteristics of plants and the spatial

2718,lake evaporation plays an important role in the water budget of lakes predicting lake evaporation responses to climate change is thus of paramount importance for the planning of mitigation and adaption strategies however most studies that have simulated climate change impacts on lake evaporation have typically utilised a single mechanistic model whilst such studies have merit projected changes in lake evaporation from any single lake model can be considered uncertain to better understand evaporation responses to climate change a multi model approach i e where a range of projections are considered is desirable in this study we present such multi model analysis where five lake models forced by four different climate model projections are used to simulate historic and future change 1901 2099 in lake evaporation our investigation which focuses on sub tropical lake kinneret israel suggested considerable differences in simulated evaporation rates among the models with the annual average evaporation rates varying between 1232 mm year 1 and 2608 mm year 1 during the historic period 1901 2005 we explored these differences by comparing the models with reference evaporation rates estimated using in situ data 2000 2005 and a bulk aerodynamic algorithm we found that the model ensemble generally captured the intra annual variability in reference evaporation rates and compared well at seasonal timescales rmsec 0 19 r 0 92 using the model ensemble we then projected future change in evaporation rates under three different representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rcp 2 6 6 0 and 8 5 our projections indicated that by the end of the 21st century 2070 2099 annual average evaporation rates would increase in lake kinneret by 9 22 under rcps 2 6 8 5 when compared with projected regional declines in precipitation our projections suggested that the water balance of lake kinneret could experience a deficit of 14 40 this century we anticipate this substantial projected deficit combined with a considerable growth in population expected for this region could have considerable negative impacts on water availability and would consequently increase regional water stress keywords ensemble modelling lake evaporation climate change lake kinneret 1 introduction lake evaporation plays a fundamental role in the basic functioning of lakes evaporation directly and in some cases substantially modifies the hydrologic chemical and energy budgets making it one of the most important physical controls on lake ecosystems schindler 2001 lenters et al 2005 riveros iregui et al 2017 woolway et al 2020 not only does lake evaporation play a fundamental role in these budgets through the physical removal of fresh water but the cooling effect of latent heat flux is also central to the modification of lake temperature and related processes such as stratification mishra et al 2011 lenters et al 2013 spence et al 2013 van cleave et al 2014 and vertical mixing macintyre et al 2009 ye et al 2019 with likely impacts on lake chemistry and biota likens et al 2009 williamson et al 2009 wahed et al 2014 importantly lake evaporation also contributes to critical feedbacks within lakes including interactions between evaporation and lake surface temperature lenters et al 2013 spence et al 2013 van cleave et al 2014 ye et al 2019 kishcha et al 2021 feedbacks between salinity and evaporation rates shilo et al 2015 riveros iregui et al 2017 and the coupling of evaporation with changes in lake level and extent marsh and bigras 1988 li et al 2013 friedrich et al 2018 zhan et al 2019 while evaporation substantially influences various processes within the lake fluctuations in water level represent arguably one of the most important ones for the ecosystem services that lakes provide a decline in lake water level can have major implications for access to clean water collection of food via fishing the transportation of goods energy generation and ecosystem loss zohary and ostrovsky 2011 evaporation in lakes is largely governed by the magnitude of the vapor pressure gradient between the lake surface and the overlying atmosphere hostetler and bartlein 1990 lenters et al 2005 2014 this gradient and thereafter the transfer of latent heat is determined primarily by the temperature of the lake surface the absolute humidity in the atmosphere and the amount of wind induced turbulent mixing at the air water interface lenters et al 2014 woolway et al 2018 some of the most direct atmospheric drivers of lake evaporation are thus wind speed and absolute humidity i e the basis of eddy covariance measurements however due to the influence of lake surface temperature on the vapor pressure gradient other atmospheric and limnological factors which influence the lake heat budget also play a considerable role in evaporation brutsaert 1982 lenters et al 2005 friedrich et al 2018 overall the sources of available energy that influence lake evaporation are numerous including incoming radiation both solar and longwave sensible heat flux via changes in the bowen ratio advected heat snowfall groundwater etc and changes in heat stored within the lake itself the energy available for evaporation is also modulated by the amount of outgoing longwave and shortwave radiation which are dictated by lake surface temperature and shortwave albedo respectively in addition to these climatic drivers numerous lake specific features such as water clarity wind sheltering and lake depth can modify the timing and or intensity of lake evaporation primarily through influences on lake surface temperature heat storage and wind mixing mcvicar et al 2012 read et al 2012 zhan et al 2019 as a result of these complex interactions and the dependence of many lake specific factors evaporation is highly variable between lakes marsh and bigras 1988 woolway et al 2018 wang et al 2018 konapala et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 given the significance of lake evaporation as well as its complex interactions with other within lake processes predicting its response to climate change is of paramount importance to accurately simulate lake evaporation responses to historic and future climatic variations process based numerical models that can compute complex air water and within lake thermodynamic fluxes are needed a number of such process based models have been developed in recent decades including those based on among other things eddy diffusion hostetler and bartlein 1990 hostetler et al 1993 bulk formulation mironov 2008 energy balance hipsey et al 2019 and turbulence closure burchard et al 1999 goudsmit et al 2002 however most studies that simulate climate change impacts on lake evaporation have utilised only a single mechanistic model hostetler and bartlein 1990 vallet coulomb et al 2001 lenters et al 2005 wang et al 2018 whilst such studies have merit most lake models implement approximate forms of relationships either due to incomplete knowledge of some processes or for practical computing purposes furthermore any individual model provides an approximation of reality for which uncertainty is often not quantified moore et al 2021 an alternate method is to adopt an ensemble approach where multiple independently developed models are used such coordinated experiments have become the de facto standard in climate science including for example the coupled model intercomparison project meehl et al 2005 ensemble modelling of lake responses to climate change is however in its infancy trolle et al 2014 gal et al 2020 mesman et al 2020 grant et al 2021 moore et al 2021 woolway et al 2021 feldbauer et al 2022 the overarching aim of this study was to investigate changes in lake evaporation under historic and future climate using a suite of independently developed lake models forced with projections from multiple general circulation models gcms to produce an ensemble of lake climate model projections our study was focused on lake kinneret israel a lake with high socio economic political and religious value also known as the sea of galilee lake kinneret provides 25 30 of the drinking water in israel shilo et al 2015 and 100 million m3 year 1 to the kingdom of jordan analysing the impacts of climate change on evaporation rates in lake kinneret is thus of primary importance for adaptation and mitigation strategies here we investigate i multi model projections of lake evaporation during the historical period and evaluate key differences across the model ensemble ii assess the accuracy of the model ensemble relative to a reference evaporation estimated using observed data at seasonal annual and intra annual timescales and iii using the model ensemble we investigate future projections of lake evaporation this century under different climate change scenarios 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area lake kinneret is a sub tropical monomictic lake located in the northern region of israel fig 1 the average surface area of the lake is 168 7 km2 with an average volume of 4100 mm3 zohary et al 2014 the mean and maximum depths of lake kinneret are 25 6 and 41 7 m respectively shilo et al 2015 and its average residence time is 8 10 years rimmer et al 2009 van emmerik et al 2013 climatic conditions in the region can be categorised as warm and dry with annual average air temperatures of 21 c maximum 36 c annual average rainfall of 380 mm year 1 and surface winds often exceeding 10 m s 1 zohary et al 2014 gal et al 2020 the main inflows of lake kinneret are the jordan and meshushim rivers and considerable water input comes as runoff and from saline springs as groundwater the most important outflows from the lake consist of water withdrawals via the national water carrier nwc the degania dam and pumping around the lake by local consumers gal et al 2003 2 2 multi model projections of lake evaporation lake projections investigated in this study were a lake climate model ensemble of 20 model realizations more specifically from five lake models driven by four gcms the lake models namely flake mironov 2008 glm hipsey et al 2019 gotm burchard et al 1999 mylake saloranta and andersen

kinetic energy for the layers in question the structure of the stratified layer between the upper mixed layer and the basin bottom is described using the concept of self similarity assumed shape of the temperature depth curve kirillin 2002 the same concept is used to describe the temperature structure of the thermally active upper layer of bottom sediments and when present of the ice and snow cover mironov 2008 flake uses a lake specific parameterization scheme to compute the fluxes of momentum and of sensible and latent heat flux at the lake surface based on the monin obukhov similarity relations glm general lake model hipsey et al 2019 is a process based 1 d hydrodynamic model that provides lake volume averaged output over the vertical axis it applies the integral energy assumption to calculate mixed layer depth from external turbulent kinetic energy mixing below the mixed layer depth is calculated through a parameterization of the eddy diffusivity coefficient to local gradients of buoyancy and shear glm applies a flexible grid structure which allows the model grid cells to vary in thickness and total number of cells during a simulation the latent heat flux in glm is calculated using the algorithm presented in imberger and patterson 1981 gotm general ocean turbulence model burchard et al 1999 is a vertical 1 d hydrodynamic water column model that includes key processes related to vertical mixing in marine and fresh waters umlauf and lemmin 2005 it has been adapted for use in hydrodynamic modelling of inland water bodies sachse et al 2014 gotm is often used as a stand alone model for investigating boundary layer dynamics in natural waters but it can also be coupled to biogeochemical models the surface fluxes of momentum sensible and latent heat are calculated according to the bulk formulae explained by fairall et al 1996 this model has been used to model co2 dissolution enstad et al 2008 water quality in lakes kong et al 2022 to predict lake ecosystem state andersen et al 2020 and to hindcast the thermal structure of lakes ayala et al 2020 moras et al 2019 mylake is a 1 d process based model used to simulate physical chemical and biological dynamics in lakes saloranta and andersen 2007 the model simulates thermal stratification lake ice and snow cover and phytoplankton dynamics along with sediment water interactions using a simple sediment box model v 1 12 mylake uses regularly spaced water layers whose vertical resolution is defined by the user the turbulent fluxes at the air water interface are estimated using a diffusion coefficient in the heat balance as explained by hondzo and stefan 1993 different versions of the model have been developed to simulate algal blooms salk et al 2022 co2 and ch4 kiuru et al

by internal seiches and surface ice goudsmit et al 2002 gaudard et al 2019 this model uses layers of fixed depth at 0 5 m intervals for lakes with 50 m maximum depth and at 1 m intervals for lakes 50 m and supports multiple options for external forcing comprising several meteorological variables or surface energy fluxes simstrat simulates thermal stratification and ice and snow formation gaudard et al 2019 the surface fluxes are calculated using the livingstone and imboden 1989 formulae simstrat has been applied in lakes of varying climatic and morphometric conditions thiery et al 2014 kobler and schmid 2019 mesman et al 2020 råman vinnå et al 2021 bärenbold et al 2022 2 2 2 input data and calibration bias adjusted climate projections from the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 lange 2019 were used to drive each lake model in a one way direction i e lake to atmosphere interactions were not considered specifically the lake models were driven by four gcms gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr and miroc5 during the 20th and 21st century 1901 2099 historic simulations were forced using anthropogenic greenhouse gas and aerosol forcings in addition to natural forcing and covered the period 1901 to 2005 future projections simulate the evolution of the climate system under three different greenhouse gas emission scenarios representative concentration pathways rcp rcp 2 6 low emission scenario rcp 6 0 medium high emission scenario and rcp 8 5 high emission scenario over the period 2006 to 2099 these pathways encompass a range of potential future global radiative forcing from anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols the climate data used to drive each lake model included projections of air temperature at 2 m wind speed at 10 m surface downwelling shortwave and longwave radiation precipitation and specific humidity table 2 the climate data had a spatial resolution of 0 5 and covered the whole lake surface fig 1 additional input data to the lake models included the hypsographic relationship between depth and surface area i e lake bathymetry and water transparency golub et al 2022 salinity feedbacks water inputs and withdrawals were not considered in the isimip2b simulations the calibration of the lake models in isimip2b consisted of parameters and coefficients related to processes controlling surface heat and energy fluxes light attenuation and turbulent kinetic energy and wind table 1 in addition different optimization functions were used to minimize the difference between simulated and measured water temperatures specific details of model calibration and optimization are given by golub et al 2022 lake models in isimip2b simulated historic and future projections of lake physical properties including among other things daily simulations

latent heat flux w m 2 ρ o is density of surface water kg m 3 calculated as a function of surface water temperature t0 oc and l v 2 501 10 6 2370 t 0 is the latent heat of vaporization j kg 1 henderson sellers 1986 2 3 validation of simulated evaporation rates we compared our simulations of lake evaporation from lake kinneret with those estimated from observed data 2000 2005 hereafter referred to as the reference evaporation most notably meteorological data measured on the lake surface and the algorithms available within the lakemetabolizer package in r woolway et al 2015 winslow et al 2016 were used to estimate the latent heat flux over the observational period and subsequently the evaporation rates eq 1 using the bulk aerodynamic algorithm of zeng et al 1998 the motivation to use the algorithm of zeng et al 1998 as opposed to the many others available fairall et al 2003 verburg and antenucci 2010 is that this bulk transfer method has been described as one of the least problematic bulk aerodynamic algorithms used by the scientific community for estimating surface energy fluxes brunke et al 2003 and due to the open access tools available for its calculation woolway et al 2015 winslow et al 2016 in brief this algorithm applies the monin obukhov similarity theory to the atmospheric boundary layer and states that wind temperature and humidity profile gradients depend on unique functions of the stability parameter text s1 the latent heat flux q e used to estimate the reference evaporation was calculated as 2 q e ρ z l v c ez u z q 0 q z where ρ z 100 p r a t

the saturated vapour pressure hpa at z t here c ez is the transfer coefficient for height z q which was calculated after correcting for wind measurement height and atmospheric stability zeng et al 1998 fig s1 using the estimated daily c ez we calculated an average c ez of 1 7 10 3 during the study period which is comparable to those estimated in other lakes table s1 a detailed description of the estimation of reference evaporation is provided in the supplementary material text s1 the calculated q e was then used to estimate e using eq 1 the estimated reference evaporation was also validated with monthly evaporation from water solute heat balances available from the israel national water supply company mekorot over the common period 2000 2005 meteorological data over the 2000 2005 period was collected at a fixed height on lake weather station tabgha located in the northwest region of lake kinneret 1 km offshore from the kinneret limnological laboratory 35 54 longitude and 32 86 latitude air temperature and relative humidity were measured using a young temperature relative humidity sensor probe model 43372c at 6 3 m above water surface shortwave radiation 305 2800 nm w m 2 and downwelling longwave radiation 5 25 nm w m 2 were measured using a kipp zonen delft bv pyranometer cm11 and cg1 respectively at 6 5 m above water surface wind speed and direction were measured using a young wind monitor ma 05106 at 7 8 m above the water surface water surface temperature was measured by a young platinum floating temperature probe model 41 342 at a depth of 0 05 m gal et al 2003 rimmer et al 2009 the reported measurement error of the water temperature observations was 0 005 c rimmer et al 2009 van emmerik et al 2013 the sample frequency at the tabgha station was 10 min and maintenance works were carried out once a month precipitation observations were collected from an on shore weather station located 2 km from the southern point of the lake 2 4 statistical methods to assess the performance of the lake model simulations we compared reference and simulated evaporation rates over the common period 2000 2005 by estimating the normalized mean bias error mbe and the normalized root mean squared error rmsec and then summarizing the results within a target diagram jolliff et al 2009 in addition the spearman rank correlation r was used to assess the ability of the models to reproduce seasonal and intra annual variability patterns from the reference evaporation 2 5 historic and future projections of precipitation and population complementary to our lake evaporation projections we used historic and future projections of precipitation p in the region these were also available from isimip2b frieler et al 2017 projections of p and e were used in this study to estimate changes to the net flux of water between the atmosphere and the surface p e during the historic and future periods this net flux was also used to provide insights into potential future changes to the volume of water in lake kinneret the precipitation data consisted of daily values for historic and future scenarios available for the four gcms and the three rcps used in projecting future changes in lake evaporation in addition we obtained historic and future population projections for the study area that were available from the isimip3b for two shared socio economic pathways i e ssp 1 comparable to rcp 2 6 and ssp 5 comparable to rcp 8 5 at a 0 5 degree spatial resolution for lake kinneret and the surrounding region we defined a bounding box of longitude 34 25 36 and latitude 29 25 33 75 when extracting the gridded population data concurrent changes in the local population and p e are used here to provide insights into changes in water stress within the region in the future precipitation and population data are freely available from the isimip data repository at https data isimip org 3 results 3 1 validation of simulated evaporation rates we compared simulated evaporation rates from our lake climate model ensemble with the reference evaporation over the period 2000 2005 our analysis suggests that lake evaporation estimates were sensitive to the choice of lake model at daily and seasonal timescales the reference evaporation was generally within the range of those simulated by the model ensemble which suggests that they adequately capture the intra annual variability of the reference evaporation moreover the mean of the model ensemble followed closely the seasonal variation in the reference evaporation fig 2 to better assess the performance of the individual lakes models we compared the monthly reference and simulated evaporation rates with three performance metrics namely the spearman rank correlation r rmsec and mbe fig 3 table 3 our analysis suggested that among the lake models tested mylake compared best with the reference evaporation r 0 88 rmsec 0 14 mbe 0 04 followed by flake r 0 77 rmsec 0 19 mbe 0 05 gotm r 0 86 rmsec 0 23 mbe 0 18 simstrat r 0 76 rmsec 0 31 mbe 0 27 and glm r 0 77 rmsec 0 43 mbe 0 41 furthermore a high correlation and low error r 0 92 rmsec 0 19 mbe 0 15 was calculated between the mean of the lake climate model ensemble and the reference evaporation fig 4 a overall our comparison suggests that the mean of the models performed better than most of the individual models and considerably better than the worst performing model fig 4 although it is important to note that the mean of the ensemble showed slightly higher evaporation rates relative to the reference evaporation particularly when evaporation rates were low fig 4a moreover a comparison of reference and simulated evaporation rates at seasonal timescales suggested that some models e g flake and mylake generally underestimated the reference evaporation rates during all seasons except winter while the opposite was true for other models e g gotm glm and simstrat which overestimated evaporation rates in all seasons table 4 we also calculated the percent error in simulated seasonal evaporation rates which demonstrated considerable variability in the performance of lake models across seasons for instance the models with the lowest percent error across seasons were mylake 17 to 21 and flake 24 to 43 gotm exhibited errors between 5 and 45 followed by simstrat 20 and 99 and glm 38 and 111 table 4 overall our results suggest that for this particular lake and during the time period of interest one could argue that mylake and flake performed best when simulating the reference evaporation however this could be due to the positive and negative seasonal biases of these lake models being compensated for and thus resulting in an overall lower bias than gotm glm and simstrat most impressive was the performance of the model ensemble and particularly the mean in capturing the seasonality in reference evaporation rates importantly our analysis suggests that some lake models perform better than others during some parts of the year and that including information from the ensemble is desirable finally a comparison revealed that the reference evaporation closely captured the intra annual variability of mekorot evaporation estimates which is reflected by the high correlation and low error estimated r 0 91 rmsec 0 10 mbe 0 02 see fig 2a and fig s2 suggesting that our reference evaporation is robust and can be used as a basis for validation of our simulations 3 2 multi model projections of lake evaporation during the 20th and 21st century following the validation of our model ensemble from 2000 to 2005 we investigated long term historic and future changes in evaporation rates over the period 1900 2099 specifically we investigated differences across the lake climate model ensemble in order to evaluate any discrepancies in projected future change fig 5 the future projections showed noticeable differences in lake evaporation anomalies i e the difference between lake evaporation in a given time period relative to the base period 1971 2000 average across the model ensemble by the end of this century 2070 2099 our results indicate that for the high emissions scenario rcp 8 5 mylake and flake projected the smallest increase in evaporation rates of 320 mm year 1 and 329 mm year 1 respectively whereas gotm 452 mm year 1 glm 438 mm year 1 and simstrat 388 mm year 1 projected the highest change in evaporation rates table 5 similar results were found during the historical period where the highest evaporation rates were estimated by glm gotm and simstrat furthermore our analysis suggests that the magnitude of projected change in evaporation rates differ considerably depending on the gcm used to drive the lake models particularly the average end of century evaporation anomalies across the gcms i e averaged across all lake models varied between 109 mm year 1 gfdl esm2m and 227 mm year 1 hadgem2 es under rcp 2 6 between 220 mm year 1 gfdl esm2m and 323 mm year 1 hadgem2 es under rcp 6 0 and between 334 mm year 1 gfdl esm2m and 441 mm year 1 hadgem2 es under rcp 8 5 thus the lake simulations using gfdl esm2m as input data projected considerably lower evaporation rates this century and those using hadgem2 es projected the greatest change on average given the differences in simulated evaporation rates among the lake climate model ensemble it seems relevant to combine the individual ensemble members and to calculate the average and standard deviation among them the model ensemble indicated an average annual evaporation of 1784 473 mm year 1 quoted uncertainties represent the standard deviation from the model ensemble during the latter stages of the 20th century 1971 2000 average during the 21st century 2006 to 2099 the average of the model ensemble demonstrates that evaporation rates are projected to increase considerably in lake kinneret fig 6 under rcp 2 6 lake evaporation is projected to increase by 160 70 mm year 1 by the end of the 21st century 2070 to 2099 for rcp 6 0 lake evaporation is projected to increase by 258 76 mm year 1 the largest change in lake evaporation is projected under rcp 8 5 with evaporation rates increasing by 385 93 mm year 1 these projected changes correspond to a percent increase of 9 14 and 22 for rcp 2 6 6 0 and 8 5 respectively compared to the base period average table 6 the magnitude of change in lake evaporation will not be the same throughout the year but will change differently across seasons fig 7 moreover similar to our projections of annual evaporation rates the projected changes in evaporation across seasons will vary across the lake climate model ensemble our future projections of seasonal evaporation show an overall increase compared to the historic period for all seasons and rcp scenarios fig 7 table 7 in the historic period 1971 2000 evaporation estimates were between 314 77 mm season 1 in the winter and 621 197 mm season 1 in the summer we calculated the projected changes in seasonal evaporation by the end of the 21st century 2070 2099 and found that the greatest change occurred in spring corresponding to an increase of 12 for rcp 2 6 20 for rcp 6 0 and 30 for rcp 8 5 these changes were followed by an increase in evaporation during autumn corresponding to an increase of 9 for rcp 2 6 14 for rcp 6 0 and 20 for rcp 8 5 table 7 the lowest changes across rcp scenarios were detected in the winter with increases of 8 10 and 19 under rcps 2 6 6 0 and 8 5 respectively 3 3 concurrent changes in precipitation and evaporation to evaluate the potential impact of the simulated changes in lake evaporation on water level in lake kinneret we analysed the combined impacts of climate change on precipitation and evaporation at annual timescales changes in precipitation for our study site were highly variable with an overall decreasing trend from 2005 until the end of the 21st century for all rcps fig 8 a the average precipitation over the historic period was 454 100 mm year 1 but decreased by 28 109 mm year 1 6 98 117 mm year 1 22 and 145 102 mm year 1 32 by the end of the century under rcp 2 6 6 0 and 8 5 respectively table 8 by calculating the difference between precipitation and evaporation p e our analysis showed that the change in multi model average evaporation was projected to be greater than the change in multi model average precipitation these results suggest that changes in lake evaporation will likely be greater than those in precipitation under all rcps this century notably all rcps suggested a decrease in p e until the end of the century fig 8b this change reflected the rapid increase in projected evaporation rates and the concurrent substantial decrease in projected precipitation this century within the study region relative to the 1971 2000 base period average 1330 488 mm year 1 p e continuously decreased throughout the 21st century notably under rcps 2 6 6 0 and 8 5 p e will decrease by 188 129 mm year 1 356 148 mm year 1 and 530 145 mm year 1 respectively by the end of the 21st century 2070 2099 fig 8b these changes represent a percent change in p e of 14 27 and 40 under rcp 2 6 6 0 and 8 5 respectively table 8 the local population within the study region which was estimated to be around 10 million people during the 1971 2000 base period is projected to increase during the twenty first century fig 8b projections for the shared socioeconomic pathways ssp 1 and ssp 5 i e comparable to rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 respectively showed a pronounced future increase compared to the historical period in the case of ssp 1 rcp 2 6 there was a steep increase projected for the local population until the mid 21st century i e 2050 s and afterwards a more steady increase towards 2099 with an average population of 33 million under ssp 5 rcp 8 5 the future projections demonstrate a very steep increase of population starting from 2005 with an average population of 42 million people by the end of this century when comparing these increases to the historical period we estimated a striking increase in population of 248 for the rcp 2 6 scenario and 337 for the rcp 8 5 table 8 4 discussion projecting future changes in lake evaporation is critical for ecosystem and water resource management particularly in areas where these resources are already under immense pressure givati et al 2019 prange et al 2020 in this study we provide an assessment of projected changes in evaporation rates in lake kinneret a socioeconomically important lake in the middle east using a model ensemble of 20 lake climate model combinations 5 lake models and 4 gcms we found that the ensemble mean of the models tested was superior to most of the individual lake climate model realizations in describing the reference evaporation rates in lake kinneret during the historical period this is in agreement with our expectations and in line with experiences on the use of ensemble modelling within the climate science community trolle et al 2014 moore et al 2021 which have often shown that an ensemble approach provides more robust projections of complex systems compared to any single model by applying 20 lake climate model combinations to simulate one lake we were able to understand key differences in model performance and likewise to demonstrate the usefulness of an ensemble approach for projecting lake responses to climate change the lake climate models generally agreed on the seasonal variability in evaporation rates and match those shown in the reference evaporation calculated using observational data with the ensemble mean often showing the best performance regarding our future projections our analysis also demonstrated that it is critical to consider an ensemble of both lake and climate model simulations when projecting future change in lakes given the spread of the projected changes although we believe that this study bridges an important knowledge gap there are some limitations that should be considered when interpreting our findings firstly our projections are generated with 1 d process based lake models and thus horizontal features in lakes and the intra lake responses to climate change will not be captured laval et al 2003 in practice the 1 d lake models used in this study assume that evaporation rates are uniform over the entire lake surface given that input data to the models was available for one location representative of the lake however field observations in different regions have shown that the spatial distribution of lake evaporation is highly variable mahrer and assouline 1993 lenters et al 2013 similarly one might expect within lake differences in the magnitude of change in lake evaporation rates under climate change as has already been demonstrated for lake surface temperature mason et al 2016 woolway and merchant 2018 the intra lake variability in evaporation rates could be simulated with 3 d lake models but these complex models are data intensive and computationally expensive amadori et al 2021 and therefore are not often used for ensemble lake modelling particularly for investigating future change zamani et al 2021 furthermore our comparison of the simulations with reference evaporation from lake kinneret demonstrated some differences in the ability of the lake models to capture some of the variability in evaporation rates this was particularly evident in winter when seasonal evaporation rates in this lake are at their lowest however evaporation rates at this time of year are unlikely to have a considerable influence on annual evaporation rates in this lake which are the primary focus of our study some of the differences between the simulations and reference evaporation are likely due to the meteorological data used to drive the lake models specifically the gcms used in this study provide historical and future projections of atmospheric conditions at a relatively coarse 0 5 spatial resolution the gridded climate data are thus unlikely to capture all of the short scale spatial variations occurring at the lake surface particularly given the complex topography in the study region in addition to these limitations our model simulations do not consider two way interactions between the lake and the overlying atmosphere furthermore when evaporation rates are relatively low e g in winter the percent difference between simulated and reference evaporation will be relatively large while we acknowledge the limitations of using gcms in such regions these data are undoubtedly the most appropriate to predict future changes in the climate busuioc et al 2001 and in turn the studied lake in an attempt to address the spatial mismatch between observed and simulated meteorological data from the study region we used bias corrected gcm output data from isimip2b as input to the lake models frieler et al 2017 lange 2019 this bias adjustment essentially alters the statistics of climate simulation data for the purpose of making them more similar to observations to our knowledge few studies have used gcm data to project future impacts of climate change on lake kinneret rimmer et al 2011 with others using weather generators to forecast changes in the near future gal et al 2020 finally the results presented in this study do not consider ongoing climate change adaptations carried by the israeli government despite the limitations described above we believe that our study provides important insights about the future changes in evaporation rates in lake kinneret and is a valuable pilot study for larger scale across lake assessments the strength of this study is the use of a large ensemble of lake model projections which has allowed us to identify likely scenarios of future change in lake evaporation within a socioeconomically critical lake the large ensemble was invaluable in allowing us to not only project future change in evaporation but also to consider a suite of simulations and in turn include uncertainty bounds within our projections it is our hope that in underscoring the value of including ensemble modelling in lake research our work motivates continued efforts to employ an ensemble of lake models for better understanding lake responses to climate change we see good prospects for continued coordination between lake model development as well as their inclusion in large climate simulations particularly given the recent expansion of computing resources facilitates including increasing spatial resolution and correspondingly improved process representation non thermodynamic processes in lakes improved large scale hydrological processes etc we believe that upscaling the multi model approach introduced in this study to multiple lakes distributed across climatic gradients and in lakes of varying sizes and physiographic characteristics could provide important insights into lake evaporation variability and responses to climate change the access of water resources for human consumption and ecosystem services highly depends on the spatio temporal distribution of not only evaporation but also precipitation two key components of the water budget of lakes konapala et al 2020 in this study we estimated the impact of changes in both of these metrics and consequently on p e in lake kinneret we found that in all future climate change scenarios projected changes in lake evaporation were greater than the projected changes in precipitation with p e being predominantly negative and increasingly so throughout the 21st century specifically by the end of this century our projections suggest that p e in lake kinneret will decrease by between 14 and 40 under rcp 2 6 and 8 5 respectively these projected changes largely align with those described by givati et al 2019 who projected a future decrease in precipitation in this region resulting in a 44 decrease in the flow of water from the jordan river i e the main inflow to lake kinneret by 2050 2079 under rcp 8 5 however similar dramatic changes in the water budget of lake kinneret have already been reported with observational data demonstrating that precipitation in the kinneret river basin has reduced considerably since 1985 givati et al 2019 similarly streamflow observations from the jordan river indicate that flow rates have decreased by more than 50 since 2004 provoking historically low levels in lake kinneret in 2018 tal 2019 if the p e balance of lake kinneret changes in line with our future projections water availability in the region will likely be severely stressed this century notably in the absence of substantial water inflow changes e g less water extraction for irrigation a decrease in p e will likely reduce the total lake volume zhou et al 2021 our analysis has also demonstrated that a decline in p e this century will likely occur in parallel with a rapid growth in population most notably the population in the studied region is projected to increase between 248 and 337 by the end of this century under rcp 2 6 and 8 5 respectively this suggests that a growing population will likely become increasingly dependent on water from lake kinneret notably the intensification of water scarcity driven by an increasing deficit in p e combined with a rapid growth in population is likely to further enhance the depletion of lake kinneret and further enhance the already existing water stress in the region however it is also important to note that an increase in water stress within the region might reduce the local population due to possible migration in the future which is not considered in our assessment as well as the serious socioeconomic implications of declining water level influenced by an increasing deficit in p e this could lead to critical ecosystem disturbances such as an increase in salinity with implications for not only physical lake processes ladwig et al 2021 but also the community composition biomass and diversity of phytoplankton zooplankton macrophytes and fish jeppesen et al 2015 as well as a weakening of key species the proliferation of invasive species and a loss of biodiversity zohary and

2718,lake evaporation plays an important role in the water budget of lakes predicting lake evaporation responses to climate change is thus of paramount importance for the planning of mitigation and adaption strategies however most studies that have simulated climate change impacts on lake evaporation have typically utilised a single mechanistic model whilst such studies have merit projected changes in lake evaporation from any single lake model can be considered uncertain to better understand evaporation responses to climate change a multi model approach i e where a range of projections are considered is desirable in this study we present such multi model analysis where five lake models forced by four different climate model projections are used to simulate historic and future change 1901 2099 in lake evaporation our investigation which focuses on sub tropical lake kinneret israel suggested considerable differences in simulated evaporation rates among the models with the annual average evaporation rates varying between 1232 mm year 1 and 2608 mm year 1 during the historic period 1901 2005 we explored these differences by comparing the models with reference evaporation rates estimated using in situ data 2000 2005 and a bulk aerodynamic algorithm we found that the model ensemble generally captured the intra annual variability in reference evaporation rates and compared well at seasonal timescales rmsec 0 19 r 0 92 using the model ensemble we then projected future change in evaporation rates under three different representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rcp 2 6 6 0 and 8 5 our projections indicated that by the end of the 21st century 2070 2099 annual average evaporation rates would increase in lake kinneret by 9 22 under rcps 2 6 8 5 when compared with projected regional declines in precipitation our projections suggested that the water balance of lake kinneret could experience a deficit of 14 40 this century we anticipate this substantial projected deficit combined with a considerable growth in population expected for this region could have considerable negative impacts on water availability and would consequently increase regional water stress keywords ensemble modelling lake evaporation climate change lake kinneret 1 introduction lake evaporation plays a fundamental role in the basic functioning of lakes evaporation directly and in some cases substantially modifies the hydrologic chemical and energy budgets making it one of the most important physical controls on lake ecosystems schindler 2001 lenters et al 2005 riveros iregui et al 2017 woolway et al 2020 not only does lake evaporation play a fundamental role in these budgets through the physical removal of fresh water but the cooling effect of latent heat flux is also central to the modification of lake temperature and related processes such as stratification mishra et al 2011 lenters et al 2013 spence et al 2013 van cleave et al 2014 and vertical mixing macintyre et al 2009 ye et al 2019 with likely impacts on lake chemistry and biota likens et al 2009 williamson et al 2009 wahed et al 2014 importantly lake evaporation also contributes to critical feedbacks within lakes including interactions between evaporation and lake surface temperature lenters et al 2013 spence et al 2013 van cleave et al 2014 ye et al 2019 kishcha et al 2021 feedbacks between salinity and evaporation rates shilo et al 2015 riveros iregui et al 2017 and the coupling of evaporation with changes in lake level and extent marsh and bigras 1988 li et al 2013 friedrich et al 2018 zhan et al 2019 while evaporation substantially influences various processes within the lake fluctuations in water level represent arguably one of the most important ones for the ecosystem services that lakes provide a decline in lake water level can have major implications for access to clean water collection of food via fishing the transportation of goods energy generation and ecosystem loss zohary and ostrovsky 2011 evaporation in lakes is largely governed by the magnitude of the vapor pressure gradient between the lake surface and the overlying atmosphere hostetler and bartlein 1990 lenters et al 2005 2014 this gradient and thereafter the transfer of latent heat is determined primarily by the temperature of the lake surface the absolute humidity in the atmosphere and the amount of wind induced turbulent mixing at the air water interface lenters et al 2014 woolway et al 2018 some of the most direct atmospheric drivers of lake evaporation are thus wind speed and absolute humidity i e the basis of eddy covariance measurements however due to the influence of lake surface temperature on the vapor pressure gradient other atmospheric and limnological factors which influence the lake heat budget also play a considerable role in evaporation brutsaert 1982 lenters et al 2005 friedrich et al 2018 overall the sources of available energy that influence lake evaporation are numerous including incoming radiation both solar and longwave sensible heat flux via changes in the bowen ratio advected heat snowfall groundwater etc and changes in heat stored within the lake itself the energy available for evaporation is also modulated by the amount of outgoing longwave and shortwave radiation which are dictated by lake surface temperature and shortwave albedo respectively in addition to these climatic drivers numerous lake specific features such as water clarity wind sheltering and lake depth can modify the timing and or intensity of lake evaporation primarily through influences on lake surface temperature heat storage and wind mixing mcvicar et al 2012 read et al 2012 zhan et al 2019 as a result of these complex interactions and the dependence of many lake specific factors evaporation is highly variable between lakes marsh and bigras 1988 woolway et al 2018 wang et al 2018 konapala et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 given the significance of lake evaporation as well as its complex interactions with other within lake processes predicting its response to climate change is of paramount importance to accurately simulate lake evaporation responses to historic and future climatic variations process based numerical models that can compute complex air water and within lake thermodynamic fluxes are needed a number of such process based models have been developed in recent decades including those based on among other things eddy diffusion hostetler and bartlein 1990 hostetler et al 1993 bulk formulation mironov 2008 energy balance hipsey et al 2019 and turbulence closure burchard et al 1999 goudsmit et al 2002 however most studies that simulate climate change impacts on lake evaporation have utilised only a single mechanistic model hostetler and bartlein 1990 vallet coulomb et al 2001 lenters et al 2005 wang et al 2018 whilst such studies have merit most lake models implement approximate forms of relationships either due to incomplete knowledge of some processes or for practical computing purposes furthermore any individual model provides an approximation of reality for which uncertainty is often not quantified moore et al 2021 an alternate method is to adopt an ensemble approach where multiple independently developed models are used such coordinated experiments have become the de facto standard in climate science including for example the coupled model intercomparison project meehl et al 2005 ensemble modelling of lake responses to climate change is however in its infancy trolle et al 2014 gal et al 2020 mesman et al 2020 grant et al 2021 moore et al 2021 woolway et al 2021 feldbauer et al 2022 the overarching aim of this study was to investigate changes in lake evaporation under historic and future climate using a suite of independently developed lake models forced with projections from multiple general circulation models gcms to produce an ensemble of lake climate model projections our study was focused on lake kinneret israel a lake with high socio economic political and religious value also known as the sea of galilee lake kinneret provides 25 30 of the drinking water in israel shilo et al 2015 and 100 million m3 year 1 to the kingdom of jordan analysing the impacts of climate change on evaporation rates in lake kinneret is thus of primary importance for adaptation and mitigation strategies here we investigate i multi model projections of lake evaporation during the historical period and evaluate key differences across the model ensemble ii assess the accuracy of the model ensemble relative to a reference evaporation estimated using observed data at seasonal annual and intra annual timescales and iii using the model ensemble we investigate future projections of lake evaporation this century under different climate change scenarios 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area lake kinneret is a sub tropical monomictic lake located in the northern region of israel fig 1 the average surface area of the lake is 168 7 km2 with an average volume of 4100 mm3 zohary et al 2014 the mean and maximum depths of lake kinneret are 25 6 and 41 7 m respectively shilo et al 2015 and its average residence time is 8 10 years rimmer et al 2009 van emmerik et al 2013 climatic conditions in the region can be categorised as warm and dry with annual average air temperatures of 21 c maximum 36 c annual average rainfall of 380 mm year 1 and surface winds often exceeding 10 m s 1 zohary et al 2014 gal et al 2020 the main inflows of lake kinneret are the jordan and meshushim rivers and considerable water input comes as runoff and from saline springs as groundwater the most important outflows from the lake consist of water withdrawals via the national water carrier nwc the degania dam and pumping around the lake by local consumers gal et al 2003 2 2 multi model projections of lake evaporation lake projections investigated in this study were a lake climate model ensemble of 20 model realizations more specifically from five lake models driven by four gcms the lake models namely flake mironov 2008 glm hipsey et al 2019 gotm burchard et al 1999 mylake saloranta and andersen 2007 and simstrat goudsmit et al 2002 table 1 contributed to the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip phase 2b lake sector golub et al 2022 a description of each lake model used is provided below 2 2 1 lake models description flake is a 1 d bulk model based on a two layer parametric representation of the evolving temperature profile and on the integral budgets of heat and kinetic energy for the layers in question the structure of the stratified layer between the upper mixed layer and the basin bottom is described using the concept of self similarity assumed shape of the temperature depth curve kirillin 2002 the same concept is used to describe the temperature structure of the thermally active upper layer of bottom sediments and when present of the ice and snow cover mironov 2008 flake uses a lake specific parameterization scheme to compute the fluxes of momentum and of sensible and latent heat flux at the lake surface based on the monin obukhov similarity relations glm general lake model hipsey et al 2019 is a process based 1 d hydrodynamic model that provides lake volume averaged output over the vertical axis it applies the integral energy assumption to calculate mixed layer depth from external turbulent kinetic energy mixing below the mixed layer depth is calculated through a parameterization of the eddy diffusivity coefficient to local gradients of buoyancy and shear glm applies a flexible grid structure which allows the model grid cells to vary in thickness and total number of cells during a simulation the latent heat flux in glm is calculated using the algorithm presented in imberger and patterson 1981 gotm general ocean turbulence model burchard et al 1999 is a vertical 1 d hydrodynamic water column model that includes key processes related to vertical mixing in marine and fresh waters umlauf and lemmin 2005 it has been adapted for use in hydrodynamic modelling of inland water bodies sachse et al 2014 gotm is often used as a stand alone model for investigating boundary layer dynamics in natural waters but it can also be coupled to biogeochemical models the surface fluxes of momentum sensible and latent heat are calculated according to the bulk formulae explained by fairall et al 1996 this model has been used to model co2 dissolution enstad et al 2008 water quality in lakes kong et al 2022 to predict lake ecosystem state andersen et al 2020 and to hindcast the thermal structure of lakes ayala et al 2020 moras et al 2019 mylake is a 1 d process based model used to simulate physical chemical and biological dynamics in lakes saloranta and andersen 2007 the model simulates thermal stratification lake ice and snow cover and phytoplankton dynamics along with sediment water interactions using a simple sediment box model v 1 12 mylake uses regularly spaced water layers whose vertical resolution is defined by the user the turbulent fluxes at the air water interface are estimated using a diffusion coefficient in the heat balance as explained by hondzo and stefan 1993 different versions of the model have been developed to simulate algal blooms salk et al 2022 co2 and ch4 kiuru et al 2019 internal phosphorus loads markelov et al 2019 and light attenuation dynamics pilla and couture 2021 simstrat is a physical deterministic 1 d hydrodynamic model including vertical mixing induced by internal seiches and surface ice goudsmit et al 2002 gaudard et al 2019 this model uses layers of fixed depth at 0 5 m intervals for lakes with 50 m maximum depth and at 1 m intervals for lakes 50 m and supports multiple options for external forcing comprising several meteorological variables or surface energy fluxes simstrat simulates thermal stratification and ice and snow formation gaudard et al 2019 the surface fluxes are calculated using the livingstone and imboden 1989 formulae simstrat has been applied in lakes of varying climatic and morphometric conditions thiery et al 2014 kobler and schmid 2019 mesman et al 2020 råman vinnå et al 2021 bärenbold et al 2022 2 2 2 input data and calibration bias adjusted climate projections from the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 lange 2019 were used to drive each lake model in a one way direction i e lake to atmosphere interactions were not considered specifically the lake models were driven by four gcms gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr and miroc5 during the 20th and 21st century 1901 2099 historic simulations were forced using anthropogenic greenhouse gas and aerosol forcings in addition to natural forcing and covered the period 1901 to 2005 future projections simulate the evolution of the climate system under three different greenhouse gas emission scenarios representative concentration pathways rcp rcp 2 6 low emission scenario rcp 6 0 medium high emission scenario and rcp 8 5 high emission scenario over the period 2006 to 2099 these pathways encompass a range of potential future global radiative forcing from anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols the climate data used to drive each lake model included projections of air temperature at 2 m wind speed at 10 m surface downwelling shortwave and longwave radiation precipitation and specific humidity table 2 the climate data had a spatial resolution of 0 5 and covered the whole lake surface fig 1 additional input data to the lake models included the hypsographic relationship between depth and surface area i e lake bathymetry and water transparency golub et al 2022 salinity feedbacks water inputs and withdrawals were not considered in the isimip2b simulations the calibration of the lake models in isimip2b consisted of parameters and coefficients related to processes controlling surface heat and energy fluxes light attenuation and turbulent kinetic energy and wind table 1 in addition different optimization functions were used to minimize the difference between simulated and measured water temperatures specific details of model calibration and optimization are given by golub et al 2022 lake models in isimip2b simulated historic and future projections of lake physical properties including among other things daily simulations of lake surface water temperature and latent heat flux these data were used in this study to estimate evaporation rates in lake kinneret as 1 e q e ρ o l v where e is evaporation rate m s 1 q e is the latent heat flux w m 2 ρ o is density of surface water kg m 3 calculated as a function of surface water temperature t0 oc and l v 2 501 10 6 2370 t 0 is the latent heat of vaporization j kg 1 henderson sellers 1986 2 3 validation of simulated evaporation rates we compared our simulations of lake evaporation from lake kinneret with those estimated from observed data 2000 2005 hereafter referred to as the reference evaporation most notably meteorological data measured on the lake surface and the algorithms available within the lakemetabolizer package in r woolway et al 2015 winslow et al 2016 were used to estimate the latent heat flux over the observational period and subsequently the evaporation rates eq 1 using the bulk aerodynamic algorithm of zeng et al 1998 the motivation to use the algorithm of zeng et al 1998 as opposed to the many others available fairall et al 2003 verburg and antenucci 2010 is that this bulk transfer method has been described as one of the least problematic bulk aerodynamic algorithms used by the scientific community for estimating surface energy fluxes brunke et al 2003 and due to the open access tools available for its calculation woolway et al 2015 winslow et al 2016 in brief this algorithm applies the monin obukhov similarity theory to the atmospheric boundary layer and states that wind temperature and humidity profile gradients depend on unique functions of the stability parameter text s1 the latent heat flux q e used to estimate the reference evaporation was calculated as 2 q e ρ z l v c ez u z q 0 q z where ρ z 100 p r a t z 273 16 is the density of the overlying air kg m 3 p is the surface air pressure hpa r a 287 1 0 608 q z is the gas constant for moist air j kg 1 c 1 u z is the wind speed m s 1 at height z u 7 8 m

the saturated vapour pressure hpa at z t here c ez is the transfer coefficient for height z q which was calculated after correcting for wind measurement height and atmospheric stability zeng et al 1998 fig s1 using the estimated daily c ez we calculated an average c ez of 1 7 10 3 during the study period which is comparable to those estimated in other lakes table s1 a detailed description of the estimation of reference evaporation is provided in the supplementary material text s1 the calculated q e was then used to estimate e using eq 1 the estimated reference evaporation was also validated with monthly evaporation from water solute heat balances available from the israel national water supply company mekorot over the common period 2000 2005 meteorological data over the 2000 2005 period was collected at a fixed height on lake weather station tabgha located in the northwest region of lake kinneret 1 km offshore from the kinneret limnological laboratory 35 54 longitude and 32 86 latitude air temperature and relative humidity were measured using a young temperature relative humidity sensor probe model 43372c at 6 3 m above water surface shortwave radiation 305 2800 nm w m 2 and downwelling longwave radiation 5 25 nm w m 2 were measured using a kipp zonen delft bv pyranometer cm11 and cg1 respectively at 6 5 m above water surface wind speed and direction were measured using a young wind monitor ma 05106 at 7 8 m above the water surface water surface temperature was measured by a young platinum floating temperature probe model 41 342 at a depth of 0 05 m gal et al 2003 rimmer et al 2009 the reported measurement error of the water temperature observations was 0 005 c rimmer et al 2009 van emmerik et al 2013 the sample frequency at the tabgha station was 10 min and maintenance works were carried out once a month precipitation observations were collected from an on shore weather station located 2 km from the southern point of the lake 2 4 statistical methods to assess the performance of the lake model simulations we compared reference and simulated evaporation rates over the common period 2000 2005 by estimating the normalized mean bias error mbe and the normalized root mean squared error rmsec and then summarizing the results within a target diagram jolliff et al 2009 in addition the spearman rank correlation r was used to assess the ability of the models to reproduce seasonal and intra annual variability patterns from the reference evaporation 2 5 historic and future projections of precipitation and population complementary to our lake evaporation projections we used historic and future projections of precipitation p in the region these were also available from isimip2b frieler et al 2017 projections of p and e were used in this study to estimate changes to the net flux of water between the atmosphere and the surface p e during the historic and future periods this net flux was also used to provide insights into potential future changes to the volume of water in lake kinneret the precipitation data consisted of daily values for historic and future scenarios available for the four gcms and the three rcps used in projecting future changes in lake evaporation in addition we obtained historic and future population projections for the study area that were available from the isimip3b for two shared socio economic pathways i e ssp 1 comparable to rcp 2 6 and ssp 5 comparable to rcp 8 5 at a 0 5 degree spatial resolution for lake kinneret and the surrounding region we defined a bounding box of longitude 34 25 36 and latitude 29 25 33 75 when extracting the gridded population data concurrent changes in the local population and p e are used here to provide insights into changes in water stress within the region in the future precipitation and population data are freely available from the isimip data repository at https data isimip org 3 results 3 1 validation of simulated evaporation rates we compared simulated evaporation rates from our lake climate model ensemble with the reference evaporation over the period 2000 2005 our analysis suggests that lake evaporation estimates were sensitive to the choice of lake model at daily and seasonal timescales the reference evaporation was generally within the range of those simulated by the model ensemble which suggests that they adequately capture the intra annual variability of the reference evaporation moreover the mean of the model ensemble followed closely the seasonal variation in the reference evaporation fig 2 to better assess the performance of the individual lakes models we compared the monthly reference and simulated evaporation rates with three performance metrics namely the spearman rank correlation r rmsec and mbe fig 3 table 3 our analysis suggested that among the lake models tested mylake compared best with the reference evaporation r 0 88 rmsec 0 14 mbe 0 04 followed by flake r 0 77 rmsec 0 19 mbe 0 05 gotm r 0 86 rmsec 0 23 mbe 0 18 simstrat r 0 76 rmsec 0 31 mbe 0 27 and glm r 0 77 rmsec 0 43 mbe 0 41 furthermore a high correlation and low error r 0 92 rmsec 0 19 mbe 0 15 was calculated between the mean of the lake climate model ensemble and the reference evaporation fig 4 a overall our comparison suggests that the mean of the models performed better than most of the individual models and considerably better than the worst performing model fig 4 although it is important to note that the mean of the ensemble showed slightly higher evaporation rates relative to the reference evaporation particularly when evaporation rates were low fig 4a moreover a comparison of reference and simulated evaporation rates at seasonal timescales suggested that some models e g flake and mylake generally underestimated the reference evaporation rates during all seasons except winter while the opposite was true for other models e g gotm glm and simstrat which overestimated evaporation rates in all seasons table 4 we also calculated the percent error in simulated seasonal evaporation rates which demonstrated considerable variability in the performance of lake models across seasons for instance the models with the lowest percent error across seasons were mylake 17 to 21 and flake 24 to 43 gotm exhibited errors between 5 and 45 followed by simstrat 20 and 99 and glm 38 and 111 table 4 overall our results suggest that for this particular lake and during the time period of interest one could argue that mylake and flake performed best when simulating the reference evaporation however this could be due to the positive and negative seasonal biases of these lake models being compensated for and thus resulting in an overall lower bias than gotm glm and simstrat most impressive was the performance of the model ensemble and particularly the mean in capturing the seasonality in reference evaporation rates importantly our analysis suggests that some lake models perform better than others during some parts of the year and that including information from the ensemble is desirable finally a comparison revealed that the reference evaporation closely captured the intra annual variability of mekorot evaporation estimates which is reflected by the high correlation and low error estimated r 0 91 rmsec 0 10 mbe 0 02 see fig 2a and fig s2 suggesting that our reference evaporation is robust and can be used as a basis for validation of our simulations 3 2 multi model projections of lake evaporation during the 20th and 21st century following the validation of our model ensemble from 2000 to 2005 we investigated long term historic and future changes in evaporation rates over the period 1900 2099 specifically we investigated differences across the lake climate model ensemble in order to evaluate any discrepancies in projected future change fig 5 the future projections showed noticeable differences in lake evaporation anomalies i e the difference between lake evaporation in a given time period relative to the base period 1971 2000 average across the model ensemble by the end of this century 2070 2099 our results indicate that for the high emissions scenario rcp 8 5 mylake and flake projected the smallest increase in evaporation rates of 320 mm year 1 and 329 mm year 1 respectively whereas gotm 452 mm year 1 glm 438 mm year 1 and simstrat 388 mm year 1 projected the highest change in evaporation rates table 5 similar results were found during the historical period where the highest evaporation rates were estimated by glm gotm and simstrat furthermore our analysis suggests that the magnitude of projected change in evaporation rates differ considerably depending on the gcm used to drive the lake models particularly the average end of century evaporation anomalies across the gcms i e averaged across all lake models varied between 109 mm year 1 gfdl esm2m and 227 mm year 1 hadgem2 es under rcp 2 6 between 220 mm year 1 gfdl esm2m and 323 mm year 1 hadgem2 es under rcp 6 0 and between 334 mm year 1 gfdl esm2m and 441 mm year 1 hadgem2 es under rcp 8 5 thus the lake simulations using gfdl esm2m as input data projected considerably lower evaporation rates this century and those using hadgem2 es projected the greatest change on average given the differences in simulated evaporation rates among the lake climate model ensemble it seems relevant to combine the individual ensemble members and to calculate the average and standard deviation among them the model ensemble indicated an average annual evaporation of 1784 473 mm year 1 quoted uncertainties represent the standard deviation from the model ensemble during the latter stages of the 20th century 1971 2000 average during the 21st century 2006 to 2099 the average of the model ensemble demonstrates that evaporation rates are projected to increase considerably in lake kinneret fig 6 under rcp 2 6 lake evaporation is projected to increase by 160 70 mm year 1 by the end of the 21st century 2070 to 2099 for rcp 6 0 lake evaporation is projected to increase by 258 76 mm year 1 the largest change in lake evaporation is projected under rcp 8 5 with evaporation rates increasing by 385 93 mm year 1 these projected changes correspond to a percent increase of 9 14 and 22 for rcp 2 6 6 0 and 8 5 respectively compared to the base period average table 6 the magnitude of change in lake evaporation will not be the same throughout the year but will change differently across seasons fig 7 moreover similar to our projections of annual evaporation rates the projected changes in evaporation across seasons will vary across the lake climate model ensemble our future projections of seasonal evaporation show an overall increase compared to the historic period for all seasons and rcp scenarios fig 7 table 7 in the historic period 1971 2000 evaporation estimates were between 314 77 mm season 1 in the winter and 621 197 mm season 1 in the summer we calculated the projected changes in seasonal evaporation by the end of the 21st century 2070 2099 and found that the greatest change occurred in spring corresponding to an increase of 12 for rcp 2 6 20 for rcp 6 0 and 30 for rcp 8 5 these changes were followed by an increase in evaporation during autumn corresponding to an increase of 9 for rcp 2 6 14 for rcp 6 0 and 20 for rcp 8 5 table 7 the lowest changes across rcp scenarios were detected in the winter with increases of 8 10 and 19 under rcps 2 6 6 0 and 8 5 respectively 3 3 concurrent changes in precipitation and evaporation to evaluate the potential impact of the simulated changes in lake evaporation on water level in lake kinneret we analysed the combined impacts of climate change on precipitation and evaporation at annual timescales changes in precipitation for our study site were highly variable with an overall decreasing trend from 2005 until the end of the 21st century for all rcps fig 8 a the average precipitation over the historic period was 454 100 mm year 1 but decreased by 28 109 mm year 1 6 98 117 mm year 1 22 and 145 102 mm year 1 32 by the end of the century under rcp 2 6 6 0 and 8 5 respectively table 8 by calculating the difference between precipitation and evaporation p e our analysis showed that the change in multi model average evaporation was projected to be greater than the change in multi model average precipitation these results suggest that changes in lake evaporation will likely be greater than those in precipitation under all rcps this century notably all rcps suggested a decrease in p e until the end of the century fig 8b this change reflected the rapid increase in projected evaporation rates and the concurrent substantial decrease in projected precipitation this century within the study region relative to the 1971 2000 base period average 1330 488 mm year 1 p e continuously decreased throughout the 21st century notably under rcps 2 6 6 0 and 8 5 p e will decrease by 188 129 mm year 1 356 148 mm year 1 and 530 145 mm year 1 respectively by the end of the 21st century 2070 2099 fig 8b these changes represent a percent change in p e of 14 27 and 40 under rcp 2 6 6 0 and 8 5 respectively table 8 the local population within the study region which was estimated to be around 10 million people during the 1971 2000 base period is projected to increase during the twenty first century fig 8b projections for the shared socioeconomic pathways ssp 1 and ssp 5 i e comparable to rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 respectively showed a pronounced future increase compared to the historical period in the case of ssp 1 rcp 2 6 there was a steep increase projected for the local population until the mid 21st century i e 2050 s and afterwards a more steady increase towards 2099 with an average population of 33 million under ssp 5 rcp 8 5 the future projections demonstrate a very steep increase of population starting from 2005 with an average population of 42 million people by the end of this century when comparing these increases to the historical period we estimated a striking increase in population of 248 for the rcp 2 6 scenario and 337 for the rcp 8 5 table 8 4 discussion projecting future changes in lake evaporation is critical for ecosystem and water resource management particularly in areas where these resources are already under immense pressure givati et al 2019 prange et al 2020 in this study we provide an assessment of projected changes in evaporation rates in lake kinneret a socioeconomically important lake in the middle east using a model ensemble of 20 lake climate model combinations 5 lake models and 4 gcms we found that the ensemble mean of the models tested was superior to most of the individual lake climate model realizations in describing the reference evaporation rates in lake kinneret during the historical period this is in agreement with our expectations and in line with experiences on the use of ensemble modelling within the climate science community trolle et al 2014 moore et al 2021 which have often shown that an ensemble approach provides more robust projections of complex systems compared to any single model by applying 20 lake climate model combinations to simulate one lake we were able to understand key differences in model performance and likewise to demonstrate the usefulness of an ensemble approach for projecting lake responses to climate change the lake climate models generally agreed on the seasonal variability in evaporation rates and match those shown in the reference evaporation calculated using observational data with the ensemble mean often showing the best performance regarding our future projections our analysis also demonstrated that it is critical to consider an ensemble of both lake and climate model simulations when projecting future change in lakes given the spread of the projected changes although we believe that this study bridges an important knowledge gap there are some limitations that should be considered when interpreting our findings firstly our projections are generated with 1 d process based lake models and thus horizontal features in lakes and the intra lake responses to climate change will not be captured laval et al 2003 in practice the 1 d lake models used in this study assume that evaporation rates are uniform over the entire lake surface given that input data to the models was available for one location representative of the lake however field observations in different regions have shown that the spatial distribution of lake evaporation is highly variable mahrer and assouline 1993 lenters et al 2013 similarly one might expect within lake differences in the magnitude of change in lake evaporation rates under climate change as has already been demonstrated for lake surface temperature mason et al 2016 woolway and merchant 2018 the intra lake variability in evaporation rates could be simulated with 3 d lake models but these complex models are data intensive and computationally expensive amadori et al 2021 and therefore are not often used for ensemble lake modelling particularly for investigating future change zamani et al 2021 furthermore our comparison of the simulations with reference evaporation from lake kinneret demonstrated some differences in the ability of the lake models to capture some of the variability in evaporation rates this was particularly evident in winter when seasonal evaporation rates in this lake are at their lowest however evaporation rates at this time of year are unlikely to have a considerable influence on annual evaporation rates in this lake which are the primary focus of our study some of the differences between the simulations and reference evaporation are likely due to the meteorological data used to drive the lake models specifically the gcms used in this study provide historical and future projections of atmospheric conditions at a relatively coarse 0 5 spatial resolution the gridded climate data are thus unlikely to capture all of the short scale spatial variations occurring at the lake surface particularly given the complex topography in the study region in addition to these limitations our model simulations do not consider two way interactions between the lake and the overlying atmosphere furthermore when evaporation rates are relatively low e g in winter the percent difference between simulated and reference evaporation will be relatively large while we acknowledge the limitations of using gcms in such regions these data are undoubtedly the most appropriate to predict future changes in the climate busuioc et al 2001 and in turn the studied lake in an attempt to address the spatial mismatch between observed and simulated meteorological data from the study region we used bias corrected gcm output data from isimip2b as input to the lake models frieler et al 2017 lange 2019 this bias adjustment essentially alters the statistics of climate simulation data for the purpose of making them more similar to observations to our knowledge few studies have used gcm data to project future impacts of climate change on lake kinneret rimmer et al 2011 with others using weather generators to forecast changes in the near future gal et al 2020 finally the results presented in this study do not consider ongoing climate change adaptations carried by the israeli government despite the limitations described above we believe that our study provides important insights about the future changes in evaporation rates in lake kinneret and is a valuable pilot study for larger scale across lake assessments the strength of this study is the use of a large ensemble of lake model projections which has allowed us to identify likely scenarios of future change in lake evaporation within a socioeconomically critical lake the large ensemble was invaluable in allowing us to not only project future change in evaporation but also to consider a suite of simulations and in turn include uncertainty bounds within our projections it is our hope that in underscoring the value of including ensemble modelling in lake research our work motivates continued efforts to employ an ensemble of lake models for better understanding lake responses to climate change we see good prospects for continued coordination between lake model development as well as their inclusion in large climate simulations particularly given the recent expansion of computing resources facilitates including increasing spatial resolution and correspondingly improved process representation non thermodynamic processes in lakes improved large scale hydrological processes etc we believe that upscaling the multi model approach introduced in this study to multiple lakes distributed across climatic gradients and in lakes of varying sizes and physiographic characteristics could provide important insights into lake evaporation variability and responses to climate change the access of water resources for human consumption and ecosystem services highly depends on the spatio temporal distribution of not only evaporation but also precipitation two key components of the water budget of lakes konapala et al 2020 in this study we estimated the impact of changes in both of these metrics and consequently on p e in lake kinneret we found that in all future climate change scenarios projected changes in lake evaporation were greater than the projected changes in precipitation with p e being predominantly negative and increasingly so throughout the 21st century specifically by the end of this century our projections suggest that p e in lake kinneret will decrease by between 14 and 40 under rcp 2 6 and 8 5 respectively these projected changes largely align with those described by givati et al 2019 who projected a future decrease in precipitation in this region resulting in a 44 decrease in the flow of water from the jordan river i e the main inflow to lake kinneret by 2050 2079 under rcp 8 5 however similar dramatic changes in the water budget of lake kinneret have already been reported with observational data demonstrating that precipitation in the kinneret river basin has reduced considerably since 1985 givati et al 2019 similarly streamflow observations from the jordan river indicate that flow rates have decreased by more than 50 since 2004 provoking historically low levels in lake kinneret in 2018 tal 2019 if the p e balance of lake kinneret changes in line with our future projections water availability in the region will likely be severely stressed this century notably in the absence of substantial water inflow changes e g less water extraction for irrigation a decrease in p e will likely reduce the total lake volume zhou et al 2021 our analysis has also demonstrated that a decline in p e this century will likely occur in parallel with a rapid growth in population most notably the population in the studied region is projected to increase between 248 and 337 by the end of this century under rcp 2 6 and 8 5 respectively this suggests that a growing population will likely become increasingly dependent on water from lake kinneret notably the intensification of water scarcity driven by an increasing deficit in p e combined with a rapid growth in population is likely to further enhance the depletion of lake kinneret and further enhance the already existing water stress in the region however it is also important to note that an increase in water stress within the region might reduce the local population due to possible migration in the future which is not considered in our assessment as well as the serious socioeconomic implications of declining water level influenced by an increasing deficit in p e this could lead to critical ecosystem disturbances such as an increase in salinity with implications for not only physical lake processes ladwig et al 2021 but also the community composition biomass and diversity of phytoplankton zooplankton macrophytes and fish jeppesen et al 2015 as well as a weakening of key species the proliferation of invasive species and a loss of biodiversity zohary and

2719,accurate drought prediction is essential for drought resilience and water resources management the skill of seasonal drought prediction from dynamical and statistical models has limitations this study combines dynamical models and deep learning to construct hybrid dynamical statistical models we use the random forest to extract typical grids based on the geopotential height sea level pressure and 2 m temperature the long short term memory lstm is used to construct the statistical models with atmospheric variables as predictors and the 3 month standardized precipitation index spi3 as the predictand the hindcasts of atmospheric variables from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf seas5 model are processed as predictors to force the statistical models the hybrid model constructed using the dynamical models and the lstm is named dynamic lstm d lstm the results suggest that the lstm models are of information extraction capability and robustness when the lead time exceeds one month the prediction skills are significantly improved by the d lstm models especially in the east northwest southwest and tibet in most regions the d lstm models are more skillful across all seasons for lead times exceeding 30 days and are reliable in predicting droughts in spring and summer when the ecmwf seas5 loses skills at the seasonal scale furthermore the d lstm models are more accurate in drought onset prediction keywords seasonal drought prediction hybrid models lstm data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction droughts are natural disasters that occur under all climate regimes liu et al 2016 global chronically drought prone areas have increased significantly from 16 19 between 1902 and 1949 to 41 09 between 1950 and 2008 wang et al 2014 according to the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations developing countries suffered 29 billion in agriculture owing to drought disasters between 2005 and 2015 conforti et al 2018 therefore accurate drought prediction is vital for improving drought resilience managing water resources and reducing drought losses with a better understanding of the climate system and improved computational capabilities predicting droughts using general circulation models gcms has become a fundamental approach hao et al 2018 seasonal drought indices such as the standardized precipitation index spi and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei can be calculated from gcm precipitation and temperature outputs lang et al 2020 ma et al 2015 ujeneza and abiodun 2015 the advantage of gcms is that they are based on physical principles and can capture the nonlinear changes in the ocean atmosphere and on land bader et al 2008 significant advances have been made in drought prediction in recent years with the widespread use of post processing and multi model ensembles li et al 2020 mo and lyon 2015 nevertheless gcms are limited by chaotic properties initial value errors and model biases which lead to uncertainties in the forecasted precipitation with a lead time of more than two weeks li et al 2017 merryfield et al 2020 statistical methods less computationally demanding usually first identify a range of predictors from historical hydroclimatic observations reanalysis which are then input into statistical models to predict drought however unclear physical mechanisms and unstable statistical relationships are always the problems of statistical methods hao et al 2018 to combine the advantages of dynamical and statistical models many researchers have attempted to construct hybrid dynamical statistical models li et al 2018a madhukumar et al 2021 hybrid models mainly involve two steps first calibration to correct the bias and ensemble spread of gcms forecasts and second merging forecasts from multiple sources madadgar et al 2016 ribeiro and pires 2016 yan et al 2017 previous efforts have focused on combining forecasts from multiple dynamical and statistical models achieving excellent results hao et al 2016 madadgar et al 2016 wang et al 2012 nevertheless some variables such as geopotential height gh and temperature yield higher skill scores with long lead times and are often used to analyze atmospheric circulation anomalies during droughts but can be used for prediction kuswanto et al 2019 liu et al 2018 for seasonal drought large scale circulation is an important mechanism and the role of atmospheric anomalies varies between droughts lhotka et al 2020 li et al 2018b okumura et al 2017 zhuang et al 2020 thus some studies have aimed to extract information from atmospheric circulation patterns to predict drought events for example costa cabral et al 2016 were able to project meteorological drought in california using the north pacific high nph sea level pressure anomaly in northeastern europe more than 65 of drought events were detected one month in advance by lavaysse et al 2018 and richardson et al 2020 explored the potential benefits of using weather pattern predictions to improve sub seasonal forecasts of meteorological drought in these studies selecting an appropriate method to obtain key information from atmospheric variables was critical with the explosive growth of observation and reanalysis data and the considerable increases in computing capabilities climate prediction with deep learning dl has become an active area of research reichstein et al 2019 the most significant advantage of dl is to mine information from big data for future prediction in the past few years dl has helped improve climate predictions significantly and assisted in interpreting the underlying mechanisms pan et al 2020 yoo geun et al 2019 two state of the art widely adopted architectures are convolutional neural network cnn for image tasks and recurrent neural network rnn for sequence learning tasks such as time series modeling shen 2018 a cnn and transfer learning are used to predict the east asian summer monsoon easm in tang and duan 2021 and the anomaly correlation is higher than that of each of the current state of the art dynamic models furthermore andersson et al 2021 adopted the u net a cnn variant that takes images as input and produces images as output to realize the seasonal arctic sea ice probabilistic forecasting as an improved model of ordinary rnns for time series prediction long short term memory lstm has been applied in drought prediction widely poornima and pushpalatha 2019 xu et al 2022 zhang et al the previous studies based on lstm are mainly through two methods one is to use the drought indices e g spi spei etc or combine them with related hydro meteorological variables such as temperature humidity and wind speed as predictors to derive the drought indices for the next moment or period poornima and pushpalatha 2019 wu et al 2021 xu et al 2022 xu et al 2018b the second is to find the teleconnection between antecedent climatic drivers such as the southern oscillation index soi pacific decadal oscillation index pdo indian ocean dipole iod and drought indices for prediction at a future time dikshit and pradhan 2021 dikshit et al 2021a although the above studies have predicted drought indices at various time scales e g spei1 spei3 spei12 etc the lead time of many studies is 1 month or 2 months for example the parameters from the past 19 months also including the 20th month parameters were used to predict the 21st month s spei in dikshit et al 2021b the lead time in xu et al 2022 is 1 month and 1 to 2 month danandeh mehr et al 2022 forecasted the spei3 and spei6 over the lead time of one month it may be related to the lstm model construction specifically the sequence length in lstm determines the length of previously stored information correspondingly in drought prediction which is how long the past information is used to predict the current drought as for lstm single step prediction is easier and more accurate than multi step prediction fortunately xu et al 2018b and dikshit et al 2021a used recursive and sequence to series seq2seq methods to make drought predictions ranging from 1 month to 5 months and 1 month to 12 months lead times respectively china has long been affected by drought due to its geographical location and climatic regime ayantobo et al 2017 and in recent years extreme droughts have become increasingly frequent and severe chen et al 2018 jin et al 2013 ma et al 2020 while progress has been made in drought prediction in china using various models xu et al 2018a xu et al 2018b zhang et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 there have been few attempts to employ dl to predict seasonal drought in all regions of china for the reason that drought mechanisms vary between different regions and across spatial temporal scales in addition few studies have input the contemporaneous atmospheric variables from the dynamical models to force the lstm to make the daily prediction for the next three months this method differs from xu et al 2018b and dikshit et al 2021a and matches the daily timestep used for the operational drought monitoring in this study we combine dynamical models and dl to construct hybrid models we use the random forest rf to extract typical grids from atmospheric circulation variables lstm is used as the statistical model to find the relationships between atmospheric variables and meteorological drought the atmospheric variables forecasted by the dynamical models are then processed to force the drought prediction models the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 introduces the data and methodology section 3 presents the prediction results we will discuss the study limitations and future work in section 4 the conclusions are presented in section 5 2 data and methodology 2 1 data 2 1 1 observations observed daily precipitation amounts from the climate data centre cdc of the national

3 5 cmcc35 table 1 during the same period over china from the cds https cds climate copernicus eu cdsapp dataset seasonal original single levels 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 daily updated 3 month standardized precipitation index spi3 since rainfall varies significantly in different regions the concept of drought varies in order to assess drought better the world meteorological organization wmo recommends using the spi to monitor the drought spi is a standardized index that reflects the probability of given observed precipitation relative to the long term climatic conditions of the area negative and positive spi values represent precipitation deficit and surplus respectively spi can be applied to different time scales e g 3 6 and 12 months to analyze the impact of drought on various water resource demands we select spi3 as the seasonal drought index in this study calculated for the 9 regions using area averaged precipitation traditionally the spi3 varies on a monthly scale reflecting cumulative precipitation over the past three months however a monthly timescale does not sufficiently reflect the evolution of drought onset persistence and relief presenting limitations for meeting the requirements for real time monitoring and prediction for effective management therefore we follow the wmo recommendation to adjust the sliding time window of the spi3 to 90 days svoboda et al 2012 thus we obtain information on the daily variation of meteorological droughts while the mathematical treatment remained unchanged full calculation details are given by liu et al 2018 2 2 2 predictors construction hart and grumm 2001 first used standardized anomalies to delineate weather scale events and this approach has been carried out in weather analysis and forecasting duan et al 2014 liu et al 2017 evidence from these studies has demonstrated the superiority of anomaly in many aspects qian et al 2021 here we calculate 90 day standardized anomalies sa90 using the following equation 1 s a 90 x 90 μ 90 σ 90 where x 90 represents the original variable and μ 90 and σ 90 are the climatological mean and standard deviation respectively explicitly speaking x 90 is the 90 day running mean whose value is located on the last day of the running window the two climatological variables μ 90 σ 90 are further computed based on the 90 day running mean the climatic background period in this study is the 30 years before each hindcast year so the background is sliding for example x 90 for 1 april 2000 represented the 90 day average for the period from 3 january 2000 to 1 april 2000 and μ 90 and σ 90 are the 90 day averages and standard deviation for the period from 3 january 1970 to 1 april 1999 so we obtain the sa90 for all considered atmospheric variables i e sa90gh200 sa90gh500 sa90gh850 sa90t2m and sa90slp 2 2 3 drought prediction model we construct one lstm model for each region using 22 year data for training 8 year data for validation and 1 year data for test there are a total of 9 24 models for 9 regions in 24 hindcast years 1993 2016 each model adopts the daily 5 layer gh200 gh500 gh850 t2m slp sa90 dataset as the predictors and the spi3 of the day as the predictand the grids over the tibetan plateau on gh850 and slp are masked before constructing the model over and near large orography slp and gh850 readings are unphysical the readings underneath the orography are the results of extrapolation from dynamical models and hence are artificial the model structure is shown in fig 2 first we flatten the five layer sa90 into a column of 3215 data points the input neurons extract typical data through the rf and then produce the output spi3 data by forcing the lstm the details of the rf and lstm training validation and test stages are in supplements 3 5 the models constructed above incorporate the contemporaneous statistical relationships between the predictors and the spi3 but cannot predict the future during the training validation and test periods the models are forced with era5 data for prediction we first calculate sa90 using era5 data for the past 90 1 n days and the current day ecmwf seas5 outputs for the prospective n days and then force the lstm models to predict the nth day spi3 as shown in fig 3 therefore the drought prediction models we construct are hybrid dynamical statistical models which we name dynamic lstm d lstm 2 2 4 gcm hindcast precipitation the spi3 calculated from the seas5 cfsv2 and cmcc35 hindcast precipitation datasets are compared with the hybrid models for prediction we use observed precipitation for the past 90 1 n days and the current day gcm outputs for the prospective n days and then calculate the nth day spi3 2 2 5 skill scores root mean square error rmse is adopted as the loss function to describe the error between the model output and the observed data and for the inverse calculation of the lstm models as follows 2 r m s e i 1 n y i x i 2 n where x i represents the observed value y i represents the predictand and n represents the sample size the correlation coefficient r is used as the performance evaluation function for the lstm to measure the correlation between the model output and the expected values 3 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where x i is the observed value y i is the predictand x 1 n i 1 n x i the sample mean and analogously for y and n represents the sample size 3 results 3 1 simulated spi3 in training validation and test periods as introduced previously in sect 2 2 3 we construct models based on 22 year training data 8 year validation data and 1 year test data as shown by the two skill scores in table 2 the mean values of the r are all over 0 86 and the averages of the rmse are all below 0 57 in the training set which indicates that the lstm can extract information from atmospheric variables and capture the nonlinear atmospheric processes in addition the two skill scores are slightly worse in the validation and test set which means the robustness of the models however the lstm models perform much better in the north and east than in the xinjiang and tibet which may reflect the different drought mechanisms in these regions 3 2 seasonal drought prediction between 1993 and 2016 ecmwf seas5 hindcasts data for the first day of each month as do the d lstm models when we predict the spi3 in each year the lstm model tested in the year is used finally we generated 4 sets of seasonal drought prediction products spi3 based on the cmcc35 cfsv2 seas5 and d lstm fig 4 and fig 5 show the correlation and rmse results of the spi3 between 1993 and 2016 the strength of the skill scores of all 4 models decreases as the lead time increases at one month or less the prediction skills of the seas5 outputs are stronger than that of the d lstm models indicating that dynamic models are more accurate in simulating precipitation with short lead times which is consistent with other analyses lang et al 2014 li et al 2017 however when the lead time exceeds 30 days the d lstm models outperform the dynamic models in most regions the rmse has apparent differences between the four models for the two skill scores in all regions maybe the reasons are that we choose rmse as the loss function to train the lstm models and the four models have varying skills for the regions while in the north south and inner mongolia the prediction skills of the d lstm models are almost the same as the dynamical models we also find that the skill scores are different between the regions for example the outputs from both the dynamical and the d lstm models in the tibet and xinjiang are worse than the others contrary to this the dynamical and the d lstm models both perform well in the east and south 3 3 prediction skills across all seasons according to fig 4 and fig 5 the seas5 models are the best for seasonal drought prediction among the three dynamical models so we compare the prediction skills of the seas5 and the d lstm for all target seasons and the results are shown in fig 6 and fig 7 both models underperform in the first half of the year compared with the second half the d lstm models perform much better for summer than the seas5 in the northeast southwest and tibet but does not perform well for the winter nevertheless the d lstm models are more skillful across all seasons in other regions for lead times exceeding 30 days in addition the d lstm models are still reliable in spring and summer when the seas5 often loses skills 3 4 drought onset prediction for seasonal drought prediction the capability of the models to determine whether drought will occur in the future is essential here given a spi3 time series the drought condition is defined as the spi3 below a specified threshold 0 8 in this study according to ma et al 2015 and svoboda et al 2002 if the daily observed spi3 and predicted spi3 on the same day are both below 0 8 the drought prediction is correct so we calculate the accuracy of drought prediction as follows 4 a c c u r a c y n n where n represents the total number of the observed drought days spi3 0 8 at a specific lead time 1st 2nd or the 90th day and n represents the total number of the days correctly predicted from fig 8 it is clear that the d lstm models outperform the seas5 in predicting droughts when the lead time is over 30 days especially after 60 days which means the d lstm allows for better prediction of drought onset at the seasonal scale compared to seas5 the decrease in accuracy of the d lstm models is smaller when the lead time is extended from 31 60 days to 61 90 days these results are consistent with the low rmse of the d lstm models as shown in fig 5 to find out why the d lstm models are more accurate in predicting drought onset especially in the east northwest and southwest we plot the time series of the predicted spi values on the 30th 60th and 90th lead days respectively shown in fig 9 the outputs from the d lstm always match the observed time series as the lead time increases however the seas5 tends to predict more precipitation when the lead time is over 30 days contributing to positive values of spi3 as a result it is hard for the seas5 to determine the occurrence of droughts at the seasonal scale 4 discussion 4 1 impact of forecast error from the ecmwf seas5 dataset 4 1 1 anomaly correlation coefficients acc of forecasted atmospheric variables we use the hindcast atmospheric circulation dataset from the seas5 as predictors to force the d lstm therefore the models contain two kinds of error first from the lstm and second from the gcm this section focuses on the impact of the second error source fig 10 shows that the acc of all variables decreases with increasing lead time which indicates that the error from the seas5 dataset introduces lots of uncertainties to the prediction 4 1 2 perfect drought prediction we replace all atmospheric data for the prospective 90 days with reanalysis data to re force the d lstm models which we name perfect d lstm fig 11 and fig 12 the correlation and rmse of the perfect d lstm are all improved in all regions actually the performances of the perfect models indicate the upper limit of prediction abilities of the lstm for the reason that the inputs are reanalysis data therefore the red curves are consistent with the simulation skills of the lstm in table 2 post processing gcm precipitation outputs have also been included in the dynamical statistical prediction methods schepen et al 2016 so it is necessary to correct the forecasted atmospheric variables accordingly 4 2 comparison between the lstm model and other machine learning models as we know the artificial neural network ann is one of the classic machine learning models many researchers have used this model to improve precipitation and drought prediction belayneh et al 2014 da paz et al 2011 sigaroodi et al 2014 can the same results be obtained by replacing lstm with ann according to the same processing steps for our study furthermore since the lstm model is an ann we take linear models and tree based models into consideration we choose least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso and random forest regressor in this study following section 2 2 3 we name the models d ann d lasso and d rf respectively from fig 13 the d lstm models have better or the equivalent performance than the other models in most regions except the northwest and xinjiang the rmse shown in fig 14 indicates that the d lstm models are more skillful it is obvious that d lstm models make slight improvements in predicting spi3 compared to the other models actually in machine learning a little increase in accuracy is often an essential improvement for machine learning models another point of view is that data and features determine the upper limit of machine learning performances and various models algorithms are used to approach this upper limit zheng et al 2021 5 conclusions effective drought prediction is essential for drought resilience and water resources management nevertheless the dynamic and traditional statistical models have limitations in seasonal drought prediction this study combines the ecmwf seas5 and the lstm to construct drought prediction models over china at the seasonal scale the capability and robustness of the lstm models to extract information between atmospheric variables and meteorological drought is evaluated and the extent to which the prediction skills could be improved and the effectiveness of predicting drought onset are investigated the results suggest that the accuracy of the simulated spi3 by the lstm models in training validation and test set using era5 reanalysis data is high both the correlation and rmse are significantly improved by the d lstm when the lead time exceeds 30 days over china in most regions the d lstm models are more skillful across all seasons and perform well in spring and summer when the seas5 often loses predictability in addition the d lstm models have better skills in predicting the drought onset at the seasonal scale in the future the post processing of the forecasted atmospheric variables will be considered we should note that the drought prediction models constructed in this study cannot predict the spatial distribution of the spi3 because the precipitation data are processed as the regional average to reflect more details of the drought other deep learning models such as the conv lstm or u net model are prospected to solve this problem last but not least we investigate the capability of the d lstm models in predicting the drought onset by transforming the numerical spi3 trajectories into a categorical series using 0 8 as a threshold in section 3 4 we did

2719,accurate drought prediction is essential for drought resilience and water resources management the skill of seasonal drought prediction from dynamical and statistical models has limitations this study combines dynamical models and deep learning to construct hybrid dynamical statistical models we use the random forest to extract typical grids based on the geopotential height sea level pressure and 2 m temperature the long short term memory lstm is used to construct the statistical models with atmospheric variables as predictors and the 3 month standardized precipitation index spi3 as the predictand the hindcasts of atmospheric variables from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf seas5 model are processed as predictors to force the statistical models the hybrid model constructed using the dynamical models and the lstm is named dynamic lstm d lstm the results suggest that the lstm models are of information extraction capability and robustness when the lead time exceeds one month the prediction skills are significantly improved by the d lstm models especially in the east northwest southwest and tibet in most regions the d lstm models are more skillful across all seasons for lead times exceeding 30 days and are reliable in predicting droughts in spring and summer when the ecmwf seas5 loses skills at the seasonal scale furthermore the d lstm models are more accurate in drought onset prediction keywords seasonal drought prediction hybrid models lstm data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction droughts are natural disasters that occur under all climate regimes liu et al 2016 global chronically drought prone areas have increased significantly from 16 19 between 1902 and 1949 to 41 09 between 1950 and 2008 wang et al 2014 according to the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations developing countries suffered 29 billion in agriculture owing to drought disasters between 2005 and 2015 conforti et al 2018 therefore accurate drought prediction is vital for improving drought resilience managing water resources and reducing drought losses with a better understanding of the climate system and improved computational capabilities predicting droughts using general circulation models gcms has become a fundamental approach hao et al 2018 seasonal drought indices such as the standardized precipitation index spi and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei can be calculated from gcm precipitation and temperature outputs lang et al 2020 ma et al 2015 ujeneza and abiodun 2015 the advantage of gcms is that they are based on physical principles and can capture the nonlinear changes in the ocean atmosphere and on land bader et al 2008 significant advances have been made in drought prediction in recent years with the widespread use of post processing and multi model ensembles li et al 2020 mo and lyon 2015 nevertheless gcms are limited by chaotic properties initial value errors and model biases which lead to uncertainties in the forecasted precipitation with a lead time of more than two weeks li et al 2017 merryfield et al 2020 statistical methods less computationally demanding usually first identify a range of predictors from historical hydroclimatic observations reanalysis which are then input into statistical models to predict drought however unclear physical mechanisms and unstable statistical relationships are always the problems of statistical methods hao et al 2018 to combine the advantages of dynamical and statistical models many researchers have attempted to construct hybrid dynamical statistical models li et al 2018a madhukumar et al 2021 hybrid models mainly involve two steps first calibration to correct the bias and ensemble spread of gcms forecasts and second merging forecasts from multiple sources madadgar et al 2016 ribeiro and pires 2016 yan et al 2017 previous efforts have focused on combining forecasts from multiple dynamical and statistical models achieving excellent results hao et al 2016 madadgar et al 2016 wang et al 2012 nevertheless some variables such as geopotential height gh and temperature yield higher skill scores with long lead times and are often used to analyze atmospheric circulation anomalies during droughts but can be used for prediction kuswanto et al 2019 liu et al 2018 for seasonal drought large scale circulation is an important mechanism and the role of atmospheric anomalies varies between droughts lhotka et al 2020 li et al 2018b okumura et al 2017 zhuang et al 2020 thus some studies have aimed to extract information from atmospheric circulation patterns to predict drought events for example costa cabral et al 2016 were able to project meteorological drought in california using the north pacific high nph sea level pressure anomaly in northeastern europe more than 65 of drought events were detected one month in advance by lavaysse et al 2018 and richardson et al 2020 explored the potential benefits of using weather pattern predictions to improve sub seasonal forecasts of meteorological drought in these studies selecting an appropriate method to obtain key information from atmospheric variables was critical with the explosive growth of observation and reanalysis data and the considerable increases in computing capabilities climate prediction with deep learning dl has become an active area of research reichstein et al 2019 the most significant advantage of dl is to mine information from big data for future prediction in the past few years dl has helped improve climate predictions significantly and assisted in interpreting the underlying mechanisms pan et al 2020 yoo geun et al 2019 two state of the art widely adopted architectures are convolutional neural network cnn for image tasks and recurrent neural network rnn for sequence learning tasks such as time series modeling shen 2018 a cnn and transfer learning are used to predict the east asian summer monsoon easm in tang and duan 2021 and the anomaly correlation is higher than that of each of the current state of the art dynamic models furthermore andersson et al 2021 adopted the u net a cnn variant that takes images as input and produces images as output to realize the seasonal arctic sea ice probabilistic forecasting as an improved model of ordinary rnns for time series prediction long short term memory lstm has been applied in drought prediction widely poornima and pushpalatha 2019 xu et al 2022 zhang et al the previous studies based on lstm are mainly through two methods one is to use the drought indices e g spi spei etc or combine them with related hydro meteorological variables such as temperature humidity and wind speed as predictors to derive the drought indices for the next moment or period poornima and pushpalatha 2019 wu et al 2021 xu et al 2022 xu et al 2018b the second is to find the teleconnection between antecedent climatic drivers such as the southern oscillation index soi pacific decadal oscillation index pdo indian ocean dipole iod and drought indices for prediction at a future time dikshit and pradhan 2021 dikshit et al 2021a although the above studies have predicted drought indices at various time scales e g spei1 spei3 spei12 etc the lead time of many studies is 1 month or 2 months for example the parameters from the past 19 months also including the 20th month parameters were used to predict the 21st month s spei in dikshit et al 2021b the lead time in xu et al 2022 is 1 month and 1 to 2 month danandeh mehr et al 2022 forecasted the spei3 and spei6 over the lead time of one month it may be related to the lstm model construction specifically the sequence length in lstm determines the length of previously stored information correspondingly in drought prediction which is how long the past information is used to predict the current drought as for lstm single step prediction is easier and more accurate than multi step prediction fortunately xu et al 2018b and dikshit et al 2021a used recursive and sequence to series seq2seq methods to make drought predictions ranging from 1 month to 5 months and 1 month to 12 months lead times respectively china has long been affected by drought due to its geographical location and climatic regime ayantobo et al 2017 and in recent years extreme droughts have become increasingly frequent and severe chen et al 2018 jin et al 2013 ma et al 2020 while progress has been made in drought prediction in china using various models xu et al 2018a xu et al 2018b zhang et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 there have been few attempts to employ dl to predict seasonal drought in all regions of china for the reason that drought mechanisms vary between different regions and across spatial temporal scales in addition few studies have input the contemporaneous atmospheric variables from the dynamical models to force the lstm to make the daily prediction for the next three months this method differs from xu et al 2018b and dikshit et al 2021a and matches the daily timestep used for the operational drought monitoring in this study we combine dynamical models and dl to construct hybrid models we use the random forest rf to extract typical grids from atmospheric circulation variables lstm is used as the statistical model to find the relationships between atmospheric variables and meteorological drought the atmospheric variables forecasted by the dynamical models are then processed to force the drought prediction models the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 introduces the data and methodology section 3 presents the prediction results we will discuss the study limitations and future work in section 4 the conclusions are presented in section 5 2 data and methodology 2 1 data 2 1 1 observations observed daily precipitation amounts from the climate data centre cdc of the national meteorological information centre china meteorological administration cma are used to provide 0 5 0 5 gridded data for the period 1962 2016 https data cma cn data detail datacode surf cli chn pre day grid 0 5 html the gridded precipitation data are area averaged to regional precipitation over the 9 drought regions fig 1 more details of the drought regions can be found in wu et al 2011 2 1 2 gcm hindcast data we focus on seasonal drought prediction for the next 90 days corresponding to the seasonal scale discussed throughout this paper for this data for the atmospheric variables in 90 day blocks are downloaded from the ecmwf seas5 hindcast dataset for 1993 2016 https cds climate copernicus eu cdsapp dataset seasonal original single levels including gh200 gh500 gh850 t2m and slp for comparison we select hindcast precipitation from the ecmwf seas5 ncep coupled forecast system model version 2 cfsv2 and euro mediterranean center for climate change seasonal prediction system version 3 5 cmcc35 table 1 during the same period over china from the cds https cds climate copernicus eu cdsapp dataset seasonal original single levels 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 daily updated 3 month standardized precipitation index spi3 since rainfall varies significantly in different regions the concept of drought varies in order to assess drought better the world meteorological organization wmo recommends using the spi to monitor the drought spi is a standardized index that reflects the probability of given observed precipitation relative to the long term climatic conditions of the area negative and positive spi values represent precipitation deficit and surplus respectively spi can be applied to different time scales e g 3 6 and 12 months to analyze the impact of drought on various water resource demands we select spi3 as the seasonal drought index in this study calculated for the 9 regions using area averaged precipitation traditionally the spi3 varies on a monthly scale reflecting cumulative precipitation over the past three months however a monthly timescale does not sufficiently reflect the evolution of drought onset persistence and relief presenting limitations for meeting the requirements for real time monitoring and prediction for effective management therefore we follow the wmo recommendation to adjust the sliding time window of the spi3 to 90 days svoboda et al 2012 thus we obtain information on the daily variation of meteorological droughts while the mathematical treatment remained unchanged full calculation details are given by liu et al 2018 2 2 2 predictors construction hart and grumm 2001 first used standardized anomalies to delineate weather scale events and this approach has been carried out in weather analysis and forecasting duan et al 2014 liu et al 2017 evidence from these studies has demonstrated the superiority of anomaly in many aspects qian et al 2021 here we calculate 90 day standardized anomalies sa90 using the following equation 1 s a 90 x 90 μ 90 σ 90 where x 90 represents the original variable and μ 90 and σ 90 are the climatological mean and standard deviation respectively explicitly speaking x 90 is the 90 day running mean whose value is located on the last day of the running window the two climatological variables μ 90 σ 90 are further computed based on the 90 day running mean the climatic background period in this study is the 30 years before each hindcast year so the background is sliding for example x 90 for 1 april 2000 represented the 90 day average for the period from 3 january 2000 to 1 april 2000 and μ 90 and σ 90 are the 90 day averages and standard deviation for the period from 3 january 1970 to 1 april 1999 so we obtain the sa90 for all considered atmospheric variables i e sa90gh200 sa90gh500 sa90gh850 sa90t2m and sa90slp 2 2 3 drought prediction model we construct one lstm model for each region using 22 year data for training 8 year data for validation and 1 year data for test there are a total of 9 24 models for 9 regions in 24 hindcast years 1993 2016 each model adopts the daily 5 layer gh200 gh500 gh850 t2m slp sa90 dataset as the predictors and the spi3 of the day as the predictand the grids over the tibetan plateau on gh850 and slp are masked before constructing the model over and near large orography slp and gh850 readings are unphysical the readings underneath the orography are the results of extrapolation from dynamical models and hence are artificial the model structure is shown in fig 2 first we flatten the five layer sa90 into a column of 3215 data points the input neurons extract typical data through the rf and then produce the output spi3 data by forcing the lstm the details of the rf and lstm training validation and test stages are in supplements 3 5 the models constructed above incorporate the contemporaneous statistical relationships between the predictors and the spi3 but cannot predict the future during the training validation and test periods the models are forced with era5 data for prediction we first calculate sa90 using era5 data for the past 90 1 n days and the current day ecmwf seas5 outputs for the prospective n days and then force the lstm models to predict the nth day spi3 as shown in fig 3 therefore the drought prediction models we construct are hybrid dynamical statistical models which we name dynamic lstm d lstm 2 2 4 gcm hindcast precipitation the spi3 calculated from the seas5 cfsv2 and cmcc35 hindcast precipitation datasets are compared with the hybrid models for prediction we use observed precipitation for the past 90 1 n days and the current day gcm outputs for the prospective n days and then calculate the nth day spi3 2 2 5 skill scores root mean square error rmse is adopted as the loss function to describe the error between the model output and the observed data and for the inverse calculation of the lstm models as follows 2 r m s e i 1 n y i x i 2 n where x i represents the observed value y i represents the predictand and n represents the sample size the correlation coefficient r is used as the performance evaluation function for the lstm to measure the correlation between the model output and the expected values 3 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where x i is the observed value y i is the predictand x 1 n i 1 n x i the sample mean and analogously for y and n represents the sample size 3 results 3 1 simulated spi3 in training validation and test periods as introduced previously in sect 2 2 3 we construct models based on 22 year training data 8 year validation data and 1 year test data as shown by the two skill scores in table 2 the mean values of the r are all over 0 86 and the averages of the rmse are all below 0 57 in the training set which indicates that the lstm can extract information from atmospheric variables and capture the nonlinear atmospheric processes in addition the two skill scores are slightly worse in the validation and test set which means the robustness of the models however the lstm models perform much better in the north and east than in the xinjiang and tibet which may reflect the different drought mechanisms in these regions 3 2 seasonal drought prediction between 1993 and 2016 ecmwf seas5 hindcasts data for the first day of each month as do the d lstm models when we predict the spi3 in each year the lstm model tested in the year is used finally we generated 4 sets of seasonal drought prediction products spi3 based on the cmcc35 cfsv2 seas5 and d lstm fig 4 and fig 5 show the correlation and rmse results of the spi3 between 1993 and 2016 the strength of the skill scores of all 4 models decreases as the lead time increases at one month or less the prediction skills of the seas5 outputs are stronger than that of the d lstm models indicating that dynamic models are more accurate in simulating precipitation with short lead times which is consistent with other analyses lang et al 2014 li et al 2017 however when the lead time exceeds 30 days the d lstm models outperform the dynamic models in most regions the rmse has apparent differences between the four models for the two skill scores in all regions maybe the reasons are that we choose rmse as the loss function to train the lstm models and the four models have varying skills for the regions while in the north south and inner mongolia the prediction skills of the d lstm models are almost the same as the dynamical models we also find that the skill scores are different between the regions for example the outputs from both the dynamical and the d lstm models in the tibet and xinjiang are worse than the others contrary to this the dynamical and the d lstm models both perform well in the east and south 3 3 prediction skills across all seasons according to fig 4 and fig 5 the seas5 models are the best for seasonal drought prediction among the three dynamical models so we compare the prediction skills of the seas5 and the d lstm for all target seasons and the results are shown in fig 6 and fig 7 both models underperform in the first half of the year compared with the second half the d lstm models perform much better for summer than the seas5 in the northeast southwest and tibet but does not perform well for the winter nevertheless the d lstm models are more skillful across all seasons in other regions for lead times exceeding 30 days in addition the d lstm models are still reliable in spring and summer when the seas5 often loses skills 3 4 drought onset prediction for seasonal drought prediction the capability of the models to determine whether drought will occur in the future is essential here given a spi3 time series the drought condition is defined as the spi3 below a specified threshold 0 8 in this study according to ma et al 2015 and svoboda et al 2002 if the daily observed spi3 and predicted spi3 on the same day are both below 0 8 the drought prediction is correct so we calculate the accuracy of drought prediction as follows 4 a c c u r a c y n n where n represents the total number of the observed drought days spi3 0 8 at a specific lead time 1st 2nd or the 90th day and n represents the total number of the days correctly predicted from fig 8 it is clear that the d lstm models outperform the seas5 in predicting droughts when the lead time is over 30 days especially after 60 days which means the d lstm allows for better prediction of drought onset at the seasonal scale compared to seas5 the decrease in accuracy of the d lstm models is smaller when the lead time is extended from 31 60 days to 61 90 days these results are consistent with the low rmse of the d lstm models as shown in fig 5 to find out why the d lstm models are more accurate in predicting drought onset especially in the east northwest and southwest we plot the time series of the predicted spi values on the 30th 60th and 90th lead days respectively shown in fig 9 the outputs from the d lstm always match the observed time series as the lead time increases however the seas5 tends to predict more precipitation when the lead time is over 30 days contributing to positive values of spi3 as a result it is hard for the seas5 to determine the occurrence of droughts at the seasonal scale 4 discussion 4 1 impact of forecast error from the ecmwf seas5 dataset 4 1 1 anomaly correlation coefficients acc of forecasted atmospheric variables we use the hindcast atmospheric circulation dataset from the seas5 as predictors to force the d lstm therefore the models contain two kinds of error first from the lstm and second from the gcm this section focuses on the impact of the second error source fig 10 shows that the acc of all variables decreases with increasing lead time which indicates that the error from the seas5 dataset introduces lots of uncertainties to the prediction 4 1 2 perfect drought prediction we replace all atmospheric data for the prospective 90 days with reanalysis data to re force the d lstm models which we name perfect d lstm fig 11 and fig 12 the correlation and rmse of the perfect d lstm are all improved in all regions actually the performances of the perfect models indicate the upper limit of prediction abilities of the lstm for the reason that the inputs are reanalysis data therefore the red curves are consistent with the simulation skills of the lstm in table 2 post processing gcm precipitation outputs have also been included in the dynamical statistical prediction methods schepen et al 2016 so it is necessary to correct the forecasted atmospheric variables accordingly 4 2 comparison between the lstm model and other machine learning models as we know the artificial neural network ann is one of the classic machine learning models
