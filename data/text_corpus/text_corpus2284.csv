for all the parameters the difference was compared with fisher s protected least significant difference lsd test at 5 probability level since similar trends were obtained during both the year pooled analysis was done taking year as a main factor to increase the precision of tested treatments 3 results and discussion 3 1 site characteristics the soil of the experimental field was sandy loam typic ustochrept in texture and tested low in organic carbon 0 28 and available nitrogen 163 1 kg ha 1 medium in available phosphorous 17 6 kg ha 1 medium in available sulphur 19 2 kg ha 1 and high in available potassium 334 9 kg ha 1 however ph 7 78 and electrical conductivity 0 34 of the soil were found in the normal range mean field capacity determined by pressure plate apparatus as per richards and weaver 1943 was 24 8 v v in 0 100 cm profile with average bulk density of 1 58 mg m 3 saturated conductivity was calculated by constant head method klute and dirksen 1986 the layer wise physical properties of experimental site are given in table 1 3 2 yield and yield attributes result revealed that capitulum diameter capitulum weight seeds per capitulum 1000 seed weight and seed yield were significantly higher in psh 1962 than psh 996 table 2 psh 1962 resulted in 7 0 20 8 8 4 and 15 5 higher capitulum diameter capitulum weight seed per capitulum and 1000 seed weight than psh 996 respectively increased seed yield to the tune of 12 9 of psh 1962 over psh 996 resulted from genetic make up which is evidence from overall yield attributes methods of irrigation had significant effect on yield attributing characters of sunflower and drip irrigated crop perform significantly better than furrow irrigated table 2 capitulum diameter capitulum weight seeds per capitulum 1000 seed weight and seed yield were 7 1 1 4 2 78 8 12 and 14 7 higher in drip irrigated crop than furrow irrigated crop respectively irrespective of hybrids better performance of drip irrigation attributed to precise irrigation application in radial distribution pattern resulted in effective uptake of nutrients from the soil volume where most of the roots are concentrated near the emitters sinha et al 2017 furthermore under drip irrigation soil moisture remained near to field capacity during most of time as against under furrow irrigation vertical downward movement of water remained to greater extent just after irrigation which carry nutrients along with this is clear from 89 1 mm drainage under furrow irrigation as against complete check on drainage in drip table 3 hitsuda et al 2005 observed that sulphur is more prone to leaching which is necessary element for oil synthesis and utilization of carbohydrates for oil synthesis rani et al 2009 thus reduced availability of sulphur under furrow irrigation than drip irrigation is one of the reasons for lesser seed yield under former than latter sulphur levels also had significant effect on seed yield of sunflower and seed yield increased successively and significantly with each increment in sulphur from 0 to 60 kg s ha 1 table 2 crop raised with 60 kg s ha 1 recorded 31 1 18 8 and 8 0 higher seed yield than 0 20 and 40 kg s ha 1 respectively irrespective of methods of irrigation and hybrids better seed yield with the highest level of sulphur attributed to improved yield attributing characters viz capitulum diameter capitulum weight and 1000 seed weight than all lower levels secondly sulphur deficiency under lower levels caused reduction in seed yield and oil content because sulphur is involved in protein and enzyme synthesis though the interaction between methods of irrigation and sulphur levels was found to be non significant but results revealed that seed yield was comparatively higher in drip than furrow irrigation table 2 drip irrigated crop produced 18 8 12 2 and 11 3 higher seed yield than furrow irrigated with 20 40 and 60 kg s ha 1 respectively even in control plots 0 kg s ha 1 drip irrigated crop recorded 19 3 higher seed yield which clearly elucidated the benefit of drip fertigation over furrow irrigation furthermore under furrow irrigation sulphur remained more prone to leaching caused reduction in availability and seed yield 3 3 oil content and oil yield oil content differ significantly between both the hybrids and seeds of psh 1962 having 3 5 more oil content than psh 996 irrespective of sulphur levels and irrigation methods table 4 higher oil content in psh 1962 resulted from its genetic potential consequently oil yield was also recorded significantly higher from psh 1962 than psh 996 because of significantly higher seed yield and oil content psh 1962 recorded 29 7 higher oil yield than psh 996 methods of irrigation also had significant effect on oil content of sunflower irrespective of hybrids and sulphur levels table 4 drip irrigated crop recorded significantly and 1 8 higher oil content than furrow irrigated higher oil content in seeds of drip irrigated crop resulted from precise and frequent application of irrigation water along with fertigation of n p and s since sulphur is involved in synthesis of oil hence improved oil content in seeds secondly through drip sulphur fertigation was applied in 5 splits up to 66 days after sowing of the crop which resulted in regular supply of nutrients near to oil synthesis stage of the crop furthermore in furrow irrigation nutrients particularly n and s are more prone to leaching because of more depth of each irrigation which is evident from drainage hence reduced availability of sulphur resulted in lower oil content consequently oil yield was also obtained significantly higher from drip irrigated crop than furrow irrigated irrespective of sulphur levels and hybrids drip irrigated crop registered 18 9 higher oil yield than furrow irrigated because of higher oil content and seed yield oil content in sunflower seeds increased successively and significantly with each increment in sulphur levels irrespective of methods of irrigation and hybrids table 4 seeds from crop raised with 60 kg s ha 1 having 3 2 1 9 and 0 8 higher oil content than that raised with 0 20 and 40 kg s ha 1 respectively higher oil content in seeds from crop raised with higher level of sulphur resulted from better availability of sulphur which is actively involved in oil synthesis oil yield was also recorded significantly higher from 60 kg s ha 1 than lower level of sulphur because of higher seed yield along with significantly higher oil content though the interaction between methods of irrigation and sulphur levels was found to be non significant for oil content and oil yield but data manifested that oil content was higher in drip irrigated crop that furrow irrigated at each level of sulphur table 4 drip irrigation resulted in 1 9 2 1 and 1 8 higher oil content than furrow irrigation with 20 40 and 60 kg s ha 1 respectively even in control plot 0 kg s ha 1 oil content was 1 2 higher in drip irrigated crop than furrow which clearly elucidated added advantages of drip irrigation over furrow similarly oil yield was higher in drip irrigation than furrow irrigation with each level of sulphur because of higher seed yield and oil content tables 2 and 4 the interaction between hybrids and sulphur levels found to be non significant but the oil content was 3 6 3 8 and 3 3 higher in psh 1962 than psh 996 with 20 40 and 60 kg s ha 1 respectively this elucidated the better potential of psh 1962 for oil synthesis over psh 996 and manifested the better ability of psh 1962 for sulphur utilization in oil synthesis over psh 996 3 4 water productivity psh 1962 recorded significantly higher bio physical water productivity bpwp than psh 996 because of significantly higher seed yield as irrigation water input remained same in both the hybrids irrespective of methods of irrigation table 5 bpwp productivity was 54 g higher from psh 1962 than psh 996 with each cubic metre of actual evapotranspiration eta however eta was also 17 2 mm higher in psh 1962 than psh 996 because of better growth and yield attributing characters resulting from genetic make of the hybrid similarly water use efficiency wue was also marginally higher in psh 1962 than psh 996 because of better absorption of water which is evident from higher profile water use and lesser drainage component table 3 methods of irrigation also had significant effect on bpwp and drip irrigated crop registered 5 3 higher bpwp than furrow irrigated despite the denominator eta was 33 9 mm higher in former than latter treatment table 5 higher bpwp in drip irrigation resulted from significantly higher grain yield with 38 0 less irrigation water input than furrow irrigation higher eta in drip irrigation attributed to higher soil profile moisture use and complete check on drainage hence efficient utilization of applied irrigation water table 3 frequent and light irrigation under drip kept check on drainage hence no leaching of nutrients particularly n and s resulted in better yield attributes and seed yield secondly in furrow irrigation more drainage resulted in leaching of nutrients which ultimately recorded reduced availability and poor yield parameters drip irrigation resulted in 32 6 higher wue than furrow irrigation table 5 higher wue in drip irrigation resulted from159 5 mm less irrigation water input and completed check on drainage than furrow irrigation bpwp also improved successively and significantly with each increment in sulphur fertilization irrespective of hybrids and methods of irrigation table 5 bpwp increased by 20 7 12 8 and 4 8 with 60 kg s ha 1 over 0 20 and 40 kg s ha 1 respectively higher bpwp with higher level of sulphur attributed to increase in seed yield with higher availability of sulphur despite increase in denominator eta from 351 5 mm under 0 kg s ha 1 to 378 9 mm under 60 kg s ha 1 table 5 since eta has linear and positive relation with seed yield hence significant improvement in seed yield was recorded with higher eta similarly wue was improved with application of sulphur from 0 to 60 kg s ha 1 because of higher seed yield resulting from higher eta with equal amount of irrigation water input 3 5 economic analysis data clearly indicated that psh 1962 registered rs 9393 ha 1 higher net returns over psh 996 with rs 0 26 higher benefit with 1 0 rupee investment over psh 996 table 6 economic water productivity ewp was also rs 2 38 higher with each cubic metre of eta from psh 1962 than psh 996 table 5 drip irrigation recorded rs 10 185 ha 1 higher net returns with 0 21 more benefit cost b c than furrow irrigation ewp was also rs 1 87 higher with each cubic metre of consumptive use eta among the sulphur levels net returns increased with each increment in sulphur levels irrespective of hybrids and methods of irrigation net returns were rs 11 185 ha 1 higher from 60 kg s ha 1 than control 0 kg s ha 1 b c also increased from 0 90 to 1 11 with application of sulphur from control to 60 kg ha 1 ewp improved to the tune of rs 2 32 with 60 kg s ha 1 over control 0 kg s ha 1 with each cubic metre of consumptive use eta drip irrigation resulted in rs 4 01 2 49 1 18 and 0 02 higher returns with each cubic metre of consumptive use than furrow irrigation with 0 20 40 and 60 kg s ha 1 respectively table 6 4 conclusion sunflower is being cultivated during spring season in maize rice potato sunflower cropping system in indian punjab water requirement of spring crops in punjab is quite high because of high evaporative demand resulting from low relative humidity and scanty or no rainfall to achieve potential yield with higher monetary returns and higher bio physical water productivity sunflower hybrid psh 1962 should be drip irrigated along with fertigation of 60 kg s ha 1 drip irrigation saves 38 0 irrigation water along with rs 10 185 ha 1 more net returns economic water productivity and water use efficiency were also 20 9 and 32 6 higher in drip than furrow irrigation respectively

sowing as top dressing a heavy pre sowing irrigation 100 mm was applied to the whole experimental field before seed bed preparation to ensure adequate moisture in the soil profile at the time of sowing the sunflower hybrids were sown on february 1st during 2016 and january 25thduring 2017 on southern side of east west ridges the sowing was done by dibbling two seeds per hill by keeping ridge to ridge spacing of 60 cm and plant to plant spacing of 30 cm drip irrigation was applied at three days interval and depth of each irrigation was kept equal to 80 of cumulative crop evapo transpiration etc to estimate etc reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated with the help of eto calculator software developed by fao using location specific meteorological data maximum

be placed in a room with a constant temperature the seed samples must have the same temperature as the adjustment samples and the oil content determined on dry matter basis madsen 1976 2 4 economics net return was calculated by excluding cost of production and expenditure from the gross returns b c was calculated to access the feasibility of the treatments and is the ratio between net returns obtained from any activity and the total cost of cultivation 2 5 statistical analysis analysis of variance was performed using proc glm procedure of sas version 9 4 sas 2017 institute inc cary nc usa for all the parameters the difference was compared with fisher s protected least significant difference lsd test at 5 probability level since similar trends were obtained during both the year pooled analysis was done taking year as a main factor to increase the precision of tested treatments 3 results and discussion 3 1 site characteristics the soil of the experimental field was sandy loam typic ustochrept in texture and tested low in organic carbon 0 28 and available nitrogen 163 1 kg ha 1 medium in available phosphorous 17 6 kg ha 1 medium in available sulphur 19 2 kg ha 1 and high in available potassium 334 9 kg ha 1 however ph 7 78 and electrical conductivity 0 34 of the soil were found in the normal range mean field capacity determined by pressure plate apparatus as per richards and weaver 1943 was 24 8 v v in 0 100 cm profile with average bulk density of 1 58 mg m 3 saturated conductivity was calculated by constant head method klute and dirksen 1986 the layer wise physical properties of experimental site are given in table 1 3 2 yield and yield attributes result revealed that capitulum diameter capitulum weight seeds per capitulum 1000 seed weight and seed yield were significantly higher in psh 1962 than psh 996 table 2 psh 1962 resulted in 7 0 20 8 8 4 and 15 5 higher capitulum diameter capitulum weight seed per capitulum and 1000 seed weight than psh 996 respectively increased seed yield to the tune of 12 9 of psh 1962 over psh 996 resulted from genetic make up which is evidence from overall yield attributes methods of irrigation had significant effect on yield attributing characters of sunflower and drip irrigated crop perform significantly better than furrow irrigated table 2 capitulum diameter capitulum weight seeds per capitulum 1000 seed weight and seed yield were 7 1 1 4 2 78 8 12 and 14 7 higher in drip irrigated crop than furrow irrigated crop respectively irrespective of hybrids better performance of drip irrigation attributed to precise irrigation application in radial distribution pattern resulted in effective uptake of nutrients from the soil volume where most of the roots are concentrated near the emitters sinha et al 2017 furthermore under drip irrigation soil moisture remained near to field capacity during most of time as against under furrow irrigation vertical downward movement of water remained to greater extent just after irrigation which carry nutrients along with this is clear from 89 1 mm drainage under furrow irrigation as against complete check on drainage in drip table 3 hitsuda et al 2005 observed that sulphur is more prone to leaching which is necessary element for oil synthesis and utilization of carbohydrates for oil synthesis rani et al 2009 thus reduced availability of sulphur under furrow irrigation than drip irrigation is one of the reasons for lesser seed yield under former than latter sulphur levels also had significant effect on seed yield of sunflower and seed yield increased successively and significantly with each increment in sulphur from 0 to 60 kg s ha 1 table 2 crop raised with 60 kg s ha 1 recorded 31 1 18 8 and 8 0 higher seed yield than 0 20 and 40 kg s ha 1 respectively irrespective of methods of irrigation and hybrids better seed yield with the highest level of sulphur attributed to improved yield attributing characters viz capitulum diameter capitulum weight and 1000 seed weight than all lower levels secondly sulphur deficiency under lower levels caused reduction in seed yield and oil content because sulphur is involved in protein and enzyme synthesis though the interaction between methods of irrigation and sulphur levels was found to be non significant but results revealed that seed yield was comparatively higher in drip than furrow irrigation table 2 drip irrigated crop produced 18 8 12 2 and 11 3 higher seed yield than furrow irrigated with 20 40 and 60 kg s ha 1 respectively even in control plots 0 kg s ha 1 drip irrigated crop recorded 19 3 higher seed yield which clearly elucidated the benefit of drip fertigation over furrow irrigation furthermore under furrow irrigation sulphur remained more prone to leaching caused reduction in availability and seed yield 3 3 oil content and oil yield oil content differ significantly between both the hybrids and seeds of psh 1962 having 3 5 more oil content than psh 996 irrespective of sulphur levels and irrigation methods table 4 higher oil content in psh 1962 resulted from its genetic potential consequently oil yield was also recorded significantly higher from psh 1962 than psh 996 because of significantly higher seed yield and oil content psh 1962 recorded 29 7 higher oil yield than psh 996 methods of irrigation also had significant effect on oil content of sunflower irrespective of hybrids and sulphur levels table 4 drip irrigated crop recorded significantly and 1 8 higher oil content than furrow irrigated higher oil content in seeds of drip irrigated crop resulted from precise and frequent application of irrigation water along with fertigation of n p and s since sulphur is involved in synthesis of oil hence improved oil content in seeds secondly through drip sulphur fertigation was applied in 5 splits up to 66 days after sowing of the crop which resulted in regular supply of nutrients near to oil synthesis stage of the crop furthermore in furrow irrigation nutrients particularly n and s are more prone to leaching because of more depth of each irrigation which is evident from drainage hence reduced availability of sulphur resulted in lower oil content consequently oil yield was also obtained significantly higher from drip irrigated crop than furrow irrigated irrespective of sulphur levels and hybrids drip irrigated crop registered 18 9 higher oil yield than furrow irrigated because of higher oil content and seed yield oil content in sunflower seeds increased successively and significantly with each increment in sulphur levels irrespective of methods of irrigation and hybrids table 4 seeds from crop raised with 60 kg s ha 1 having 3 2 1 9 and 0 8 higher oil content than that raised with 0 20 and 40 kg s ha 1 respectively higher oil content in seeds from crop raised with higher level of sulphur resulted from better availability of sulphur which is actively involved in oil synthesis oil yield was also recorded significantly higher from 60 kg s ha 1 than lower level of sulphur because of higher seed yield along with significantly higher oil content though the interaction between methods of irrigation and sulphur levels was found to be non significant for oil content and oil yield but data manifested that oil content was higher in drip irrigated crop that furrow irrigated at each level of sulphur table 4 drip irrigation resulted in 1 9 2 1 and 1 8 higher oil content than furrow irrigation with 20 40 and 60 kg s ha 1 respectively even in control plot 0 kg s ha 1 oil content was 1 2 higher in drip irrigated crop than furrow which clearly elucidated added advantages of drip irrigation over furrow similarly oil yield was higher in drip irrigation than furrow irrigation with each level of sulphur because of higher seed yield and oil content tables 2 and 4 the interaction between hybrids and sulphur levels found to be non significant but the oil content was 3 6 3 8 and 3 3 higher in psh 1962 than psh 996 with 20 40 and 60 kg s ha 1 respectively this elucidated the better potential of psh 1962 for oil synthesis over psh 996 and manifested the better ability of psh 1962 for sulphur utilization in oil synthesis over psh 996 3 4 water productivity psh 1962 recorded significantly higher bio physical water productivity bpwp than psh 996 because of significantly higher seed yield as irrigation water input remained same in both the hybrids irrespective of methods of irrigation table 5 bpwp productivity was 54 g higher from psh 1962 than psh 996 with each cubic metre of actual evapotranspiration eta however eta was also 17 2 mm higher in psh 1962 than psh 996 because of better growth and yield attributing characters resulting from genetic make of the hybrid similarly water use efficiency wue was also marginally higher in psh 1962 than psh 996 because of better absorption of water which is evident from higher profile water use and lesser drainage component table 3 methods of irrigation also had significant effect on bpwp and drip irrigated crop registered 5 3 higher bpwp than furrow irrigated despite the denominator eta was 33 9 mm higher in former than latter treatment table 5 higher bpwp in drip irrigation resulted from significantly higher grain yield with 38 0 less irrigation water input than furrow irrigation higher eta in drip irrigation attributed to higher soil profile moisture use and complete check on drainage hence efficient utilization of applied irrigation water table 3 frequent and light irrigation under drip kept check on drainage hence no leaching of nutrients particularly n and s resulted in better yield attributes and seed yield secondly in furrow irrigation more drainage resulted in leaching of nutrients which ultimately recorded reduced availability and poor yield parameters drip irrigation resulted in 32 6 higher wue than furrow irrigation table 5 higher wue in drip irrigation resulted from159 5 mm less irrigation water input and completed check on drainage than furrow irrigation bpwp also improved successively and significantly with each increment in sulphur fertilization irrespective of hybrids and methods of irrigation table 5 bpwp increased by 20 7 12 8 and 4 8 with 60 kg s ha 1 over 0 20 and 40 kg s ha 1 respectively higher bpwp with higher level of sulphur attributed to increase in seed yield with higher availability of sulphur despite increase in denominator eta from 351 5 mm under 0 kg s ha 1 to 378 9 mm under 60 kg s ha 1 table 5 since eta has linear and positive relation with seed yield hence significant improvement in seed yield was recorded with higher eta similarly wue was improved with application of sulphur from 0 to 60 kg s ha 1 because of higher seed yield resulting from higher eta with equal amount of irrigation water input 3 5 economic analysis data clearly indicated that psh 1962 registered rs 9393 ha 1 higher net returns over psh 996 with rs 0 26 higher benefit with 1 0 rupee investment over psh 996 table 6 economic water productivity ewp was also rs 2 38 higher with each cubic metre of eta from psh 1962 than psh 996 table 5 drip irrigation recorded rs 10 185 ha 1 higher net returns with 0 21 more benefit cost b c than furrow irrigation ewp was also rs 1 87 higher with each cubic metre of consumptive use eta among the sulphur levels net returns increased with each increment in sulphur levels irrespective of hybrids and methods of irrigation net returns were rs 11 185 ha 1 higher from 60 kg s ha 1 than control 0 kg s ha 1 b c also increased from 0 90 to 1 11 with application of sulphur from control to 60 kg ha 1 ewp improved to the tune of rs 2 32 with 60 kg s ha 1 over control 0 kg s ha 1 with each cubic metre of consumptive use eta drip irrigation resulted in rs 4 01 2 49 1 18 and 0 02 higher returns with each cubic metre of consumptive use than furrow irrigation with 0 20 40 and 60 kg s ha 1 respectively table 6 4 conclusion sunflower is being cultivated during spring season in maize rice potato sunflower cropping system in indian punjab water requirement of spring crops in punjab is quite high because of high evaporative demand resulting from low relative humidity and scanty or no rainfall to achieve potential yield with higher monetary returns and higher bio physical water productivity sunflower hybrid psh 1962 should be drip irrigated along with fertigation of 60 kg s ha 1 drip irrigation saves 38 0 irrigation water along with rs 10 185 ha 1 more net returns economic water productivity and water use efficiency were also 20 9 and 32 6 higher in drip than furrow irrigation respectively

net income in the mediterranean region keywords eggplant surface drip subsurface drip partial root zone drying deficit irrigation economic evaluation 1 introduction water is fast becoming an economically scarce resource in many areas of the world especially in arid and semi arid regions such as the mediterranean the increased competition for water between agricultural industrial and urban consumers creates the need for continuous improvements of irrigation practices in commercial agricultural production todorovic 2016 effective irrigation management strategies can aid in improving crop water productivity through proper timing and application of irrigation water therefore the efficient utilization of limited available fresh water resources in irrigated agriculture necessitates the use pressurized irrigation systems such as surface and subsurface drip systems for increasing yield and quality eggplant is an economically important vegetable crop produced as 35 3 million tons from 1 9 million ha worldwide turkey is in the third place among the eggplant producing countries and produces 3 of the world production although eggplant production is realized in all the geographical regions in turkey the mediterranean region provides 42 of total production tuik 2015 crop growth and yield are mainly dependent on irrigation thus irrigation methods and management are of importance to soil and plant water status drip irrigation is the most efficient method of irrigation for vegetable cultivation fereres and soriano 2007 the delivery of low amounts of water at a high frequency usually limits water evaporation and drainage thus represents high water productivity sharmasarkar et al 2001 sun et al 2013 subsurface drip sdi has proven to be an efficient irrigation method with potential advantages of high water use efficiency fewer weed and disease problems less soil erosion efficient fertilizer application maintenance of dry areas for tractor movement at any time flexibility in design and lower labour costs than in a conventional drip irrigation system lamm and camp 2007 irmak et al 2016 there has been an increasing usage of sdi for vegetable production in the world especially in arid and semi arid regions due to advantages mentioned above the yield and quality response of the eggplant to irrigation with sdi is needed to be able to evaluate the economic feasibility of using sdi under local conditions and provide scientifically based practical information to the farmers in our country the usage of the sdi is very limited and there is not sufficient information about the effectiveness of this system over the surface drip irrigation system deficit irrigation and partial root zone drying prd are the water management techniques in which applying less irrigation water than required allows larger irrigation areas with the available water resources prd simulating drip irrigation using same quantity of water produced greater biomass yield compared with conventional uniform watering wang et al 2005 however prd might results in increased root zone salinity as compared with conventional deficit irrigation due to moving salts towards the roots in alternating drip line operation during irrigations on both sides of the crop row many investigations have been carried out worldwide regarding the effects of deficit irrigation on yield of mainly horticultural crops fereres and soriano 2007 nagaz et al 2012 sezen et al 2014 bozkurt çolak et al 2017 there are several studies on eggplant irrigation carried out in different countries

different vegetable crops including eggplant chartzoulakis and drosos 1995 wang et al 2006 yuan et al 2006 aujla et al 2007 irrigation frequency is one of the important factors in drip irrigation management especially in coarse textured soils proper irrigation frequency can establish a balance between soil moisture and oxygen conditions in the crop root zone throughout the growing season wan and kang 2006 high irrigation frequency is associated with constantly elevated moisture levels in the crop root zone and consequently the hydraulic conductivity and water availability are maintained for longer times at high levels raviv et al 1999 eggplant is an important summer vegetable in the mediterranean region of turkey farmers practice for raising the crop with 6 8 irrigations by surface method leads to high water demand however availability of irrigation water in drier months is the main limiting factor to enhance crop productivity in the region hence the efficient use of water should be prioritized to increase crop water productivity in the region drip system may be an alternative of conventional irrigation due to its precise and direct application of water in root zone the dependence of crop yield on water supply is a critical issue because of the increasing limited water resources for irrigation the objectives of the present study were to i evaluate and compare the interactive effects of full and conventional deficit irrigation regimes and partial root zone drying and irrigation frequencies on yield quality and water productivity of field grown eggplant solanum melongema l under surface drip and subsurface drip systems and ii compare net income generated by different irrigation regimes for surface and subsurface irrigated eggplant grown in the mediterranean

harvesting and transportation costs for the calculation of the total cost of eggplant production for one year the sum of crop production costs the yearly cost of the irrigation system irrigation labour and water cost are taken into account 2 6 statistical analysis analysis of variance was performed to evaluate the statistical effect of irrigation treatments on eggplant yields and components wp and et using the jmp statistical software developed by sas sas institute inc cary nc usa treatment means were compared using lsd test steel and torrie 1980 3 results and discussion 3 1 applied irrigation water amount i and crop evapotranspiration eta the data on applied irrigation water amount and crop water use evapotranspiration for the different treatments in the experimental years are given in table 1 total amount of water applied varied among the treatments in the experimental years and these variations depended on weather conditions and rainfall in the first year to achieve a good stand a total of 41 mm of irrigation water was applied equally at four applications to all treatment plots the seasonal irrigation water applied ranged from 243 mm to 495 mm in the surface drip plots varied from 228 mm to 446 mm in the subsurface drip plots table 1 in the second growing season a total of 62 mm of irrigation water was applied equally at five applications to all treatment plots the total irrigation water applied varied from 229 to 444 mm in surface drip varied from 216 to 418 mm in the subsurface drip plots in general subsurface drip treatments received slightly less water than the surface drip plots due to reduced evaporation losses from the soil surface prd50 and di50 treatments received the same amount of water eggplant evapotranspiration eta was highly dependent on prevailing weather conditions irrigation amount rainfall received and the variation of soil water storage in the growing seasons seasonal eta values ranged from 339 mm in if3 di50 to 543 mm in if3 fi treatment plots in 2013 and varied from 363 mm in if6 di50 to 527 mm in if3 fi treatment plots in 2014 for the surface drip in subsurface drip plots eta varied from 306 mm in if3 di50 to 495 mm in if3 fi treatment in the first growing season and 349 mm in if6 di50 to 494 mm in if3 fi treatment in the second growing season table 1 water consumption under sdi was slightly lower than that under surface drip contributing to lower plant height table 2 and leaf area data not provided the seasonal eta increased with the increasing amount of irrigation under both surface and subsurface drip systems the eta of most treatments in 2014 were slightly lower than those in 2013 probably due to the lower monthly minimum temperature in april 2014 and higher tmax encountered in june and august in the second growing season occurrence of a very low temperature in april 4 4 c in 2014 slowed down the seedling establishment and plant growth di50 treatments under both irrigation systems resulted in slightly lower et 2 3 than prd50 treatment despite of receiving the same amount of water at full fruit bearing period under full irrigation fi and low deficit irrigation treatments di75 the plants grew vigorously leading water consumption to reach its maximum in both experimental years ertek et al 2006 reported seasonal et of furrow irrigated eggplant varying between 420 and 689 mm in the mediterranean region of turkey lovelli et al 2007 found the seasonal et of drip irrigated eggplant in southern italy varied between 147 and 469 mm karam et al 2011 reported seasonal et of eggplant varying between 150 and 590 mm in the central bekaa valley of lebanon our results are in agreement with above mentioned study results 3 2 soil water content variation soil water content variations in the effective root zone depth of 60 cm during the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons for each irrigation frequency and irrigation method are presented in fig 2 a d and figure 3a d respectively temporal variability of soil water content swc in 2013 and 2014 characterized by a gradual decrease in soil water content in response to deficit irrigations towards the end of the season swc in 3 day frequency plots were higher than those in 6 day frequency plots high irrigation frequency is associated with constantly elevated soil water content levels in the crop root zone for both drip systems with 3 day irrigation interval soil water contents in fi and di75 treatment plots remained above 50 of available water throughout the growing season on the other hand in deficit irrigation treatments di75 di50 and prd50 with 6 day interval swc remained below the 50 of available water during most of the growing seasons it was observed that swc values in prd50 plots were below the di50 for both drip systems in the experimental years even though these treatments received the same amount of water 3 3 fresh eggplant yield eggplant yields obtained from the different treatments in the experimental years are presented in table 1 tables 3 and 4 provide statistical analysis results on yield and quality parameters of eggplant irrigation systems intervals and regimes resulted in significantly different yields p 0 01 in the first growing season table 4 in the second year irrigation frequency and regimes differed significantly but no significant difference was found between the two drip irrigation systems regarding the fresh eggplant yield eggplant yield values ranged from a lowest of 40 9 t ha 1 in sdi if6 prd50 to highest 78 70 t ha 1 in the di if3 fi in 2013 and ranged from 58 8 t ha 1 in sdi if6 prd50 to 92 7 t ha 1 in the sdi if3 fi in 2014 prd50 treatments resulted in the lowest yields in both growing seasons di50 produced significantly greater yield than prd50 under both drip systems even though prd50 and di50 received the same amount irrigation water the difference in eta between these two treatments is not significant regarding the lower yield in prd50 treatment might be attributed to all the roots were exposed to uniform water distribution under di50 than prd50 in which half of the roots kept relatively drier conditions the second growing season produced significantly greater yield than those in the first year due to favourable maximum and minimum air temperature conditions prevailed the fi treatments with 3 day irrigation intervals in both irrigation systems resulted in significantly higher yields than all other treatments in the study irrigation frequency of 3 day outperformed significantly over 6 day frequency in yield and quality of eggplant in both experimental years the two year results revealed that frequent irrigation maintains higher soil water content in the effective root zone depth which in turn results in vigorous growth and greater yields water stress reduced eggplant yields significantly in the experimental years in general as the amount of irrigation water applied decreased yield decreased amiri et al 2012 investigated the effects of irrigation intervals of 6 and 12 day and nitrogen fertilizer on furrow irrigated eggplant in iran their results showed that the highest yield was observed in 6 day interval irrigation with total water use of 441 mm aujla et al 2007 determined fresh eggplant yields varying from 43 1 and 103 1 t ha 1 in india karam et al 2011 reported eggplant yields varying between 13 4 and 33 8 t ha 1 for full and deficit irrigation regimes in lebanon kuşçu et al 2009 obtained marketable yields of eggplant as 46 4 t ha 1 with irrigation at 80 evaporation replenishment in marmara region of turkey douh and boujelben 2010 in their study in tunisia to investigated the effects of subsurface and surface drip irrigation on eggplant yield and they concluded that subsurface drip irrigation outperformed the surface drip irrigation our results are contradictory to tunisian study findings there are limited comparative study on sdi and di on eggplant production several studies have compared the effects of sdi and di on crop yield proving that sdi generally results in higher yield patel and rajput 2009 kong et al 2011 kırnak et al 2002 and chaves et al 2003 demonstrated that water stress resulted in significant decreases in eggplant yield and yield components rakhymzhanov et al 2015 reported that drip irrigation resulted in 41 yield increase and water saving of 29 as compared to furrow irrigation in kazakhstan díaz pérez and eaton 2015 suggested that eggplant may tolerate mild water stress when plants irrigated at 67 eta produced yields similar to those of plants irrigated at 100 eta or higher rates thus there is a potential to save water by reducing current irrigation rates without negatively impacting fruit yields the results revealed that in areas with no water shortage full irrigation with 3 day irrigation frequency is recommended for greater yield however under water scarcity conditions di75 can be a good alternative with water saving about 25 but yield reduction only approximately less than 5 3 4 water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity iwp wp and iwp values for the different treatments in the experimental years are presented in table 1 wp values ranged from a lowest of 12 2 kg m 3 in sdi if6 prd50 to highest of 21 9 kg m 3 in the sdi if3 di50 in 2013 and ranged from 16 6 kg m 3 in sdi if6 prd50 to 24 5 kg m 3 in the sdi if3 di50 in 2014 wp and iwp values were significantly influenced by irrigation systems intervals and regimes table 3 in general as the amount of irrigation water applied decreased wp increased except prd50 treatments which resulted in lowest wp in both experimental years full irrigation treatments also had lower wp values in the experimental years although wp values in di50 and prd50 treatments were higher but these treatments produced very low yields as compared to full irrigation therefore higher wp should be associated with higher yields karam et al 2011 reported the highest wp value in the deficit irrigation treatment as 5 6 kg m 3 in lebanon while lovelli et al 2007 reported highest wp as 10 3 kg m 3 for full irrigated eggplant in southern italy in addition they reported significant increases in water productivity of eggplants between non irrigated and well irrigated conditions amiri et al 2012 reported highest wp of 11 6 kg m 3 in eggplants irrigated every 6 days and received 120 kg nitrogen per hectare in iran kırnak et al 2002 who demonstrated that water stress caused increases in water productivity our results on wp are in agreement with findings of lovelli et al 2007 and amiri et al 2012 the higher wp of plants under stress conditions is because stressed plants wilt far more than unstressed plants and wilting invariably occurs in times when the saturation deficit of the atmosphere is large bloch et al 2006 irrigation water productivity iwp values ranged from 14 7 kg m 3 in sdi if6 fi to 27 3 kg m 3 in the sdi if3 di50 treatments in 2013 and ranged from 20 8 kg m 3 in di if3 fi to 35 7 kg m 3 in the sdi if3 di50 treatments in 2014 irrigation frequency and regimes resulted in significantly different iwp values in the experimental years but there was no significant difference between the irrigation systems in the first growing season however irrigation systems interval and regimes resulted in significantly different iwp values in the second experimental year greatest iwp values were obtained from the deficit irrigation treatments while full irrigation treatments resulted in the lowest iwp values for both irrigation methods contrary lovelli et al 2007 reported decreasing iwp values with increasing water stress kuşçu et al 2009 determined the average iwp for eggplant as 13 6 and 13 0 kg m 3 for 60 and 80 of pan evaporation replenishment in marmara region of turkey dukes et al 2003 determined iwp values for sensor based high frequency drip irrigated bell pepper ranging from 16 0 to 52 6 kg m 3 for marketable yield in florida sezen et al 2014 reported increasing iwp values with increasing water stress for pepper in turkey our results are in agreement with above mentioned study findings 3 5 water yield relationships and yield response factor there was significant linear relationships between crop evapotranspiration and eggplant yield for both drip systems in the experimental years fig 4 a b the difference between slope and intercept of the y versus eta relationships in the experimental years can be explained by the variation of weather conditions during the growing seasons similar results were obtained by sezen et al 2006 in bell pepper grown in the mediterranean region of turkey kuşçu et al 2009 reported significant second degree polynomial relations between yield and irrigation for eggplant under the southern marmara region of turkey karam et al 2011 found a significant second degree polynomial relation between fruit dry matter of eggplant and eta in lebanon yield response factor ky values determined for eggplant as 0 73 and 0 80 for di and sdi in the first and 0 69 and 0 63 for di and sdi in the second growing season respectively are depicted in fig 5 a b smaller ky values in the second year can be attributed to greater yields but slightly lower crop water use values it can be argued that the species which show a ky smaller than 1 0 tolerate water stress to a greater extent and they could be exposed to a water deficit which even if it determines a limited production decrease would allow a significant irrigation water saving and increase water productivity thus eggplant can be considered as tolerant to mild water stress since ky values are smaller than 1 0 şenyiğit et al 2011 reported yield response factor ky of 0 81 for eggplant under greenhouse conditions ertek et al 2006 determined ky as 0 60 for furrow irrigated eggplant in eastern turkey chartzoulakis and drosos 1995 found ky value of 0 9 for the total growing period in an unheated greenhouse in crete karam et al 2011 have given ky values of 0 55 and 1 18 for the experimental years lovelli et al 2007 reported ky value of 1 37 for eggplant under southern italy conditions the reason for difference between the two studies is that much lower eggplant yields but similar et values obtained in southern italy conditions in comparison to our results 3 6 plant height plant height values ranged from a lowest of 89 cm in sdi if6 prd50 to highest 128 cm in the di if3 fi in 2013 and varied from 90 cm in sdi if6 prd50 to 134 cm in the di if3 fi in 2014 in treatments table 2 irrigation intervals and regimes resulted in significantly different plant heights p 0 01 in 2013 and irrigation methods intervals and regimes resulted in significantly different plant height p 0 01 in 2014 table 3 the fi treatments with 3 day irrigation intervals in two years resulted in significantly higher plant height as compared with all other treatments water stress reduced eggplant plant height significantly in general as the amount of irrigation water applied decreased plant height decreased pirboneh et al 2012 observed the highest plant height with 6 day interval and was 52 3 higher in comparison with no irrigation in guilan iran kırnak et al 2002 also concluded that drought stress resulted in significant reduction in plant height of eggplant as compared with control treatment 3 7 fruit yield components and quality parameters fruit yield components and quality parameters such as fruit number mean fruit weight volume firmness ph fruit dry matter total soluble solid are presented in table 2 statistical analysis results on quality parameters of eggplant under different treatments in the experimental years are presented in table 3 irrigation regimes had a significantly different effect on quality parameters maximum fruit number fruit weight and volume were obtained from the if3fi surface drip plots in both experimental years irrigation methods intervals and regimes resulted in significantly different fruit number fruit weight and volume in general surface drip performance was better than subsurface drip considering quality of eggplants the fruit number varied from a low of 233 1000 ha 1 in sdi if6 prd50 treatment to 392 1000 ha 1 in di if3 fi in 2013 in 2014 greatest fruit number was obtained from the 458 1000 ha 1 in di if3 fi treatments and the lowest value was 339 1000 ha 1 in sdi if6 prd50 treatment results are consisted in the two experimental years same treatments both years díaz pérez and eaton 2015 reported that fruit number and fruit yields marketable and total were also lowest at 33 eta and there were little yield differences among irrigation rates higher than 33 eta in the southeastern united states the results revealed significant differences in mean fruit weight among treatments irrigation systems intervals and regimes resulted in significantly different fruit weight p 0 01 in 2013 and irrigation intervals and regimes resulted in significantly different fruit weight p 0 01 in 2014 as the amount of irrigation water increased fruit number weight and volume increased in both experimental years in general 3 day irrigation frequency resulted in greater fruit weight as compared to 6 day frequency smittle et al 1994 kırnak et al 2002 karam et al 2011 pirboneh et al 2012 and demirel et al 2014 reported that water stress resulted in a reduction of fruit lenght fruit volume and fruit width of eggplant the effect of irrigation systems intervals and regimes on fruit firmness was significantly different fruit firmness increased with increasing irrigation quantity in the second year but mixed effects were observed in the first year fi treatment resulted in the greatest fruit firmness values in the second year irrigation regimes resulted in significantly different fruit dry matter p 0 01 in the experimental years table 3 surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems had similar fruit dry matter in corresponding treatments the highest fruit dry matter values were obtained in deficit irrigation treatments while the lowest fruit dry matter value was obtained from the fi treatments interaction of irrigation intervals and irrigation regimes resulted in significantly different ph p 0 05 in 2013 and there was no significant difference between them in 2014 the highest ph value was obtained in if6di50 treatments while the lowest fruit ph value was recorded in the if3fi treatment similar results for fruit dry matter were obtained for total soluble solids tss tss values were significantly influenced by irrigation systems frequency and regimes and their triple interactions p 0 01 in 2013 in the second year similar results except the irrigation systems which resulted in no significant difference in tss mohawesh 2016 reported that the tss and titratable acidity increased significantly as the amount of irrigation water decreased from the 100 irrigation level to the 20 irrigation level in jordan kırnak et al 2002 reported that tss and titratable acidity increased with decreasing irrigation amounts karam et al 2011 stated a positive effect of water deficit on fruit dry matter content which is associated with flavour our results are in general agreement with the above mentioned research findings about the fruit quality parameters 3 8 economic evaluation an economic analysis was carried out by using averages of two year data based on investment operation and production costs and the results are presented in table 5 economic evaluation revealed that the maximum net income was generated as us 13 941 ha 1 with the full irrigation treatment under the surface drip with 3 day interval di if3fi treatment followed by sdi if3fi treatment the lowest net return was generated by sdi if6 prd50 treatment followed by di if6 prd50 lovelli et al 2007 showed that providing 100 of eta for eggplant growth was indeed the most profitable irrigation schedule kuşçu et al 2009 determined the maximum net return for eggplant as us 6188 for 80 replenishment of pan evaporation in the marmara region of turkey sezen et al 2015 reported similar findings for drip irrigated pepper in tarsus turkey it was noted that there was a considerable difference between irrigation intervals in net income among the irrigation regimes and irrigation methods in general as the amount of irrigation water applied increased net income also raised under both irrigation systems on the other hand in case of water scarcity if3di75 treatments resulted in significantly higher income compared to the other deficit irrigation treatments di50 resulted in significantly higher net income than the prd50 treatments even though these two treatments received the same amount of irrigation water in both drip systems in regions where access to the irrigation water is costly or water supply is less than demanded the if3di75 treatment could be a reasonable alternative in this study if3di75 treatment caused water saving of 25 in irrigation water resulted in 4 3 yield reduction but net income declined only 5 6 as compared to fi the results revealed that diif3fi treatment which generated the highest net income can be recommended for areas experiencing no water shortage 4 conclusions the results of the current study clearly demonstrated the significant effects of surface and subsurface drip systems irrigation intervals and regimes on total yield and quality of eggplant and also economic returns fi treatments under both di and sdi produced significantly greater yields than deficit irrigation treatments in the experimental years di50 produced significantly greater yield than prd50 under both drip systems even though prd50 and di50 received the same amount irrigation water three day irrigation frequency resulted in significantly greater yield than those in six day frequency in both drip systems in the experimental years the experimental findings indicate that water management is critically important in order to obtain higher yields of field grown eggplant under the mediterranean climatic conditions irrigation systems intervals and regimes all had a significantly different effect on quality parameters the results showed that surface drip resulted in higher eggplant yield than sdi by 7 3 and 11 for 3 day and 6 day irrigation frequency in 2013 but the two systems performed similarly in the second year it was concluded that both subsurface and surface drip irrigation if3 fi treatments are recommended under field conditions in order to obtain higher and better quality eggplant yield in the mediterranean region of turkey although the di75 treatments plots with 3 day irrigation interval received approximately 25 less water compared to the fi plots for both irrigation systems total yield was reduced by an average of 4 3 therefore considering water shortages in dry years deficit irrigation practices di75 can be suggested the results indicated that wp and iwp values decreased with increasing irrigation amounts for both drip systems it is suggested that high water productivity should be associated with high or acceptable yield particularly in water scarce areas however di50 and prd50 treatments with longer irrigation interval 6 days resulted in lower total eggplant yield and lower quality thus it is not recommended to use longer irrigation interval with moderate to high deficit irrigations for surface drip and subsurface drip irrigated eggplant production in the region the highest net income was obtained from the if3fi surface drip treatment followed by if3fi subsurface drip treatment it was observed that net income decreased with decreasing irrigation water compared with conventional deficit irrigation treatments prd50 with both drip systems generated the lowest net income therefore full irrigation with 3 day irrigation frequency under surface drip and subsurface drip can be recommended if there is no water shortage and in case of water scarcity di75 treatments with 3 day could be good alternative for obtaining high yield and economic returns acknowledgement the authors would like to thank the turkish scientific and technical research council

50 75 and 50 of fi were tested in a split split plot design in general sdi used slightly less water than the surface drip plots due to reduced evaporation losses from the soil surface irrigation systems intervals and regimes resulted in significantly different yields and quality the results showed that surface drip resulted in higher eggplant yield than sdi by 7 3 and 11 for 3 day and 6 day

net income in the mediterranean region keywords eggplant surface drip subsurface drip partial root zone drying deficit irrigation economic evaluation 1 introduction water is fast becoming an economically scarce resource in many areas of the world especially in arid and semi arid regions such as the mediterranean the increased competition for water between agricultural industrial and urban consumers creates the need for continuous improvements of irrigation practices in commercial agricultural production todorovic 2016 effective irrigation management strategies can aid in improving crop water productivity through proper timing and application of irrigation water therefore the efficient utilization of limited available fresh water resources in irrigated agriculture necessitates the use pressurized irrigation systems such as surface and subsurface drip systems for increasing yield and quality eggplant is an economically important vegetable crop produced as 35 3 million tons from 1 9 million ha worldwide turkey is in the third place among the eggplant producing countries and produces 3 of the world production although eggplant production is realized in all the geographical regions in turkey the mediterranean region provides 42 of total production tuik 2015 crop growth and yield are mainly dependent on irrigation thus irrigation methods and management are of importance to soil and plant water status drip irrigation is the most efficient method of irrigation for vegetable cultivation fereres and soriano 2007 the delivery of low amounts of water at a high frequency usually limits water evaporation and drainage thus represents high water productivity sharmasarkar et al 2001 sun et al 2013 subsurface drip sdi has proven to be an efficient irrigation method with potential advantages of high water use efficiency fewer weed and disease problems less soil erosion efficient fertilizer application maintenance of dry areas for tractor movement at any time flexibility in design and lower labour costs than in a conventional drip irrigation system lamm and camp 2007 irmak et al 2016 there has been an increasing usage of sdi for vegetable production in the world especially in arid and semi arid regions due to advantages mentioned above the yield and quality response of the eggplant to irrigation with sdi is needed to be able to evaluate the economic feasibility of using sdi under local conditions and provide scientifically based practical information to the farmers in our country the usage of the sdi is very limited and there is not sufficient information about the effectiveness of this system over the surface drip irrigation system deficit irrigation and partial root zone drying prd are the water management techniques in which applying less irrigation water than required allows larger irrigation areas with the available water resources prd simulating drip irrigation using same quantity of water produced greater biomass yield compared with conventional uniform watering wang et al 2005 however prd might results in increased root zone salinity as compared with conventional deficit irrigation due to moving salts towards the roots in alternating drip line operation during irrigations on both sides of the crop row many investigations have been carried out worldwide regarding the effects of deficit irrigation on yield of mainly horticultural crops fereres and soriano 2007 nagaz et al 2012 sezen et al 2014 bozkurt çolak et al 2017 there are several studies on eggplant irrigation carried out in different countries chartzoulakis and drosos 1995 aujla et al 2007 gaveh et al 2011 karam et al 2011 showing that eggplant can be produced at moderate levels of drought stress without major impact on fruit yield kırnak et al 2002 and chaves et al 2003 reported decrease in eggplant yield in response to increased soil water stress levels lovelli et al 2007 demonstrated that the sensitivity to water stress of eggplants was expressed in high marketable yield decrements and a drop in water productivity in eggplant the most critical periods for irrigation are during flowering and fruit formation blum 2005 fruit size and yield as well as biomass yield are reduced by moisture stress eggplant needs uniform soil moisture conditions for high fruit production and dry periods may cause shedding of flowers and young fruits burt 2000 díaz pérez and eaton 2015 many researchers reported greater yields and water productivity values of drip irrigation system over the surface irrigation methods throughout the world in different vegetable crops including eggplant chartzoulakis and drosos 1995 wang et al 2006 yuan et al 2006 aujla et al 2007 irrigation frequency is one of the important factors in drip irrigation management especially in coarse textured soils proper irrigation frequency can establish a balance between soil moisture and oxygen conditions in the crop root zone throughout the growing season wan and kang 2006 high irrigation frequency is associated with constantly elevated moisture levels in the crop root zone and consequently the hydraulic conductivity and water availability are maintained for longer times at high levels raviv et al 1999 eggplant is an important summer vegetable in the mediterranean region of turkey farmers practice for raising the crop with 6 8 irrigations by surface method leads to high water demand however availability of irrigation water in drier months is the main limiting factor to enhance crop productivity in the region hence the efficient use of water should be prioritized to increase crop water productivity in the region drip system may be an alternative of conventional irrigation due to its precise and direct application of water in root zone the dependence of crop yield on water supply is a critical issue because of the increasing limited water resources for irrigation the objectives of the present study were to i evaluate and compare the interactive effects of full and conventional deficit irrigation regimes and partial root zone drying and irrigation frequencies on yield quality and water productivity of field grown eggplant solanum melongema l under surface drip and subsurface drip systems and ii compare net income generated by different irrigation regimes for surface and subsurface irrigated eggplant grown in the mediterranean

irrigation water amount i and crop evapotranspiration eta the data on applied irrigation water amount and crop water use evapotranspiration for the different treatments in the experimental years are given in table 1 total amount of water applied varied among the treatments in the experimental years and these variations depended on weather conditions and rainfall in the first year to achieve a good stand a total of 41 mm of irrigation water was applied equally at four applications to all treatment plots the seasonal irrigation water applied ranged from 243 mm to 495 mm in the surface drip plots varied from 228 mm to 446 mm in the subsurface drip plots table 1 in the second growing season a total of 62 mm of irrigation water was applied equally at five applications to all treatment plots the total irrigation water applied varied from 229 to 444 mm in surface drip varied from 216 to 418 mm in the subsurface drip plots in general subsurface drip treatments received slightly less water than the surface drip plots due to reduced evaporation losses from the soil surface prd50 and di50 treatments received the same amount of water eggplant evapotranspiration eta was highly dependent on prevailing weather conditions irrigation amount rainfall received and the variation of soil water storage in the growing seasons seasonal eta values ranged from 339 mm in if3 di50 to 543 mm in if3 fi treatment plots in 2013 and varied from 363 mm in if6 di50 to 527 mm in if3 fi treatment plots in 2014 for the surface drip in subsurface drip plots eta varied from 306 mm in if3 di50 to 495 mm in if3 fi treatment in the first growing season and 349 mm in if6 di50 to 494 mm in if3 fi treatment in the second growing season table 1 water consumption under sdi was slightly lower than that under surface drip contributing to lower plant height table 2 and leaf area data not provided the seasonal eta increased with the increasing amount of irrigation under both surface and subsurface drip systems the eta of most treatments in 2014 were slightly lower than those in 2013 probably due to the lower monthly minimum temperature in april 2014 and higher tmax encountered in june and august in the second growing season occurrence of a very low temperature in april 4 4 c in 2014 slowed down the seedling establishment and plant growth di50 treatments under both irrigation systems resulted in slightly lower et 2 3 than prd50 treatment despite of receiving the same amount of water at full fruit bearing period under full irrigation fi and low deficit irrigation treatments di75 the plants grew vigorously leading water consumption to reach its maximum in both experimental years ertek et al 2006 reported seasonal et of furrow irrigated eggplant varying between 420 and 689 mm in the mediterranean region of turkey lovelli et al 2007 found the seasonal et of drip irrigated eggplant in southern italy varied between 147 and 469 mm karam et al 2011 reported seasonal et of eggplant varying between 150 and 590 mm in the central bekaa valley of lebanon our results are in agreement with above mentioned study results 3 2 soil water content variation soil water content variations in the effective root zone depth of 60 cm during the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons for each irrigation frequency and irrigation method are presented in fig 2 a d and figure 3a d respectively temporal variability of soil water content swc in 2013 and 2014 characterized by a gradual decrease in soil water content in response to deficit irrigations towards the end of the season swc in 3 day frequency plots were higher than those in 6 day frequency plots high irrigation frequency is associated with constantly elevated soil water content levels in the crop root zone for both drip systems with 3 day irrigation interval soil water contents in fi and di75 treatment plots remained above 50 of available water throughout the growing season on the other hand in deficit irrigation treatments di75 di50 and prd50 with 6 day interval swc remained below the 50 of available water during most of the growing seasons it was observed that swc values in prd50 plots were below the di50 for both drip systems in the experimental years even though these treatments received the same amount of water 3 3 fresh eggplant yield eggplant yields obtained from the different treatments in the experimental years are presented in table 1 tables 3 and 4 provide statistical analysis results on yield and quality parameters of eggplant irrigation systems intervals and regimes resulted in significantly different yields p 0 01 in the first growing season table 4 in the second year irrigation frequency and regimes differed significantly but no significant difference was found between the two drip irrigation systems regarding the fresh eggplant yield eggplant yield values ranged from a lowest of 40 9 t ha 1 in sdi if6 prd50 to highest 78 70 t ha 1 in the di if3 fi in 2013 and ranged from 58 8 t ha 1 in sdi if6 prd50 to 92 7 t ha 1 in the sdi if3 fi in 2014 prd50 treatments resulted in the lowest yields in both growing seasons di50 produced significantly greater yield than prd50 under both drip systems even though prd50 and di50 received the same amount irrigation water the difference in eta between these two treatments is not significant regarding the lower yield in prd50 treatment might be attributed to all the roots were exposed to uniform water distribution under di50 than prd50 in which half of the roots kept relatively drier conditions the second growing season produced significantly greater yield than those in the first year due to favourable maximum and minimum air temperature conditions prevailed the fi treatments with 3 day irrigation intervals in both irrigation systems resulted in significantly higher yields than all other treatments in the study irrigation frequency of 3 day outperformed significantly over 6 day frequency in yield and quality of eggplant in both experimental years the two year results revealed that frequent irrigation maintains higher soil water content in the effective root zone depth which in turn results in vigorous growth and greater yields water stress reduced eggplant yields significantly in the experimental years in general as the amount of irrigation water applied decreased yield decreased amiri et al 2012 investigated the effects of irrigation intervals of 6 and 12 day and nitrogen fertilizer on furrow irrigated eggplant in iran their results showed that the highest yield was observed in 6 day interval irrigation with total water use of 441 mm aujla et al 2007 determined fresh eggplant yields varying from 43 1 and 103 1 t ha 1 in india karam et al 2011 reported eggplant yields varying between 13 4 and 33 8 t ha 1 for full and deficit irrigation regimes in lebanon kuşçu et al 2009 obtained marketable yields of eggplant as 46 4 t ha 1 with irrigation at 80 evaporation replenishment in marmara region of turkey douh and boujelben 2010 in their study in tunisia to investigated the effects of subsurface and surface drip irrigation on eggplant yield and they concluded that subsurface drip irrigation outperformed the surface drip irrigation our results are contradictory to tunisian study findings there are limited comparative study on sdi and di on eggplant production several studies have compared the effects of sdi and di on crop yield proving that sdi generally results in higher yield patel and rajput 2009 kong et al 2011 kırnak et al 2002 and chaves et al 2003 demonstrated that water stress resulted in significant decreases in eggplant yield and yield components rakhymzhanov et al 2015 reported that drip irrigation resulted in 41 yield increase and water saving of 29 as compared to furrow irrigation in kazakhstan díaz pérez and eaton 2015 suggested that eggplant may tolerate mild water stress when plants irrigated at 67 eta produced yields similar to those of plants irrigated at 100 eta or higher rates thus there is a potential to save water by reducing current irrigation rates without negatively impacting fruit yields the results revealed that in areas with no water shortage full irrigation with 3 day irrigation frequency is recommended for greater yield however under water scarcity conditions di75 can be a good alternative with water saving about 25 but yield reduction only approximately less than 5 3 4 water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity iwp wp and iwp values for the different treatments in the experimental years are presented in table 1 wp values ranged from a lowest of 12 2 kg m 3 in sdi if6 prd50 to highest of 21 9 kg m 3 in the sdi if3 di50 in 2013 and ranged from 16 6 kg m 3 in sdi if6 prd50 to 24 5 kg m 3 in the sdi if3 di50 in 2014 wp and iwp values were significantly influenced by irrigation systems intervals and regimes table 3 in general as the amount of irrigation water applied decreased wp increased except prd50 treatments which resulted in lowest wp in both experimental years full irrigation treatments also had lower wp values in the experimental years although wp values in di50 and prd50 treatments were higher but these treatments produced very low yields as compared to full irrigation therefore higher wp should be associated with higher yields karam et al 2011 reported the highest wp value in the deficit irrigation treatment as 5 6 kg m 3 in lebanon while lovelli et al 2007 reported highest wp as 10 3 kg m 3 for full irrigated eggplant in southern italy in addition they reported significant increases in water productivity of eggplants between non irrigated and well irrigated conditions amiri et al 2012 reported highest wp of 11 6 kg m 3 in eggplants irrigated every 6 days and received 120 kg nitrogen per hectare in iran kırnak et al 2002 who demonstrated that water stress caused increases in water productivity our results on wp are in agreement with findings of lovelli et al 2007 and amiri et al 2012 the higher wp of plants under stress conditions is because stressed plants wilt far more than unstressed plants and wilting invariably occurs in times when the saturation deficit of the atmosphere is large bloch et al 2006 irrigation water productivity iwp values ranged from 14 7 kg m 3 in sdi if6 fi to 27 3 kg m 3 in the sdi if3 di50 treatments in 2013 and ranged from 20 8 kg m 3 in di if3 fi to 35 7 kg m 3 in the sdi if3 di50 treatments in 2014 irrigation frequency and regimes resulted in significantly different iwp values in the experimental years but there was no significant difference between the irrigation systems in the first growing season however irrigation systems interval and regimes resulted in significantly different iwp values in the second experimental year greatest iwp values were obtained from the deficit irrigation treatments while full irrigation treatments resulted in the lowest iwp values for both irrigation methods contrary lovelli et al 2007 reported decreasing iwp values with increasing water stress kuşçu et al 2009 determined the average iwp for eggplant as 13 6 and 13 0 kg m 3 for 60 and 80 of pan evaporation replenishment in marmara region of turkey dukes et al 2003 determined iwp values for sensor based high frequency drip irrigated bell pepper ranging from 16 0 to 52 6 kg m 3 for marketable yield in florida sezen et al 2014 reported increasing iwp values with increasing water stress for pepper in turkey our results are in agreement with above mentioned study findings 3 5 water yield relationships and yield response factor there was significant linear relationships between crop evapotranspiration and eggplant yield for both drip systems in the experimental years fig 4 a b the difference between slope and intercept of the y versus eta relationships in the experimental years can be explained by the variation of weather conditions during the growing seasons similar results were obtained by sezen et al 2006 in bell pepper grown in the mediterranean region of turkey kuşçu et al 2009 reported significant second degree polynomial relations between yield and irrigation for eggplant under the southern marmara region of turkey karam et al 2011 found a significant second degree polynomial relation between fruit dry matter of eggplant and eta in lebanon yield response factor ky values determined for eggplant as 0 73 and 0 80 for di and sdi in the first and 0 69 and 0 63 for di and sdi in the second growing season respectively are depicted in fig 5 a b smaller ky values in the second year can be attributed to greater yields but slightly lower crop water use values it can be argued that the species which show a ky smaller than 1 0 tolerate water stress to a greater extent and they could be exposed to a water deficit which even if it determines a limited production decrease would allow a significant irrigation water saving and increase water productivity thus eggplant can be considered as tolerant to mild water stress since ky values are smaller than 1 0 şenyiğit et al 2011 reported yield response factor ky of 0 81 for eggplant under greenhouse conditions ertek et al 2006 determined ky as 0 60 for furrow irrigated eggplant in eastern turkey chartzoulakis and drosos 1995 found ky value of 0 9 for the total growing period in an unheated greenhouse in crete karam et al 2011 have given ky values of 0 55 and 1 18 for the experimental years lovelli et al 2007 reported ky value of 1 37 for eggplant under southern italy conditions the reason for difference between the two studies is that much lower eggplant yields but similar et values obtained in southern italy conditions in comparison to our results 3 6 plant height plant height values ranged from a lowest of 89 cm in sdi if6 prd50 to highest 128 cm in the di if3 fi in 2013 and varied from 90 cm in sdi if6 prd50 to 134 cm in the di if3 fi in 2014 in treatments table 2 irrigation intervals and regimes resulted in significantly different plant heights p 0 01 in 2013 and irrigation methods intervals and regimes resulted in significantly different plant height p 0 01 in 2014 table 3 the fi treatments with 3 day irrigation intervals in two years resulted in significantly higher plant height as compared with all other treatments water stress reduced eggplant plant height significantly in general as the amount of irrigation water applied decreased plant height decreased pirboneh et al 2012 observed the highest plant height with 6 day interval and was 52 3 higher in comparison with no irrigation in guilan iran kırnak et al 2002 also concluded that drought stress resulted in significant reduction in plant height of eggplant as compared with control treatment 3 7 fruit yield components and quality parameters fruit yield components and quality parameters such as fruit number mean fruit weight volume firmness ph fruit dry matter total soluble solid are presented in table 2 statistical analysis results on quality parameters of eggplant under different treatments in the experimental years are presented in table 3 irrigation regimes had a significantly different effect on quality parameters maximum fruit number fruit weight and volume were obtained from the if3fi surface drip plots in both experimental years irrigation methods intervals and regimes resulted in significantly different fruit number fruit weight and volume in general surface drip performance was better than subsurface drip considering quality of eggplants the fruit number varied from a low of 233 1000 ha 1 in sdi if6 prd50 treatment to 392 1000 ha 1 in di if3 fi in 2013 in 2014 greatest fruit number was obtained from the 458 1000 ha 1 in di if3 fi treatments and the lowest value was 339 1000 ha 1 in sdi if6 prd50 treatment results are consisted in the two experimental years same treatments both years díaz pérez and eaton 2015 reported that fruit number and fruit yields marketable and total were also lowest at 33 eta and there were little yield differences among irrigation rates higher than 33 eta in the southeastern united states the results revealed significant differences in mean fruit weight among treatments irrigation systems intervals and regimes resulted in significantly different fruit weight p 0 01 in 2013 and irrigation intervals and regimes resulted in significantly different fruit weight p 0 01 in 2014 as the amount of irrigation water increased fruit number weight and volume increased in both experimental years in general 3 day irrigation frequency resulted in greater fruit weight as compared to 6 day frequency smittle et al 1994 kırnak et al 2002 karam et al 2011 pirboneh et al 2012 and demirel et al 2014 reported that water stress resulted in a reduction of fruit lenght fruit volume and fruit width of eggplant the effect of irrigation systems intervals and regimes on fruit firmness was significantly different fruit firmness increased with increasing irrigation quantity in the second year but mixed effects were observed in the first year fi treatment resulted in the greatest fruit firmness values in the second year irrigation regimes resulted in significantly different fruit dry matter p 0 01 in the experimental years table 3 surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems had similar fruit dry matter in corresponding treatments the highest fruit dry matter values were obtained in deficit irrigation treatments while the lowest fruit dry matter value was obtained from the fi treatments interaction of irrigation intervals and irrigation regimes resulted in significantly different ph p 0 05 in 2013 and there was no significant difference between them in 2014 the highest ph value was obtained in if6di50 treatments while the lowest fruit ph value was recorded in the if3fi treatment similar results for fruit dry matter were obtained for total soluble solids tss tss values were significantly influenced by irrigation systems frequency and regimes and their triple interactions p 0 01 in 2013 in the second year similar results except the irrigation systems which resulted in no significant difference in tss mohawesh 2016 reported that the tss and titratable acidity increased significantly as the amount of irrigation water decreased from the 100 irrigation level to the 20 irrigation level in jordan kırnak et al 2002 reported that tss and titratable acidity increased with decreasing irrigation amounts karam et al 2011 stated a positive effect of water deficit on fruit dry matter content which is associated with flavour our results are in general agreement with the above mentioned research findings about the fruit quality parameters 3 8 economic evaluation an economic analysis was carried out by using averages of two year data based on investment operation and production costs and the results are presented in table 5 economic evaluation revealed that the maximum net income was generated as us 13 941 ha 1 with the full irrigation treatment under the surface drip with 3 day interval di if3fi treatment followed by sdi if3fi treatment the lowest net return was generated by sdi if6 prd50 treatment followed by di if6 prd50 lovelli et al 2007 showed that providing 100 of eta for eggplant growth was indeed the most profitable irrigation schedule kuşçu et al 2009 determined the maximum net return for eggplant as us 6188 for 80 replenishment of pan evaporation in the marmara region of turkey sezen et al 2015 reported similar findings for drip irrigated pepper in tarsus turkey it was noted that there was a considerable difference between irrigation intervals in net income among the irrigation regimes and irrigation methods in general as the amount of irrigation water applied increased net income also raised under both irrigation systems on the other hand in case of water scarcity if3di75 treatments resulted in significantly higher income compared to the other deficit irrigation treatments di50 resulted in significantly higher net income than the prd50 treatments even though these two treatments received the same amount of irrigation water in both drip systems in regions where access to the irrigation water is costly or water supply is less than demanded the if3di75 treatment could be a reasonable alternative in this study if3di75 treatment caused water saving of 25 in irrigation water resulted in 4 3 yield reduction but net income declined only 5 6 as compared to fi the results revealed that diif3fi treatment which generated the highest net income can be recommended for areas experiencing no water shortage 4 conclusions the results of the current study clearly demonstrated the significant effects of surface and subsurface drip systems irrigation intervals and regimes on total yield and quality of eggplant and also economic returns fi treatments under both di and sdi produced significantly greater yields than deficit irrigation treatments in the experimental years di50 produced significantly greater yield than prd50 under both drip systems even though prd50 and di50 received the same amount irrigation water three day irrigation frequency resulted in significantly greater yield than those in six day frequency in both drip systems in the experimental years the experimental findings indicate that water management is critically important in order to obtain higher yields of field grown eggplant under the mediterranean climatic conditions irrigation systems intervals and regimes all had a significantly different effect on quality parameters the results showed that surface drip resulted in higher eggplant yield than sdi by 7 3 and 11 for 3 day and 6 day irrigation frequency in 2013 but the two systems performed similarly in the second year it was concluded that both subsurface and surface drip irrigation if3 fi treatments are recommended under field conditions in order to obtain higher and better quality eggplant yield in the mediterranean region of turkey although the di75 treatments plots with 3 day irrigation interval received approximately 25 less water compared to the fi plots for both irrigation systems total yield was reduced by an average of 4 3 therefore considering water shortages in dry years deficit irrigation practices di75 can be suggested the results indicated that wp and iwp values decreased with increasing irrigation amounts for both drip systems it is suggested that high water productivity should be associated with high or acceptable yield particularly in water scarce areas however di50 and prd50 treatments with longer irrigation interval 6 days resulted in lower total eggplant yield and lower quality thus it is not recommended to use longer irrigation interval with moderate to high deficit irrigations for surface drip and subsurface drip irrigated eggplant production in the region the highest net income was obtained from the if3fi surface drip treatment followed by if3fi subsurface drip treatment it was observed that net income decreased with decreasing irrigation water compared with conventional deficit irrigation treatments prd50 with both drip systems generated the lowest net income therefore full irrigation with 3 day irrigation frequency under surface drip and subsurface drip can be recommended if there is no water shortage and in case of water scarcity di75 treatments with 3 day could be good alternative for obtaining high yield and economic returns acknowledgement the authors would like to thank the turkish scientific and technical research council tubitak for its financial support for the project tovag 112o870 
11422,micro irrigation has been claimed to be the world s most valued irrigation innovation however both its potential to save water and its adaptability to smallholders needs are being questioned while its energy requirement implies financial and environmental costs that are not affordable everywhere this paper contributes to this debate with a field performance assessment of smallholder micro irrigation systems in the baixo acaraú irrigation district ceará brazil and a novel analysis model that depicts the energy water yield nexus by linking irrigation performance with energy efficiency and yield gap irrigation system performance was evaluated in a sample of 40 family lots and compared to design performance in a fairly homogeneous subset of them pumping inefficiency and inappropriate filtering have been at the root of system deficiencies the great variability of irrigation performance indicated a wide margin for improvement and the possibility of using prominent farmers as benchmarks although there has been technology translation in the irrigation district that included local innovation in the filtering system the process has not been completed it is concluded that the adoption of foreign irrigation technology could be accelerated with the collaboration between local innovators and publicly supported irrigation advisory services using integrated performance assessment approaches like the one presented here keywords microirrigation smallholder energy efficiency irrigation efficiency brazil 1 introduction micro irrigation has become the world s most valued irrigation innovation due to its potential to save water and nutrients by applying the water slowly next to the plants drip irrigation has been widely adopted in countries like israel and spain postel et al 2001 foresaw drip irrigation kits designed for smallholder farmers as a new technology that could alleviate poverty in developing countries however both the potential of drip irrigation to save water van der kooij et al 2013 perry and steduto 2017 molle and tanouti 2017 birkenholtz 2017 and its adaptability to smallholders in poor regions wanvoeke et al 2015 venot et al 2018 are being questioned while field evidence shows that the actual performance of drip irrigation in the field often differs from that under controlled conditions benouniche et al 2014a new conceptual frameworks have allowed the bounding of the potential of irrigation technology to improve water use efficiency and productivity at farm scheme and basin scales e g mateos 2008 mateos and araus 2016 furthermore increasing irrigation efficiency and water productivity by shifting from gravity systems to pressurized systems that require energy is a water energy food trade off with regional and global consequences but also with great impact on smallholder production costs smallholder irrigation has been suggested as being a means to escape from the poverty trap burney et al 2013 in brazil substantial investment has been made by the government and international funding agencies to set up public smallholder irrigation schemes their performance however is highly variable gonçalves et al 2015 although they are viewed as important assets for rural development in the semiarid brazilian north east a region prone to droughts and suffering social problems by testing a number of different technologies and arrangements at the farm level burney et al 2014 have shown that interventions in the sertão the brazilian semiarid region focused on efficient irrigation systems can help reduce the dependence of production systems on climate this paper contributes to the debate on the role and performance of micro irrigation in smallholder farming by presenting and discussing an assessment of smallholder irrigation performance in the baixo acaraú irrigation district ceará brazil the assessment includes a novel irrigation system analysis approach based on the energy water yield nexus the latter describes the complex interactions between the natural resources and the human activities directed towards food production fao 2014 downscaling the concept to farm level may be an effective approach for improving irrigation management farmers might be more responsive to recommendations linking irrigation operation and maintenance with energy saving and yield enhancement than to the usual ones for improving irrigation efficiency 2 methods 2 1 the irrigation district the baixo acaraú irrigation district acronym in portuguese dibau is located in the semiarid brazilian north east in the state of ceará at latitude 3 7 s and longitude 40 5 w dibau has a tropical climate with dry summers and rainfall concentrated between january and may the mean annual rainfall is of 1300 mm soils are sandy or sandy loam dibau was constructed in 2002 by the national integration ministry later it was handed over to settlers who associated themselves under a water users association that manages the district dibau covers 8335 ha divided into 501 farm lots of varying sizes small 4 8 ha medium 16 18 ha and large 80 200 ha the majority of the farm lots are family ones of 8 ha the main crops are coconut 48 banana 18 guava 6 orange trees 5 and papaya 4 water is supplied to a main canal by a pumping station at the acaraú river to be distributed to the farmers through secondary open channels connected by gravity to small tanks at the entrance of the farm lots there the water is pressurized by pumping and filtered to be applied with micro irrigation systems mainly with micro sprinklers although drip trickle systems are also used for vegetables normally water is supplied on demand however limitations on water availability in the acaraú river basin during the study period led to rotation delivery schedules that restricted on farm water allocation although allowed high or relatively high irrigation frequency from daily to twice a week the performance assessment focused on the family lots the 8 ha lots are typically divided into 8 squared irrigation units fig 1 a constitutes a sketch of a family lot the first element of the irrigation system is a small tank and a water meter both belonging to the district these physical components are also managerial boundaries the scheme water users association manages the collective system upstream of the water meter while downstream is farmer s responsibility next are an electric motor driven pump a filter disc screen or artisanal type sometimes a fertigation system and generally an irrigation controller the system head is connected to the irrigation units by 100 mm diameter pvc pipe at the entrance of each irrigation unit there is a hydraulic valve operated from the irrigation controller irrigation is performed with drippers or micro sprinklers there are three possible layouts of the emitter laterals in relation to the manifold fig 1b 2 2 on farm observations the focus of the study were family lots thus a sample of 40 family lots was selected the selection was conditioned by the irrigation turn in a given lot and the availability of the evaluation team at the time of the turn therefore the farm lots evaluated were not chosen randomly but were representative of the family lots in the district they were homogeneous in size 8 ha irrigation system sectoring 8 units irrigation equipment provided by the national integration ministry when the lots were handed over to the current owners and access to water the research approach consisted of downscaling the energy water yield nexus to the farm level by evaluating each system component from upstream to downstream and linking component energy consumption to irrigation performance measurements at the system head motor pump filter main line and irrigation units allowed the characterization of actual system performance actual performance was compared to design performance estimated using the analysis model described in section 3 and both used to assess the impact of irrigation performance on yield section 2 3 first pressure and discharge at the pump outlet were measured using a manometer bratal work ranges from 0 to 4 and 6 bar brazil installed for the purpose and a portable ultrasonic flow meter pce instruments pce 100 h uk accuracy of 2 the flow rate at the district water meter was also recorded the evaluation team noted the motor and pump characteristics written on the respective plates so that they could find their specifications in manuals provided by the manufacturer next voltage v v and current intensity i a were measured using a digital clamp multimeter minipa et 3200 brazil accuracy of 3 in order to calculate the electric power used by the motor pm w 1 p m η 3 v i cos φ where η is motor efficiency and cosφ the power factor specified on the motor s plate simultaneously manometers bratal work ranges from 0 to 4 and 6 bar brazil installed for the purpose at every unit head were used to determine water head along the main line consistency of the readings was checked periodically by connecting all manometers simultaneously at the same point in the pipeline while discharge and pressure distribution were evaluated in one of the units in operation usually the one most downstream the unit evaluation procedure consisted of determining the discharge collecting water in a measuring cylinder during 30 s and pressure with bratal manometers at sixteen emitters merriam and keller 1978 the emitters were placed in the laterals at the inlet at the far end and at points one third and two thirds of the distance along the manifold four emitters were selected along each of these laterals at the inlet the far end and at points one third and two thirds of the distance between them finally during the field inspection the evaluation team noted any observation that could help to understand actual system performance and sketched 1 the system head elements their size and configuration 2 the layout of the whole farm lot 3 each irrigation unit noting emitter type and spacing crop plant spacing and estimates of crop and weed ground cover and 4 the elements and configuration of each unit head before and after the field inspection the evaluation team interviewed the farmer using a semi structured questionnaire that covered the system components their age operation maintenance irrigation turns and supply limitations use of the irrigation advisory service family members on the farm workers machinery produce and marketing as well as any other questions that could help to understand irrigation performance 2 3 analysis model an analysis model that integrated the farm lot irrigation system hydraulics from the pump to the emitters the yield response to irrigation and performance indicators based on model simulations and field observations was developed the model s hydraulics component uses standard equations it first calculates pressure at the pump outlet entering in the pump curve equation the discharge resulting from adding the nominal discharge of the emitters in the units in operation the pressure losses along the main pipe were calculated with the hazen williams equation 2 h f 10 67 q 1 852 c 1 852 d 4 871 l where hf is the head loss in m of water column over the length of pipe l m q is the flow rate m3 s 1 c is the pipe roughness coefficient and d is the inside pipe diameter m minor head losses at each system component along the suction and discharge pipes were estimated by multiplying a component specific friction coefficient by a kinetic energy term considering flow velocity at the corresponding location head losses in the irrigation units were calculated using a combination of the darcy weisbach and blasius equations keller and bliesner 1990 p 523 taking into account the emitter connection friction loss as an equivalent length of the lateral 3 h f 7 89 10 4 q 1 75 d 4 75 s s f 1 s where s m is the spacing between emitter connections along the lateral or between lateral connections along the manifold and f1 m is the emitter or lateral connection loss as an equivalent length of lateral or manifold respectively as in mateos 2006 the model then recalculates the emitter flow rate as a function of the calculated pressure head using the discharge equation 4 q k 1 h x where h m is the pressure head at the emitter x non dimensional the discharge exponent and k1 ls 1 m x the discharge coefficient the calculation of the emitter pressure and discharge distributions in the units in operation is repeated until convergence is achieved the resulting total discharge is then used to recalculate the pressure head at the pump outlet and the system pressure distribution is computed again eqs 2 4 until convergence is achieved therefore the computation of the model hydraulics component consists of several iteration loops one for each unit in operation nested in the system iteration loop finally hydraulic power p w along the system was calculated as 5 p ρ g q h where ρ is water density g the acceleration due to gravity and q and h correspond to the specific point along the system where p is calculated the yield response to irrigation model component was that proposed by wu 1988 briefly it is derived from the linear yield response to crop evapotranspiration doorenbos and kassam 1979 6 1 y y m k y 1 e t e t m where ym and y are the respective maximum and actual yields etm and et are the respective maximum and actual evapotranspiration and ky is a yield response factor representing the effect of a reduction in evapotranspiration on yields et is calculated as 7 e t e w r where r is the effective rainfall w is the applied irrigation and e is the irrigation efficiency the combination of eqs 6 and 7 results in 8 1 y y m k y 1 e w r w m r where wm is the net irrigation requirement for maximum yield on the other hand e depends on the application uniformity and the relative irrigation supply 9 w w w m it could be assumed that wm is obtained by applying the nominal discharge qnom while w results from the actual discharge qavg then a subrogate of w would be the relative discharge rate rdr 10 r d r w q a v g q n o m if the water applied is assumed to follow a uniform frequency distribution then e can be expressed as wu 1988 11a e 1 1 w a b 2 a 11b e a w 1 2 4 w 4 a 1 w 2 a 1 w a b 2 a 11c e 1 w 1 w a where a and b are related b 2 2a and represent the distribution uniformity of the water applied in fact a can be calculated as a function of the coefficient of variation cv of the applied water or of the du warrick 1983 12 a 1 3 c v 1 3 100 d u 130 where du is defined as the ratio of the mean irrigation depth in the quarter of the field receiving less water 4 emitters according to the evaluation protocol and the mean irrigation depth mean of 16 measurements in the evaluation procedure expressed as a percentage the analysis model was programmed specifically for the characteristics of the dibau family lots however it does not require any complex computations and can be programmed on a spreadsheet so that its adaptation to the layout and configuration of similar farm lots would not be difficult 2 4 performance indicators there is a need for energy at the entrance of the system in order to ensure a minimum pressure at the emitters so their relative discharge variation is kept below the level that would provoke crop heterogeneity the design s objective is to minimize the energy requirement at the system s entrance while meeting the uniformity criterion operation and maintenance should aim to maintain the design performance therefore their performance assessment could be based on indicators that quantify energy loss at the different system components in relation to allowable design loss that is the aim of the indicators that follow these indicators added to others also reflecting the effects of the energy loss defined above i e du eq 10 rdr and relative yield loss eq 8 pump efficiency ep 13 e p

the discharge measured according to the manufacturer s catalogue this indicator makes the performance of pumps of models with different efficiency curves comparable ratio of actual to design power at the system entrance 15 r a d p m p d e s i g n where pm is calculated from eq 1 while pdesign is calculated applying the analysis model considering the sectors in operation at the evaluation time the power losses calculated for the actual discharge and head at each system component are subtracted from the power losses calculated with the analysis model and divided by the power measured at the system s entrance positive values are named relative power excess rpei for the component concerned i and negative values relative power deficit rpdi rpei represents the fraction of power that could be saved under optimal operation conditions of the system component i while rpdi indicates the fraction of extra power that should be consumed for the correct operation of the specific system component application of the analysis model and computation of performance indicators required detailed characterization of the irrigation system and intensive measurement of several variables in some lots some system characteristics could not be determined e g diameter of buried pipe motor pump specifications or some variables could not be measured e g voltage and current intensity at the motor pump therefore the analysis model could be applied only to 26 farm lots 3 results 3 1 application of the analysis model in this section we present the application of the analysis model to two typical but contrasting farm irrigation systems measured and simulated pressure head along the pipeline and in the irrigation unit under operation are shown in diagrams where their divergences can be visualized another diagram will present the virtual effect that actual operation could have on yield and it is compared with estimated yield for the design condition performance of each system and their components are summarized using indicators in terms of relative energy use farm lot c06 3 grew banana in units 1 6 the pump was centrifugal model ksb megabloc 40160r with impeller diameter of 151 mm the filter was of the artisanal type the farmer rotated irrigation from unit to unit with only one unit under irrigation at a given time unit 6 at the evaluation time the banana plants were irrigated with micro sprinklers model plasnova rotor brown fig 2 a compares the actual pressure measured along the system with the pressure simulated by the analysis model for the design condition it is observed that already at the pumping station pressure was below that expected this difference was compensated for after the filter because the artisanal filter causes a very small head loss pressure along the main line decreased a little further in the actual condition than in the design condition it would seem that the hydraulic valve at the unit entrance provoked higher head losses than expected and for some reason e g laterals deformation deposits of particles or organic material in manifold and laterals laterals and emitters connectors head losses within the unit were higher than expected as a result emitters average discharge was considerably lesser for the actual condition rdr 0 59 than for the design condition rdr 1 07 as can be seen in fig 2b that represents the manufacturer head discharge curve for unit 6 considering its specific micro sprinklers and displays the actual head discharge data points for the 16 emitters evaluated in the unit the range of variation of emitter discharge is in this case consistent with the range of variation of head at the emitters while the scatter could be due to emitter clogging fig 2c idealizes the effect of this performance on yield loss the solid line corresponds to the high uniformity du 94 of the design condition while the dashed line corresponds to the very poor du 48 of the actual condition the yield reduction for the actual condition compared to the design condition was 43 this would be a considerable yield gap if the same irrigation performance continued throughout the entire irrigation season the ratio rad pm pdesign was 0 96 fig 3 a the design condition generated a greater discharge and pressure than the actual condition although this was achieved with a greater pump efficiency 72 vs 67 about 19 of the power actually used could be saved fig 3a partly at the pump but also along the main line at the unit head and within the unit fig 3b while it would be advisable to increase the power used by 5 fig 3a mainly for proper filtering fig 3c the power loss excess was responsible for the low actual rdr while the unacceptable actual du was likely due to poor filtering this is supported by fig 2b which depicts the manufacturer s head discharge curve for the particular micro sprinkler installed in unit 6 and the 16 head discharge data pairs observed during the evaluation several emitter discharge values were less than the manufacturer s curve value for the actual head a symptom of emitter clogging although also of the mixing of different micro sprinkler types farm lot c50 2 grew guava trees the pump was centrifugal model king c8 e10 with impeller diameter of 168 mm there was a disc filter at the system head but the disc rings had been removed 2 of the 8 units were under irrigation at the evaluation time the guava trees were irrigated with auto compensating micro sprinklers model netafim supernet lr red pump efficiency was 51 whereas it should be 82 for the design condition the head at the pump outlet was therefore notably less than expected so the pressure at the emitters fig 4 a although fairly uniform between 16 and 17 m was a little lower than the manufacturer recommended working pressure range of 20 40 m of water column given the pressure compensating feature of the micro sprinklers the low pressure had little effect on the mean discharge rdr 0 97 fig 4b and yield fig 4c although the actual du 82 could cause a yield reduction of 6 with respect to the design condition du 100 the ratio rad pm pdesign was 1 46 fig 5 a due to the low pumping efficiency under the actual condition the farmer could potentially save about 57 of the energy actually consumed fig 5a mainly in the pump fig 5b while he should use a small additional amount of energy fig 5a for filtering fig 5c which in this case was estimated to be 2 m the head discharge data pairs for the micro sprinkler evaluated were in a wide range of discharges and a narrow range of pressure fig 4b indicating clogging likely due to the lack of filtering the performance of farm lots c06 3 and c50 2 showed a contrast in the sense that in the former the right amount of energy was used inefficiently causing a significant yield penalty while in the latter an excess of energy used inefficiently resulted in an excessive energy cost but saved the yield filtering was inadequate in both cases although its estimated effect on yield was more significant in farm lot c06 3 than in c50 2 the next section extends this type of analysis to all farm lots evaluated using performance indicators 3 2 performance variability among farm lots overall the on farm water meters worked rather well fig 6 which gave us confidence in the fairness of charging irrigation costs proportionally to water consumption however some of the water meters were blocked by debris or fish that arrived with the canal water this was one of the first problems detected and one recommendation to pass on to the district the screens protecting the entrance to the farm tanks were often broken and the pumping station did not have any type of detritus rake or filter to prevent the entry of foreign matter such as debris and fish all motors had a rated power of 10 kw except two which had 12 2 kw and all the pumps were centrifugal the most common pump makes were inapi model 12dlc 3500 rpm impeller of 168 mm ksb model megabloc 40160r with impellers of 151 160 or 174 mm king model c10r 3500 rpm impeller of 179 mm and imbil model 40125 3500 rpm impeller of 133 mm although other pump models were found the year of acquisition of the pumps varied from 2003 to 2012 pump efficiency varied greatly from farm lot to farm lot fig 7 ep was less than 50 in 17 out of the 37 farm lots where it could be determined when compared to the corresponding efficiency in the head efficiency curve given in the pump manufacturer s catalogue catalogues were available for 26 models of the 37 evaluated only two pumps had the efficiency in the catalogue curve fig 8 shows the operation point on the h q fig 8a and ep q fig 8b planes for the 10 model inapi pumps evaluated the operation data points were at varying distances from the catalogue curves that enveloped the points cloud the lowest ep in the inapi data set was 35 while according to the catalogue curve it should be 70 for the same pump h was 27 2 m whereas it should be 49 5 m according to the discharge measured although all the pumps of this model had ep of below the attainable efficiency some performed relatively well assuming that the right motor pump was selected pumping efficiency may be below expectation because differences between design and actual operation conditions and or deterioration of motor pump components due to poor maintenance proper maintenance should include lubrication of the line shaft grease of pump head and electric motor bearings and periodic adjustment of impeller packing glands and pump shaft seals duke 2007 the majority of the farmers interviewed declared not to do this maintenance the irrigation system analysis model that could be applied to 26 farm lots showed that an excess of power was used in all but one of the motor pumps fig 9 the average excess of power 2 2 kw represented about 25 of the average power consumed according to our measurements this is a significant amount although it could be an overestimation of the actual attainable value note that the pump curves displayed in the catalogues were determined in a controlled ambient using brand new pumps for instance the dashed curve that envelops the head discharge data points in fig 8a drawn by eye imitating the curve of the catalogue until touching the observed data points could be more realistic for field conditions than the catalogue curve although it still shows that many pumps were well below the attainable frontier this is also evident in fig 8b in which the pump efficiency discharge data points and manufacturer s curve are depicted all the farmers found that the filters installed in the farm lots when the district was constructed were inadequate for filtering the water of the acaraú river as mentioned before the district lacks any cleaning equipment at the river pumping station moreover the filters initially installed at the farm lots were disc or screen filters of a smaller size than the one needed farmers struggled to keep them clean maintaining an adequate pressure and removing particles that could clog the emitters many farmers decided to remove the filters thus worsening emitter clogging in 2012 a farmer from the region developed what is locally known as an artisanal filter it is like a screen filter made of two concentric pvc tubes with the internal one perforated by hand to about 230 mesh fig 10 in 2014 only 4 farmers still used screen or disc filters 15 farmers did not have any filters at all and 19 farmers had acquired the artisanal filter fig 11 contrary to the motor pumps excess of power consumption at the filter was detected in only 6 of the 26 systems where the analysis model was applied fig 12 in this set of 6 were the 4 systems with disc or screen filters with the 1 4 kw consumed in one of the screen filters standing out the power consumption was more than adequate for good operation conditions in only 2 of the 17 artisanal filters in the same sample the other 15 consumed an amount of power likely to be less than necessary for proper filtering it was assumed that a pressure drop of 2 m is adequate for most micro irrigation filters that surely occurred in the remaining 5 systems where there was no filter fig 13 a shows the unit distribution uniformity found in the district du was over 80 in only 16 out of the 40 lots evaluated over 80 for du is considered to be acceptable or good while du 80 is poor or very poor for this kind of irrigation system part of this poor uniformity could be due to low pressure distribution uniformity however more than half of the lots had a pressure distribution uniformity dup of over 80 fig 13b and there was no relationship between pressure and discharge distribution uniformities fig 14 emitter clogging could be another cause of low du in fact the field inspections of the emitters revealed that the membrane of the auto compensating ones was often covered with fine particles and organic material or the farmer had removed the membrane when s he observed that the emitters were obstructed the farmers who used the artisanal filter said that they were happy with their new filters arguing that they could considerably reduce washing frequency however when asked about emitter clogging they answered that they have to check and clean emitters every one to three weeks du ranged between 94 and 100 under the design condition of the 26 systems analysed while it took on values as low as 19 in the actual condition fig 15 on average du was 98 and 72 respectively the mean relative irrigation discharge was 1 05 and 0 73 for the design and actual conditions respectively with more variability in the actual than in the design condition fig 16 the objective should be rdr near unity while rdr 0 73 indicates an insufficient water supply if the system operates continually in this way the notable uniformity gap together with the commonly low actual rdr lead to a yield gap that is also considerable fig 17 while under design conditions potential yield could be achieved virtually in all the farm lots average relative yield under actual conditions was estimated to be only 0 75 with values as low as 0 48 but some farm lots performed well with an estimated actual relative yield as high as the design yield 4 discussion most irrigation advisory services focus on providing irrigation recommendations and evaluating distribution uniformity smith and muñoz 2002 surveys on distribution uniformity have shown great variability among farmers benouniche et al 2014a reported du between 12 and 93 in 22 field evaluations of drip irrigation systems in morocco that variability and the occurrence of poorly performing micro irrigation systems were also found in countries where irrigation is more advanced for instance hanson et al 1995 reported that the average du of hand move solid set sprinklers and micro irrigation systems in california was overall less than that of furrow or border irrigation in central spain the uniformity of drip irrigation systems found by ortega et al 2005 was in general greater than the uniformity of solid set sprinkler systems but the variability among installations was quite large therefore the frequency distribution of du presented in fig 13a is not surprising the challenge here lies in understanding the reasons for poor performance and identifying the measures to improve it which goes beyond the usual irrigation advisory services benouniche et al 2014a were able to explain the actual irrigation performance of a heterogeneous set of drip irrigation systems in morocco by linking irrigation efficiency and distribution uniformity with the socio economic logic of the farmers who operated those systems our assessment was constrained to family farm lots a fairly homogeneous group so that actual performance variability was likely to be related to technical rather than socio economic reasons the first concern could be whether micro irrigation was the appropriate election for dibau wanvoeke et al 2015 argued that smallholder drip irrigation gained popularity in sub saharan africa not because of what the technology brings to farmers but because of spurious interests in dibau the crops envisaged were tropical fruit trees and vegetables soils are mainly sandy the plots are small and the aim was to supply water on demand these are the physical and agronomical characteristics into which micro irrigation fits better than surface or sprinkler irrigation burt et al 2000 however it may still happen that technology translation garb and friedlander 2014 did not flow fluently certainly the filters initially installed at the family farm lots did not have the capacity to clean the required flow of water with the particular quality of the acaraú river thus many farmers removed the filter from the irrigation system head although suppliers and dealers of irrigation material and equipment are present in the region the response to this flaw was not immediate it only arrived in 2012 and as a local innovation when a farmer developed what it is locally known as artisanal filter this farmer changed from farming to the new business of constructing and selling the artisanal filter the filter was evolved from faulty prototypes to the current model described above an exemplary case of an irrigation innovation process reached through bricolage benouniche et al 2014b therefore we believe that micro irrigation was the appropriate election among the available technologies however while the farmers interviewed declared that they were happy with the new filter our research revealed that the technology translation process is still incomplete filtration performance of the artisanal filter is not yet sufficient as inferred from the low du fig 13a from the lack of correlation between emitter discharge and pressure distribution uniformities fig 14 and above all from the farmer s interviews and emitter field inspections insufficient filtering exacerbated by the chemical composition of the water the ph of about 8 and the high concentration of carbonates and bicarbonate may cause precipitation of carbonates in the pipes and emitters causes emitter clogging low application uniformity and yield losses we claim here that an open innovation environment facilitates local innovation and co evolution poncet et al 2010 however the process and the adoption of foreign technology could be accelerated with the intervention at the local level of public or publicly supported services a similar recommendation has been made in a recent study on drip irrigation adoption in california taylor and zilberman 2017 for instance evaluation of the artisanal filter using international standards international organization for standardization iso 2013 could be carried out by irrigation testing laboratories specialized irrigation advisory services or research centres opening new ways of thinking of public support to local innovations this type of testing would guarantee quality and would likely enhance and catalyse local innovation a structure including an irrigation advisory service and an irrigation testing laboratory was set up in the acaraú valley with the participation of public academic institutions and a non profit enterprise unfortunately despite its initial success and farmers acceptance córcoles et al 2016 the structure did not last due to non sustained support irrigation energy is a global multifaceted concern that we found to be a very relevant issue in dibau pumping inefficiency contributed to poor irrigation performance and unnecessary production costs considering that on farm energy is the largest component of the irrigation bill in dibau farmers district managers and the irrigation advisory service were unaware of the magnitude of pumping inefficiency and its economic effects irrigation energy auditing is becoming increasingly common in developed countries rocamora et al 2013 although both assessment and research have focused on a network level rodríguez díaz et al 2009 for instance evaluation of the pumps in the collective network of dibau was carried out by córcoles et al 2016 our results recommend conducting irrigation energy assessment also at a farm scale extensive pumping efficiency has been carried out on farms in the us central plains hla and scherer 2001 krantz 2010 however we are not aware of any extensive assessment of smallholder irrigation energy efficiency like the one reported in this paper the existence of motor pumps performing well promotes the use of benchmarking for participatory learning and improvement lozano and mateos 2008 borgia et al 2013 for instance when all the pump models were pooled using the ratio between the actual efficiency and the catalogue pump efficiency for the actual discharge and the resulting indicator was depicted against the year of pump acquisition available for 16 of the 40 evaluated the relative efficiency indicator was found to range from 40 to 100 fig 18 this indicated that some pumps operated satisfactorily and implied that others gave a very poor performance there was no correlation between the pump age and the relative efficiency indicator thus thorough pump inspection maintenance and repair has to be carried out individually and as a system component but it can focus on the poor performing systems 5 conclusions the analysis model developed in this work depicts the energy water yield nexus by linking energy efficiency upstream and yield gap downstream with irrigation performance the performance assessment of smallholder irrigation systems in dibau based on the analysis model and field measurements helped to diagnose the causes of the deficiencies detected revealed undetected ones and linked underperformance with yield loss and energy cost the high performance variability found among the smallholder irrigators indicates a large margin for improvement and suggests the use of best farmers as benchmarks in a participatory learning process following a systemic performance assessment primary causes of systems underperformance were pumping inefficiency and inappropriate filtering although there has been technology translation through local innovation in the filtering system the process has not been completed because of lack of technical knowledge the collaboration between public advisory services and local innovators artisans will accelerate the fine tuning of technologies and their adoption although our analysis model was designed specifically for the family lots of dibau it was meant to be an archetype for similar smallholder irrigation farming systems in brazil and other countries we believe that farmers will be more responsive to recommendations based on the energy water yield nexus approach than to the usual water use efficiency ones acknowledgements we greatly appreciate the work of the team who conducted the field evaluations we also acknowledge the interest and kindness of the dibau farmers whose irrigation systems were evaluated the study was funded by the project bases científicas do assessoramento na

11422,micro irrigation has been claimed to be the world s most valued irrigation innovation however both its potential to save water and its adaptability to smallholders needs are being questioned while its energy requirement implies financial and environmental costs that are not affordable everywhere this paper contributes to this debate with a field performance assessment of smallholder micro irrigation systems in the baixo acaraú irrigation district ceará brazil and a novel analysis model that depicts the energy water yield nexus by linking irrigation performance with energy efficiency and yield gap irrigation system performance was evaluated in a sample of 40 family lots and compared to design performance in a fairly homogeneous subset of them pumping inefficiency and inappropriate filtering have been at the root of system deficiencies the great variability of irrigation performance indicated a wide margin for improvement and the possibility of using prominent farmers as benchmarks although there has been technology translation in the irrigation district that included local innovation in the filtering system the process has not been completed it is concluded that the adoption of foreign irrigation technology could be accelerated with the collaboration between local innovators and publicly supported irrigation advisory services using integrated performance assessment approaches like the one presented here keywords microirrigation smallholder energy efficiency irrigation efficiency brazil 1 introduction micro irrigation has become the world s most valued irrigation innovation due to its potential to save water and nutrients by applying the water slowly next to the plants drip irrigation has been widely adopted in countries like israel and spain postel et al 2001 foresaw drip irrigation kits designed for smallholder farmers as a new technology that could alleviate poverty in developing countries however both the potential of drip irrigation to save water van der kooij et al 2013 perry and steduto 2017 molle and tanouti 2017 birkenholtz 2017 and its adaptability to smallholders in poor regions wanvoeke et al 2015 venot et al 2018 are being questioned while field evidence shows that the actual performance of drip irrigation in the field often differs from that under controlled conditions benouniche et al 2014a new conceptual frameworks have allowed the bounding of the potential of irrigation technology to improve water use efficiency and productivity at farm scheme and basin scales e g mateos 2008 mateos and araus 2016 furthermore increasing irrigation efficiency and water productivity by shifting from gravity systems to pressurized systems that require energy is a water energy food trade off with regional and global consequences but also with great impact on smallholder production costs smallholder irrigation has been suggested as being a means to escape from the poverty trap burney et al 2013 in brazil substantial investment has been made by the government and international funding agencies to set up public smallholder irrigation schemes their performance however is highly variable gonçalves et al 2015 although they are viewed as important assets for rural development in the semiarid brazilian north east a region prone to droughts and suffering social problems by testing a number of different technologies and arrangements at the farm level burney et al 2014 have shown that interventions in the sertão the brazilian semiarid region focused on efficient irrigation systems can help reduce the dependence of production systems on climate this paper contributes to the debate on the role and performance of micro irrigation in smallholder farming by presenting and discussing an assessment of smallholder irrigation performance in the baixo acaraú irrigation district ceará brazil the assessment includes a novel irrigation system analysis approach based on the energy water yield nexus the latter describes the complex interactions between the natural resources and the human activities directed towards food production fao 2014 downscaling the concept to farm level may be an effective approach for improving irrigation management farmers might be more responsive to recommendations linking irrigation operation and maintenance with energy saving and yield enhancement than to the usual ones for improving irrigation efficiency 2 methods 2 1 the irrigation district the baixo acaraú irrigation district acronym in portuguese dibau is located in the semiarid brazilian north east in the state of ceará at latitude 3 7 s and longitude 40 5 w dibau has a tropical climate with dry summers and rainfall concentrated between january and may the mean annual rainfall is of 1300 mm soils are sandy or sandy loam dibau was constructed in 2002 by the national integration ministry later it was handed over to settlers who associated themselves under a water users association that manages the district dibau covers 8335 ha divided into 501 farm lots of varying sizes small 4 8 ha medium 16 18 ha and large 80 200 ha the majority of the farm lots are family ones of 8 ha the main crops are coconut 48 banana 18 guava 6 orange trees 5 and papaya 4 water is supplied to a main canal by a pumping station at the acaraú river to be distributed to the farmers through secondary open channels connected by gravity to small tanks at the entrance of the farm lots there the water is pressurized by pumping and filtered to be applied with micro irrigation systems mainly with micro sprinklers although drip trickle systems are also used for vegetables normally water is supplied on demand however limitations on water availability in the acaraú river basin during the study period led to rotation delivery schedules that restricted on farm water allocation although allowed high or relatively high irrigation frequency from daily to twice a week the performance assessment focused on the family lots the 8 ha lots are typically divided into 8 squared irrigation units fig 1 a constitutes a sketch of a family lot the first element of the irrigation system is a small tank and a water meter both belonging to the district these physical components are also managerial boundaries the scheme water users association manages the collective system upstream of the water meter while downstream is farmer s responsibility next are an electric motor driven pump a filter disc screen or artisanal type sometimes a fertigation system and generally an irrigation controller the system head is connected to the irrigation units by 100 mm diameter pvc pipe at the entrance of each irrigation unit there is a hydraulic valve operated from the irrigation controller irrigation is performed with drippers or micro sprinklers there are three possible layouts of the emitter laterals in relation to the manifold fig 1b 2 2 on farm observations the focus of the study were family lots thus a sample of 40 family lots was selected the selection was conditioned by the irrigation turn in a given lot and the availability of the evaluation team at the time of the turn therefore the farm lots evaluated were not chosen randomly but were representative of the family lots in the district they were homogeneous in size 8 ha irrigation system sectoring 8 units irrigation equipment provided by the national integration ministry when the lots were handed over to the current owners and access to water the research approach consisted of downscaling the energy water yield nexus to the farm level by evaluating each system component from upstream to downstream and linking component energy consumption to irrigation performance measurements at the system head motor pump filter main line and irrigation units allowed the characterization of actual system performance actual performance was compared to design performance estimated using the analysis model described in section 3 and both used to assess the impact of irrigation performance on yield section 2 3 first pressure and discharge at the pump outlet were measured using a manometer bratal work ranges from 0 to 4 and 6 bar brazil installed for the purpose and a portable ultrasonic flow meter pce instruments pce 100 h uk accuracy of 2 the flow rate at the district water meter was also recorded the evaluation team noted the motor and pump characteristics written on the respective plates so that they could find their specifications in manuals provided by the manufacturer next voltage v v and current intensity i a were measured using a digital clamp multimeter minipa et 3200 brazil accuracy of 3 in order to calculate the electric power used by the motor pm w 1 p m η 3 v i cos φ where η is motor efficiency and cosφ the power factor specified on the motor s plate simultaneously manometers bratal work ranges from 0 to 4 and 6 bar brazil installed for the purpose at every unit head were used to determine water head along the main line consistency of the readings was checked periodically by connecting all manometers simultaneously at the same point in the pipeline while discharge and pressure distribution were evaluated in one of the units in operation usually the one most downstream the unit evaluation procedure consisted of determining the discharge collecting water in a measuring cylinder during 30 s and pressure with bratal manometers at sixteen emitters merriam and keller 1978 the emitters were placed in the laterals at the inlet at the far end and at points one third and two thirds of the distance along the manifold four emitters were selected along each of these laterals at the inlet the far end and at points one third and two thirds of the distance between them finally during the field inspection the evaluation team noted any observation that could help to understand actual system performance and sketched 1 the system head elements their size and configuration 2 the layout of the whole farm lot 3 each irrigation unit noting emitter type and spacing crop plant spacing and estimates of crop and weed ground cover and 4 the elements and configuration of each unit head before and after the field inspection the evaluation team interviewed the farmer using a semi structured questionnaire that covered the system components their age operation maintenance irrigation turns and supply limitations use of the irrigation advisory service family members on the farm workers machinery produce and marketing as well as any other questions that could help to understand irrigation performance 2 3 analysis model an analysis model that integrated the farm lot irrigation system hydraulics from the pump to the emitters the yield response to irrigation and performance indicators based on model simulations and field observations was developed the model s hydraulics component uses standard equations it first calculates pressure at the pump outlet entering in the pump curve equation the discharge resulting from adding the nominal discharge of the emitters in the units in operation the pressure losses along the main pipe were calculated with the hazen williams equation 2 h f 10 67 q 1 852 c 1 852 d 4 871 l where hf is the head loss in m of water column over the length of pipe l m q is the flow rate m3 s 1 c is the pipe roughness coefficient and d is the inside pipe diameter m minor head losses at each system component along the suction and discharge pipes were estimated by multiplying a component specific friction coefficient by a kinetic energy term considering flow velocity at the corresponding location head losses in the irrigation units were calculated using a combination of the darcy weisbach and blasius equations keller and bliesner 1990 p 523 taking into account the emitter connection friction loss as an equivalent length of the lateral 3 h f 7 89 10 4 q 1 75 d 4 75 s s f 1 s where s m is the spacing between emitter connections along the lateral or between lateral connections along the manifold and f1 m is the emitter or lateral connection loss as an equivalent length of lateral or manifold respectively as in mateos 2006 the model then recalculates the emitter flow rate as a function of the calculated pressure head using the discharge equation 4 q k 1 h x where h m is the pressure head at the emitter x non dimensional the discharge exponent and k1 ls 1 m x the discharge coefficient the calculation of the emitter pressure and discharge distributions in the units in operation is repeated until convergence is achieved the resulting total discharge is then used to recalculate the pressure head at the pump outlet and the system pressure distribution is computed again eqs 2 4 until convergence is achieved therefore the computation of the model hydraulics component consists of several iteration loops one for each unit in operation nested in the system iteration loop finally hydraulic power p w along the system was calculated as 5 p ρ g q h where ρ is water density g the acceleration due to gravity and q and h correspond to the specific point along the system where p is calculated the yield response to irrigation model component was that proposed by wu 1988 briefly it is derived from the linear yield response to crop evapotranspiration doorenbos and kassam 1979 6 1 y y m k y 1 e t e t m where ym and y are the respective maximum and actual yields etm and et are the respective maximum and actual evapotranspiration and ky is a yield response factor representing the effect of a reduction in evapotranspiration on yields et is calculated as 7 e t e w r where r is the effective rainfall w is the applied irrigation and e is the irrigation efficiency the combination of eqs 6 and 7 results in 8 1 y y m k y 1 e w r w m r where wm is the net irrigation requirement for maximum yield on the other hand e depends on the application uniformity and the relative irrigation supply 9 w w w m it could be assumed that wm is obtained by applying the nominal discharge qnom while w results from the actual discharge qavg then a subrogate of w would be the relative discharge rate rdr 10 r d r w q a v g q n o m if the water applied is assumed to follow a uniform frequency distribution then e can be expressed as wu 1988 11a e 1 1 w a b 2 a 11b e a w 1 2 4 w 4 a 1 w 2 a 1 w a b 2 a 11c e 1 w 1 w a where a and b are related b 2 2a and represent the distribution uniformity of the water applied in fact a can be calculated as a function of the coefficient of variation cv of the applied water or of the du warrick 1983 12 a 1 3 c v 1 3 100 d u 130 where du is defined as the ratio of the mean irrigation depth in the quarter of the field receiving less water 4 emitters according to the evaluation protocol and the mean irrigation depth mean of 16 measurements in the evaluation procedure expressed as a percentage the analysis model was programmed specifically for the characteristics of the dibau family lots however it does not require any complex computations and can be programmed on a spreadsheet so that its adaptation to the layout and configuration of similar farm lots would not be difficult 2 4 performance indicators there is a need for energy at the entrance of the system in order to ensure a minimum pressure at the emitters so their relative discharge variation is kept below the level that would provoke crop heterogeneity the design s objective is to minimize the energy requirement at the system s entrance while meeting the uniformity criterion operation and maintenance should aim to maintain the design performance therefore their performance assessment could be based on indicators that quantify energy loss at the different system components in relation to allowable design loss that is the aim of the indicators that follow these indicators added to others also reflecting the effects of the energy loss defined above i e du eq 10 rdr and relative yield loss eq 8 pump efficiency ep 13 e p

saved under optimal operation conditions of the system component i while rpdi indicates the fraction of extra power that should be consumed for the correct operation of the specific system component application of the analysis model and computation of performance indicators required detailed characterization of the irrigation system and intensive measurement of several variables in some lots some system characteristics could not be determined e g diameter of buried pipe motor pump specifications or some variables could not be measured e g voltage and current intensity at the motor pump therefore the analysis model could be applied only to 26 farm lots 3 results 3 1 application of the analysis model in this section we present the application of the analysis model to two typical but contrasting farm irrigation systems measured and simulated pressure head along the pipeline and in the irrigation unit under operation are shown in diagrams where their divergences can be visualized another diagram will present the virtual effect that actual operation could have on yield and it is compared with estimated yield for the design condition performance of each system and their components are summarized using indicators in terms of relative energy use farm lot c06 3 grew banana in units 1 6 the pump was centrifugal model ksb megabloc 40160r with impeller diameter of 151 mm the filter was of the artisanal type the farmer rotated irrigation from unit to unit with only one unit under irrigation at a given time unit 6 at the evaluation time the banana plants were irrigated with micro sprinklers model plasnova rotor brown fig 2 a compares the actual pressure measured along the system with the pressure simulated by the analysis model for the design condition it is observed that already at the pumping station pressure was below that expected this difference was compensated for after the filter because the artisanal filter causes a very small head loss pressure along the main line decreased a little further in the actual condition than in the design condition it would seem that the hydraulic valve at the unit entrance provoked higher head losses than expected and for some reason e g laterals deformation deposits of particles or organic material in manifold and laterals laterals and emitters connectors head losses within the unit were higher than expected as a result emitters average discharge was considerably lesser for the actual condition rdr 0 59 than for the design condition rdr 1 07 as can be seen in fig 2b that represents the manufacturer head discharge curve for unit 6 considering its specific micro sprinklers and displays the actual head discharge data points for the 16 emitters evaluated in the unit the range of variation of emitter discharge is in this case consistent with the range of variation of head at the emitters while the scatter could be due to emitter clogging fig 2c idealizes the effect of this performance on yield loss the solid line corresponds to the high uniformity du 94 of the design condition while the dashed line corresponds to the very poor du 48 of the actual condition the yield reduction for the actual condition compared to the design condition was 43 this would be a considerable yield gap if the same irrigation performance continued throughout the entire irrigation season the ratio rad pm pdesign was 0 96 fig 3 a the design condition generated a greater discharge and pressure than the actual condition although this was achieved with a greater pump efficiency 72 vs 67 about 19 of the power actually used could be saved fig 3a partly at the pump but also along the main line at the unit head and within the unit fig 3b while it would be advisable to increase the power used by 5 fig 3a mainly for proper filtering fig 3c the power loss excess was responsible for the low actual rdr while the unacceptable actual du was likely due to poor filtering this is supported by fig 2b which depicts the manufacturer s head discharge curve for the particular micro sprinkler installed in unit 6 and the 16 head discharge data pairs observed during the evaluation several emitter discharge values were less than the manufacturer s curve value for the actual head a symptom of emitter clogging although also of the mixing of different micro sprinkler types farm lot c50 2 grew guava trees the pump was centrifugal model king c8 e10 with impeller diameter of 168 mm there was a disc filter at the system head but the disc rings had been removed 2 of the 8 units were under irrigation at the evaluation time the guava trees were irrigated with auto compensating micro sprinklers model netafim supernet lr red pump efficiency was 51 whereas it should be 82 for the design condition the head at the pump outlet was therefore notably less than expected so the pressure at the emitters fig 4 a although fairly uniform between 16 and 17 m was a little lower than the manufacturer recommended working pressure range of 20 40 m of water column given the pressure compensating feature of the micro sprinklers the low pressure had little effect on the mean discharge rdr 0 97 fig 4b and yield fig 4c although the actual du 82 could cause a yield reduction of 6 with respect to the design condition du 100 the ratio rad pm pdesign was 1 46 fig 5 a due to the low pumping efficiency under the actual condition the farmer could potentially save about 57 of the energy actually consumed fig 5a mainly in the pump fig 5b while he should use a small additional amount of energy fig 5a for filtering fig 5c which in this case was estimated to be 2 m the head discharge data pairs for the micro sprinkler evaluated were in a wide range of discharges and a narrow range of pressure fig 4b indicating clogging likely due to the lack of filtering the performance of farm lots c06 3 and c50 2 showed a contrast in the sense that in the former the right amount of energy was used inefficiently causing a significant yield penalty while in the latter an excess of energy used inefficiently resulted in an excessive energy cost but saved the yield filtering was inadequate in both cases although its estimated effect on yield was more significant in farm lot c06 3 than in c50 2 the next section extends this type of analysis to all farm lots evaluated using performance indicators 3 2 performance variability among farm lots overall the on farm water meters worked rather well fig 6 which gave us confidence in the fairness of charging irrigation costs proportionally to water consumption however some of the water meters were blocked by debris or fish that arrived with the canal water this was one of the first problems detected and one recommendation to pass on to the district the screens protecting the entrance to the farm tanks were often broken and the pumping station did not have any type of detritus rake or filter to prevent the entry of foreign matter such as debris and fish all motors had a rated power of 10 kw except two which had 12 2 kw and all the pumps were centrifugal the most common pump makes were inapi model 12dlc 3500 rpm impeller of 168 mm ksb model megabloc 40160r with impellers of 151 160 or 174 mm king model c10r 3500 rpm impeller of 179 mm and imbil model 40125 3500 rpm impeller of 133 mm although other pump models were found the year of acquisition of the pumps varied from 2003 to 2012 pump efficiency varied greatly from farm lot to farm lot fig 7 ep was less than 50 in 17 out of the 37 farm lots where it could be determined when compared to the corresponding efficiency in the head efficiency curve given in the pump manufacturer s catalogue catalogues were available for 26 models of the 37 evaluated only two pumps had the efficiency in the catalogue curve fig 8 shows the operation point on the h q fig 8a and ep q fig 8b planes for the 10 model inapi pumps evaluated the operation data points were at varying distances from the catalogue curves that enveloped the points cloud the lowest ep in the inapi data set was 35 while according to the catalogue curve it should be 70 for the same pump h was 27 2 m whereas it should be 49 5 m according to the discharge measured although all the pumps of this model had ep of below the attainable efficiency some performed relatively well assuming that the right motor pump was selected pumping efficiency may be below expectation because differences between design and actual operation conditions and or deterioration of motor pump components due to poor maintenance proper maintenance should include lubrication of the line shaft grease of pump head and electric motor bearings and periodic adjustment of impeller packing glands and pump shaft seals duke 2007 the majority of the farmers interviewed declared not to do this maintenance the irrigation system analysis model that could be applied to 26 farm lots showed that an excess of power was used in all but one of the motor pumps fig 9 the average excess of power 2 2 kw represented about 25 of the average power consumed according to our measurements this is a significant amount although it could be an overestimation of the actual attainable value note that the pump curves displayed in the catalogues were determined in a controlled ambient using brand new pumps for instance the dashed curve that envelops the head discharge data points in fig 8a drawn by eye imitating the curve of the catalogue until touching the observed data points could be more realistic for field conditions than the catalogue curve although it still shows that many pumps were well below the attainable frontier this is also evident in fig 8b in which the pump efficiency discharge data points and manufacturer s curve are depicted all the farmers found that the filters installed in the farm lots when the district was constructed were inadequate for filtering the water of the acaraú river as mentioned before the district lacks any cleaning equipment at the river pumping station moreover the filters initially installed at the farm lots were disc or screen filters of a smaller size than the one needed farmers struggled to keep them clean maintaining an adequate pressure and removing particles that could clog the emitters many farmers decided to remove the filters thus worsening emitter clogging in 2012 a farmer from the region developed what is locally known as an artisanal filter it is like a screen filter made of two concentric pvc tubes with the internal one perforated by hand to about 230 mesh fig 10 in 2014 only 4 farmers still used screen or disc filters 15 farmers did not have any filters at all and 19 farmers had acquired the artisanal filter fig 11 contrary to the motor pumps excess of power consumption at the filter was detected in only 6 of the 26 systems where the analysis model was applied fig 12 in this set of 6 were the 4 systems with disc or screen filters with the 1 4 kw consumed in one of the screen filters standing out the power consumption was more than adequate for good operation conditions in only 2 of the 17 artisanal filters in the same sample the other 15 consumed an amount of power likely to be less than necessary for proper filtering it was assumed that a pressure drop of 2 m is adequate for most micro irrigation filters that surely occurred in the remaining 5 systems where there was no filter fig 13 a shows the unit distribution uniformity found in the district du was over 80 in only 16 out of the 40 lots evaluated over 80 for du is considered to be acceptable or good while du 80 is poor or very poor for this kind of irrigation system part of this poor uniformity could be due to low pressure distribution uniformity however more than half of the lots had a pressure distribution uniformity dup of over 80 fig 13b and there was no relationship between pressure and discharge distribution uniformities fig 14 emitter clogging could be another cause of low du in fact the field inspections of the emitters revealed that the membrane of the auto compensating ones was often covered with fine particles and organic material or the farmer had removed the membrane when s he observed that the emitters were obstructed the farmers who used the artisanal filter said that they were happy with their new filters arguing that they could considerably reduce washing frequency however when asked about emitter clogging they answered that they have to check and clean emitters every one to three weeks du ranged between 94 and 100 under the design condition of the 26 systems analysed while it took on values as low as 19 in the actual condition fig 15 on average du was 98 and 72 respectively the mean relative irrigation discharge was 1 05 and 0 73 for the design and actual conditions respectively with more variability in the actual than in the design condition fig 16 the objective should be rdr near unity while rdr 0 73 indicates an insufficient water supply if the system operates continually in this way the notable uniformity gap together with the commonly low actual rdr lead to a yield gap that is also considerable fig 17 while under design conditions potential yield could be achieved virtually in all the farm lots average relative yield under actual conditions was estimated to be only 0 75 with values as low as 0 48 but some farm lots performed well with an estimated actual relative yield as high as the design yield 4 discussion most irrigation advisory services focus on providing irrigation recommendations and evaluating distribution uniformity smith and muñoz 2002 surveys on distribution uniformity have shown great variability among farmers benouniche et al 2014a reported du between 12 and 93 in 22 field evaluations of drip irrigation systems in morocco that variability and the occurrence of poorly performing micro irrigation systems were also found in countries where irrigation is more advanced for instance hanson et al 1995 reported that the average du of hand move solid set sprinklers and micro irrigation systems in california was overall less than that of furrow or border irrigation in central spain the uniformity of drip irrigation systems found by ortega et al 2005 was in general greater than the uniformity of solid set sprinkler systems but the variability among installations was quite large therefore the frequency distribution of du presented in fig 13a is not surprising the challenge here lies in understanding the reasons for poor performance and identifying the measures to improve it which goes beyond the usual irrigation advisory services benouniche et al 2014a were able to explain the actual irrigation performance of a heterogeneous set of drip irrigation systems in morocco by linking irrigation efficiency and distribution uniformity with the socio economic logic of the farmers who operated those systems our assessment was constrained to family farm lots a fairly homogeneous group so that actual performance variability was likely to be related to technical rather than socio economic reasons the first concern could be whether micro irrigation was the appropriate election for dibau wanvoeke et al 2015 argued that smallholder drip irrigation gained popularity in sub saharan africa not because of what the technology brings to farmers but because of spurious interests in dibau the crops envisaged were tropical fruit trees and vegetables soils are mainly sandy the plots are small and the aim was to supply water on demand these are the physical and agronomical characteristics into which micro irrigation fits better than surface or sprinkler irrigation burt et al 2000 however it may still happen that technology translation garb and friedlander 2014 did not flow fluently certainly the filters initially installed at the family farm lots did not have the capacity to clean the required flow of water with the particular quality of the acaraú river thus many farmers removed the filter from the irrigation system head although suppliers and dealers of irrigation material and equipment are present in the region the response to this flaw was not immediate it only arrived in 2012 and as a local innovation when a farmer developed what it is locally known as artisanal filter this farmer changed from farming to the new business of constructing and selling the artisanal filter the filter was evolved from faulty prototypes to the current model described above an exemplary case of an irrigation innovation process reached through bricolage benouniche et al 2014b therefore we believe that micro irrigation was the appropriate election among the available technologies however while the farmers interviewed declared that they were happy with the new filter our research revealed that the technology translation process is still incomplete filtration performance of the artisanal filter is not yet sufficient as inferred from the low du fig 13a from the lack of correlation between emitter discharge and pressure distribution uniformities fig 14 and above all from the farmer s interviews and emitter field inspections insufficient filtering exacerbated by the chemical composition of the water the ph of about 8 and the high concentration of carbonates and bicarbonate may cause precipitation of carbonates in the pipes and emitters causes emitter clogging low application uniformity and yield losses we claim here that an open innovation environment facilitates local innovation and co evolution poncet et al 2010 however the process and the adoption of foreign technology could be accelerated with the intervention at the local level of public or publicly supported services a similar recommendation has been made in a recent study on drip irrigation adoption in california taylor and zilberman 2017 for instance evaluation of the artisanal filter using international standards international organization for standardization iso 2013 could be carried out by irrigation testing laboratories specialized irrigation advisory services or research centres opening new ways of thinking of public support to local innovations this type of testing would guarantee quality and would likely enhance and catalyse local innovation a structure including an irrigation advisory service and an irrigation testing laboratory was set up in the acaraú valley with the participation of public academic institutions and a non profit enterprise unfortunately despite its initial success and farmers acceptance córcoles et al 2016 the structure did not last due to non sustained support irrigation energy is a global multifaceted concern that we found to be a very relevant issue in dibau pumping inefficiency contributed to poor irrigation performance and unnecessary production costs considering that on farm energy is the largest component of the irrigation bill in dibau farmers district managers and the irrigation advisory service were unaware of the magnitude of pumping inefficiency and its economic effects irrigation energy auditing is becoming increasingly common in developed countries rocamora et al 2013 although both assessment and research have focused on a network level rodríguez díaz et al 2009 for instance evaluation of the pumps in the collective network of dibau was carried out by córcoles et al 2016 our results recommend conducting irrigation energy assessment also at a farm scale extensive pumping efficiency has been carried out on farms in the us central plains hla and scherer 2001 krantz 2010 however we are not aware of any extensive assessment of smallholder irrigation energy efficiency like the one reported in this paper the existence of motor pumps performing well promotes the use of benchmarking for participatory learning and improvement lozano and mateos 2008 borgia et al 2013 for instance when all the pump models were pooled using the ratio between the actual efficiency and the catalogue pump efficiency for the actual discharge and the resulting indicator was depicted against the year of pump acquisition available for 16 of the 40 evaluated the relative efficiency indicator was found to range from 40 to 100 fig 18 this indicated that some pumps operated satisfactorily and implied that others gave a very poor performance there was no correlation between the pump age and the relative efficiency indicator thus thorough pump inspection maintenance and repair has to be carried out individually and as a system component but it can focus on the poor performing systems 5 conclusions the analysis model developed in this work depicts the energy water yield nexus by linking energy efficiency upstream and yield gap downstream with irrigation performance the performance assessment of smallholder irrigation systems in dibau based on the analysis model and field measurements helped to diagnose the causes of the deficiencies detected revealed undetected ones and linked underperformance with yield loss and energy cost the high performance variability found among the smallholder irrigators indicates a large margin for improvement and suggests the use of best farmers as benchmarks in a participatory learning process following a systemic performance assessment primary causes of systems underperformance were pumping inefficiency and inappropriate filtering although there has been technology translation through local innovation in the filtering system the process has not been completed because of lack of technical knowledge the collaboration between public advisory services and local innovators artisans will accelerate the fine tuning of technologies and their adoption although our analysis model was designed specifically for the family lots of dibau it was meant to be an archetype for similar smallholder irrigation farming systems in brazil and other countries we believe that farmers will be more responsive to recommendations based on the energy water yield nexus approach than to the usual water use efficiency ones acknowledgements we greatly appreciate the work of the team who conducted the field evaluations we also acknowledge the interest and kindness of the dibau farmers whose irrigation systems were evaluated the study was funded by the project bases científicas do assessoramento na

11423,construction of extensive high dike compartments has spurred land use intensification on the upper floodplains of the vietnamese mekong delta increasingly intense rice based farming within these compartments has changed the water dynamics of the delta making it impossible to exploit the erstwhile benefits of floodwaters progressive contraction of the natural floodplains has led to reduced deposition of fertile sediments and environmental degradation endangering the sustainability of farmers livelihoods the mekong delta plan recommends discontinuance of high dike construction in the upper delta and restoration of the floodplains however this requires a radical shift in the agricultural economy halting intensification of rice based farming systems and developing alternative farming systems that can flourish on restored floodplains using living with floods livelihood strategies this paper explores stakeholders perceptions and appreciation of these contrasting farming and livelihood systems for the upper delta it also examines the extent that alternatives to flood based agricultural systems are viewed as feasible and attractive we applied multi criteria analysis mca with analytic hierarchy process ahp to explore the views of double and triple rice farmers and experts on alternatives based on a set of economic water management and environmental aspects mca results indicate a clear preference among both farmers and experts for flood based farming systems with low dikes floodwater retention capacity infrastructure for flood protection environmental sustainability and market stability were ranked as the most important factors contributing to livelihood sustainability on the delta keywords flood based farming systems dike livelihoods mekong delta multi criteria analysis 1 introduction nowadays the world s deltas display different structural development states or socio ecological systems the ganges and indus deltas for instance are in the anthropocene 1 1 anthropocene completely altered system through human intervention renaud et al 2013 state and in danger of tipping into a collapsed state 2 2 collapsed a delta that society has chosen to abandon or no longer protect renaud et al 2013 in contrast the rhine meuse delta now also in the anthropocene state could potentially revert to a modified holocene 3 3 holocene river delta in equilibrium with geography and dynamic processes dominant renaud et al 2013 state as programmes such as the dutch room for the river are progressively implemented and expanded renaud et al 2013 van herk et al 2015 van staveren and van tatenhove 2016 indeed the netherlands and many other countries such as the uk germany and bangladesh are increasing their emphasis on ecosystem based spatial planning and flood defences in response to environmental concerns and the rising cost of flood protection infrastructure particularly in the face of climate change kundzewicz 2002 samuels et al 2006 temmerman et al 2013 van wesenbeeck et al 2014 bubeck et al 2015 the degrading effects of flood control measures on the environment are now also increasingly clear alongside the lost economic opportunities associated with ecosystem services that natural floodwaters could provide wang et al 2016 in vietnam the mekong delta is presently at a crossroad it could enter a collapsed state or return to a modified holocene condition the direction it takes will depend largely on whether intensification of rice production continues or if instead alternative flood based farming systems are adopted land use intensification has strongly affected water management on the vietnamese mekong delta vmd during the past decades vietnam s food security policies have stimulated intensification of rice production this has transformed the upper vmd from a seasonal floodplain into a highly intensified rice farming area with large scale flood control structures increased triple cropping of rice in combination with high dike protection has altered the flood dynamics of the delta table 1 high dikes however have increased peak river discharges changed floodwater distribution reduced flood retention capacity of floodplains and increased flood risk in surrounding and downstream areas hoa et al 2007 tri et al 2012 kingdom of the netherlands and the socialist republic of vietnam 2013 duong et al 2014 dung et al 2018b in addition extensive high dike constructions have reduced the floodplain s water storage capacity to such a level that it is inadequate to mitigate saltwater intrusion in downstream provinces during the dry season triple crop rice farming systems under high dike protection may be environmentally unsustainable in the region endangering farmers livelihoods in the long run kingdom of the netherlands and the socialist republic of vietnam 2013 high dikes interrupt interactions between rivers and floodplains wetland ecosystems need this interaction to exploit natural benefits such as deposition of fertile sediment and provision of wild fish stocks danh and mushtaq 2011 opperman et al 2013 hung et al 2014a manh et al 2014 the quality of soils in particular sulphate acid soils may be degraded as a result of triple crop rice farming combined as it typically is with excess pesticide and fertiliser use howie 2011 triple crop rice farming may even cease to be profitable due to the rising production costs resulting from soil degradation these have raised the discussion in vietnam on how sustainable triple rice cultivation in the floodplains of the upper delta käkönen 2008 howie 2011 kingdom of the netherlands and the socialist republic of vietnam 2013 chapman et al 2016 chapman and darby 2016 in the mekong delta plan a clear recommendation has been made to stop conversion of floodplains to triple rice and restore the retention capacity of the floodplains in lights of climate change environmental sustainability and economic viability recommendations are made to invest in flood based livelihood systems that can provide economic livelihoods from flood based activities as aquaculture floating rice lotus and floating vegetables etc most previous studies of farming systems and farmers livelihood sustainability have focused on two aspects i evaluation of the costs and benefits of farming practices associated with different water management strategies and ii exploration of stakeholders views on the impacts of farming systems on livelihood sustainability the first aspect is usually investigated using economic tools to calculate the costs and benefits of different farming systems in monetary terms many studies of this kind have been carried out in the case study area dan 2015 kien 2014 giz 2014 mike 2013 yet by focusing only on the monetary profitability of farming systems these have mostly overlooked social and environmental impacts the second aspect has been addressed mainly with qualitative surveys or interviews with stakeholders substantially fewer studies of this kind are available for the case study area howie 2011 trieu et al 2010 trung et al 2013 berg et al 2017 both kinds of studies have concluded that farming systems under low dike protection are more beneficial to farmers than those under high dike protection no previous studies however have combined multiple economic social and environmental evaluation considerations also farmers perspectives on their livelihood options under low dike and high dike protection have not been explicitly addressed incorporation of these elements is necessary to fully grasp the impacts of high dike construction beyond the economic effects in addition inclusion of alternative farming systems could broaden our understanding of environmental and livelihood sustainability options against the background of a delta at a developmental crossroad and considering our fragmented understanding of farmers preferences the current study explores stakeholders views of alternative farming systems from a sustainable livelihoods perspective we hypothesise that double and triple rice farmers prefer flood based farming systems under low dike protection 4 4 flood based farming systems involve cultivation of for example lotus and floating rice under the protection of low dikes that allow floodwaters to enter fields in the flood season instead of farming systems requiring high dikes this is because low dike systems are associated with more sustainable livelihoods we test this hypothesis in an giang province located in the long xuyen quadrangle which is one of the vmd s two main floodplains fig 1 we used a two step approach to examine stakeholders views on the livelihood sustainability effects of alternative farming systems in step one we conducted an interview survey with farmers to identify farming systems and obtain a better understanding of the challenges farmers faced in step two we conducted focus group sessions with experts and with farmers to explore their ideas on alternative farming systems in relation to a set of economic water management and environmental considerations using multi criteria analysis mca 2 research context 2 1 flood based farming systems every floodplain has distinct characteristics that govern the regularity of its flooding patterns and to which particular flood based farming systems have been adapted abraham et al 2013 spate irrigation network foundation 2013 in their natural state the vmd floodplains are usually under water from july to december and farmers cultivate lands protected by either high dikes or low dikes high dikes in effect create dike encircled polders on which farmers can produce three rice crops each year with full flood protection thus high dikes increase crop production potential for farmers but if they fail the risks and costs are very substantial low dikes 5 5 low dikes are known as august dikes in vietnam and comprise farmer built low dikes of about 1 m height these protect the fields against the onset of floods permitting the harvesting of a second rice crop before mid august after harvesting and as flood levels rise fields become flooded to a peak depth of some 3 4 m in contrast allow floodwaters to enter fields during peak flooding while providing sufficient protection for two rice crops each year in the low dike system the eco hydrological dynamics are environmentally favourable as floodwaters flow in and out of farming systems depositing fertile sediments creating lush fish habitats and flushing the land of agrochemicals and sulphate acid deposits howie 2011 kingdom of the netherlands and the socialist republic of vietnam 2013 trung et al 2013 flood based farming systems are adapted to the floodwater regime optimising productivity in relation to the rise and recession of floods contributing to agroecological sustainability nguyen and james 2013 the seasonal flooding of the mekong river may offer opportunities for a variety of flood based production systems within the vmd including freshwater aquaculture floating rice and other floating crops such as river bean sesbania sesban called dien dien locally water mimosa neptunia oleracea called nhut lotus nelumbo nucifera called sen and water lily nymphaea called sung floodplains with more active hydro ecological dynamics may thus offer opportunities for diversification of farming 2 2 maximising sustainable livelihoods the terms livelihoods and sustainable livelihoods have been used increasingly in the scientific literature since 1990 ian 2015 morse and mcnamara 2013a numerous studies have applied the idea of livelihood sustainability in various sectors such as agriculture aquaculture geography urban development forestry and fisheries see e g ian 2015 meyer aurich 2005 murshed e jahan and pemsl 2011 rasul and thapa 2004 wang et al 2016 the term sustainability is understood as the intersection of a series of three overlapping circles that symbolise the environment the economic system and society morse and mcnamara 2013b a much cited definition of sustainable livelihoods is that of chambers and conway 1992 p 7 a livelihood comprises the capabilities assets and activities required for a means of living a livelihood is sustainable when it can cope with and recover from stresses and shocks and maintain or enhance its capabilities and assets both now and in the future while not undermining the natural resource base the current study explores the maximisation of sustainable livelihoods at the farm system level this refers to a situation wherein the income of a farmer is optimised using sustainable farming practices farming practices are sustainable when they balance economic ecological and social aspects they can thus be implemented for many years and continue to generate a good income without ill effects on the natural environment 2 3 study area an giang province was selected as the case study area for three main reasons 1 its geographical position in the upper floodplains of the vmd 2 its distinction as the province with the greatest amount of land converted to triple crop rice farming under high dike protection and 3 its position as one of the highest rice producing provinces of the delta an giang covers most of the long xuyen quadrangle which forms the western floodplain of the vmd during flood events the province in its natural state is inundated to a depth of 1 5 m to 4 m rendering the entire area a large pond that retains floodwater for a number of months kingdom of the netherlands and the socialist republic of vietnam 2013 the floodplain holds some 16 109 m3 of water in its natural state dung et al 2018b together with the more easterly plain of reads it is a principal water retention and flood regulation reservoir for the vmd which is connected to the cambodian floodplain thanks to sediment transport by floodwaters there is a dominance of alluvial soils in the region this makes the province an ideal location for growing high yielding rice varieties kien 2014 rice production has been greatly intensified since the late 1980s spurred by government food security objectives and the doi moi economic policy reforms strong growth in double crop rice under low dike protection was followed by increased triple crop rice under high dike protection the expanse of lands protected by high dikes in an giang province grew rapidly starting in 1998 table 1 data from the department of agriculture and rural development dard indicates that by 2014 almost all agricultural lands in the province were protected by high dikes fig 2 nowadays about 91 of the agricultural area in the province is used for paddy rice production with the remaining 9 under vegetables fruit trees and aquaculture aggso 2014 an giang was the second highest producer of rice among all vmd provinces from 2000 to 2015 with production of 3 2 million tons year compared to 3 3 million tons year in kien giang province and 2 7 million tons year in dong thap province gsovn 2015 3 methodology 3 1 interview survey and literature review we conducted an interview survey of 60 farmers in an giang and dong thap provinces to identify alternative farming systems and capture the challenges farmers faced in their present farming systems and livelihoods under either low dike or high dike flood protection most surveys 45 were carried out in six communes in an giang dinh thanh and vong dong communes in thoai son district o long vy commune in chau phu district thanh my tay and binh phu communes in chau phu district and tan uyen in tri ton district the remainder 15 were done in dong thap tan my commune in thanh binh district see fig 1 surveying in two provinces enabled us to capture different experiences and perspectives of farmers regarding high dike protected rice production systems which were predominant in an giang and low dike systems which were still predominant in dong thap surveyed farmers were selected through random sampling followed by snowball sampling to capture the broadest variety of farming systems in rice vegetables and aquaculture the number of farmers interviewed was not fixed in advance for each region instead following kumar 2014 we terminated surveying once information saturation was reached that is when additional surveys yielded no additional information on farming or livelihood systems we combined the survey results with a literature review to identify the range of farming systems present and to define valuation criteria for low dike and high dike farming systems for later use in the mca finally we interviewed five experts and four local officials to deepen our understanding of the difficulties involved in flood based farming and to gain experts opinions on dike protection strategies two sets of structured questionnaires were developed one for use with farmers in low dike areas and the other for use with farmers in high dike areas both explored farm characteristics advantages and disadvantages of dike protection and alternative farming systems for sustainable livelihoods whereas the low dike questionnaire focused more on the advantages and constraints of flood based agriculture in the flood season the high dike questionnaire had greater emphasis on advantages and disadvantages of the high dikes with respect to livelihoods and environmental aspects each interview was recorded and notes were taken to enable verification of the information provided 3 2 multi criteria analysis mca mca is a method of engaging stakeholders in an evaluation of alternatives based on set criteria and sub criteria mendoza et al 1999 department for communities and local government 2009 mca has often been used in agricultural and environmental studies carof et al 2013 cisneros et al 2011 fontana et al 2013 huang et al 2011 reidsma et al 2011 teshome et al 2014 tiwari et al 1999 our study implemented an mca employing criteria related to economic social and environmental sustainability the aim was to evaluate the livelihood flood management and environmental effects of alternative farming systems further details in section 3 3 these aspects have been used in numerous previous studies to evaluate agricultural sustainability kundzewicz 2002 reidsma et al 2011 kremen et al 2012 mark and patrick 2013 teshome et al 2014 our mca involved a complex evaluation of ten alternative farming systems assessed based on three criteria and 14 sub criteria fig 3 we organised three mca workshops one with experts and two with farmers to evaluate the farming systems based on the criteria defined to organise the rankings and assess the consistency and coherence of participants scores and responses we used analytic hierarchy process ahp saaty 2008 though the location of our research is the upper part of the delta our analysis incorporates potential impacts of land use changes on the delta as a whole we did this by including various internalities and externalities of floodwater management internalities are benefits at the local level such as soil fertility water quality goods and profits externalities are benefits and costs on the deltaic scale such as flood protection and salinity intrusion downstream this means we explore the effects of alternatives not only at the local level but also for the delta as a whole 3 2 1 ahp ahp is a means of ranking options using pair wise comparisons and weighted attributes it is among the widest applied mca tools huang et al 2011 many studies have used the method introduced by saaty 1980 to evaluate alternatives in agriculture and other fields alphonce 1997 chavez et al 2012 karami 2006 reed et al 2014 all criteria the first hierarchy and sub criteria the second hierarchy are compared in pairs using a 1 9 numerical scale then weightings are applied to produce alternative comparisons saaty 1980 an advantage of ahp is that the pair wise comparison of alternatives structured hierarchically facilitates stakeholders assessments and consideration of defined goals criteria and sub criteria 3 2 2 workshops with experts and farmers we first conducted the mca at an international workshop on participatory decision support tools for strategic delta planning and management nine vietnamese experts took part each was knowledgeable about farming systems and farmers livelihoods in the vmd the workshop began with a presentation of our study objective methodology the farming systems included and a how to scoring guide for the mca we then handed out the mca questionnaires so that each expert could individually score the alternative farming systems based on the given criteria and sub criteria in addition to the workshop we organised two farmer focus group sessions one in thanh my tay commune high dike area and one in binh phu commune low dike area both communes are located in the chau phu district of an giang this was a district in which we had previously done farmer interviews the district moreover had both types of dikes and a range of different farming systems each focus group session involved ten invited farmers who were divided into two groups thus forming four groups of five farmers each though the farmers conducted the mca in these groups they used individual scoring cards they could thus individually rate the criteria and alternatives while simultaneously discussing their views and implications as a group each farmer was furthermore given a different coloured set of sticky notes on which to write their scores and the alternatives they preferred the different colours enabled facilitators to ensure that the outcomes were not dominated by any one group member experienced from the workshop with the experts in the farmer sessions we checked the consistency of the pair wise comparisons as the mca progressed using excel sheets with ahp software provided by dr klaus d goepel from the website http bpmsg com 3 3 criteria and sub criteria livelihoods floodwater management and environmental sustainability were the three main criteria used for evaluating the alternative farming systems both farming systems in low dike areas and farming systems in high dike areas for each criterion four to five sub criteria were identified 14 in all these described social economic and environmental aspects sub criteria were derived from the literature and the farmer interviews and selected for their pertinence to the socio economic development and agricultural context of the vmd we developed indicators and descriptions for each sub criterion to clarify them to both the experts and the farmers during their respective mca sessions table 2 presents details on the sub criteria used see fig 3 for the mca structure 4 results 4 1 interviews with farmers in an giang 40 of the 45 farmers interviewed preferred high dikes to low dikes dung and jacob 2017 the preference was made because i high dikes improved residential safety and public welfare and ii they enabled cultivation of a third rice crop for which a stable market was readily available farmers indicated that the high dikes protected their lives belongings and farms against flooding and created a safe place for them to earn a living in addition the high dikes facilitated transportation improving farmers access to markets and protecting their lands from flood damages cultivation of a third rice crop during the flood season was said to increase farmers incomes nonetheless farmers living under the protection of the high dikes expressed concern about environmental problems caused by the triple cropping of rice all of the farmers in high dike farming systems acknowledged disadvantages of the high dikes such as increased fertiliser and pesticide use nonetheless seven of them observed that rice was a traditional easy to sell crop also the third rice crop which could be produced thanks to the high dikes was credited with eliminating social problems such as drinking wine and playing cards which were typical during the many hours of spare time people otherwise had in the flood season regarding the five farmers who disapproved of the high dikes it was responded that additional profit from triple rice practice is lower than the production costs interviews indicated that farmers with larger lands liked the high dikes even more than farmers with smaller lands because profits from rice cultivation were proportional to the cultivated area three farmers noted the decrease of wild fish stocks and fertile sediments due to the hydropower developments upstream along the mekong river all 33 interviewed farmers from high dike areas agreed that the high dikes had reduced fertile sediment deposition in their rice fields five suggested that the decrease in wild fish and sediment was due to the minor flooding of recent years following the large 2011 flood in dong thap province where fewer high dikes had been constructed seven of the 15 farmers interviewed did not prefer the high dikes dung and jacob 2017 these farmers thus had a distinctly different view from those in an giang they gave several reasons for their opinion i they were unwilling to invest the three year financial contribution required by government for dike construction ii they had heard from neighbours in high dike areas that the profitability of triple crop rice farming was outweighed by negative environmental impacts and increased investment costs and iii farmers saw the low dikes as safeguarding natural benefits of floods and considered the current double cultivation system within low dikes to be good for the soil we found that pressure to convert to triple cropping of rice was still active in the region two farmers noted that local government had held several meetings to encourage farmers to switch from the low dike farming system to the high dike system various constraints were noted for flood based low dike farming i it was difficult to plant the flooded lands if there were strong winds waves or heavy rain ii most farmers were unfamiliar with improved planting techniques iii crop failures due to golden apple snails pomacea canaliculata and water pollution were commonplace iv fishing was dangerous particularly as boats on open waters were exposed to strong winds and waves in the flood season v markets for commodities other than rice were less readily available and less stable than the rice market and vi wild fish stocks had fallen sharply compared to previous years both the interview survey and the literature pointed to numerous farming systems that had been applied in the region we had to narrow these to a feasible selection to keep our analysis from becoming overly complex we selected ten farming system alternatives which we judged as maximising livelihood sustainability that is they appeared to provide the best income potential with the least environmental degradation table 3 half of these 5 were for low dike areas and half 5 were for high dike areas these alternatives were used in the mca process 4 2 multi criteria analysis our groups assigned each criteria and sub criteria weights from 0 to 1 zero 0 signifies the least importance while 1 represents the highest importance thus if three criteria factors were deemed equally important all three would have weights of 0 33 experts and farmers weightings of the three main criteria differed markedly table 4 vietnamese experts considered livelihoods to be the most important criterion 0 46 whereas farmers considered environmental sustainability in land and water to be most important assigning them weightings ranging from 0 50 to 0 57 experts and farmers were in alignment however on flood protection as the least important criterion thus while the experts seemed to be primarily concerned about the livelihoods of farmers in relation to farming systems farmers surprisingly appeared to attach higher importance to sustainability of the soil and water environment than to their livelihoods or floodwater management experts and farmers also differed in their valuations of the sub criteria under the livelihood criterion experts scored profitability 0 24 and infrastructure and public works 0 24 as the most important farmers however scored market stability 0 40 as the most important factor under floodwater management both experts and farmers emphasised the ability to exploit the benefits of floodwaters 0 33 and 0 36 respectively but farmers also valued flood protection 0 32 complexity of operation and externalities were ranked as the least important factors by both experts and farmers under environmental sustainability in land and water experts considered water storage capacity 0 30 and water pollution risk 0 29 as the two foremost factors farmers ranked water pollution risk 0 30 water storage capacity 0 22 and soil fertility 0 21 as most important the mca results show that both experts and farmers preferred the flood based farming systems in low dike areas over all farming systems in the high dike areas table 5 exploiting the benefits of floodwaters for farming was considered the best means of maximising sustainable livelihoods among the farming systems under low dike protection the double vegetable ld2 and double mixed crop ld3 were deemed the best options which involved dry season cultivation combined with floating crops in the flood season although farming systems in the high dike areas were not preferred three farming systems were suggested as the most promising alternatives if the high dikes could not be eliminated these were hd2 double rice vegetables hd3 triple mixed crops and hd4 mixed crops poultry or cattle the triple crop rice farming system hd6 came in the lowest position among both farmers and experts even though this system offers the ability to produce three rice crops in a single cultivation year 5 discussion triple crop rice farming systems implemented under the protection of high dikes have spread throughout the floodplains of the vmd during the past two decades this has greatly reduced the floodplains water retention capacity changed local floodwater dynamics and undermined potential benefits of floodwaters for the agroecology of the delta the effects of climate change and hydropower developments upstream have exacerbated the negative impacts of intensified rice farming particularly with regard to water management regimes and sedimentation loads lu and siew 2006 västilä et al 2010 fredrik 2011 hoang et al 2016 intensive rice production stimulated by national food security policies and reliable and readily available rice markets has resulted in environmental degradation especially in the high dike compartments across the delta livelihoods are becoming less sustainable because the high dike farming systems require increased fertiliser and pesticide applications to maintain rice production levels all of the stakeholders in the current research recognised the need to explore alternatives we started with an interview survey which found a preference among double triple rice farmers for high dikes over low dikes due to the protection that high dikes offered for residential zones and the stability of the national market for rice indeed while high dikes and similar water related infrastructure are costly they are often needed to protect human settlements and property against flood damages moreover high dikes have enabled farmers to cultivate three rice crops per year and thus increase their incomes the market for rice is stable because the vietnamese government has invested great effort over the past 40 years in developing the rice market and the rice processing industry huu nguyen et al 2016 markets for other crops are far less mature as yet in addition rice grains are relatively easily preserved even for long periods of time after harvest so farmers have less need to worry about market risks berg et al 2017 our mca results contradicted the findings of our interview survey according to the mca flood based farming systems under low dike protection were most preferred and acknowledged as the best means of maximising livelihood sustainability experts weighted the livelihood criterion as most important as they supposed farm profitability infrastructure for flood protection and market stability would be most important to farmers farmers however indicated that their greatest concern was environmental sustainability more than 50 of weights underlining the importance of floodwaters for environmental preservation and worries about the negative impacts of soil degradation caused by triple crop rice farming floodwater retention capacity and exploitability of floodwaters benefits were deemed important by both farmers and experts recognising the advantages of flooding for the environment and for farmers livelihoods the heavier weightings assigned to these criteria by both farmers and experts indicate a demand for sustainable farming systems which were provided only by the low dikes our mca results can thus also be interpreted as progressive exposure to an awareness of environmental degradation the mca further validates the earlier findings of the interviews that market stability and flood protection are highly valued as benefits by farmers to invest in and develop flood based farming systems within low dike systems two factors have to be addressed i provision of dependable flood protection for residential zones to safeguard people and their property as well as transportation infrastructure and public services such as hospitals and schools and ii strengthening of markets for other commodities perhaps in association with development of modern food processing and perishable food preservation industries for new products grown in the alternative farming systems the lowest score in the mca assessment was for the farming system with eight rice crops in three years a 3 3 2 cycle similar to chapman and darby 2016 our results suggest inadequate economic and environmental benefit of the 3 3 2 rice system for farmers furthermore chapman et al 2016 indicate that the 3 3 2 cycle did not improve on the triple crop rice system in regard to trapping fertile sediment the system of high dike compartments traps little fertile sediment because the position capacity and physical barrier of the sluice gates carries water differently than floodwaters flowing over low dikes hung et al 2014b moreover farmers tend to use excess rainwater pumped from compartment to compartment instead of irrigation based on floodwaters which bring trapped sediment joep 2015 there is as yet no effective means of trapping sediment for triple crop rice systems it therefore seems recommendable to discontinue or at least to reduce triple cropping of rice thus eliminating the main reason for high dike construction instead of continuing to focus on quantity a shift may be proposed to a greater focus on rice quality for the international market in combination with more concern for the environmental quality of farming systems tong 2017 in addition water and fertiliser managements are also recommended for the whole farming systems jang et al 2012 in line with our mca results most previous studies also found a preference for low dike farming systems over the high dike systems of the vmd käkönen 2008 and trung et al 2013 suggest more government stimulus for developing farming systems under low dikes to reduce agrochemical use from the levels needed for farming in the high dike compartments howie 2011 studied relationships between farmers and the state and among farmers themselves showing increased production costs in high dike farming systems compared to low dike systems kien 2014 conducted a cost benefit analysis and concluded that farming practices under low dike protection had the highest economic benefit compared to those under high dikes or no dikes giz 2014 carried out a cost benefit assessment for four land management change scenarios in an giang that study determined that converting a large proportion of triple crop rice area to seasonal rice plus vegetables could be an optimal future land use in terms of economic profit using a different method to analyse the costs and benefits of dike heightening on the vmd floodplains dan 2015 showed decreased profit from the first and second rice crops due to the higher input costs as the main cost of dike heightening and recommended that rice intensification under high dike protection no longer be encouraged in the vmd iucn and vawr 2016 produced results similar to ours using farmer interviews and focus groups to explore adaptation of farming models for different areas in the mekong delta that research also stressed the need to address the market obstacles associated with non rice crops overall the results of these studies are comparable with our mca finding that low dike farming systems are economically more advantageous than high dike farming systems furthermore the multiple methods used in the current research an interview survey combined with a literature review focus groups and an mca contributes new insights on farmers views of farming systems our two step approach showed initially contradictory results which underlines the importance of the scientific method applied in any research context if we had carried out only the interview survey combined with the literature review or if we had carried out only the mca our conclusions may well have been different for example we may have concluded that the majority of farmers advocated the high dikes since many of the farmers interviewed were enthusiastic about the protection the high dikes offered and the ability to engage in triple crop rice production however the focus group sessions conducted during the mca showed a clear preference among farmers for flood based farming systems with low dikes our combination of the two methods revealed that farmers were aware of the importance of sustainable farming systems but that their livelihoods depend on stable markets and flood safety in the current social and economic context of the delta approaching the problem using these different methods brought out to some extent the dilemma that farmers face the qualitative insights gained in this study on preferred alternative farming systems could be tested in further research across a broader sample of farming communities using quantitative surveys the method used in this study a combined multi criteria analysis mca with analytic hierarchy process ahp could be applied in other areas when comparisons are made on the socio economic and environmental performance of different farming systems the mca ahp method can be used to support decision makers in deciding which farming systems are suitable and effective for improving livelihood sustainability under a set of evaluation criteria i e economic social and environmental perspectives alternatives can be evaluated by different stakeholders with the ahp various levels of pair wised comparisons can be done by weighing and ranking the alternatives options based on a set of criteria mark and patrick 2013 the ahp helps to reduce the inconsistency from stakeholders judgements saaty 2008 in order to apply mca ahp users should address the following three issues first integrate experts recommendations into a set of evaluation criteria that fit the research objective second ensure that participants for the evaluation workshops or focus group are familiar with the farming systems and activities in the study area finally the consistency of stakeholders scores needed to be checked during the process in the pair wise comparisons using ahp 6 conclusions our study uses both interview survey and multi criteria analysis mca to understand stakeholders views on the current and alternative farming systems from a sustainable livelihoods perspective based on the findings of the study three main conclusions are drawn double and triple rice farmers share their concern about environmental degradation of triple rice cultivation in high dikes based on the mca results our surprise to such an extent is that farmers valued the concerns of environmental degradation as the highest weight larger than 50 above concerns for livelihood 28 and floodwater management 17 their concerns for the environment even outweighed those from the experts it shows a strong appreciation of farmers on the detrimental effects of environmental degradation of soil and water in triple rice on their livelihoods and income the progressive and compounding nature of environmental degradation may explain changing attitudes of farmers in their appreciation and valuing of triple rice cultivation and environmental concerns as shown by dung et al 2018a initially benefits of higher rice production outweigh the extra cost and burdens but as deterioration compounds over the years increases in production costs will surpass the gains resulting even in negative results the mca results and valuation of the alternative farming systems provide a clear indication that farmers and experts underwrite the analysis of environmental degradation of triple rice and the prospects for sustainable flood based alternatives as putting forward in recent analysis and the mekong delta plan mdp the ranking of alternative farming systems though not unanimous in system specific preference attributes a clear preference for flood based low dike farming systems addressing environmental concerns and diversification towards higher value crops away from low economic rice this provides scope and support for the mdp recommended priority strategy to stop expanding triple rice cultivation behind high dikes in the upper delta and invest in agricultural flood based or controlled flooding diversification as these alternative systems are only emerging at this stage it will take considerable effort to upscale them to the scale of the vast floodplains of the delta for which a robust support from farmers and stakeholders will be needed the compounding effects of environmental degradation in triple rice may accelerate this process a clear challenge will be to retain the clear benefits of a stable market and flood protection to life and homestead in a diversified flood based livelihood as found as the preference of farmers to the high dike farming systems based on the interview results a failure to attain these may otherwise quickly turn the scales of costs and benefits on these now seemingly attractive alternatives acknowledgement we thank nuffic niche vnm 104 project co funded by the netherlands government and vietnam

11423,construction of extensive high dike compartments has spurred land use intensification on the upper floodplains of the vietnamese mekong delta increasingly intense rice based farming within these compartments has changed the water dynamics of the delta making it impossible to exploit the erstwhile benefits of floodwaters progressive contraction of the natural floodplains has led to reduced deposition of fertile sediments and environmental degradation endangering the sustainability of farmers livelihoods the mekong delta plan recommends discontinuance of high dike construction in the upper delta and restoration of the floodplains however this requires a radical shift in the agricultural economy halting intensification of rice based farming systems and developing alternative farming systems that can flourish on restored floodplains using living with floods livelihood strategies this paper explores stakeholders perceptions and appreciation of these contrasting farming and livelihood systems for the upper delta it also examines the extent that alternatives to flood based agricultural systems are viewed as feasible and attractive we applied multi criteria analysis mca with analytic hierarchy process ahp to explore the views of double and triple rice farmers and experts on alternatives based on a set of economic water management and environmental aspects mca results indicate a clear preference among both farmers and experts for flood based farming systems with low dikes floodwater retention capacity infrastructure for flood protection environmental sustainability and market stability were ranked as the most important factors contributing to livelihood sustainability on the delta keywords flood based farming systems dike livelihoods mekong delta multi criteria analysis 1 introduction nowadays the world s deltas display different structural development states or socio ecological systems the ganges and indus deltas for instance are in the anthropocene 1 1 anthropocene completely altered system through human intervention renaud et al 2013 state and in danger of tipping into a collapsed state 2 2 collapsed a delta that society has chosen to abandon or no longer protect renaud et al 2013 in contrast the rhine meuse delta now also in the anthropocene state could potentially revert to a modified holocene 3 3 holocene river delta in equilibrium with geography and dynamic processes dominant renaud et al 2013 state as programmes such as the dutch room for the river are progressively implemented and expanded renaud et al 2013 van herk et al 2015 van staveren and van tatenhove 2016 indeed the netherlands and many other countries such as the uk germany and bangladesh are increasing their emphasis on ecosystem based spatial planning and flood defences in response to environmental concerns and the rising cost of flood protection infrastructure particularly in the face of climate change kundzewicz 2002 samuels et al 2006 temmerman et al 2013 van wesenbeeck et al 2014 bubeck et al 2015 the degrading effects of flood control measures on the environment are now also increasingly clear alongside the lost economic opportunities associated with ecosystem services that natural floodwaters could provide wang et al 2016 in vietnam the mekong delta is presently at a crossroad it could enter a collapsed state or return to a modified holocene condition the direction it takes will depend largely on whether intensification of rice production continues or if instead alternative flood based farming systems are adopted land use intensification has strongly affected water management on the vietnamese mekong delta vmd during the past decades vietnam s food security policies have stimulated intensification of rice production this has transformed the upper vmd from a seasonal floodplain into a highly intensified rice farming area with large scale flood control structures increased triple cropping of rice in combination with high dike protection has altered the flood dynamics of the delta table 1 high dikes however have increased peak river discharges changed floodwater distribution reduced flood retention capacity of floodplains and increased flood risk in surrounding and downstream areas hoa et al 2007 tri et al 2012 kingdom of the netherlands and the socialist republic of vietnam 2013 duong et al 2014 dung et al 2018b in addition extensive high dike constructions have reduced the floodplain s water storage capacity to such a level that it is inadequate to mitigate saltwater intrusion in downstream provinces during the dry season triple crop rice farming systems under high dike protection may be environmentally unsustainable in the region endangering farmers livelihoods in the long run kingdom of the netherlands and the socialist republic of vietnam 2013 high dikes interrupt interactions between rivers and floodplains wetland ecosystems need this interaction to exploit natural benefits such as deposition of fertile sediment and provision of wild fish stocks danh and mushtaq 2011 opperman et al 2013 hung et al 2014a manh et al 2014 the quality of soils in particular sulphate acid soils may be degraded as a result of triple crop rice farming combined as it typically is with excess pesticide and fertiliser use howie 2011 triple crop rice farming may even cease to be profitable due to the rising production costs resulting from soil degradation these have raised the discussion in vietnam on how sustainable triple rice cultivation in the floodplains of the upper delta käkönen 2008 howie 2011 kingdom of the netherlands and the socialist republic of vietnam 2013 chapman et al 2016 chapman and darby 2016 in the mekong delta plan a clear recommendation has been made to stop conversion of floodplains to triple rice and restore the retention capacity of the floodplains in lights of climate change environmental sustainability and economic viability recommendations are made to invest in flood based livelihood systems that can provide economic livelihoods from flood based activities as aquaculture floating rice lotus and floating vegetables etc most previous studies of farming systems and farmers livelihood sustainability have focused on two aspects i evaluation of the costs and benefits of farming practices associated with different water management strategies and ii exploration of stakeholders views on the impacts of farming systems on livelihood sustainability the first aspect is usually investigated using economic tools to calculate the costs and benefits of different farming systems in monetary terms many studies of this kind have been carried out in the case study area dan 2015 kien 2014 giz 2014 mike 2013 yet by focusing only on the monetary profitability of farming systems these have mostly overlooked social and environmental impacts the second aspect has been addressed mainly with qualitative surveys or interviews with stakeholders substantially fewer studies of this kind are available for the case study area howie 2011 trieu et al 2010 trung et al 2013 berg et al 2017 both kinds of studies have concluded that farming systems under low dike protection are more beneficial to farmers than those under high dike protection no previous studies however have combined multiple economic social and environmental evaluation considerations also farmers perspectives on their livelihood options under low dike and high dike protection have not been explicitly addressed incorporation of these elements is necessary to fully grasp the impacts of high dike construction beyond the economic effects in addition inclusion of alternative farming systems could broaden our understanding of environmental and livelihood sustainability options against the background of a delta at a developmental crossroad and considering our fragmented understanding of farmers preferences the current study explores stakeholders views of alternative farming systems from a sustainable livelihoods perspective we hypothesise that double and triple rice farmers prefer flood based farming systems under low dike protection 4 4 flood based farming systems involve cultivation of for example lotus and floating rice under the protection of low dikes that allow floodwaters to enter fields in the flood season instead of farming systems requiring high dikes this is because low dike systems are associated with more sustainable livelihoods we test this hypothesis in an giang province located in the long xuyen quadrangle which is one of the vmd s two main floodplains fig 1 we used a two step approach to examine stakeholders views on the livelihood sustainability effects of alternative farming systems in step one we conducted an interview survey with farmers to identify farming systems and obtain a better understanding of the challenges farmers faced in step two we conducted focus group sessions with experts and with farmers to explore their ideas on alternative farming systems in relation to a set of economic water management and environmental considerations using multi criteria analysis mca 2 research context 2 1 flood based farming systems every floodplain has distinct characteristics that govern the regularity of its flooding patterns and to which particular flood based farming systems have been adapted abraham et al 2013 spate irrigation network foundation 2013 in their natural state the vmd floodplains are usually under water from july to december and farmers cultivate lands protected by either high dikes or low dikes high dikes in effect create dike encircled polders on which farmers can produce three rice crops each year with full flood protection thus high dikes increase crop production potential for farmers but if they fail the risks and costs are very substantial low dikes 5 5 low dikes are known as august dikes in vietnam and comprise farmer built low dikes of about 1 m height these protect the fields against the onset of floods permitting the harvesting of a second rice crop before mid august after harvesting and as flood levels rise fields become flooded to a peak depth of some 3 4 m in contrast allow floodwaters to enter fields during peak flooding while providing sufficient protection for two rice crops each year in the low dike system the eco hydrological dynamics are environmentally favourable as floodwaters flow in and out of farming systems depositing fertile sediments creating lush fish habitats and flushing the land of agrochemicals and sulphate acid deposits howie 2011 kingdom of the netherlands and the socialist republic of vietnam 2013 trung et al 2013 flood based farming systems are adapted to the floodwater regime optimising productivity in relation to the rise and recession of floods contributing to agroecological sustainability nguyen and james 2013 the seasonal flooding of the mekong river may offer opportunities for a variety of flood based production systems within the vmd including freshwater aquaculture floating rice and other floating crops such as river bean sesbania sesban called dien dien locally water mimosa neptunia oleracea called nhut lotus nelumbo nucifera called sen and water lily nymphaea called sung floodplains with more active hydro ecological dynamics may thus offer opportunities for diversification of farming 2 2 maximising sustainable livelihoods the terms livelihoods and sustainable livelihoods have been used increasingly in the scientific literature since 1990 ian 2015 morse and mcnamara 2013a numerous studies have applied the idea of livelihood sustainability in various sectors such as agriculture aquaculture geography urban development forestry and fisheries see e g ian 2015 meyer aurich 2005 murshed e jahan and pemsl 2011 rasul and thapa 2004 wang et al 2016 the term sustainability is understood as the intersection of a series of three overlapping circles that symbolise the environment the economic system and society morse and mcnamara 2013b a much cited definition of sustainable livelihoods is that of chambers and conway 1992 p 7 a livelihood comprises the capabilities assets and activities required for a means of living a livelihood is sustainable when it can cope with and recover from stresses and shocks and maintain or enhance its capabilities and assets both now and in the future while not undermining the natural resource base the current study explores the maximisation of sustainable livelihoods at the farm system level this refers to a situation wherein the income of a farmer is optimised using sustainable farming practices farming practices are sustainable when they balance economic ecological and social aspects they can thus be implemented for many years and continue to generate a good income without ill effects on the natural environment 2 3 study area an giang province was selected as the case study area for three main reasons 1 its geographical position in the upper floodplains of the vmd 2 its distinction as the province with the greatest amount of land converted to triple crop rice farming under high dike protection and 3 its position as one of the highest rice producing provinces of the delta an giang covers most of the long xuyen quadrangle which forms the western floodplain of the vmd during flood events the province in its natural state is inundated to a depth of 1 5 m to 4 m rendering the entire area a large pond that retains floodwater for a number of months kingdom of the netherlands and the socialist republic of vietnam 2013 the floodplain holds some 16 109 m3 of water in its natural state dung et al 2018b together with the more easterly plain of reads it is a principal water retention and flood regulation reservoir for the vmd which is connected to the cambodian floodplain thanks to sediment transport by floodwaters there is a dominance of alluvial soils in the region this makes the province an ideal location for growing high yielding rice varieties kien 2014 rice production has been greatly intensified since the late 1980s spurred by government food security objectives and the doi moi economic policy reforms strong growth in double crop rice under low dike protection was followed by increased triple crop rice under high dike protection the expanse of lands protected by high dikes in an giang province grew rapidly starting in 1998 table 1 data from the department of agriculture and rural development dard indicates that by 2014 almost all agricultural lands in the province were protected by high dikes fig 2 nowadays about 91 of the agricultural area in the province is used for paddy rice production with the remaining 9 under vegetables fruit trees and aquaculture aggso 2014 an giang was the second highest producer of rice among all vmd provinces from 2000 to 2015 with production of 3 2 million tons year compared to 3 3 million tons year in kien giang province and 2 7 million tons year in dong thap province gsovn 2015 3 methodology 3 1 interview survey and literature review we conducted an interview survey of 60 farmers in an giang and dong thap provinces to identify alternative farming systems and capture the challenges farmers faced in their present farming systems and livelihoods under either low dike or high dike flood protection most surveys 45 were carried out in six communes in an giang dinh thanh and vong dong communes in thoai son district o long vy commune in chau phu district thanh my tay and binh phu communes in chau phu district and tan uyen in tri ton district the remainder 15 were done in dong thap tan my commune in thanh binh district see fig 1 surveying in two provinces enabled us to capture different experiences and perspectives of farmers regarding high dike protected rice production systems which were predominant in an giang and low dike systems which were still predominant in dong thap surveyed farmers were selected through random sampling followed by snowball sampling to capture the broadest variety of farming systems in rice vegetables and aquaculture the number of farmers interviewed was not fixed in advance for each region instead following kumar 2014 we terminated surveying once information saturation was reached that is when additional surveys yielded no additional information on farming or livelihood systems we combined the survey results with a literature review to identify the range of farming systems present and to define valuation criteria for low dike and high dike farming systems for later use in the mca finally we interviewed five experts and four local officials to deepen our understanding of the difficulties involved in flood based farming and to gain experts opinions on dike protection strategies two sets of structured questionnaires were developed one for use with farmers in low dike areas and the other for use with farmers in high dike areas both explored farm characteristics advantages and disadvantages of dike protection and alternative farming systems for sustainable livelihoods whereas the low dike questionnaire focused more on the advantages and constraints of flood based agriculture in the flood season the high dike questionnaire had greater emphasis on advantages and disadvantages of the high dikes with respect to livelihoods and environmental aspects each interview was recorded and notes were taken to enable verification of the information provided 3 2 multi criteria analysis mca mca is a method of engaging stakeholders in an evaluation of alternatives based on set criteria and sub criteria mendoza et al 1999 department for communities and local government 2009 mca has often been used in agricultural and environmental studies carof et al 2013 cisneros et al 2011 fontana et al 2013 huang et al 2011 reidsma et al 2011 teshome et al 2014 tiwari et al 1999 our study implemented an mca employing criteria related to economic social and environmental sustainability the aim was to evaluate the livelihood flood management and environmental effects of alternative farming systems further details in section 3 3 these aspects have been used in numerous previous studies to evaluate agricultural sustainability kundzewicz 2002 reidsma et al 2011 kremen et al 2012 mark and patrick 2013 teshome et al 2014 our mca involved a complex evaluation of ten alternative farming systems assessed based on three criteria and 14 sub criteria fig 3 we organised three mca workshops one with experts and two with farmers to evaluate the farming systems based on the criteria defined to organise the rankings and assess the consistency and coherence of participants scores and responses we used analytic hierarchy process ahp saaty 2008 though the location of our research is the upper part of the delta our analysis incorporates potential impacts of land use changes on the delta as a whole we did this by including various internalities and externalities of floodwater management internalities are benefits at the local level such as soil fertility water quality goods and profits externalities are benefits and costs on the deltaic scale such as flood protection and salinity intrusion downstream this means we explore the effects of alternatives not only at the local level but also for the delta as a whole 3 2 1 ahp ahp is a means of ranking options using pair wise comparisons and weighted attributes it is among the widest applied mca tools huang et al 2011 many studies have used the method introduced by saaty 1980 to evaluate alternatives in agriculture and other fields alphonce 1997 chavez et al 2012 karami 2006 reed et al 2014 all criteria the first hierarchy and sub criteria the second hierarchy are compared in pairs using a 1 9 numerical scale then weightings are applied to produce alternative comparisons saaty 1980 an advantage of ahp is that the pair wise comparison of alternatives structured hierarchically facilitates stakeholders assessments and consideration of defined goals criteria and sub criteria 3 2 2 workshops with experts and farmers we first conducted the mca at an international workshop on participatory decision support tools for strategic delta planning and management nine vietnamese experts took part each was knowledgeable about farming systems and farmers livelihoods in the vmd the workshop began with a presentation of our study objective methodology the farming systems included and a how to scoring guide for the mca we then handed out the mca questionnaires so that each expert could individually score the alternative farming systems based on the given criteria and sub criteria in addition to the workshop we organised two farmer focus group sessions one in thanh my tay commune high dike area and one in binh phu commune low dike area both communes are located in the chau phu district of an giang this was a district in which we had previously done farmer interviews the district moreover had both types of dikes and a range of different farming systems each focus group session involved ten invited farmers who were divided into two groups thus forming four groups of five farmers each though the farmers conducted the mca in these groups they used individual scoring cards they could thus individually rate the criteria and alternatives while simultaneously discussing their views and implications as a group each farmer was furthermore given a different coloured set of sticky notes on which to write their scores and the alternatives they preferred the different colours enabled facilitators to ensure that the outcomes were not dominated by any one group member experienced from the workshop with the experts in the farmer sessions we checked the consistency of the pair wise comparisons as the mca progressed using excel sheets with ahp software provided by dr klaus d goepel from the website http bpmsg com 3 3 criteria and sub criteria livelihoods floodwater management and environmental sustainability were the three main criteria used for evaluating the alternative farming systems both farming systems in low dike areas and farming systems in high dike areas for each criterion four to five sub criteria were identified 14 in all these described social economic and environmental aspects sub criteria were derived from the literature and the farmer interviews and selected for their pertinence to the socio economic development and agricultural context of the vmd we developed indicators and descriptions for each sub criterion to clarify them to both the experts and the farmers during their respective mca sessions table 2 presents details on the sub criteria used see fig 3 for the mca structure 4 results 4 1 interviews with farmers in an giang 40 of the 45 farmers interviewed preferred high dikes to low dikes dung and jacob 2017 the preference was made because i high dikes improved residential safety and public welfare and ii they enabled cultivation of a third rice crop for which a stable market was readily available farmers indicated that the high dikes protected their lives belongings and farms against flooding and created a safe place for them to earn a living in addition the high dikes facilitated transportation improving farmers access to markets and protecting their lands from flood damages cultivation of a third rice crop during the flood season was said to increase farmers incomes nonetheless farmers living under the protection of the high dikes expressed concern about environmental problems caused by the triple cropping of rice all of the farmers in high dike farming systems acknowledged disadvantages of the high dikes such as increased fertiliser and pesticide use nonetheless seven of them observed that rice was a traditional easy to sell crop also the third rice crop which could be produced thanks to the high dikes was credited with eliminating social problems such as drinking wine and playing cards which were typical during the many hours of spare time people otherwise had in the flood season regarding the five farmers who disapproved of the high dikes it was responded that additional profit from triple rice practice is lower than the production costs interviews indicated that farmers with larger lands liked the high dikes even more than farmers with smaller lands because profits from rice cultivation were proportional to the cultivated area three farmers noted the decrease of wild fish stocks and fertile sediments due to the hydropower developments upstream along the mekong river all 33 interviewed farmers from high dike areas agreed that the high dikes had reduced fertile sediment deposition in their rice fields five suggested that the decrease in wild fish and sediment was due to the minor flooding of recent years following the large 2011 flood in dong thap province where fewer high dikes had been constructed seven of the 15 farmers interviewed did not prefer the high dikes dung and jacob 2017 these farmers thus had a distinctly different view from those in an giang they gave several reasons for their opinion i they were unwilling to invest the three year financial contribution required by government for dike construction ii they had heard from neighbours in high dike areas that the profitability of triple crop rice farming was outweighed by negative environmental impacts and increased investment costs and iii farmers saw the low dikes as safeguarding natural benefits of floods and considered the current double cultivation system within low dikes to be good for the soil we found that pressure to convert to triple cropping of rice was still active in the region two farmers noted that local government had held several meetings to encourage farmers to switch from the low dike farming system to the high dike system various constraints were noted for flood based low dike farming i it was difficult to plant the flooded lands if there were strong winds waves or heavy rain ii most farmers were unfamiliar with improved planting techniques iii crop failures due to golden apple snails pomacea canaliculata and water pollution were commonplace iv fishing was dangerous particularly as boats on open waters were exposed to strong winds and waves in the flood season v markets for commodities other than rice were less readily available and less stable than the rice market and vi wild fish stocks had fallen sharply compared to previous years both the interview survey and the literature pointed to numerous farming systems that had been applied in the region we had to narrow these to a feasible selection to keep our analysis from becoming overly complex we selected ten farming system alternatives which we judged as maximising livelihood sustainability that is they appeared to provide the best income potential with the least environmental degradation table 3 half of these 5 were for low dike areas and half 5 were for high dike areas these alternatives were used in the mca process 4 2 multi criteria analysis our groups assigned each criteria and sub criteria weights from 0 to 1 zero 0 signifies the least importance while 1 represents the highest importance thus if three criteria factors were deemed equally important all three would have weights of 0 33 experts and farmers weightings of the three main criteria differed markedly table 4 vietnamese experts considered livelihoods to be the most important criterion 0 46 whereas farmers considered environmental sustainability in land and water to be most important assigning them weightings ranging from 0 50 to 0 57 experts and farmers were in alignment however on flood protection as the least important criterion thus while the experts seemed to be primarily concerned about the livelihoods of farmers in relation to farming systems farmers surprisingly appeared to attach higher importance to sustainability of the soil and water environment than to their livelihoods or floodwater management experts and farmers also differed in their valuations of the sub criteria under the livelihood criterion experts scored profitability 0 24 and infrastructure and public works 0 24 as the most important farmers however scored market stability 0 40 as the most important factor under floodwater management both experts and farmers emphasised the ability to exploit the benefits of floodwaters 0 33 and 0 36 respectively but farmers also valued flood protection 0 32 complexity of operation and externalities were ranked as the least important factors by both experts and farmers under environmental sustainability in land and water experts considered water storage capacity 0 30 and water pollution risk 0 29 as the two foremost factors farmers ranked water pollution risk 0 30 water storage capacity 0 22 and soil fertility 0 21 as most important the mca results show that both experts and farmers preferred the flood based farming systems in low dike areas over all farming systems in the high dike areas table 5 exploiting the benefits of floodwaters for farming was considered the best means of maximising sustainable livelihoods among the farming systems under low dike protection the double vegetable ld2 and double mixed crop ld3 were deemed the best options which involved dry season cultivation combined with floating crops in the flood season although farming systems in the high dike areas were not preferred three farming systems were suggested as the most promising alternatives if the high dikes could not be eliminated these were hd2 double rice vegetables hd3 triple mixed crops and hd4 mixed crops poultry or cattle the triple crop rice farming system hd6 came in the lowest position among both farmers and experts even though this system offers the ability to produce three rice crops in a single cultivation year 5 discussion triple crop rice farming systems implemented under the protection of high dikes have spread throughout the floodplains of the vmd during the past two decades this has greatly reduced the floodplains water retention capacity changed local floodwater dynamics and undermined potential benefits of floodwaters for the agroecology of the delta the effects of climate change and hydropower developments upstream have exacerbated the negative impacts of intensified rice farming particularly with regard to water management regimes and sedimentation loads lu and siew 2006 västilä et al 2010 fredrik 2011 hoang et al 2016 intensive rice production stimulated by national food security policies and reliable and readily available rice markets has resulted in environmental degradation especially in the high dike compartments across the delta livelihoods are becoming less sustainable because the high dike farming systems require increased fertiliser and pesticide applications to maintain rice production levels all of the stakeholders in the current research recognised the need to explore alternatives we started with an interview survey which found a preference among double triple rice farmers for high dikes over low dikes due to the protection that high dikes offered for residential zones and the stability of the national market for rice indeed while high dikes and similar water related infrastructure are costly they are often needed to protect human settlements and property against flood damages moreover high dikes have enabled farmers to cultivate three rice crops per year and thus increase their incomes the market for rice is stable because the vietnamese government has invested great effort over the past 40 years in developing the rice market and the rice processing industry huu nguyen et al 2016 markets for other crops are far less mature as yet in addition rice grains are relatively easily preserved even for long periods of time after harvest so farmers have less need to worry about market risks berg et al 2017 our mca results contradicted the findings of our interview survey according to the mca flood based farming systems under low dike protection were most preferred and acknowledged as the best means of maximising livelihood sustainability experts weighted the livelihood criterion as most important as they supposed farm profitability infrastructure for flood protection and market stability would be most important to farmers farmers however indicated that their greatest concern was environmental sustainability more than 50 of weights underlining the importance of floodwaters for environmental preservation and worries about the negative impacts of soil degradation caused by triple crop rice farming floodwater retention capacity and exploitability of floodwaters benefits were deemed important by both farmers and experts recognising the advantages of flooding for the environment and for farmers livelihoods the heavier weightings assigned to these criteria by both farmers and experts indicate a demand for sustainable farming systems which were provided only by the low dikes our mca results can thus also be interpreted as progressive exposure to an awareness of environmental degradation the mca further validates the earlier findings of the interviews that market stability and flood protection are highly valued as benefits by farmers to invest in and develop flood based farming systems within low dike systems two factors have to be addressed i provision of dependable flood protection for residential zones to safeguard people and their property as well as transportation infrastructure and public services such as hospitals and schools and ii strengthening of markets for other commodities perhaps in association with development of modern food processing and perishable food preservation industries for new products grown in the alternative farming systems the lowest score in the mca assessment was for the farming system with eight rice crops in three years a 3 3 2 cycle similar to chapman and darby 2016 our results suggest inadequate economic and environmental benefit of the 3 3 2 rice system for farmers furthermore chapman et al 2016 indicate that the 3 3 2 cycle did not improve on the triple crop rice system in regard to trapping fertile sediment the system of high dike compartments traps little fertile sediment because the position capacity and physical barrier of the sluice gates carries water differently than floodwaters flowing over low dikes hung et al 2014b moreover farmers tend to use excess rainwater pumped from compartment to compartment instead of irrigation based on floodwaters which bring trapped sediment joep 2015 there is as yet no effective means of trapping sediment for triple crop rice systems it therefore seems recommendable to discontinue or at least to reduce triple cropping of rice thus eliminating the main reason for high dike construction instead of continuing to focus on quantity a shift may be proposed to a greater focus on rice quality for the international market in combination with more concern for the environmental quality of farming systems tong 2017 in addition water and fertiliser managements are also recommended for the whole farming systems jang et al 2012 in line with our mca results most previous studies also found a preference for low dike farming systems over the high dike systems of the vmd käkönen 2008 and trung et al 2013 suggest more government stimulus for developing farming systems under low dikes to reduce agrochemical use from the levels needed for farming in the high dike compartments howie 2011 studied relationships between farmers and the state and among farmers themselves showing increased production costs in high dike farming systems compared to low dike systems kien 2014 conducted a cost benefit analysis and concluded that farming practices under low dike protection had the highest economic benefit compared to those under high dikes or no dikes giz 2014 carried out a cost benefit assessment for four land management change scenarios in an giang that study determined that converting a large proportion of triple crop rice area to seasonal rice plus vegetables could be an optimal future land use in terms of economic profit using a different method to analyse the costs and benefits of dike heightening on the vmd floodplains dan 2015 showed decreased profit from the first and second rice crops due to the higher input costs as the main cost of dike heightening and recommended that rice intensification under high dike protection no longer be encouraged in the vmd iucn and vawr 2016 produced results similar to ours using farmer interviews and focus groups to explore adaptation of farming models for different areas in the mekong delta that research also stressed the need to address the market obstacles associated with non rice crops overall the results of these studies are comparable with our mca finding that low dike farming systems are economically more advantageous than high dike farming systems furthermore the multiple methods used in the current research an interview survey combined with a literature review focus groups and an mca contributes new insights on farmers views of farming systems our two step approach showed initially contradictory results which underlines the importance of the scientific method applied in any research context if we had carried out only the interview survey combined with the literature review or if we had carried out only the mca our conclusions may well have been different for example we may have concluded that the majority of farmers advocated the high dikes since many of the farmers interviewed were enthusiastic about the protection the high dikes offered and the ability to engage in triple crop rice production however the focus group sessions conducted during the mca showed a clear preference among farmers for flood based farming systems with low dikes our combination of the two methods revealed that farmers were aware of the importance of sustainable farming systems but that their livelihoods depend on stable markets and flood safety in the current social and economic context of the delta approaching the problem using these different methods brought out to some extent the dilemma that farmers face the qualitative insights gained in this study on preferred alternative farming systems could be tested in further research across a broader sample of farming communities using quantitative surveys the method used in this study a combined multi criteria analysis mca with analytic hierarchy process ahp could be applied in other areas when comparisons are made on the socio economic and environmental performance of different farming systems the mca ahp method can be used to support decision makers in deciding which farming systems are suitable and effective for improving livelihood sustainability under a set of evaluation criteria i e economic social and environmental perspectives alternatives can be evaluated by different stakeholders with the ahp various levels of pair wised comparisons can be done by weighing and ranking the alternatives options based on a set of criteria mark and patrick 2013 the ahp helps to reduce the inconsistency from stakeholders judgements saaty 2008 in order to apply mca ahp users should address the following three issues first integrate experts recommendations into a set of evaluation criteria that fit the research objective second ensure that participants for the evaluation workshops or focus group are familiar with the farming systems and activities in the study area finally the consistency of stakeholders scores needed to be checked during the process in the pair wise comparisons using ahp 6 conclusions our study uses both interview survey and multi criteria analysis mca to understand stakeholders views on the current and alternative farming systems from a sustainable livelihoods perspective based on the findings of the study three main conclusions are drawn double and triple rice farmers share their concern about environmental degradation of triple rice cultivation in high dikes based on the mca results our surprise to such an extent is that farmers valued the concerns of environmental degradation as the highest weight larger than 50 above concerns for livelihood 28 and floodwater management 17 their concerns for the environment even outweighed those from the experts it shows a strong appreciation of farmers on the detrimental effects of environmental degradation of soil and water in triple rice on their livelihoods and income the progressive and compounding nature of environmental degradation may explain changing attitudes of farmers in their appreciation and valuing of triple rice cultivation and environmental concerns as shown by dung et al 2018a initially benefits of higher rice production outweigh the extra cost and burdens but as deterioration compounds over the years increases in production costs will surpass the gains resulting even in negative results the mca results and valuation of the alternative farming systems provide a clear indication that farmers and experts underwrite the analysis of environmental degradation of triple rice and the prospects for sustainable flood based alternatives as putting forward in recent analysis and the mekong delta plan mdp the ranking of alternative farming systems though not unanimous in system specific preference attributes a clear preference for flood based low dike farming systems addressing environmental concerns and diversification towards higher value crops away from low economic rice this provides scope and support for the mdp recommended priority strategy to stop expanding triple rice cultivation behind high dikes in the upper delta and invest in agricultural flood based or controlled flooding diversification as these alternative systems are only emerging at this stage it will take considerable effort to upscale them to the scale of the vast floodplains of the delta for which a robust support from farmers and stakeholders will be needed the compounding effects of environmental degradation in triple rice may accelerate this process a clear challenge will be to retain the clear benefits of a stable market and flood protection to life and homestead in a diversified flood based livelihood as found as the preference of farmers to the high dike farming systems based on the interview results a failure to attain these may otherwise quickly turn the scales of costs and benefits on these now seemingly attractive alternatives acknowledgement we thank nuffic niche vnm 104 project co funded by the netherlands government and vietnam

11424,irrigation systems aimed to optimize water use efficiency in agriculture have become essential due to the increasing water limitations that agriculture is currently facing assessment of crop responses to different irrigation systems and strategies are therefore encouraged to find the most efficient options for each specific case the main objective of this study was to assess the performance of a citrus crop under a surface si and subsurface drip irrigation ssi with 7 si7 ssi7 or 14 emitters si14 ssi14 per plant as well as a third ss treatment ssia identical to ssi7 but equipped with and additional drip line buried between the tree rows evaluations were made in terms of yield fruit composition irrigation water productivity iwp and water savings results showed that on average water savings were 23 0 in the ssi treatment compared to the si treatment without significant differences in either yield or fruit composition iwp was higher in si14 ssi14 and ssia than in si7 and ssi7 treatments ssia was the treatment with the lowest irrigation volumes and the highest yield and compared to si7 allowed over the three years water savings in the range between 22 4 and 27 9 results from this study illustrate that there is opportunity to substantially save water in citrus production and that further research in this direction is needed to contribute to better optimize the water resources in agriculture keywords water saving citrus soil plant water status fruit quality 1 introduction according to data from the food and agriculture organization www fao org two thirds of the world population are expected to live in regions with water stress conditions by 2025 between 500 and 1000 m3 per year per capita agriculture which is the largest water consuming sector has to adopt methods and strategies to improve crop sustainability provenzano et al 2014 using irrigation techniques that allow water savings without significantly reducing crop yield maximizing economic benefits and protecting environmental quality has been proposed as a possible strategy to approach this challenge rodriguez sinobas et al 2016 spain is one of the largest citrus producers in europe with annual productions higher than 5 million tonnes during the last decade www fao org the main citrus producing region is the valencian community with nearly 3 million tons per year which is equivalent to 60 of the spanish citrus production http gipcitricos ivia es citricultura valenciana because of the semi arid climate of the area and the high crop water requirements there is a growing interest among farmers in implementing strategies aimed to improve the sustainability of the citrus production adoption of efficient irrigation systems associated to water saving strategies based on either simple periodic estimations of the soil water balance terms or precise assessments of temporal and spatial distribution of water exchange processes within the soil plant atmosphere system provenzano et al 2013 may lead to improve crop sustainability compared to other irrigation methods drip irrigation systems provide the possibility to apply lower volumes of water more frequently and efficiently if well designed these systems make it possible to apply slow steady and uniform amounts of water and nutrients within the plant s root zone while minimizing deep percolation and maintaining high productivity levels rallo et al 2011 during the last decades the interest in the use of subsurface drip irrigation ssi in woody perennial crops has increased ssi has been suggested as a promising strategy for a sustainable water management in semiarid regions consoli et al 2014 in this irrigation system water can be uniformly applied directly to the root zone while maintaining a dry soil surface thus minimizing the water loss from evaporation and preventing weeds growth provenzano 2007 ssi has been shown to preserve water in comparison to surface drip irrigation si without compromising yield increasing then water use efficiency consoli et al 2014 robles et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 nevertheless the adoption of ssi has been also associated to some inconveniences such as a high initial cost potential for rodent damage salt accumulation between the drip lines and soil surface and particularly high potential for emitter plugging phene et al 1986 1993 phene 1995 in drip irrigation systems the number of emitters per plant determine the number and dimensions of the wetted bulbs in which roots are mainly concentrated root growth conditions inside the wetting bulbs are considered close to the optimum as water and nutrients are readily available to the plant as result of the high frequency irrigation pereira et al 2010 in tree crops the number of emitters per plant and the spacing between them can be flexible as long as an adequate volume of root zone is provided with enough water to meet canopy water requirement evans et al 2007 smaller the emitter spacing bigger the soil wetted volume and higher is the crop water availability shan et al 2011 recently garcía tejera et al 2017 concluded that under deficit irrigation the wetted area on the soil surface should be reduced in order to decrease soil evaporation while under full irrigation at least 30 40 of the allotted soil per tree should be wetted to maximize trees transpiration a reduced volume of wetted soil implies that a greater fraction of the root system is in dry soil particularly towards the end of the season this is the reason why in horticultural studies lower midday stem water potential ψstem values have been often observed under drip irrigation lampinen et al 2001 intrigliolo and castel 2005 than under furrow irrigation mccutchan and shackel 1992 fereres and goldhamer 2003 the main objective of this work was to assess the performance of citrus trees in terms of plant water status yield fruit quality and irrigation water productivity when i trees were grown under si and ssi ii soil wetted volume was modified by doubling from 7 to 14 the number of emitters per plant in both irrigation systems and iii an additional third line was added in the ssi treatment between tree rows 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental plot the study was conducted during 2014 2015 and 2016 in a commercial citrus orchard planted with citrus clementina hort ex tan arrufatina located in alberique 39 7 31 33 n 0 33 17 06 w valencia spain trees were grafted onto citrange carrizo citrus sinensis osb x poncirus trifoliata raf and planted at spacing of 5 50 m x 4 25 m at the beginning of the experiment the canopy ground cover gc was equal on average to 39 4 4 1 the soil was loam to sandy clay loam texture with percentages of sand silt and clay ranging from 34 4 to 51 6 22 6 to 38 4 and 21 8 to 33 8 respectively within the orchard soil organic matter was on average 1 25 and total organic carbon 0 73 irrigation water had on average for the three seasons an electrical conductivity of 1 33 ds m 1 and ph equal to 7 9 at 25 c the irrigation system was installed in march 2014 this included automatic control valves for each treatment and flow meters to monitor the amount of water applied in each sub plot during an irrigation event trees were provided with 2 3 drip lines depending on the treatment located either above on surface si treatments or below the soil surface subsurface ssi treatments at 0 30 m depth one meter apart from the tree rows in order to avoid possible differences between si and ssi treatments due to root damage while installing the drip lines in treatment ssi one trench at each side of the tree rows was also excavated and filled in the si treatment simulating what was done to install the ssi system other agronomic practices including standard fertilization were the same for all the treatments and controlled by the farmer who followed the ordinary management of the surrounding area 2 2 irrigation strategies and experimental design five irrigation treatments replicated three times 15 sub plots were set according to a complete randomized design fig 1 each sub plot consisted of four rows of 6 7 trees in which 8 10 central trees were selected for sampling purposes within the irrigation treatments two si and two ssi treatments were equipped with drip laterals containing 7 si7 and ssi7 or 14 si14 and ssi14 emitters 2 2 l h 1 azud premier pc as azud alcantarilla murcia spain per tree spaced 1 2 and 0 6 m respectively a further ssi treatment ssia similar to ssi7 was equipped with an additional drip line located between tree rows so that this treatment had a total of 10 11 emitters per plant irrigation was scheduled based on the crop evapotranspiration etc estimated with the single crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 and adjusted by accounting for the dynamic of soil water contents δθ ψstem and weather forecast temperature wind speed and rainfall reference evapotranspiration eto was estimated with the penman monteith equation in the version modified by fao allen et al 1998 by using the meteorological observations acquired by two automatic weather stations located nearby the orchard according to the canopy ground cover the seasonal crop coefficient kc was assumed variable from a minimum of 0 36 in may to a maximum of 0 56 in october in line with the plant physiological stages castel 2000 the si treatments were irrigated to provide 100 of etc in the ssi treatments however just the 80 85 of etc was applied the 15 20 reduction in water applied in ssi was supposed to be the contribution of soil evaporation to the total et as reported in other studies fereres et al 2003 orgaz et al 2006 alves et al 2007 within the si and ssi treatments irrigation timing was then tailored for treatments with different number of emitters per tree in order to provide the same amount of water to all of them that is treatments with 14 emitters per tree for instance were irrigated half of the time that treatments with 7 emitters per tree citrus fruit have a single sigmoid growth curve that can be divided in three stages agustí et al 2003 i a first stage of cell division slow increase in volume ii a second stage of cell enlargement rapid fruit growth and iii a third stage of maturation lower growth than in the second stage precipitation and eto data collected from the weather stations were considered for the whole season as well as for each phase of fruit growth within each year 2 3 monitoring soil and plant water status frequency domain reflectometry fdr water content profile probes enviroscan sentek stepney australia were installed in two plots of treatments si7 and ssi7 fig 1 to monitor soil water content at 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 m depths at 30 min time step based on previous findings bonet et al 2010 the fdr probes were located adjacent to the drip irrigation line and at about 0 10 m from the emitter measurements were used to monitor that soil water content at 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 m ranged between field capacity θfc and a lower limit of 80 of θfc as suggested by bonet et al 2010 readings at 0 7 cm depth were used to verify that there were no water losses due to deep percolation despite fdr probes usually require soil specific calibration to provide accurate estimates of soil water content for coarse textured soils like those characterizing the experimental field the default calibration equation proposed by the manufacturer can be considered valid and fairly accurate provenzano et al 2015 thus fdr probes were not calibrated in this study the ψstem was measured in six trees per treatment two trees per each sub plot by using a scholander pressure chamber model 600 pms instrument co usa measurements were carried out weekly during the months of high evaporative demand and with a lower frequency during the rest of the season in each tree ψstem was measured in two mature leaves bagged in aluminum foil bags at least one hour before the measurements turner 1981 these measurements were used to calculate the water stress integral sψstem mpa day that is considered as a link between short term stress and long term growth response myers 1988 s ψ stem i 1 t ψ stem i c n where ψ s t e m i is the mean midday steam water potential at any time interval i c is a threshold of ψstem below which conditions of water stress occur and n is the number of days in the interval the threshold c was defined by assuming the occurrence of mild stress conditions during the year in particular a value of 0 9 mpa was assumed from january to may and a value of 1 1 mpa from june to harvest the use of these thresholds is based on previous research carried out in the area and aimed to test different irrigation regimes ballester et al 2014 2 4 yield irrigation water

2015 was the rainiest year 309 5 mm with rainfall mainly occurring in phases ii and iii of the fruit growth on the other hand seasonal eto was characterized by a limited variability with values ranging between 758 780 mm for the three years average irrigation depths in all treatments were 389 4 265 4 and 357 6 mm in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively with remarkable differences between treatments compared to si7 that was considered as the control table 2 on average ssi treatments allowed achieving water savings of 21 8 24 7 and 22 4 respectively in 2014 2015 and 2016 when compared to si treatments among the ssi treatments the highest water saving with respect to s7 was obtained in treatment ssia 25 3 on average for the three seasons 3 2 soil water content and plant water status fig 2 shows the seasonal variation of soil water content expressed as percentage of field capacity in the four probes installed in the si7 and ssi7 treatments fig 1 similar θ readings were recorded in probes installed within the same treatment soil water content followed the same trend in both si and ssi treatments over the years although values of θ θfc tended to increase during summer the levels of soil water content in the root zone 10 50 cm depth were always around the field capacity θ θfc 100 fig 3 shows the temporal patterns of ψstem in all treatments during 2014 2015 and 2016 in the same figure thresholds of ψstem used to evaluate the water stress integral as well as rainfall events are also indicated as it can be observed ψstem was above the established thresholds 0 9 and 1 1 mpa large part of the seasons except during spring and summer when values were occasionally lower similar trends were observed in all the treatments although slightly lower ψstem generally was observed in ssi treatments when compared to si likewise treatments with seven emitters per tree had in some periods values of ψstem lower more negative than those in which the number of emitters per plant was double for all treatments table 3 shows the values of sψstem during the three years as well as the corresponding values obtained in each of the examined fruit growth phases it can be noticed that there were phases in which sψstem resulted equal to zero being ψstem always higher less negative than the considered threshold on the contrary there were other periods in which sψstem gradually increased as a consequence of ψstem being lower than threshold by doubling the emitters per plant seasonal sψstem resulted generally lower regardless of the drip line position i e si or ssi treatments however this was not the case during the last experimental season when sψstem in treatment si14 was greater than the one obtained in si7 in general the highest annual sψstem values were registered in treatment ssi7 which reached the absolute maximum value in 2015 with 19 9 mpa day of which 10 8 mpa day were accumulated during the phase i of fruit growth the relationships between crop yield and sψstem displayed a general trend not statistically correlated of declining crop yield at increasing sψstem data not shown 3 3 yield fruit quality and irrigation water productivity in 2014 and 2016 nf was not statistically significant among treatments table 2 nevertheless in 2015 ssi7 had the lowest nf with statistically significant differences with respect to treatments si14 and ssia on the other hand fw in 2015 was similar in all treatments while some differences between treatments were observed in the other two seasons in 2014 fw in treatment si14 was significantly higher than in all the ssi treatments in the last experimental season ssia was the treatment with the highest fw with statistically significant differences compared to treatments si7 ssi7 and ssi14 in spite of these differences in fw registered in 2014 and 2016 no differences in yield were observed between treatments those years only in 2015 when yield was systematically lower than 2014 and 2016 the different treatments produced a certain effect on crop yield in particular ssi7 treatment had the lowest yield which resulted significantly lower than that observed in si14 and ssia the ssia treatment had the highest average crop yield 61 9 kg tree 1 in the three years although with no statistically significant differences with the other treatments yield standard deviation was similar among treatments during the three years with values ranging between 16 and 27 in general the highest average iwp was obtained in the ssi treatment table 2 with increases in 16 5 22 9 and 34 3 in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively compared to the si treatment the highest average iwp 8 89 kg m 3 was obtained in treatment ssia table 4 shows the parameters of fruit quality determined in each season at the time of harvest the irrigation system si or ssi and number of emitters used per tree had a significant effect on tss ta and mi in 2014 and 2016 ssi7 was the treatment with the highest values of tss and mi in contrast with the si14 treatment which had the lowest values in 2015 si14 was again the treatment with the lowest maturity index 4 discussion results obtained in this study showed that the ssi system saved water 23 0 over the three seasons in comparison to the si system with no yield or fruit quality penalties this result is in agreement with recent studies on citrus trees in which water savings between 17 4 and 19 4 in ssi systems did not affect yield either consoli et al 2014 robles et al 2016 in other crop such as pomegranate zhang et al 2017 obtained increases in yield in a ssi system with 10 reductions of water compared to a si system during one year of the study yield was also increased in a study on grapevines when vines were under a ssi system with drip lines installed at 0 35 m depth and 1 20 m from the vine rows pisciotta et al 2018 that was not the case in the work presented here for any of the seasons of study here water reductions in the ssi treatment had a slightly decreasing effect on ψstem mainly during the summer months when the atmospheric evaporative demand was high however only a significant reduction in fruit number and yield was observed in 2015 in the ssi7 treatment which was likely due to the high seasonal sψstem of that treatment most of the stress monitored in trees from ssi7 was concentrated during the phase i of fruit growth which several studies on citrus have reported as the most sensitive stage to water stress castel and buj 1993 gonzález altozano and castel 2000 moreover on may 14 2015 a maximum temperature of 44 5 c was recorded in the study area which could have affected the seasonal crop performance in fact yield in 2015 was significantly lower than in 2014 and 2016 it is important to note that fdr readings showed that soil water content expressed as a percentage of field capacity were close to 100 for most of the time during summer in both si7 and ssi7 treatments fig 2 this was in contrast with the ψstem measurements which as mentioned above indicated that plant water status was slightly different between treatments with lower ψstem values generally observed in treatments ssi than in treatments si fig 3 this result highlights the importance of monitoring the soil plant atmosphere continuum when scheduling irrigation indeed if only fdr readings had been considered in this study plant water needs would have been underestimated in treatments ssi and thus crop performance most likely impaired since different irrigation volumes applied to ssi and si treatments did not affect yield with the exception of the ssi7 treatment in 2015 it could be then speculated that the water savings in this treatment were related to the water losses by soil surface evaporation the same has been suggested by other authors in similar studies on citrus trees under ssi consoli et al 2014 robles et al 2016 investigations aimed at determining the evaporative fraction of an orchard are scarce this is due to the complexity to separate the two components of evapotranspiration as well as to the difficulty to compare studies performed under different conditions soil evaporation has been reported to be a significant part of crop evapotranspiration particularly when the gc is small bonachela et al 2001 in a citrus orchard with a gc 39 similar to that of this study but of a sandy soil villalobos et al 2008 estimated that soil surface evaporation was respectively 32 and 40 of the total evapotranspiration in august and may of two consecutive years other study ruiz rodríguez et al 2017 on citrus orchards with gc ranging between 30 and 40 performed nearby to the area where the present work was conducted obtained by simulating the water balance evaporation rates between 19 0 and 21 1 these values are very close to the water savings obtained in the ssi treatment in this work in agreement with similar studies on ssi systems water savings in treatment ssi in the present work led to a higher iwp 19 5 over the three seasons than in si although differences were not statistically significant table 2 this increase in iwp is lower than that reported by consoli et al 2014 for tarocco sciara orange trees 33 3 but higher than the increase reported for almond trees 13 in romero et al 2004 consoli et al 2014 performed their study in a young orchard where probably soil evaporation was higher than in the present study conducted in a mature orchard and therefore under larger ground cover values regarding the treatments with different wetted soil volumes treatments with 14 emitters per tree as well as the one with the additional drip line had in general higher iwp than treatments with seven emitters per tree particularly under sub surface irrigation when there is not soil evaporation a larger soil wetted volume had a positive effect on plant water status mainly when the atmospheric evaporative demand was high in fact treatments si14 ssi14 and ssia were in general characterized by presenting the lowest seasonal sψstem in addition treatments with a higher number of emitters received slightly less amount of water than the treatments with 7 emitters per tree this also contributed to the higher iwp obtained in the treatments with 14 emitters per trees in apparent contradictions with our findings consoli et al 2017 also in citrus trees found that under partial root zone drying prd iwp increased this was explained because of the lower soil volume wetted however in consoli et al 2017 the prd treatment received lower amount of water than the control which also influenced the reported iwp values it is interesting to notice that ssia treatment which was similar to the ssi7 but with an additional drip line between tree rows led to a more efficient use of water in fact this treatment was set by assuming that the additional drip lines between the tree rows could have promoted the root system development thus facilitating water uptake after irrigation or a rainfall event even if assessment of root growth that could have confirmed this hypothesis was not conducted the results obtained in the ssa treatment lead to think that the additional drip line improves the trees performance when compared to treatment ssi7 ssia was generally subjected to lower water stress as confirmed by the lower seasonal sψstem to which corresponded a significantly higher yield in 2015 and higher fw in 2016 ssia treatment was the one that allowed the highest water savings with respect to the si7 and the highest iwp over the three seasons table 2 nevertheless this study only includes the results obtained during three years after the installation of the ssi system since other factors such as for instance emitter clogging by either roots or soil particles may compromise water delivery in ssi systems evans et al 2007 further research would be necessary to assess the long term crop response overall this study shows that substantial water savings can be obtained by modifying the conventional irrigation practices followed in citrus production using ssi systems in place of the traditional system with drip lines laying on the soil surface irrigation volumes can be reduced more than 20 25 in ssia treatment on average for the three seasons without yield penalty water savings of the same order of magnitude to those observed here ballester et al 2014 gasque et al 2010 or higher 58 consoli et al 2017 have been reported in studies on citrus dealing with partial root zone drying and regulated deficit irrigation rdi strategies in semi arid areas ssi systems coupled with rdi strategies have been used in order to improve water productivity in almond trees with satisfactory productive results romero et al 2004 there is therefore the possibility for water savings in citrus production by combining ssi and rdi further research is however needed to evaluate the potential and practicality of using rdi in commercial ssi citrus orchards 5 conclusions in this study the performance of a citrus orchard in terms of yield fruit quality iwp and water savings was assessed over three years by comparing five treatments with either 7 or 14 emitters per plant under si and ssi systems results indicated that the position of the drip lines as well as the number of emitters per plant are important factors affecting water productivity firstly on average ssi treatments enabled water savings without harming production thus increasing iwp water savings achieved in treatments ssi 23 0 on average are indicative of the amount of soil evaporation accounts in a citrus orchard under the semi arid conditions characterizing the mediterranean climate secondly two alternative drip systems were assessed with seven and fourteen emitters per plant and even with an additional drip line between tree rows treatments with a greater number of emitters per plant were characterized by a better plant water status throughout the study with treatments ssi and especially with ssia an efficient irrigation management without significant crop yield losses was achieved however a cost benefit analysis could allow evaluating the financial feasibility of the different irrigation systems design

11424,irrigation systems aimed to optimize water use efficiency in agriculture have become essential due to the increasing water limitations that agriculture is currently facing assessment of crop responses to different irrigation systems and strategies are therefore encouraged to find the most efficient options for each specific case the main objective of this study was to assess the performance of a citrus crop under a surface si and subsurface drip irrigation ssi with 7 si7 ssi7 or 14 emitters si14 ssi14 per plant as well as a third ss treatment ssia identical to ssi7 but equipped with and additional drip line buried between the tree rows evaluations were made in terms of yield fruit composition irrigation water productivity iwp and water savings results showed that on average water savings were 23 0 in the ssi treatment compared to the si treatment without significant differences in either yield or fruit composition iwp was higher in si14 ssi14 and ssia than in si7 and ssi7 treatments ssia was the treatment with the lowest irrigation volumes and the highest yield and compared to si7 allowed over the three years water savings in the range between 22 4 and 27 9 results from this study illustrate that there is opportunity to substantially save water in citrus production and that further research in this direction is needed to contribute to better optimize the water resources in agriculture keywords water saving citrus soil plant water status fruit quality 1 introduction according to data from the food and agriculture organization www fao org two thirds of the world population are expected to live in regions with water stress conditions by 2025 between 500 and 1000 m3 per year per capita agriculture which is the largest water consuming sector has to adopt methods and strategies to improve crop sustainability provenzano et al 2014 using irrigation techniques that allow water savings without significantly reducing crop yield maximizing economic benefits and protecting environmental quality has been proposed as a possible strategy to approach this challenge rodriguez sinobas et al 2016 spain is one of the largest citrus producers in europe with annual productions higher than 5 million tonnes during the last decade www fao org the main citrus producing region is the valencian community with nearly 3 million tons per year which is equivalent to 60 of the spanish citrus production http gipcitricos ivia es citricultura valenciana because of the semi arid climate of the area and the high crop water requirements there is a growing interest among farmers in implementing strategies aimed to improve the sustainability of the citrus production adoption of efficient irrigation systems associated to water saving strategies based on either simple periodic estimations of the soil water balance terms or precise assessments of temporal and spatial distribution of water exchange processes within the soil plant atmosphere system provenzano et al 2013 may lead to improve crop sustainability compared to other irrigation methods drip irrigation systems provide the possibility to apply lower volumes of water more frequently and efficiently if well designed these systems make it possible to apply slow steady and uniform amounts of water and nutrients within the plant s root zone while minimizing deep percolation and maintaining high productivity levels rallo et al 2011 during the last decades the interest in the use of subsurface drip irrigation ssi in woody perennial crops has increased ssi has been suggested as a promising strategy for a sustainable water management in semiarid regions consoli et al 2014 in this irrigation system water can be uniformly applied directly to the root zone while maintaining a dry soil surface thus minimizing the water loss from evaporation and preventing weeds growth provenzano 2007 ssi has been shown to preserve water in comparison to surface drip irrigation si without compromising yield increasing then water use efficiency consoli et al 2014 robles et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 nevertheless the adoption of ssi has been also associated to some inconveniences such as a high initial cost potential for rodent damage salt accumulation between the drip lines and soil surface and particularly high potential for emitter plugging phene et al 1986 1993 phene 1995 in drip irrigation systems the number of emitters per plant determine the number and dimensions of the wetted bulbs in which roots are mainly concentrated root growth conditions inside the wetting bulbs are considered close to the optimum as water and nutrients are readily available to the plant as result of the high frequency irrigation pereira et al 2010 in tree crops the number of emitters per plant and the spacing between them can be flexible as long as an adequate volume of root zone is provided with enough water to meet canopy water requirement evans et al 2007 smaller the emitter spacing bigger the soil wetted volume and higher is the crop water availability shan et al 2011 recently garcía tejera et al 2017 concluded that under deficit irrigation the wetted area on the soil surface should be reduced in order to decrease soil evaporation while under full irrigation at least 30 40 of the allotted soil per tree should be wetted to maximize trees transpiration a reduced volume of wetted soil implies that a greater fraction of the root system is in dry soil particularly towards the end of the season this is the reason why in horticultural studies lower midday stem water potential ψstem values have been often observed under drip irrigation lampinen et al 2001 intrigliolo and castel 2005 than under furrow irrigation mccutchan and shackel 1992 fereres and goldhamer 2003 the main objective of this work was to assess the performance of citrus trees in terms of plant water status yield fruit quality and irrigation water productivity when i trees were grown under si and ssi ii soil wetted volume was modified by doubling from 7 to 14 the number of emitters per plant in both irrigation systems and iii an additional third line was added in the ssi treatment between tree rows 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental plot the study was conducted during 2014 2015 and 2016 in a commercial citrus orchard planted with citrus clementina hort ex tan arrufatina located in alberique 39 7 31 33 n 0 33 17 06 w valencia spain trees were grafted onto citrange carrizo citrus sinensis osb x poncirus trifoliata raf and planted at spacing of 5 50 m x 4 25 m at the beginning of the experiment the canopy ground cover gc was equal on average to 39 4 4 1 the soil was loam to sandy clay loam texture with percentages of sand silt and clay ranging from 34 4 to 51 6 22 6 to 38 4 and 21 8 to 33 8 respectively within the orchard soil organic matter was on average 1 25 and total organic carbon 0 73 irrigation water had on average for the three seasons an electrical conductivity of 1 33 ds m 1 and ph equal to 7 9 at 25 c the irrigation system was installed in march 2014 this included automatic control valves for each treatment and flow meters to monitor the amount of water applied in each sub plot during an irrigation event trees were provided with 2 3 drip lines depending on the treatment located either above on surface si treatments or below the soil surface subsurface ssi treatments at 0 30 m depth one meter apart from the tree rows in order to avoid possible differences between si and ssi treatments due to root damage while installing the drip lines in treatment ssi one trench at each side of the tree rows was also excavated and filled in the si treatment simulating what was done to install the ssi system other agronomic practices including standard fertilization were the same for all the treatments and controlled by the farmer who followed the ordinary management of the surrounding area 2 2 irrigation strategies and experimental design five irrigation treatments replicated three times 15 sub plots were set according to a complete randomized design fig 1 each sub plot consisted of four rows of 6 7 trees in which 8 10 central trees were selected for sampling purposes within the irrigation treatments two si and two ssi treatments were equipped with drip laterals containing 7 si7 and ssi7 or 14 si14 and ssi14 emitters 2 2 l h 1 azud premier pc as azud alcantarilla murcia spain per tree spaced 1 2 and 0 6 m respectively a further ssi treatment ssia similar to ssi7 was equipped with an additional drip line located between tree rows so that this treatment had a total of 10 11 emitters per plant irrigation was scheduled based on the crop evapotranspiration etc estimated with the single crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 and adjusted by accounting for the dynamic of soil water contents δθ ψstem and weather forecast temperature wind speed and rainfall reference evapotranspiration eto was estimated with the penman monteith equation in the version modified by fao allen et al 1998 by using the meteorological observations acquired by two automatic weather stations located nearby the orchard according to the canopy ground cover the seasonal crop coefficient kc was assumed variable from a minimum of 0 36 in may to a maximum of 0 56 in october in line with the plant physiological stages castel 2000 the si treatments were irrigated to provide 100 of etc in the ssi treatments however just the 80 85 of etc was applied the 15 20 reduction in water applied in ssi was supposed to be the contribution of soil evaporation to the total et as reported in other studies fereres et al 2003 orgaz et al 2006 alves et al 2007 within the si and ssi treatments irrigation timing was then tailored for treatments with different number of emitters per tree in order to provide the same amount of water to all of them that is treatments with 14 emitters per tree for instance were irrigated half of the time that treatments with 7 emitters per tree citrus fruit have a single sigmoid growth curve that can be divided in three stages agustí et al 2003 i a first stage of cell division slow increase in volume ii a second stage of cell enlargement rapid fruit growth and iii a third stage of maturation lower growth than in the second stage precipitation and eto data collected from the weather stations were considered for the whole season as well as for each phase of fruit growth within each year 2 3 monitoring soil and plant water status frequency domain reflectometry fdr water content profile probes enviroscan sentek stepney australia were installed in two plots of treatments si7 and ssi7 fig 1 to monitor soil water content at 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 m depths at 30 min time step based on previous findings bonet et al 2010 the fdr probes were located adjacent to the drip irrigation line and at about 0 10 m from the emitter measurements were used to monitor that soil water content at 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 m ranged between field capacity θfc and a lower limit of 80 of θfc as suggested by bonet et al 2010 readings at 0 7 cm depth were used to verify that there were no water losses due to deep percolation despite fdr probes usually require soil specific calibration to provide accurate estimates of soil water content for coarse textured soils like those characterizing the experimental field the default calibration equation proposed by the manufacturer can be considered valid and fairly accurate provenzano et al 2015 thus fdr probes were not calibrated in this study the ψstem was measured in six trees per treatment two trees per each sub plot by using a scholander pressure chamber model 600 pms instrument co usa measurements were carried out weekly during the months of high evaporative demand and with a lower frequency during the rest of the season in each tree ψstem was measured in two mature leaves bagged in aluminum foil bags at least one hour before the measurements turner 1981 these measurements were used to calculate the water stress integral sψstem mpa day that is considered as a link between short term stress and long term growth response myers 1988 s ψ stem i 1 t ψ stem i c n where ψ s t e m i is the mean midday steam water potential at any time interval i c is a threshold of ψstem below which conditions of water stress occur and n is the number of days in the interval the threshold c was defined by assuming the occurrence of mild stress conditions during the year in particular a value of 0 9 mpa was assumed from january to may and a value of 1 1 mpa from june to harvest the use of these thresholds is based on previous research carried out in the area and aimed to test different irrigation regimes ballester et al 2014 2 4 yield irrigation water productivity and fruit quality yield number of fruit per tree nf and average fruit fresh weight fw were determined at the time of commercial harvest in all the sampled trees fig 1 fw was determined from the total weight and the number of fruits of each tree irrigation water productivity iwp kg m3 was calculated as the ratio between crop yield and seasonal irrigation volume applied pereira et al 2012 fruit quality was measured at harvest by sampling 25 fruits per sub plot three independent samples per treatment randomly collected from all the sampled trees of each treatment fruit was weighed squeezed with a juice machine zumonat model c 40 barcelona spain and filtered juice titratable acidity ta was determined by titration with 0 1 n naoh metrohm 785 dmp titrino and juice total soluble solids content tss was measured with a temperature compensated digital refractometer atago palette pr 101 the maturity index mi was calculated as the ratio between soluble solids and acidity 2 5 data analysis data were analyzed by the analysis of variance anova using statgraphics x64 and when statistically significant differences were found p 0 05 means were compared by the fisher s least significant difference lsd test at probability level of p 0 05 the relationships between yield and seasonal irrigation depth were also explored 3 results 3 1 meteorological data and seasonal irrigation volumes average precipitation and eto recorded during the three seasons of study as well as for each of the three phases of fruit growth are summarized in table 1 it was assumed that phase i of fruit growth started on day of the year doy 121 in 2014 on doy 127 in 2015 and on doy 124 in 2016 phase ii was considered to cover from doy 190 to 262 in 2014 from doy 181 to 258 in 2015 and from doy 180 to 258 in 2016 finally phase iii was considered to take place from the end of phase ii until harvesting which occurred on doy 309 300 and 295 in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively among years 2015 was the rainiest year 309 5 mm with rainfall mainly occurring in phases ii and iii of the fruit growth on the other hand seasonal eto was characterized by a limited variability with values ranging between 758 780 mm for the three years average irrigation depths in all treatments were 389 4 265 4 and 357 6 mm in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively with remarkable differences between treatments compared to si7 that was considered as the control table 2 on average ssi treatments allowed achieving water savings of 21 8 24 7 and 22 4 respectively in 2014 2015 and 2016 when compared to si treatments among the ssi treatments the highest water saving with respect to s7 was obtained in treatment ssia 25 3 on average for the three seasons 3 2 soil water content and plant water status fig 2 shows the seasonal variation of soil water content expressed as percentage of field capacity in the four probes installed in the si7 and ssi7 treatments fig 1 similar θ readings were recorded in probes installed within the same treatment soil water content followed the same trend in both si and ssi treatments over the years although values of θ θfc tended to increase during summer the levels of soil water content in the root zone 10 50 cm depth were always around the field capacity θ θfc 100 fig 3 shows the temporal patterns of ψstem in all treatments during 2014 2015 and 2016 in the same figure thresholds of ψstem used to evaluate the water stress integral as well as rainfall events are also indicated as it can be observed ψstem was above the established thresholds 0 9 and 1 1 mpa large part of the seasons except during spring and summer when values were occasionally lower similar trends were observed in all the treatments although slightly lower ψstem generally was observed in ssi treatments when compared to si likewise treatments with seven emitters per tree had in some periods values of ψstem lower more negative than those in which the number of emitters per plant was double for all treatments table 3 shows the values of sψstem during the three years as well as the corresponding values obtained in each of the examined fruit growth phases it can be noticed that there were phases in which sψstem resulted equal to zero being ψstem always higher less negative than the considered threshold on the contrary there were other periods in which sψstem gradually increased as a consequence of ψstem being lower than threshold by doubling the emitters per plant seasonal sψstem resulted generally lower regardless of the drip line position i e si or ssi treatments however this was not the case during the last experimental season when sψstem in treatment si14 was greater than the one obtained in si7 in general the highest annual sψstem values were registered in treatment ssi7 which reached the absolute maximum value in 2015 with 19 9 mpa day of which 10 8 mpa day were accumulated during the phase i of fruit growth the relationships between crop yield and sψstem displayed a general trend not statistically correlated of declining crop yield at increasing sψstem data not shown 3 3 yield fruit quality and irrigation water productivity in 2014 and 2016 nf was not statistically significant among treatments table 2 nevertheless in 2015 ssi7 had the lowest nf with statistically significant differences with respect to treatments si14 and ssia on the other hand fw in 2015 was similar in all treatments while some differences between treatments were observed in the other two seasons in 2014 fw in treatment si14 was significantly higher than in all the ssi treatments in the last experimental season ssia was the treatment with the highest fw with statistically significant differences compared to treatments si7 ssi7 and ssi14 in spite of these differences in fw registered in 2014 and 2016 no differences in yield were observed between treatments those years only in 2015 when yield was systematically lower than 2014 and 2016 the different treatments produced a certain effect on crop yield in particular ssi7 treatment had the lowest yield which resulted significantly lower than that observed in si14 and ssia the ssia treatment had the highest average crop yield 61 9 kg tree 1 in the three years although with no statistically significant differences with the other treatments yield standard deviation was similar among treatments during the three years with values ranging between 16 and 27 in general the highest average iwp was obtained in the ssi treatment table 2 with increases in 16 5 22 9 and 34 3 in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively compared to the si treatment the highest average iwp 8 89 kg m 3 was obtained in treatment ssia table 4 shows the parameters of fruit quality determined in each season at the time of harvest the irrigation system si or ssi and number of emitters used per tree had a significant effect on tss ta and mi in 2014 and 2016 ssi7 was the treatment with the highest values of tss and mi in contrast with the si14 treatment which had the lowest values in 2015 si14 was again the treatment with the lowest maturity index 4 discussion results obtained in this study showed that the ssi system saved water 23 0 over the three seasons in comparison to the si system with no yield or fruit quality penalties this result is in agreement with recent studies on citrus trees in which water savings between 17 4 and 19 4 in ssi systems did not affect yield either consoli et al 2014 robles et al 2016 in other crop such as pomegranate zhang et al 2017 obtained increases in yield in a ssi system with 10 reductions of water compared to a si system during one year of the study yield was also increased in a study on grapevines when vines were under a ssi system with drip lines installed at 0 35 m depth and 1 20 m from the vine rows pisciotta et al 2018 that was not the case in the work presented here for any of the seasons of study here water reductions in the ssi treatment had a slightly decreasing effect on ψstem mainly during the summer months when the atmospheric evaporative demand was high however only a significant reduction in fruit number and yield was observed in 2015 in the ssi7 treatment which was likely due to the high seasonal sψstem of that treatment most of the stress monitored in trees from ssi7 was concentrated during the phase i of fruit growth which several studies on citrus have reported as the most sensitive stage to water stress castel and buj 1993 gonzález altozano and castel 2000 moreover on may 14 2015 a maximum temperature of 44 5 c was recorded in the study area which could have affected the seasonal crop performance in fact yield in 2015 was significantly lower than in 2014 and 2016 it is important to note that fdr readings showed that soil water content expressed as a percentage of field capacity were close to 100 for most of the time during summer in both si7 and ssi7 treatments fig 2 this was in contrast with the ψstem measurements which as mentioned above indicated that plant water status was slightly different between treatments with lower ψstem values generally observed in treatments ssi than in treatments si fig 3 this result highlights the importance of monitoring the soil plant atmosphere continuum when scheduling irrigation indeed if only fdr readings had been considered in this study plant water needs would have been underestimated in treatments ssi and thus crop performance most likely impaired since different irrigation volumes applied to ssi and si treatments did not affect yield with the exception of the ssi7 treatment in 2015 it could be then speculated that the water savings in this treatment were related to the water losses by soil surface evaporation the same has been suggested by other authors in similar studies on citrus trees under ssi consoli et al 2014 robles et al 2016 investigations aimed at determining the evaporative fraction of an orchard are scarce this is due to the complexity to separate the two components of evapotranspiration as well as to the difficulty to compare studies performed under different conditions soil evaporation has been reported to be a significant part of crop evapotranspiration particularly when the gc is small bonachela et al 2001 in a citrus orchard with a gc 39 similar to that of this study but of a sandy soil villalobos et al 2008 estimated that soil surface evaporation was respectively 32 and 40 of the total evapotranspiration in august and may of two consecutive years other study ruiz rodríguez et al 2017 on citrus orchards with gc ranging between 30 and 40 performed nearby to the area where the present work was conducted obtained by simulating the water balance evaporation rates between 19 0 and 21 1 these values are very close to the water savings obtained in the ssi treatment in this work in agreement with similar studies on ssi systems water savings in treatment ssi in the present work led to a higher iwp 19 5 over the three seasons than in si although differences were not statistically significant table 2 this increase in iwp is lower than that reported by consoli et al 2014 for tarocco sciara orange trees 33 3 but higher than the increase reported for almond trees 13 in romero et al 2004 consoli et al 2014 performed their study in a young orchard where probably soil evaporation was higher than in the present study conducted in a mature orchard and therefore under larger ground cover values regarding the treatments with different wetted soil volumes treatments with 14 emitters per tree as well as the one with the additional drip line had in general higher iwp than treatments with seven emitters per tree particularly under sub surface irrigation when there is not soil evaporation a larger soil wetted volume had a positive effect on plant water status mainly when the atmospheric evaporative demand was high in fact treatments si14 ssi14 and ssia were in general characterized by presenting the lowest seasonal sψstem in addition treatments with a higher number of emitters received slightly less amount of water than the treatments with 7 emitters per tree this also contributed to the higher iwp obtained in the treatments with 14 emitters per trees in apparent contradictions with our findings consoli et al 2017 also in citrus trees found that under partial root zone drying prd iwp increased this was explained because of the lower soil volume wetted however in consoli et al 2017 the prd treatment received lower amount of water than the control which also influenced the reported iwp values it is interesting to notice that ssia treatment which was similar to the ssi7 but with an additional drip line between tree rows led to a more efficient use of water in fact this treatment was set by assuming that the additional drip lines between the tree rows could have promoted the root system development thus facilitating water uptake after irrigation or a rainfall event even if assessment of root growth that could have confirmed this hypothesis was not conducted the results obtained in the ssa treatment lead to think that the additional drip line improves the trees performance when compared to treatment ssi7 ssia was generally subjected to lower water stress as confirmed by the lower seasonal sψstem to which corresponded a significantly higher yield in 2015 and higher fw in 2016 ssia treatment was the one that allowed the highest water savings with respect to the si7 and the highest iwp over the three seasons table 2 nevertheless this study only includes the results obtained during three years after the installation of the ssi system since other factors such as for instance emitter clogging by either roots or soil particles may compromise water delivery in ssi systems evans et al 2007 further research would be necessary to assess the long term crop response overall this study shows that substantial water savings can be obtained by modifying the conventional irrigation practices followed in citrus production using ssi systems in place of the traditional system with drip lines laying on the soil surface irrigation volumes can be reduced more than 20 25 in ssia treatment on average for the three seasons without yield penalty water savings of the same order of magnitude to those observed here ballester et al 2014 gasque et al 2010 or higher 58 consoli et al 2017 have been reported in studies on citrus dealing with partial root zone drying and regulated deficit irrigation rdi strategies in semi arid areas ssi systems coupled with rdi strategies have been used in order to improve water productivity in almond trees with satisfactory productive results romero et al 2004 there is therefore the possibility for water savings in citrus production by combining ssi and rdi further research is however needed to evaluate the potential and practicality of using rdi in commercial ssi citrus orchards 5 conclusions in this study the performance of a citrus orchard in terms of yield fruit quality iwp and water savings was assessed over three years by comparing five treatments with either 7 or 14 emitters per plant under si and ssi systems results indicated that the position of the drip lines as well as the number of emitters per plant are important factors affecting water productivity firstly on average ssi treatments enabled water savings without harming production thus increasing iwp water savings achieved in treatments ssi 23 0 on average are indicative of the amount of soil evaporation accounts in a citrus orchard under the semi arid conditions characterizing the mediterranean climate secondly two alternative drip systems were assessed with seven and fourteen emitters per plant and even with an additional drip line between tree rows treatments with a greater number of emitters per plant were characterized by a better plant water status throughout the study with treatments ssi and especially with ssia an efficient irrigation management without significant crop yield losses was achieved however a cost benefit analysis could allow evaluating the financial feasibility of the different irrigation systems design
