13455,suspended microcrystalline polymer flooding is a new promising eor technology developed to improve oil recovery from high ca and mg reservoirs however as the technology is currently in the research and field experimental stage the characteristics of its produced water and the corresponding water treatment methods are still not clear in this study the effects of polymer concentration on physical characteristics of the three simulated produced waters namely polymer flooding produced water pfpw high ca and mg pfpw hpfpw and suspended microcrystalline pfpw smpfpw were investigated to understand the particularity of smpfpw pattern of oil droplet diameters in smpfpw exhibited a bimodal distribution with peak diameters at 4 and 150 μm the viscosities of three waters are smpfpw pfpw hfpw in descending order the absolute ζ potential of smpfpw was 1 01 2 42 times higher than that of hpfpw but was substantially lower than that of pfpw due to high ionic strength at same polymer concentrations 0 300 mg l the oil content in smpfpw is 1 78 2 47 times that in hpfpw and 1 49 1 87 times that in pfpw because of its unique spatial structure of polymers from degreasing experiments oil removal rate of smpfpw by gravity sedimentation is higher than that of pfpw but slightly lower than that of hpfpw polymer concentration play vital roles in oil water separation an inexpensive and practical routine gravity sedimentation coupled with two stage composite material filtration for oil removal is proposed for smpfpw on the basis of lab experiments keywords polymer flooding microcrystals produced water degreasing 1 introduction polymer flooding technique is effective means to improve the oil recovery in mid and late stage oilfields 1 3 however limited clean water resources and restrictions on the discharge of the produced water have to some extent affected the development of polymer flooding technology in some oilfields reinjection after treatment of the produced water has become a widely used solution 4 7 as related researches progress various polymer flooding technologies suitable for special reservoir environments e g high temperature and high salinity are researched and developed several researchers have proposed high temperature and high salinity resistant polymers 8 11 there have also been some studies proposing polymer chemical flooding techniques with help of nanoparticles 12 15 which demonstrates high application potential besides a lot of researches on the effects of polymers on the properties of produced water and the treatment of produced water also have been carried out 16 18 produced water from commonly used polymer flooding alkali surfactant polymer flooding and surfactant polymer flooding techniques are stable oil in water emulsion with various levels of oil content inconstant degree of emulsification different viscosities and residual chemical additives e g alkalis surfactants and polymers 16 19 degreasing is necessary before the produced water being reinjected previous research showed that the presence of chemical additives can greatly reduce the interfacial tension between water and oil droplets 20 22 which is essential in affecting emulsion stability of the system it was reported that polymers in alkali surfactant polymer flooding produced water can on one hand greatly increase viscosity and oil water interface film strength of the system and hinder the separation of oil and water on the other hand it can also make the oil droplets flocculation and agglomeration promoting the separation of oil and water 23 25 besides semi hydrolyzed polyacrylamide hpam is believed to be capable of increasing system viscosity oil water interfacial tension absolute ζ potential and interfacial expansion viscoelasticity of oil droplets making oil droplets less likely to aggregate and increasing the difficulty of oil water separation 26 hpam residue in produced water can also influence the flocculation in degreasing process 27 in addition to chemical additives in high salinity oilfield the produced water would be inevitably rich in metal ions such as calcium and magnesium ions that originate from deep formation waters 28 these ions can greatly inhibit the thickening and oil repellent ability of conventional polymers 29 and tend to scale and clog pipes a reduction in salinity and hardness is also necessary before further treatment or reuse 30 in 2015 jia and his team proposed a suspended microcrystalline polymer flooding technique 21 22 nucleating agent such as na2co3 or nahco3 and dispersing agent such as sodium polyacrylate was added to aqueous solution of common polymer bearing formation water the system was then stirred to obtain a suspended microcrystalline polymer system in which ca and mg ions additives and polymer molecules form a three dimensional spatial lattice structure this technique can effectively shield the influence of ca and mg ions on polymers however the practical application of this technology is still at indoor and preliminary field trial stage and the water quality characteristics of the produced water and applicable oil removal methods are still unattended on one hand the effect of solid particles in polymer flooding solutions is multidimensional researches have shown that silicon dioxide nanoparticles can form an ionic dipole with cations in water reducing the effect of these ions on polymer viscosity 31 silicon dioxide nanoparticles can also improve solution viscosity 32 thus increase difficulty of separating oil and water it has been reported that solid particles in oil in water emulsions can increase oil water interfacial tension interfacial shear viscosity and negative ζ potential 33 34 however suspended microcrystals are micron sized particles formed by the reaction of crystallizers with native ca and mg ions which are different from the exogenous nanoparticles in terms of origin size and distribution and these differences are likely to have unpredictable effects on the properties of the produced water on the other hand researches are generally focused on common polymer flooding produced water treatment currently the mainstream oil removal techniques include physical chemical and biological methods physical treatment includes traditional gravity induced sedimentation filtration and those have been proposed since recent years such as microwave ultrasonic and electrocoagulation methods 35 38 chemical methods destabilize the oil water emulsion system by the addition of chemical reagents for instance the application of emulsion breakers flocculants and membranes 16 18 23 biological methods primarily use screened and domesticated microorganisms to degrade polymers and remove oil from produced water 6 39 40 but few research has done to evaluate the performance of these treatment methods for suspended microcrystalline polymer flooding produced water smpfpw and little is known about distribution of the microcrystals and its coexistence form with oil droplets to investigate the influence of suspended microcrystalline system on the nature of the produced water and on the subsequent oil removal performance the water quality characteristics including oil content oil droplet size ζ potential and viscosity of smpfpw high ca and mg suspended microcrystalline polymer flooding produced water hpfpw high ca and mg polymer flooding produced water and pfpw normal polymer flooding produced water were analyzed based on simulated produced water besides the effect of polymer concentration on water quality characteristics of smpfpw was investigated and traditional methods such as gravity sedimentation flocculation sedimentation and filtration were carried out for oil removal of smpfpw in order to have a comprehensive understanding of this new type of produced water and to provide a basis for the development of more appropriate water treatment solutions for smpfpw in the future 2 materials

aluminum ferric chloride pafc polymeric aluminum chloride pac and polymeric ferric sulfate pfs from tenglong water treatment materials company china filter materials were carborundum walnut shell and anthracite from henan boyang water treatment materials co ltd china the viscosity of simulated produced water was measured using a lvdv 1 viscometer the ζ potential was measured using a zetasizer nano the oil droplet size and suspended particle size were measured using an ms2000 micron particle size analyzer 100 nm 1000 μm and the oil content in liquid samples was measured using an oil 460 ir spectrometer 2 2 simulation of produced water to understand the nature and characteristics of the produced water from high ca and mg oilfield after the implementation of suspended microcrystalline polymer flooding and to conduct corresponding produced water degreasing experiments we simulated three kinds of polymer flooding produced water based on treated water from a water treatment station because the suspended microcrystalline polymer flooding technique has not been applied in oilfield yet different raw waters are used to simulate three produced waters namely pfpw normal polymer flooding produced water hpfpw high ca and mg polymer flooding produced water and smpfpw high ca and mg suspended microcrystalline polymer flooding produced water three kinds of raw waters are tap water ca2 mg2 450 mg l tds 1000 mg l high ca and mg water see table 1 for water quality ca2 mg2 1000 mg l tds 20 000 mg l high ca and mg water crystallizer was added with recommended concentration of 1500 mg l to form suspended microcrystals in advance respectively detailed synthesis steps are as follows 1 put the crude oil and the three types of raw water in separate beakers and kept them at a constant temperature of 70 2 c 2 three 1000 mg l hpam stock solutions were prepared from these raw waters 3 polymer solutions with hpam concentrations of 50 100 150 200 250 and 300 mg l were made from dilution of 12 5 25 37 5 50 62 5 and 75 ml of hpam stock solution respectively to 250 ml with the corresponding raw water 4 1 0 g crude oil was added to these polymer solutions which were then stirred at 16 000 rpm for 2 min and allowed to stand for 2 h to obtain simulated produced waters 5 water from the middle layer of the solution was taken to conduct water quality characteristic measurements simulated produced waters with different concentrations of polymers for subsequent oil removal experiments were stirred at adjusted speed and for adjusted time to obtain similar initial oil content and various amounts of crude oil or tween 80 surfactant were used to meet different experimental needs detailed oil removal experiments are described in following paragraphs 2 3 oil removal experiments fig 1 shows the set up for oil removal experiments the experiment is based on the operating parameters of the qinghe oilfield water flooding produced water treatment station and is an improved and combinable process for evaluating the removal of oil from produced water the set up includes produced water simulation tank sedimentation tank flocculation tank primary filtration column and secondary filtration column the oil removal experiments briefly include 1 a simulated oil bearing water flooding produced water and the above mentioned three types of simulated polymer flooding produced water polymer concentration of 100 mg l with initial oil content of about 1150 mg l were placed in a sedimentation tank for 24 h for oil water separation the oil content was measured every 2 h to investigate the effect of sedimentation on the oil removal of different types of simulated produced waters 2 smpfpw with initial polymer concentrations of 0 200 mg l was subjected to oil water separation in sedimentation tank for 24 h the oil content was measured every 2 h to investigate the influence of polymer concentration on oil removal performance of smpfpw by sedimentation same degreasing and evaluation experiment was carried out again after connecting sedimentation tank with a primary filtration column which is similar to the existing water flooding produced water wfpw treatment method in qinghe oilfield 3 choose proper filter materials and flocculant and improve the treatment set up by adding flocculation tank or secondary filtration column evaluate the performance of different improvements by comparing oil contents of outflow waters 3 result and discussion 3 1 characteristics of simulated produced water 3 1 1 effect of suspended microcrystalline polymers on the size of oil droplets three simulated produced waters pfpw hpfpw and smpfpw with polymer content of 50 100 150 200 250 and 300 mg l were synthesized under same conditions and their oil droplet size viscosity ζ potential and oil content were determined according to above mentioned methods as is shown in fig 2 the diameter of oil droplets in pfpw hpfpw and smpfpw ranged from 0 3 700 μm 1 700 μm and 1 1000 μm respectively the oil droplet size of pfpw and smpfpw showed a bimodal distribution while that of hpfpw showed a trimodal distribution with increasing polymer concentration the peak diameter of oil droplets in pfpw and smpfpw was transformed from 150 μm to 1 6 μm and 4 μm respectively hpfpw also showed an increase in the proportion of small droplets and a decrease in the proportion of large droplets demonstrating a three peak distribution with peaks at 3 5 μm 20 μm and 150 μm research has shown that flocculation of oil droplets occurs at low polymer concentrations due to the bridging effect of polymer molecules adsorbed on the oil droplets but when polymer concentration is higher than a certain critical value the thickening effect of the polymer would be detrimental to the flocculation of oil droplets 24 25 the higher the molecular weight of the polymer the lower the critical concentration polymers with molecular weights of 2 72 million 4 0 million and 8 0 million are not conducive to the incorporation of oil droplets at their concentrations greater than 400 mg l 200 mg l and 100 mg l respectively 24 25 however our experimental results show that the oil droplet size tends to become smaller when the polymer content increases a polymer with a molecular mass of 15 million was used in this experiment according to deng the critical polymer concentration is presumed to be less than 100 mg l it is likely that the thickening effect caused by increasing polymer concentration is greater than the flocculation effect within our experimental gradient range 50 mg l 300 mg l hpam study has shown that the oil droplets in water have a certain charge after polymer adsorption when ionic strength increases the ions with opposite charge will gather around the oil droplets which shields the charge on the surface of the oil droplets increasing the possibility of collision and aggregation between the oil droplets and making the oil droplet size tend to be larger 41 which explains why hpfpw and smpfpw have larger oil droplet size at smaller end of the spectrum than that of pfpw it is noteworthy that the oil droplet size distribution pattern of hpfpw at low polymer contents showed a considerable proportion of small sized oil droplets with diameter around 5 μm which is significantly different from that of the other two produced waters the reason is currently unknown it has been suggested that the increase in viscosity caused by the polymer can affect to some extent the shear effect when synthesizing produced water and that the higher the shear stress the smaller the oil droplets 42 the case of hpfpw probably originates from combined influence from divalent cation ions on polymer thickening effect in hpfpw and different zeta potential or shear stress during stirring in summary oil droplet size of smpfpw is slightly larger than that of pfpw while the distribution and transformation pattern is similar to that of pfpw 3 2 effect of suspended microcrystalline polymers on viscosity the viscosity of smpfpw was highest in the three produced waters within given polymer concentration range and the viscosity of the three produced waters increased to varying degrees with increasing polymer concentration as a result of the polymer thickening effect the increase of hpfpw viscosity 1 59 1 8 mpa s was smaller than that of smpfpw 1 63 2 01 mpa s and pfpw 1 61 1 99 mpa s fig 3 and the effect of polymer at high concentrations 200 mg l on hpfpw viscosity was not as significant as that of smpfpw and pfpw the carboxyl groups on polymer chains will ionize hydrogen ions in aqueous environment and carry a negative charge monovalent cation in water can preferentially bind to carboxyl groups and shield their charge thus weakening the repulsion between the carboxyl groups and making the polymer chain tend to curl resulting in a smaller effective volume and reduced polymer thickening ability 29 in addition to reducing the size of a single polymer chain divalent cations can bind to two carboxyl groups from different polymer chains at the same time resulting in a more complex deformation of the polymer and a greater impact on its thickening ability and rheological properties of the solution 29 it is noteworthy that smpfpw exhibits a viscosity even higher than that of pfpw within given range of polymer concentrations while its ca and mg ion concentrations are much higher than that of pfpw which seems to be difficult to explain due to the cation shielding effect mentioned above in fact the stable structure of the suspended microcrystalline polymer system is based on the three dimensional structure of the polymer and suspended microcrystals rather than charge repulsion between functional groups the influence of cations on this structure is limited viscosity of smpfpw can increase with the increase of polymer concentration however the viscosity characteristics of smpfpw are not conducive to oil removal due to the known impact of viscosity on oil droplet rising velocity in liquid phase systems 3 3 effect of suspended microcrystalline polymers on ζ potential ζ potential is an important indicator of emulsification stability of emulsions for given range of polymer concentrations the absolute ζ potential of smpfpw 9 11 mv was higher than that of hpfpw 4 5 8 5 mv fig 3 but the absolute ζ potential of both produced waters were apparently lower than that of pfpw 14 25 8 mv and polymer concentration was only positively correlated with the absolute ζ potential of pfpw little change is observed in absolute ζ potential of smpfpw or that of pfpw when polymer content rise it has been shown that cations can significantly affect the ζ potential of emulsions and can be used as emulsion breakers 24 25 at high cation levels the thickness of the bilayer at the oil water interface is compressed 43 causing a decrease of absolute ζ potential which explains why the absolute ζ potential and emulsion stability of smpfpw with partial conversion of ca and mg ions into microcrystals is slightly higher than that of hpfpw lower absolute ζ potential means lower electric charge repulsion between oil droplets increasing the probability of collision and aggregation 44 the ζ potential characteristics of smpfpw reflected that it was lower than pfpw but slightly higher than hpfpw in terms of emulsion stability which was not significantly affected by the increase of polymer concentration below 300 mg l 3 4 effect of suspended microcrystalline polymers on oil content oil content of three simulated produced waters increased with increasing polymer concentration fig 3 since this experiment collected water samples from the middle layer of the beaker for characteristic analysis the possible factors influencing oil content are the speed of aggregation of small oil droplets and the speed of rising of larger oil droplets according to former discussion increase of polymer concentration is accompanied by the increase of viscosity high viscosity can greatly hinder the aggregation and consolidation of oil droplets which explains why oil contents increase with the increase of polymer concentration in 3 produced waters the oil content of pfpw 205 58 417 77 mg l is higher than that of hpfpw 156 22 331 66 mg l partially because the viscosity of hpfpw is generally lower than that of pfpw but it s more likely that the lower oil content in hpfpw is affected by its lower zeta potential which is proposed by 44 to impact the electric charge repulsion between oil droplets and increases the likelihood of large oil droplets formation it is worth noting that the oil content of smpfpw 385 19 mg l 633 23 mg l is much higher than that of pfpw even at similar viscosities the speed of aggregation and rising of oil droplets in these two produced waters should be similar considering small viscosity differences between smpfpw and pfpw to maintain a high oil content the oil droplets in smpfpw are presumably distributed in solution in a very different way which may be related to their unique spatial structure and the solid liquid interface provided by the suspended microcrystals this distribution pattern may keep oil droplets suspended and not float easily according to the study by jia 21 22 the diameter of suspended microcrystals are generally in the range of 1 5 μm which is similar to the detected diameter of small oil droplets in smpfpw around 4 μm so it s likely that small sized oil droplets in smpfpw can be adsorbed or wrap on the suspended microcrystals to keep floating 3 5 oil removal of smpfpw by different methods as shown by comparisons of the three types of simulated produced waters in terms of oil droplet diameter oil content ζ potential and viscosity smpfpw is indeed a new type of produced water that differs from the others in order to investigate the performance of existing water flooding produced water degreasing processes qinghe oilfield on smpfpw and to explore feasible improvements for smpfpw degreasing a series of simulated tests were carried out as follows 3 6 factors influencing sedimentation of smpfpw four types of produced water including water flooding produced water wfpw with zero polymer content pfpw hpfpw and smpfpw polymer content was 100 mg l and synthesizing conditions were adjusted to achieve a similar initial oil content of approximately 1150 mg l were subjected to a 24 h sedimentation experiments the results showed that wfpw obtained the fastest and best treatment 84 13 of oil removed after 24 h compared to the other three produced waters containing 100 mg l polymer which had a lower degree of oil water separation fig 4 a hpfpw and smpfpw have higher oil removal rates than pfpw 72 8 and 70 05 compared to 53 39 viscosity may be the main reason for the fast oil water separation in wfpw the viscosities of smpfpw hpfpw and pfpw are similar at polymer concentration of 100 mg l and higher than that of wfpw smpfpw and pfpw are dominated by large oil droplets 50 1000 μm while hpfpw contains more small oil droplets 2 60 μm the oil water separation of hpfpw should be more difficult than that of smpfpw and pfpw but the experimental results are opposite indicating that the more important factor influencing oil water separation in hpfpw is ζ potential hpfpw has the lowest absolute ζ potential 5 15 mv due to the influence of cations and has lower emulsion stability than smpfpw and pfpw which have higher absolute ζ potentials in summary smpfpw is between hpfpw and pfpw in terms of oil removal performance by gravity induced sedimentation in order to investigate the effect of polymer concentration on the performance of sedimentation degreasing of smpfpw gravity induced sedimentation degreasing experiments were carried out on smpfpw with polymer concentrations ranging from 0 to 200 mg l but with similar initial oil content about 1150 mg l the results are shown in fig 4 b as the polymer content increased from 0 to 200 mg l the rate of oil removal by sedimentation decreased gradually at 200 mg l polymer the oil removal rate of smpfpw after 24 h of sedimentation was only 34 14 no obvious change of oil removal rate was observed with extended time on the one hand this can be explained by an increase in the proportion of small sized oil droplets due to the increase of polymer concentration in smpfpw where smaller oil droplets mean a faster brownian motion and a smaller brownian motion area resulting in a lower chance of collision and aggregation between oil droplets on the other hand the increase in viscosity due to the increase in polymer concentration slows down the oil droplet aggregation and uplift therefore the increase in polymer concentration has a significant negative impact on the oil removal effect of gravity induced sedimentation of smpfpw 3 7 treatment performance of smpfpw by wfpw degreasing method to test treatment performance of the qinghe oilfield wfpw treatment method on the smpfpw the device was set up by connecting a composite filtration column after the gravity sedimentation tank see fig 1 for detailed parameters because oil content in the influent water of the treatment station was 70 80 mg l simulated smpfpw produced water samples with polymer content of 0 300 mg l and oil content of 71 79 316 17 mg l were obtained by adjusting synthesis conditions in this experiment fig 5 shows the oil content of effluent variation with time due to the fixed capacity of filter materials in the column the adsorption follows a fast to slow dynamics feature it is inevitable that the oil content of the effluent will gradually increase with time fig 5 the result also demonstrated that increase in polymer concentration accelerates the rise of the effluent oil content the influence of polymers is mainly reflected in two aspects firstly the increase in its concentration leads to an increase in the oil content of the sedimentation tank effluent water resulting in an increase of oil content for subsequent filtration secondly the polymer and suspended microcrystals themselves will be adsorbed on the surface of the filter materials competing the adsorption sites with oil both reasons lead to early penetration of filtration column studies also showed that filter pore particle size can be essential parameters affecting its performance bensal et al 2011 it s recommended that pore size is smaller than diameter of oil drops since larger pore size can hardly impede the infiltration of oil drops šećerov sokolović et al 2003 in our experiment oil content in effluent water increased with increasing polymer concentration possibly indicating more and more small oil drops passing through the filtration column other factors such as oil drop diffusion sedimentation and london forces might also contribute to oil removal during filtration since a secondary column effectively suppressed the effluent oil content in our next experiment nevertheless pore size or structure or surface chemistry of filter materials were not measured or further studied because materials used in our columns are those originally applied in wfpf treatment and our tests were to verify the adaptability of existing materials for smpfpw treatment based on the test results if smpfpw with polymer concentration of 100 mg l was degreased by wfpw degreasing method and the oil content after treatment is kept below 15 mg l the filter column must be backwashed after 21 h of operation if lower oil content were preferred the operation time of the filtration column must be further shortened 19 h to achieve 10 mg l oil content 16 h to achieve 5 mg l oil content higher polymer content in smpfpw will bring about even shorter penetration time of the column and a higher backwashing frequency which will increase the time and material costs during practical operating therefore if the backwash cycle were set at 24 h and the oil content in the effluent must not exceed 15 mg l the conventional wfpw degreasing method gravity induced sedimentation combined with composite material filtration would only be suitable for degreasing smpfpw with polymer concentrations below 100 mg l 3 8 method improvements and evaluation in order to achieve higher degreasing efficiency for smpfpw this study proposes three improved degreasing strategies based on the wfpw degreasing method in a cheap and practical way a sedimentation primary composite material filtration secondary composite material filtration b sedimentation primary composite material filtration secondary single material filtration c sedimentation flocculation primary composite material filtration prior to comparison of three improvements three inexpensive and also currently in use filter material with satisfying performance in wfpw treatment carborundum walnut shell and anthracite and three commonly used flocculants ferric polymeric aluminum chloride polymeric aluminum chloride and polymeric ferric sulfate were evaluated to ensure that the best performing filter material and flocculants were used in the improved degreasing scenario briefly smpfpw with polymer concentration of 200 mg l and oil content of 745 21 mg l was filtered using three single material filtration columns each filled with different materials and two composite material filtration columns filled with carborundum anthracite and carborundum walnut shells respectively at a 1 1 vol ratio the results showed that the single material filtration with the best oil removal performance is carborundum and composite material filtration with the best oil removal performance is the combination of carborundum anthracite fig 6 a for the flocculant selection test three flocculants namely polymeric aluminum ferric chloride polymeric aluminum chloride and polymeric ferric sulfate were used to treat smpfpw after sedimentation for equal time results showed that oil content of the outflow water decreased rapidly with increasing flocculant dose but the effect of three flocculants became stable when the dose exceeded 1000 mg l fig 6 b excellent oil removal capability was obtained at dosage of 500 mg l by polymeric iron sulphate which was chosen for subsequent flocculation experiments three improvements are done by combination of different units from fig 1 smpfpw with initial polymer concentration of 300 mg l and oil content of 320 mg l was firstly subjected to a sedimentation process after which only 31 3 of the oil was removed oil content 220 mg l this outflow was then introduced to i two same composite material filtration columns carborundum anthracite v v 1 in series or ii one composite material filtration column carborundum anthracite v v 1 followed by another single material filtration column carborundum or iii flocculation tank followed by a composite material filtration column carborundum anthracite v v 1 respectively for further degreasing overall oil removal performance of three experiments are shown in fig 7 the oil content of the effluent water from all three scenarios continues to increase with time but there are differences in the rate of increasement specifically outflow water of strategy a has an oil content of less than 4 mg l after 24 h and maintains less than 5 mg l after 38 h oil content of outflow water of strategy b is less than 5 mg l after 24 h and maintains less than 6 mg l after 36 h however the oil content of the outflow water from strategy c reached 13 43 mg l at 24 h and exceeded 15 mg l after 28 h it can be concluded that strategy a and b are significantly more effective than strategy c in removing oil from smpfpw and can meet the requirement of backwashing frequency no shorter than 24 h per column in practical operations suggesting that filtration is a more suitable method of removing oil from smpfpw than flocculation 4 conclusion in this study the water characteristics of smpfpw a kind of produced water from a promising new polymer flooding technique for high ca and mg oilfields and oil removal methods for this produced water were investigated in detail the oil droplet size distribution pattern in smpfpw is similar to that of pfpw but its small oil droplets are slightly larger than that of pfpw the thickening effect of polymers in smpfpw is unaffected by the cationic charge shielding supported by the suspended microcrystalline structure and its viscosity is even higher than that of pfpw because of partial conversion of ca and mg ions to microcrystals the absolute ζ potential of smpfpw is slightly higher than that of hpfpw but much lower than that of pfpw due to high ionic strength besides smpfpw has a higher oil content than pfpw due to the presence of suspended microcrystals and these characteristics distinguish smpfpw from other existing polymer flooding produced waters in degreasing tests gravity induced sedimentation achieved better performance for smpfpw than pfpw but not as good as hpfpw the method for degreasing water flooding produced water gravity induced sedimentation combined with primary composite material filtration is only suitable for smpfpw with polymer content below 100 mg l smpfpw with polymer concentration up to 300 mg l can be degreased to low oil content water by gravity induced sedimentation followed by two stage filtration method for 24 h before backwashing of filtration columns which basically meets the operational requirements of normal water treatment plant however more effective and comprehensive water treatment methods specific to smpfpw remain to be researched and developed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

13455,suspended microcrystalline polymer flooding is a new promising eor technology developed to improve oil recovery from high ca and mg reservoirs however as the technology is currently in the

necessary before the produced water being reinjected previous research showed that the presence of chemical additives can greatly reduce the interfacial tension between water and oil droplets 20 22 which is essential in affecting emulsion stability of the system it was reported that polymers in alkali surfactant polymer flooding produced water can on one hand greatly increase viscosity and oil water interface film strength of the system and hinder the separation of oil and water on the other hand it can also make the oil droplets flocculation and agglomeration promoting the separation of oil and water 23 25 besides semi hydrolyzed polyacrylamide hpam is believed to be capable of increasing system viscosity oil water interfacial tension absolute ζ potential and interfacial expansion viscoelasticity of oil droplets making oil droplets less likely to aggregate and increasing the difficulty of oil water separation 26 hpam residue in produced water can also influence the flocculation in degreasing process 27 in addition to chemical additives in high salinity oilfield the produced water would be inevitably rich in metal ions such as calcium and magnesium ions that originate from deep formation waters 28 these ions can greatly inhibit the thickening and oil repellent ability of conventional polymers 29 and tend to scale and clog pipes a reduction in salinity and hardness is also necessary before further treatment or reuse 30 in 2015 jia and his team proposed a suspended microcrystalline polymer flooding technique 21 22 nucleating agent such as na2co3 or nahco3 and dispersing agent such as sodium polyacrylate was added to aqueous solution of common polymer bearing formation water the system was then stirred to obtain a suspended microcrystalline polymer system in which ca and mg ions additives and polymer molecules form a three dimensional spatial lattice structure this technique can effectively shield the influence of ca and mg ions on polymers however the practical application of this technology is still at indoor and preliminary field trial stage and the water quality characteristics of the produced water and applicable oil removal methods are still unattended on one hand the effect of solid particles in polymer flooding solutions is multidimensional researches have shown that silicon dioxide nanoparticles can form an ionic dipole with cations in water reducing the effect of these ions on polymer viscosity 31 silicon dioxide nanoparticles can also improve solution viscosity 32 thus increase difficulty of separating oil and water it has been reported that solid particles in oil in water emulsions can increase oil water interfacial tension interfacial shear viscosity and negative ζ potential 33 34 however suspended microcrystals are micron sized particles formed by the reaction of crystallizers with native ca and mg ions which are different from the exogenous nanoparticles in terms of origin size and distribution and these differences are likely to have unpredictable effects on the properties of the produced water on the other hand researches are generally focused on common polymer flooding produced water treatment currently the mainstream oil removal techniques include physical chemical and biological methods physical treatment includes traditional gravity induced sedimentation filtration and those have been proposed since recent years such as microwave ultrasonic and electrocoagulation methods 35 38 chemical methods destabilize the oil water emulsion system by the addition of chemical reagents for instance the application of emulsion breakers flocculants and membranes 16 18 23 biological methods primarily use screened and domesticated microorganisms to degrade polymers and remove oil from produced water 6 39 40 but few research has done to evaluate the performance of these treatment methods for suspended microcrystalline polymer flooding produced water smpfpw and little is known about distribution of the microcrystals and its coexistence form with oil droplets to investigate the influence of suspended microcrystalline system on the nature of the produced water and on the subsequent oil removal performance the water quality characteristics including oil content oil droplet size ζ potential and viscosity of smpfpw high ca and mg suspended microcrystalline polymer flooding produced water hpfpw high ca and mg polymer flooding produced water and pfpw normal polymer flooding produced water were analyzed based on simulated produced water besides the effect of polymer concentration on water quality characteristics of smpfpw was investigated and traditional methods such as gravity sedimentation flocculation sedimentation and filtration were carried out for oil removal of smpfpw in order to have a comprehensive understanding of this new type of produced water and to provide a basis for the development of more appropriate water treatment solutions for smpfpw in the future 2 materials

the oil droplet size and suspended particle size were measured using an ms2000 micron particle size analyzer 100 nm 1000 μm and the oil content in liquid samples was measured using an oil 460 ir spectrometer 2 2 simulation of produced water to understand the nature and characteristics of the produced water from high ca and mg oilfield after the implementation of suspended microcrystalline polymer flooding and to conduct corresponding produced water degreasing experiments we simulated three kinds of polymer flooding produced water based on treated water from a water treatment station because the suspended microcrystalline polymer flooding technique has not been applied in oilfield yet different raw waters are used to simulate three produced waters namely pfpw normal polymer flooding produced water hpfpw high ca and mg polymer flooding produced water and smpfpw high ca and mg suspended microcrystalline polymer flooding produced water three kinds of raw waters are tap water ca2 mg2 450 mg l tds 1000 mg l high ca and mg water see table 1 for water quality ca2 mg2 1000 mg l tds 20 000 mg l high ca and mg water crystallizer was added with recommended concentration of 1500 mg l to form suspended microcrystals in advance respectively detailed synthesis steps are as follows 1 put the crude oil and the three types of raw water in separate beakers and kept them at a constant temperature of 70 2 c 2 three 1000 mg l hpam stock solutions were prepared from these raw waters 3 polymer solutions with hpam concentrations of 50 100 150 200 250 and 300 mg l were made from dilution of 12 5 25 37 5 50 62 5 and 75 ml of hpam stock solution respectively to 250 ml with the corresponding raw water 4 1 0 g crude oil was added to these polymer solutions which were then stirred at 16 000 rpm for 2 min and allowed to stand for 2 h to obtain simulated produced waters 5 water from the middle layer of the solution was taken to conduct water quality characteristic measurements simulated produced waters with different concentrations of polymers for subsequent oil removal experiments were stirred at adjusted speed and for adjusted time to obtain similar initial oil content and various amounts of crude oil or tween 80 surfactant were used to meet different experimental needs detailed oil removal experiments are described in following paragraphs 2 3 oil removal experiments fig 1 shows the set up for oil removal experiments the experiment is based on the operating parameters of the qinghe oilfield water flooding produced water treatment station and is an improved and combinable process for evaluating the removal of oil from produced water the set up includes produced water simulation tank sedimentation tank flocculation tank primary filtration column and secondary filtration column the oil removal experiments briefly include 1 a simulated oil bearing water flooding produced water and the above mentioned three types of simulated polymer flooding produced water polymer concentration of 100 mg l with initial oil content of about 1150 mg l were placed in a sedimentation tank for 24 h for oil water separation the oil content was measured every 2 h to investigate the effect of sedimentation on the oil removal of different types of simulated produced waters 2 smpfpw with initial polymer concentrations of 0 200 mg l was subjected to oil water separation in sedimentation tank for 24 h the oil content was measured every 2 h to investigate the influence of polymer concentration on oil removal performance of smpfpw by sedimentation same degreasing and evaluation experiment was carried out again after connecting sedimentation tank with a primary filtration column which is similar to the existing water flooding produced water wfpw treatment method in qinghe oilfield 3 choose proper filter materials and flocculant and improve the treatment set up by adding flocculation tank or secondary filtration column evaluate the performance of different improvements by comparing oil contents of outflow waters 3 result and discussion 3 1 characteristics of simulated produced water 3 1 1 effect of suspended microcrystalline polymers on the size of oil droplets three simulated produced waters pfpw hpfpw and smpfpw with polymer content of 50 100 150 200 250 and 300 mg l were synthesized under same conditions and their oil droplet size viscosity ζ potential and oil content were determined according to above mentioned methods as is shown in fig 2 the diameter of oil droplets in pfpw hpfpw and smpfpw ranged from 0 3 700 μm 1 700 μm and 1 1000 μm respectively the oil droplet size of pfpw and smpfpw showed a bimodal distribution while that of hpfpw showed a trimodal distribution with increasing polymer concentration the peak diameter of oil droplets in pfpw and smpfpw was transformed from 150 μm to 1 6 μm and 4 μm respectively hpfpw also showed an increase in the proportion of small droplets and a decrease in the proportion of large droplets demonstrating a three peak distribution with peaks at 3 5 μm 20 μm and 150 μm research has shown that flocculation of oil droplets occurs at low polymer concentrations due to the bridging effect of polymer molecules adsorbed on the oil droplets but when polymer concentration is higher than a certain critical value the thickening effect of the polymer would be detrimental to the flocculation of oil droplets 24 25 the higher the molecular weight of the polymer the lower the critical concentration polymers with molecular weights of 2 72 million 4 0 million and 8 0 million are not conducive to the incorporation of oil droplets at their concentrations greater than 400 mg l 200 mg l and 100 mg l respectively 24 25 however our experimental results show that the oil droplet size tends to become smaller when the polymer content increases a polymer with a molecular mass of 15 million was used in this experiment according to deng the critical polymer concentration is presumed to be less than 100 mg l it is likely that the thickening effect caused by increasing polymer concentration is greater than the flocculation effect within our experimental gradient range 50 mg l 300 mg l hpam study has shown that the oil droplets in water have a certain charge after polymer adsorption when ionic strength increases the ions with opposite charge will gather around the oil droplets which shields the charge on the surface of the oil droplets increasing the possibility of collision and aggregation between the oil droplets and making the oil droplet size tend to be larger 41 which explains why hpfpw and smpfpw have larger oil droplet size at smaller end of the spectrum than that of pfpw it is noteworthy that the oil droplet size distribution pattern of hpfpw at low polymer contents showed a considerable proportion of small sized oil droplets with diameter around 5 μm which is significantly different from that of the other two produced waters the reason is currently unknown it has been suggested that the increase in viscosity caused by the polymer can affect to some extent the shear effect when synthesizing produced water and that the higher the shear stress the smaller the oil droplets 42 the case of hpfpw probably originates from combined influence from divalent cation ions on polymer thickening effect in hpfpw and different zeta potential or shear stress during stirring in summary oil droplet size of smpfpw is slightly larger than that of pfpw while the distribution and transformation pattern is similar to that of pfpw 3 2 effect of suspended microcrystalline polymers on viscosity the viscosity of smpfpw was highest in the three produced waters within given polymer concentration range and the viscosity of the three produced waters increased to varying degrees with increasing polymer concentration as a result of the polymer thickening effect the increase of hpfpw viscosity 1 59 1 8 mpa s was smaller than that of smpfpw 1 63 2 01 mpa s and pfpw 1 61 1 99 mpa s fig 3 and the effect of polymer at high concentrations 200 mg l on hpfpw viscosity was not as significant as that of smpfpw and pfpw the carboxyl groups on polymer chains will ionize hydrogen ions in aqueous environment and carry a negative charge monovalent cation in water can preferentially bind to carboxyl groups and shield their charge thus weakening the repulsion between the carboxyl groups and making the polymer chain tend to curl resulting in a smaller effective volume and reduced polymer thickening ability 29 in addition to reducing the size of a single polymer chain divalent cations can bind to two carboxyl groups from different polymer chains at the same time resulting in a more complex deformation of the polymer and a greater impact on its thickening ability and rheological properties of the solution 29 it is noteworthy that smpfpw exhibits a viscosity even higher than that of pfpw within given range of polymer concentrations while its ca and mg ion concentrations are much higher than that of pfpw which seems to be difficult to explain due to the cation shielding effect mentioned above in fact the stable structure of the suspended microcrystalline polymer system is based on the three dimensional structure of the polymer and suspended microcrystals rather than charge repulsion between functional groups the influence of cations on this structure is limited viscosity of smpfpw can increase with the increase of polymer concentration however the viscosity characteristics of smpfpw are not conducive to oil removal due to the known impact of viscosity on oil droplet rising velocity in liquid phase systems 3 3 effect of suspended microcrystalline polymers on ζ potential ζ potential is an important indicator of emulsification stability of emulsions for given range of polymer concentrations the absolute ζ potential of smpfpw 9 11 mv was higher than that of hpfpw 4 5 8 5 mv fig 3 but the absolute ζ potential of both produced waters were apparently lower than that of pfpw 14 25 8 mv and polymer concentration was only positively correlated with the absolute ζ potential of pfpw little change is observed in absolute ζ potential of smpfpw or that of pfpw when polymer content rise it has been shown that cations can significantly affect the ζ potential of emulsions and can be used as emulsion breakers 24 25 at high cation levels the thickness of the bilayer at the oil water interface is compressed 43 causing a decrease of absolute ζ potential which explains why the absolute ζ potential and emulsion stability of smpfpw with partial conversion of ca and mg ions into microcrystals is slightly higher than that of hpfpw lower absolute ζ potential means lower electric charge repulsion between oil droplets increasing the probability of collision and aggregation 44 the ζ potential characteristics of smpfpw reflected that it was lower than pfpw but slightly higher than hpfpw in terms of emulsion stability which was not significantly affected by the increase of polymer concentration below 300 mg l 3 4 effect of suspended microcrystalline polymers on oil content oil content of three simulated produced waters increased with increasing polymer concentration fig 3 since this experiment collected water samples from the middle layer of the beaker for characteristic analysis the possible factors influencing oil content are the speed of aggregation of small oil droplets and the speed of rising of larger oil droplets according to former discussion increase of polymer concentration is accompanied by the increase of viscosity high viscosity can greatly hinder the aggregation and consolidation of oil droplets which explains why oil contents increase with the increase of polymer concentration in 3 produced waters the oil content of pfpw 205 58 417 77 mg l is higher than that of hpfpw 156 22 331 66 mg l partially because the viscosity of hpfpw is generally lower than that of pfpw but it s more likely that the lower oil content in hpfpw is affected by its lower zeta potential which is proposed by 44 to impact the electric charge repulsion between oil droplets and increases the likelihood of large oil droplets formation it is worth noting that the oil content of smpfpw 385 19 mg l 633 23 mg l is much higher than that of pfpw even at similar viscosities the speed of aggregation and rising of oil droplets in these two produced waters should be similar considering small viscosity differences between smpfpw and pfpw to maintain a high oil content the oil droplets in smpfpw are presumably distributed in solution in a very different way which may be related to their unique spatial structure and the solid liquid interface provided by the suspended microcrystals this distribution pattern may keep oil droplets suspended and not float easily according to the study by jia 21 22 the diameter of suspended microcrystals are generally in the range of 1 5 μm which is similar to the detected diameter of small oil droplets in smpfpw around 4 μm so it s likely that small sized oil droplets in smpfpw can be adsorbed or wrap on the suspended microcrystals to keep floating 3 5 oil removal of smpfpw by different methods as shown by comparisons of the three types of simulated produced waters in terms of oil droplet diameter oil content ζ potential and viscosity smpfpw is indeed a new type of produced water that differs from the others in order to investigate the performance of existing water flooding produced water degreasing processes qinghe oilfield on smpfpw and to explore feasible improvements for smpfpw degreasing a series of simulated tests were carried out as follows 3 6 factors influencing sedimentation of smpfpw four types of produced water including water flooding produced water wfpw with zero polymer content pfpw hpfpw and smpfpw polymer content was 100 mg l and synthesizing conditions were adjusted to achieve a similar initial oil content of approximately 1150 mg l were subjected to a 24 h sedimentation experiments the results showed that wfpw obtained the fastest and best treatment 84 13 of oil removed after 24 h compared to the other three produced waters containing 100 mg l polymer which had a lower degree of oil water separation fig 4 a hpfpw and smpfpw have higher oil removal rates than pfpw 72 8 and 70 05 compared to 53 39 viscosity may be the main reason for the fast oil water separation in wfpw the viscosities of smpfpw hpfpw and pfpw are similar at polymer concentration of 100 mg l and higher than that of wfpw smpfpw and pfpw are dominated by large oil droplets 50 1000 μm while hpfpw contains more small oil droplets 2 60 μm the oil water separation of hpfpw should be more difficult than that of smpfpw and pfpw but the experimental results are opposite indicating that the more important factor influencing oil water separation in hpfpw is ζ potential hpfpw has the lowest absolute ζ potential 5 15 mv due to the influence of cations and has lower emulsion stability than smpfpw and pfpw which have higher absolute ζ potentials in summary smpfpw is between hpfpw and pfpw in terms of oil removal performance by gravity induced sedimentation in order to investigate the effect of polymer concentration on the performance of sedimentation degreasing of smpfpw gravity induced sedimentation degreasing experiments were carried out on smpfpw with polymer concentrations ranging from 0 to 200 mg l but with similar initial oil content about 1150 mg l the results are shown in fig 4 b as the polymer content increased from 0 to 200 mg l the rate of oil removal by sedimentation decreased gradually at 200 mg l polymer the oil removal rate of smpfpw after 24 h of sedimentation was only 34 14 no obvious change of oil removal rate was observed with extended time on the one hand this can be explained by an increase in the proportion of small sized oil droplets due to the increase of polymer concentration in smpfpw where smaller oil droplets mean a faster brownian motion and a smaller brownian motion area resulting in a lower chance of collision and aggregation between oil droplets on the other hand the increase in viscosity due to the increase in polymer concentration slows down the oil droplet aggregation and uplift therefore the increase in polymer concentration has a significant negative impact on the oil removal effect of gravity induced sedimentation of smpfpw 3 7 treatment performance of smpfpw by wfpw degreasing method to test treatment performance of the qinghe oilfield wfpw treatment method on the smpfpw the device was set up by connecting a composite filtration column after the gravity sedimentation tank see fig 1 for detailed parameters because oil content in the influent water of the treatment station was 70 80 mg l simulated smpfpw produced water samples with polymer content of 0 300 mg l and oil content of 71 79 316 17 mg l were obtained by adjusting synthesis conditions in this experiment fig 5 shows the oil content of effluent variation with time due to the fixed capacity of filter materials in the column the adsorption follows a fast to slow dynamics feature it is inevitable that the oil content of the effluent will gradually increase with time fig 5 the result also demonstrated that increase in polymer concentration accelerates the rise of the effluent oil content the influence of polymers is mainly reflected in two aspects firstly the increase in its concentration leads to an increase in the oil content of the sedimentation tank effluent water resulting in an increase of oil content for subsequent filtration secondly the polymer and suspended microcrystals themselves will be adsorbed on the surface of the filter materials competing the adsorption sites with oil both reasons lead to early penetration of filtration column studies also showed that filter pore particle size can be essential parameters affecting its performance bensal et al 2011 it s recommended that pore size is smaller than diameter of oil drops since larger pore size can hardly impede the infiltration of oil drops šećerov sokolović et al 2003 in our experiment oil content in effluent water increased with increasing polymer concentration possibly indicating more and more small oil drops passing through the filtration column other factors such as oil drop diffusion sedimentation and london forces might also contribute to oil removal during filtration since a secondary column effectively suppressed the effluent oil content in our next experiment nevertheless pore size or structure or surface chemistry of filter materials were not measured or further studied because materials used in our columns are those originally applied in wfpf treatment and our tests were to verify the adaptability of existing materials for smpfpw treatment based on the test results if smpfpw with polymer concentration of 100 mg l was degreased by wfpw degreasing method and the oil content after treatment is kept below 15 mg l the filter column must be backwashed after 21 h of operation if lower oil content were preferred the operation time of the filtration column must be further shortened 19 h to achieve 10 mg l oil content 16 h to achieve 5 mg l oil content higher polymer content in smpfpw will bring about even shorter penetration time of the column and a higher backwashing frequency which will increase the time and material costs during practical operating therefore if the backwash cycle were set at 24 h and the oil content in the effluent must not exceed 15 mg l the conventional wfpw degreasing method gravity induced sedimentation combined with composite material filtration would only be suitable for degreasing smpfpw with polymer concentrations below 100 mg l 3 8 method improvements and evaluation in order to achieve higher degreasing efficiency for smpfpw this study proposes three improved degreasing strategies based on the wfpw degreasing method in a cheap and practical way a sedimentation primary composite material filtration secondary composite material filtration b sedimentation primary composite material filtration secondary single material filtration c sedimentation flocculation primary composite material filtration prior to comparison of three improvements three inexpensive and also currently in use filter material with satisfying performance in wfpw treatment carborundum walnut shell and anthracite and three commonly used flocculants ferric polymeric aluminum chloride polymeric aluminum chloride and polymeric ferric sulfate were evaluated to ensure that the best performing filter material and flocculants were used in the improved degreasing scenario briefly smpfpw with polymer concentration of 200 mg l and oil content of 745 21 mg l was filtered using three single material filtration columns each filled with different materials and two composite material filtration columns filled with carborundum anthracite and carborundum walnut shells respectively at a 1 1 vol ratio the results showed that the single material filtration with the best oil removal performance is carborundum and composite material filtration with the best oil removal performance is the combination of carborundum anthracite fig 6 a for the flocculant selection test three flocculants namely polymeric aluminum ferric chloride polymeric aluminum chloride and polymeric ferric sulfate were used to treat smpfpw after sedimentation for equal time results showed that oil content of the outflow water decreased rapidly with increasing flocculant dose but the effect of three flocculants became stable when the dose exceeded 1000 mg l fig 6 b excellent oil removal capability was obtained at dosage of 500 mg l by polymeric iron sulphate which was chosen for subsequent flocculation experiments three improvements are done by combination of different units from fig 1 smpfpw with initial polymer concentration of 300 mg l and oil content of 320 mg l was firstly subjected to a sedimentation process after which only 31 3 of the oil was removed oil content 220 mg l this outflow was then introduced to i two same composite material filtration columns carborundum anthracite v v 1 in series or ii one composite material filtration column carborundum anthracite v v 1 followed by another single material filtration column carborundum or iii flocculation tank followed by a composite material filtration column carborundum anthracite v v 1 respectively for further degreasing overall oil removal performance of three experiments are shown in fig 7 the oil content of the effluent water from all three scenarios continues to increase with time but there are differences in the rate of increasement specifically outflow water of strategy a has an oil content of less than 4 mg l after 24 h and maintains less than 5 mg l after 38 h oil content of outflow water of strategy b is less than 5 mg l after 24 h and maintains less than 6 mg l after 36 h however the oil content of the outflow water from strategy c reached 13 43 mg l at 24 h and exceeded 15 mg l after 28 h it can be concluded that strategy a and b are significantly more effective than strategy c in removing oil from smpfpw and can meet the requirement of backwashing frequency no shorter than 24 h per column in practical operations suggesting that filtration is a more suitable method of removing oil from smpfpw than flocculation 4 conclusion in this study the water characteristics of smpfpw a kind of produced water from a promising new polymer flooding technique for high ca and mg oilfields and oil removal methods for this produced water were investigated in detail the oil droplet size distribution pattern in smpfpw is similar to that of pfpw but its small oil droplets are slightly larger than that of pfpw the thickening effect of polymers in smpfpw is unaffected by the cationic charge shielding supported by the suspended microcrystalline structure and its viscosity is even higher than that of pfpw because of partial conversion of ca and mg ions to microcrystals the absolute ζ potential of smpfpw is slightly higher than that of hpfpw but much lower than that of pfpw due to high ionic strength besides smpfpw has a higher oil content than pfpw due to the presence of suspended microcrystals and these characteristics distinguish smpfpw from other existing polymer flooding produced waters in degreasing tests gravity induced sedimentation achieved better performance for smpfpw than pfpw but not as good as hpfpw the method for degreasing water flooding produced water gravity induced sedimentation combined with primary composite material filtration is only suitable for smpfpw with polymer content below 100 mg l smpfpw with polymer concentration up to 300 mg l can be degreased to low oil content water by gravity induced sedimentation followed by two stage filtration method for 24 h before backwashing of filtration columns which basically meets the operational requirements of normal water treatment plant however more effective and comprehensive water treatment methods specific to smpfpw remain to be researched and developed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

natural organic matter nom strongly affects the quality of water in urban drinking water treatment plants dwtp either directly through the contribution to undesirable organoleptic properties such as color odor and taste of water or indirectly as the largest contributor to the formation of hazardous disinfection byproducts dbps 1 the conventional process used in urban drinking water treatment plants often based on coagulation flocculation followed by sedimentation flotation and filtration does not really achieve to fully remove nom 2 this process usually accomplishes to eliminate much of the hydrophobic fraction and the heaviest molecular weight fractions but a nom content mainly constituted by low molecular weight compounds remains 3 in many rural plants r nom usually represents even a greater risk due to the disinfectant in most of the cases chlorine being mostly added straight on the raw water supplies 4 mainly aimed at eliminating pathogens but at the same time strongly favoring the formation of dbps on the other hand some advanced oxidation processes aops could be cost effective alternatives to enhance drinking water treatment either at urban dwtps and rural r facilities moreover although the aops have been strongly investigated through the past two decades in the degradation of variety of contaminants in wastewaters they have been rather scarcely assessed intended to improve drinking water production 5 among the aops the catalytic wet peroxide oxidation cwpo is an heterogeneous fenton process that has shown excellent performance in the treatment of surface water sources even under middle environmental conditions of temperature and pressure 6 the use of an appropriate solid catalyst can substantially reduce the operational costs since it can be easily separated from the reacted effluent preventing formation and disposal of sludge typical of the homogeneous classic fenton process while it also enables proper operation within a wider ph range in the treatment of real water samples as compared with the homogeneous fenton well known to efficiently operate within the range 2 4 3 4 7 in this regard several studies about the heterogeneous fenton removal of organic compounds in water have been performed under acidic ph 8 10 but works under close to neutral ph values featured by real surface water supplies remain rather scarce one of the main drawbacks affecting this family of heterogeneous processes is the loss of activity of the catalysts due to iron leaching 11 12 however the mixed al fe pillared clay catalyst has demonstrated a highly stable content of active iron still under the aggressive oxidizing conditions of the fenton reaction 13 therefore the cwpo treatment employing al fe pilcs is a very interesting alternative in the treatment of dissimilar surface water samples additional to ph the dose of h2o2 the single reagent truly consumed along the process hence mainly contributing to the operational costs employed is other important parameter to take into account facing a potential scaling up of the cwpo technology or any other fenton based treatment the optimal dose of h2o2 strongly depends on all the initial load and chemical structure of the pollutants the ph and temperature of the influent stream the presence of scavenging species of reactive oxygen species ros type and phase solid or liquid of the catalyst employed active metal type of reactor continuous batch or semibatch and whether light irradiation is used among others thus broad range of doses and concentrations of h2o2 have been reported for instance following values and conditions 60 mg h2o2 dm3 7 1 mg c dm3 of surface water ph 6 5 temperature 30 c 1 0 mg of dissolved fe3 dm3 batch reactor simulated sunlight irradiation 300 nm 800 nm

close to 50 was also found when the optimal conditions of reaction were assessed in the treatment of a real raw surface water then in spite of the promising performance of the cwpo process to assist drinking water treatment facilities in the presence of al fe pillared clay catalysts it is still mandatory to improve its performance in the treatment of variety of real water supplies as well as to measure the differential influence exerted by the most abundant dissolved ros scavenging species inorganic anions mostly likewise in the case of urban plants driving conventional physicochemical treatment it is not yet clear the most appropriate stage e g input raw water vs coagulation flocculation effluent or disinfection effluent where the cwpo or any other aop coupling would result more useful improving the output drinking water quality furthermore in the case of rural plants especially at low income countries where regularly just disinfection is occasionally performed it is still required to determine the true potential of the cwpo technology treating close to fully raw surface water in other words as a novel compact drinking water treatment plant accordingly in this study the efficiency of the cwpo process activated by an al fe pilc clay catalyst was evaluated in the removal of dissolved natural organic matter from different real surface water supplies either raw or partially treated water at several stages of three conventional urban dwtps in turn three sampling points into each plant and five rural plants were treated under natural and varied conditions of ph and temperature using our previous study as a starting reference 17 optimal conditions of the cwpo degradation of a synthetic nom surrogate achieved by multi response statistical tools were further refined now taking into account the presence of well known scavenging inorganic anions in several real surface water supplies besides the catalyst preparation was further enhanced now accessible from technical grade reagents making easier a potential scaling up of the process by smaller costs the catalytic results are analyzed in terms of doc and total nitrogen mineralization color removal 456 nm

kg bench scale to assess the effect of changing the purity of the reagents used in the treatment of surface water samples the detailed procedure is available elsewhere 13 which can be briefly summarized as follows the pillaring concentrated solutions were prepared by mixing alcl3 6h2o fecl3 6h2o in the lowest possible volume of water followed by the slow addition of powdered elemental aluminum at 70 c under gentle stirring and reflux until full dissolution the resulting concentrated solution was then aged under constant stirring at 70 c for around 5 5 h and left to stand at room temperature for further 38 h afterwards the starting clay mineral a colombian bentonite extensively characterized 18 19 was slowly added over 4 h under constant and gentle stirring at 70 c on the previously prepared al fe hydrolyzed concentrated precursor the resulting concentrated clay dispersion was kept at 70 c for 8 h under vigorous stirring and finally left to stand for 12 h at room temperature the solids were then washed until the conductivity dropped to around 20 μs cm 1 in the washing liquors the washed material was then dried at 60 c and finally heated in air at 400 c for 2 h table 1s supplementary dataset 20 displays the main physicochemical properties of both al fe pillared clays and their corresponding starting minerals the al fe pilcanalytical catalyst was prepared from analytical reagents whereas the al fe pilctechnical material corresponds to the one prepared from technical grade reagents the chemical composition of the refined starting clays and their

mol dm3 of ammonium acetate solution followed by repeated washing drying and micro kjeldahl analysis by acid base back titration of the nh3 desorbed from the nh4 homoionized materials 21 the textural analyses were conducted from the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms measured at 77 k in a micromeritics 3 flex adsorption analyzer on 150 200 mg samples solids were previously degassed as follows heating at 10 c min from rt to 90 c then kept isothermal for 1 0 h heating at 10 c min up to 300 c and final isothermal plateau throughout 12 h specific surfaces were calculated using the multipoint brunauer emmett teller bet method within the best linear region for each solid according to the keii and rouquerol criteria micropore surfaces were determined using the t plot method harkins jura and de boer 17 finally the ph of the point of zero charge phpzc of the al fe pilctechnical clay catalyst was measured by a batch equilibration technique in accordance with the procedure reported by čerović et al 22 2 3 real surface water samples the sampling sites were classified into two types i urban drinking water treatment plants all provided with conventional filtration coagulation sedimentation and disinfection stages of treatment and ii rural aqueducts r where only primary disinfection is usually performed before right drinking assessed urban plants are located at

requirements of the 360 480 currently inhabited city ipiales dwtp ipiales and túquerres dwtp túquerres plants serve 77 491 and 20 586 inhabited cities respectively aluminum sulfate or aluminum poly

raw water rw 2 effluent of physicochemical treatment ep and 3 effluent of the chlorination unit ec in the other hand five rural aqueducts r surrounding the municipality of ipiales were also studied

as above mentioned in rural plants just chlorine is sometimes added over completely raw water before consumption however since this process is not carried out systematically only raw water rw was sampled from every one of these rural aqueducts sampling was made through the rainy season according to standard methodology 23 2 4 physicochemical characterization of water samples ph and temperature

constant air bubbling 2 0 dm3 min the amount of the powdered solid clay catalyst particle size diameter 60 mesh was added into the reaction vessel and h2o2 solution 100 cm3 started to be stepwise

experiment the extra hour corresponded to 30 min of equilibrium between the solid catalyst and the liquid mixture before the addition of h2o2 and final 30 min after ending hydrogen peroxide addition all catalytic tests either on the synthetic surrogate of nom or the real surface water samples were performed by triplicate several control experiments were performed under following conditions i hydrogen peroxide using 7 0 mg c dm3 of synthetic nom 3 8 mg h2o2 mg doc in absence of catalyst in order to determine the effect of the free peroxide attack on the catalytic responses ii catalyst adsorption using 7 0 mg c dm3 of synthetic nom 3 8 g dm3 of al fe pilctechnical without any addition of h2o2 to establish the effect of the adsorption on the catalytic responses and iii homogeneous fenton employing 7 0 mg c dm3 of synthetic nom 0 3 mg fe2 dm3 added in the form of feso4 7h2o 3 8 mg h2o2 mg doc all tests were carried out at ph 7 00 and t 18 0 c the response parameters and their corresponding average standard deviations are sorted in table 3s supplementary dataset 20 an average standard deviation was calculated for every catalytic response color removal doc mineralization and h2o2 consumed and type of water sample synthetic surrogate of water raw surface water effluent of the physicochemical treatment or effluent of chlorination the selectivity to mineralization σ and the efficiency of h2o2 consumption ε previously defined elsewhere 24 25 were properly adapted in this study for comparison purposes the selectivity towards mineralization eq 3 is here defined by the ratio between the experimental doc consumption eq 1 and the theoretical doc eq 2 since the nom is a complex mixture of different molecular weights and organic functionalities the theoretical doc removal cannot be established from i e the h2o2 consumed by stoichiometric calculations however in order to estimate the selectivity to mineralization σ an ideal peroxide consumption was supposed to take place when the full color removal corresponds to doc mineralized which is expressed as shown in eq 2 1 c o n s u m e d d o c m g d m 3 d o c i d o c f 2 t h e o r e t i c a l c o n s u m e d d o c m g

nom was carried out on the synthetic surrogate of water it was prepared according to the method reported before 17 26 in order to closely resemble the planned doc concentrations required in each test the schematic composition of the synthetic water sample is shown at fig 2s supplementary dataset 20 it was crucial in order to realize if the typical variability in the input doc concentrations would significantly affect the catalytic performance of the system as operated on the field a set of experiments was run seeking to refine the process optimization previously achieved and in detail described in 17 a rotatable and orthogonal 22 factorial design of experiments was used where the cwpo factors were i dose of hydrogen peroxide mg h2o2 mg doc and ii catalyst concentration g dm3 ph temperature and input concentration of dissolved natural organic matter mg c dm3 were all handled as covariates measurable but not controllable in actual drinking water treatment plants the experimental ranges of factors and covariates are shown in table 4s supplementary dataset 20 the experimental ranges of the covariates were set according to their fitting to the statistical probability distribution found over the full collected real data of doc largest extreme value distribution collected samples 59 within the range 0 mg c dm3 28 9 mg c dm3 temperature logistic distribution collected samples 46 within the range 10 3 c 20 0 c average 13 9 c standard deviation 1 80 c and ph logistic distribution collected samples 59 within the range 6 08 8 89 mean 7 24 standard deviation 0 603 in surface water samples from several municipalities of nariño 17 whereas the kolmogorov smirnov test was used to determine the goodness of fit to the distribution of every variable in its interval 27 in the case of temperature since there were two well distinguished studied most populated geographical zones andean and pacific coastal in nariño province the two boundary measured temperatures were considered for the andean zone whereas the pacific zone was fitted to a largest extreme value distribution n 13 within the range 27 2 c 29 2 c the statistical arrange of experiments doe consisted of 16 trials see table 5s supplementary dataset 20 the statistical analysis of the data was made by the response surface methodology rsm using the statgraphics software package centurion xvi version 16 1 03 the multiple response optimization of the experimental factors was performed by raising a desirability function 27 targeting simultaneous maximal possible values for all responses doc mineralization h2o2 consumed and color removal the statistical significance of the variables and covariates was estimated by the p values at 95 confidence afterwards using the realized optimal conditions of reaction on the nom surrogate the cwpo degradation was evaluated in the treatment of the target real surface water samples from the responses of the catalytic experiments a bivariate correlation was raised as an exploratory analysis to find out a possible correlation between the three main measured responses and the input physicochemical properties ph t true color uv254 doc dn suva254 turbidity alkalinity cl po4 3 no3 so4 2 and dissolved iron table 1 first the standard shapiro wilk s w normality test at a significance level α 0 05 was applied to determine whether the data adhered to a normal distribution or not 28 the correlation was assessed using either spearman or pearson correlation coefficients at a significance level α 0 05 finally the adjustment was made by multiple regression analysis the p value 0 05 was used to determine the statistical significance of the input physicochemical properties variables on the measured catalytic responses tests of autocorrelation durbin watson and normality in the residuals shapiro wilk as well of homoscedasticity were verified over the statistical model 2 7 analytical methods the samples taken throughout every catalytic test 25 0 cm3 were immediately micro filtered millipore 0 45 μm to determine absorbance a at 456 nm for calculation of the true color removal absorbance at 254 nm and doc content recording of the doc mineralization specific uv absorbance suva254 was calculated as follows suva254 dm3 mg 1 m 1 a 254 nm doc mg dm3 100 concentration of free h2o2 was determined by the iodometric method linear range 0 0 mg dm3 15 0 mg dm3 29 and expressed as percentage of h2o2 consumed 17 iron leached was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy aas thermo scientific ice 3000 series spectrometer detection limit 0 0043 mg dm3 doc was determined by the method of the non purgeable organic carbon npoc with a shimadzu toc l cph analyzer in the presence of a pt high sensitivity catalyst detection limit 4 0 μg c dm3 dissolved nitrogen dn content was measured by a chemiluminescence detector prior thermal treatment of the sample at 720 c mg n dm3 30 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of the al fe pilc clay catalysts the main structural and textural properties of the catalysts employed in this work are displayed in table 1s supplementary dataset 20 first of all both catalysts showed basal spacings d001 greater than their corresponding starting minerals and within the range of the pillared clays with the mixed al fe system 1 70 1 86 nm 31 32 in the same trend the specific surfaces were also significantly improved as compared with the starting minerals whose increases were mainly represented in creation of new micropores 18 in the other hand in spite of the lower incorporation of aluminum and iron in the al fe pilctechnical catalyst it is noteworthy that quite comparable textural properties were obtained in comparison with the material prepared from analytical grade reagents it probably got favored thanks to the significantly higher compensation of the starting cationic exchange capacity cec obtained in the case of al fe pilctechnical in comparison with al fe pilcanalytical 33 3 2 optimal parameters for the cwpo degradation of a synthetic surrogate of nom 3 2 1 statistical multi response optimization the refinement of our previous statistical optimization 17 reached stressed enhancing of the doc mineralization by both increasing the range of hydrogen peroxide dosing per concentration unit of input doc whereas slightly decreasing the range of catalyst loading based on the trend suggested by the previously found multi response surface the optimal operating parameters obtained for hydrogen peroxide dose h2o2 dose and catalyst concentration al fe pilc were 3 77 mg h2o2 mg doc and 3 81 g dm3 of the al fe pilcanalytical catalyst respectively since different al fe pilcs and even other solid fe immobilized catalysts may yield dissimilar levels of available fe it is useful to express the optimal catalyst loading in our clay catalysts in terms of the concentration of fe active in the catalytic reactor 102 mg fe dm3 for al fe pilcanalytical the multiple response desirability function yielded a maximal value of 0 89 out of 1 00 fig 3s supplementary dataset 20 which shows that individual optimum conditions maximizing every single response properly fitted the overall multiple response in other words these are the levels of factors h2o2 dose and al fe pilc leading to the best combined doc mineralization color removal and maximal efficiency of the h2o2 consumption in the cwpo degradation of nom by al fe pilcs and probably extensible to other similar fe active cwpo catalysts 3 2 2 effect of the covariates ph t and input doc on the catalytic responses in the other hand a careful inspection of the effects exerted by each non controllable variables covariate on the recorded responses was made hence eight replicates of the central points were used to feed a multiple regression analysis where identical levels of both factors remained constant h2o2 2 1 mg h2o2 mg doc and al fe pilc 4 00 g dm3 four of these experiments were made under the same covariate values runs 7 8 14 and 16 table 5s supplementary dataset 20 corresponding to the central points of the distribution given by each covariate in real water samples ph 7 0 nom 0 7 00 mg c dm3 18 0 c whereas the four remaining experiments runs 2 3 10 and 11 table 5s supplementary dataset 20 displayed the upper and lower values of such distributions the catalytic results did not show statistical significance confirming that under the studied range of variable parameters starting nom 0 04 15 0 mg c dm3 temperature 9 20 27 9 c ph 6 2 8 4 the process efficiency was not significantly affected by the covariates corroborating a previous study 17 which represents a great advantage when applying cwpo to assist treatment of real surface water supplies under typical environmental conditions between the tropics over the full year 3 3 catalytic behavior of the al fe pilc catalyst prepared from technical grade reagents the catalytic behavior of both employed catalysts was compared under the found set of optimal conditions of the cwpo reaction over the synthetic surrogate of surface water fig 1 a the color removal was quite similar in the presence of both catalysts 95 whereas the doc mineralization was around 10 higher in the presence of the al fe pilctechnical catalyst both catalysts exhibited pretty high levels of carbon mineralization considering the set of middle ambient conditions of reaction used natural ph and t and input doc within the average measured values in raw water supplies of dwtps and rural plants as it can be seen the role of both the catalyst s adsorption 10 8 and the straight oxidation of the organic substrates by the molecular h2o2 9 8 were negligible and not able to explain the measured levels of doc mineralization besides the mineralization promoted via homogeneous fenton reaction in all experiments always below 0 3 mg dm3 table 2 was negligible 1 95 the color removal was 16 4 disregarding any significant contribution of this side process at circumneutral ph finally under optimal conditions of reaction the efficiency of hydrogen peroxide consumption 80 after 4 h in the presence of the cheaper al fe pilctechnical catalyst was quite similar to that exhibited by the al fe pilcanalytical one fig 1b since the oxidizing agent is the only reagent truly consumed and the solid catalyst is the core driving the process this result may significantly facilitate the cost effective application of this catalytic process assisting urban or rural plants at real scale in the short term 3 4 al fe pilc catalyzed cwpo treatment of real water samples every real surface water was treated in the presence of the al fe pilctechnical clay catalyst under optimal conditions of the cwpo reaction above determined the physicochemical properties of the real surface water samples are displayed in table 1 and those of the cwpo treated water samples in table 2 hereafter such a set of properties will be assessed as a function of i the type of dwtp supplied urban or rural r and ii the type of starting water raw rw effluent of the physicochemical treatment ep or effluent of the chlorination unit ec 3 4 1 effect of ph and temperature of real waters on the performance of the cwpo treatment the real surface water samples displayed ph values between around 6 0 and 8 0 and temperatures in the range 10 0 c 19 0 c table 1 within the experimental ranges yet considered in the statistical optimization of the oxidizing process for each parameter table 4s the cwpo treatment showed acceptable efficiency at every assessed natural ph and temperature table 2 the ph in all of the cases slightly dropped upon treatment probably due to formation of light carboxylic acid by products as already documented for lignin and other phenol like model molecules 34 35 in this regard the doc mineralization of water samples with high initial ph values such as rw r chaguaipe ph0 8 12 doc removal mineralization 74 2 did not get significantly affected by the natural trend of hydrogen peroxide to self decompose into water and oxygen at increasing ph 7 indeed it was observed that at lower input ph values like in the case of rw r lomaz ph0 6 07 the doc mineralization was lower 52 6 then the doc mineralization in real surface waters showed to be more affected by the presence of scavenging species mainly inorganic anions than by the circum neutral ph values featuring this natural streams it strongly connects with the statistical analysis of correlation that ruled out any significant effect of natural ph or temperature of these sources on the cwpo performance within the assessed range t 9 20 27 9 c ph 6 2 8 4 3 4 2 color removal doc mineralization h2o2 consumed and dn removal through the cwpo treatment of real surface waters the color removal fig 4s doc mineralization fig 2 and h2o2 consumed fig 5s supplementary dataset 20 through the catalytic oxidation were analyzed as a function of the type of drinking water treatment plant supplied dwtp vs r and type of starting water rw vs ep vs ec for urban plants the removal of true color from raw waters supplying them were obtained in the range 73 7 91 3 and the doc mineralizations between 51 2 and 77 3 for water samples previously treated by the conventional physicochemical method lower values of color removal in the range of 70 4 85 5 and doc mineralizations between 27 3 and 61 1 were obtained finally treatment on samples previously treated by the disinfection process yielded color removals in the interval 84 0 92 5 and doc mineralizations between 22 6 and 54 8 in the case of rural plants the color removal for raw waters supplying the studied rural plants was in the range 69 4 95 2 and the doc mineralizations between 26 6 and 74 2 these general results are hereafter analyzed in depth as a function of every catalytic recorded response but also taking into account the physicochemical properties featured by each type of real surface water sample a true color removal 456 nm on most of the studied streams a rapid color disappearance was observed through the 30 min of adsorption desorption equilibrium between the dissolved nom and the catalyst surface which represented 50 70 of the total depletion observed at final time of the experiments fig 4s supplementary dataset 20 thus color removal in this case was mainly governed by the early adsorption of chromophores however it is worth noting that no significant effect of adsorption should be expected for the cwpo color removal in continuous regime where the steady state must be obviously fulfilled hence whereas under semi batch regime the h2o2 must gradually displace adsorbed organics from the surface to adsorb onto the fe sites under continuous flow the hydrogen peroxide should maintain the nom adsorption partially restricted and mainly far of the neighbors to the active sites in the case of the urban dwtps figs 4s a d although there was an apparent trend from low to high color removal at final time of reaction rw ep ec it must be stressed that such differences were not statistically significant see table 3s supplementary dataset 20 instead it looked to depend more on both factors the higher initial color content of rw as compared to both ep and ec together with the decreasing hydrophobic nature of the dissolved nom across the advance of the conventional stages of treatment in the urban plants see later suva254 whose adsorption on the catalyst surface seemed to be favored see figs 4s a d at 30 min on the other hand rw r lomaz suva254 17 0 table 1 displayed one of the highest color removal within the water samples from rural plants at final time of reaction fig 4s e therefore high suva254 values seemed to favor the catalytic degradation of the chromophores remaining in the fluid phase after the adsorption on the al fe pilc clay catalysts it is expected that due to the quite variable composition of nom from one source to another its elimination by oxidation as well as adsorption must be different primarily as a function of the specific distribution of polar fractions of nom dissolved in water 36 so it is evident that at final time of reaction there was a strong correlation between input suva254 and the color removal it was confirmed with the statistical analysis of correlation spearman either for urban or rural plants input parameters of po4 3 concentration apparent color suva254 and ph in this order in blue table 3 displayed correlation with the color removal achieved by the cwpo treatment besides whereas suva254 and apparent color displayed a positive correlation in other words higher input values favored the color removal the opposite was found for the concentration of phosphates and the ph this is somehow expectable since phosphates may scavenge oxidizing radicals 7 decreasing the process efficiency whereas it is well known that oxidizing potential of ros typically formed in fenton reactions vanishes at increasing ph values 7 37 on the other hand those parameters that displayed statistical correlation with the catalytic response table 3 were fed into a multiple regression analysis table 6s supplementary dataset 20 besides those ones that could influence the response although did not show statistical significance in the spearman correlation turbidity and so4 2 concentration giving rise to an r2 of 98 8 the estimated coefficients obtained for these parameters were negative 1 48 and 0 52 respectively which means that the higher either turbidity or so4 2 concentration the lower color removal achieved by the cwpo treatment this can be clearly illustrated by the raw water sample rw r yaramal that showed the lowest color removal in this case mostly ascribed to the highest po4 3 concentration 0 170 mg dm3 table 1 within this series of rural samples in the case of the raw waters supplying urban plants rw dwtp pasto 91 3 displayed a color removal significantly higher than rw dwtp ipiales 73 7 it probably occurred because of the higher turbidity and concentration of sulfates in rw dwtp ipiales 6 3 ntu and 40 4 mg so4 2 dm3 in comparison with rw dwtp pasto 3 9 ntu and 3 00 mg so4 2 dm3 likewise rw dwtp túquerres in spite of displaying low turbidity 2 0 ntu showed low color removal that in this case could be attributed to both high concentration of sulfates 17 7 mg dm3 and low suva254 2 0 conversely in the case of the effluents of the physicochemical units although the turbidity was in general lower than in their corresponding rw samples the concentration of sulfates and chlorides increased by the addition of coagulants and the suva254 decreased effects which combined led to lower color removal for ep respect to rw samples therefore only based in the extent of the color removal across the different stages of treatment in the dwtps fig 4s d and the statistical analysis of correlation it is difficult to establish the most appropriate stage for coupling a cwpo unit to assist urban plants as said there was no marked difference in the final values achieved by the oxidizing treatment over each type of input water fig 4s d although rw samples in average displayed higher values of suva254 and lower contents of sulfates favoring the color removal in comparison with ep and ec samples they also exhibited higher concentrations of phosphates ph and turbidity depleting it therefore it is mandatory to assess the performance of the cwpo technology also in terms of doc mineralization and h2o2 consumed b doc mineralization doc mineralization is for sure the most important and desired response that any aop might promote in the purpose of supplementing conventional dwtps the carbon mineralization is the main way by which the later formation of disinfection by products dbps upon chlorination can be prevented or significantly reduced the doc values of the real surface waters were found falling within a broad range 1 52 mg c dm3 13 4 mg c dm3 table 1 the doc mineralization along the earlier 30 min of treatment was always significantly lower than the color removal fig 2 where in the case of the urban plants fig 2a d just approximately 10 20 of the starting doc got retained into the catalyst surface by simple adsorption however it strongly varied for the raw waters supplying rural plants fig 2e primarily related with the content of phosphates and the content of dissolved iron in the second place table 1 apparently both factors strongly favored the adsorption of doc on the al fe pilc catalyst nevertheless the mineralization by the oxidant is better evaluated at reaction times greater than 180 min 210 min of every experiment once the fractions more strongly adsorbed on the external surface of the catalyst got broken which could explain the general trend of rapid rise of the measured mineralization at the final tracked reaction time in urban plants a trend of doc mineralization at final time of reaction opposite to that of color removal was found that is rw 50 77 ep 27 61 ec 23 58 through the conventional stages of treatment corroborated in fig 2d for the average of the 3 studied urban plants this could be related to a higher initial doc content of rw compared to ep and ec except in the case of dwtp ipiales table 2 this means that the mineralization in this catalytic system was favored by the initial concentration of doc in principle it also suggests the mineralization efficiency being favored by the higher suva254 values table 1 in the starting water against the ep and ec samples in other words this mineralization apparently occurred preferentially over the hydrophobic fraction of dissolved nom and more easily over the aromatic content of these organic substrates moreover this behavior should be also partially ascribed to the strong presence of scavenging species inhibiting the aop treatment over either ep or ec samples because of the earlier addition of coagulants in the physicochemical stage of treatment the same trend was observed in the raw waters supplying the rural plants where the doc mineralization was also favored by higher values of both initial doc and suva254 table 1 this also allowed us to infer that the oxidative degradation of these macromolecular contaminants widely present in surface waters catalyzed by al fe pilcs is not mediated by the previous adsorption of the contaminants in the neighborhood of the active sites if it is taken into account that in this type of catalysts these are predominantly stabilized within the microporous region where the nom fractions with the highest molecular weights must be expected to undergo strong steric hindrance a comparison of raw waters against their corresponding effluents of the physicochemical treatment in all the assessed urban plants revealed that almost three fold higher values of doc removal were achieved by the cwpo treatment on the rw samples than the conventional coagulation flocculation process taking place in dwtp pasto and dwtp túquerres in the case of ipiales urban plant this value was still around twice the one accomplished by its physicochemical unit in this regard it has been reported that coagulation treatments baseline coagulation optimized for turbidity removal successfully eliminate over 50 of the nom present in water preferably for nom with suva254 4 while enhanced coagulation coagulation optimized for doc removal reaches values 8 30 above normal coagulation 36 trying to explain why measured doc removals were rather low 23 30 upon the physicochemical treatment currently developed at the studied urban plants several factors must be taken into account on factor can be the high concentration of chlorides and sulfates i e in rw dwtp ipiales that has been found to adversely affect the efficiency of the coagulation process in the doc removal 36 in second place coagulation has been conventionally applied in water treatment to decrease turbidity and color as well as suspended particles and pathogens however it is very important to highlight that the optimum operating conditions promoting either turbidity or color removal by coagulation are not necessarily the same favoring doc removal 36 in this sense from a comparison of the measured both turbidity removal 87 46 and 5 0 and the doc removal 23 0 and 30 in the urban plants of pasto ipiales and túquerres respectively it can be observed that in rw dwtp pasto and rw dwtp ipiales the removal of turbidity was higher than the doc removal while in rw dwtp túquerres the coagulation process should be more rather focused on the doc removal because of the too low values of turbidity in the input water supply in the case of rw dwtp pasto the doc removal by coagulation was favored by the high suva254 value of the input water 4 9 dm3 mg doc m which can be ascribed to the presence of more hydrophobic fractions of nom meanwhile in the hydrophilic fraction the coagulation process needs to be optimized in order to improve the efficiency of doc removal where usually higher doses of coagulant are required along with acidic ph 38 a higher hydrophilic character in rw dwtp túquerres according to its much lower suva254 0 7 dm3 mg doc m as compared with rw dwtp pasto suva254 4 9 dm3 mg doc m and rw dwtp ipiales suva254 3 0 dm3 mg doc m explains the low efficiency in the coagulation process at this urban plant once approached the cwpo over rw and its corresponding comparison with the efficiency of the conventional physicochemical treatment it is noteworthy that in partially treated samples ep or ec the lower performance exhibited by the cwpo treatment in the doc mineralization probably obeyed to higher average contents of chlorides in ep in comparison with their rw counterparts as reported in a previous study 17 the chlorides act as strong trapping agents of radical oxidizing species in example the reaction rate constant between ho and cl is approximately ten to thirty times higher 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 than the one for the reaction of ho with nom 1 4 4 5 108 m 1 s 1 then a clear competition is established between nom and these inorganic anions 17 thus in general for dwtp ipiales lower mineralizations were obtained as compared to samples from dwtp túquerres and dwtp pasto which could be attributed to higher inhibition of the cwpo process by the presence of high concentrations of chlorides 23 7 mg cl dm3 in average therefore in this study the cwpo process on raw water significantly increased the doc removal in comparison with the conventional physicochemical treatment but showed to be strongly affected by concentrations of chlorides exceeding around 10 mg dm3 in this regard post chlorinated samples of course also showed further inhibition mainly because of their contents of chlorides consistently increased in comparison with their rw and ep counterparts moreover the effect exerted by other species and properties featured by every starting water also deserves to be carefully examined the statistical analysis of bivariate correlation table 3 confirmed the significant effect of chlorides depleting the catalytic performance of the cwpo process besides the multiple regression analysis table 7s supplementary dataset 20 displayed that po4 3 suva254 so4 2 alkalinity cl and starting color in this order were the most significant parameters of the real surface water samples affecting the doc mineralization at the final time of reaction as expected chlorides and sulfates showed negative coefficients related to their scavenging effect whereas phosphates alkalinity and starting color displayed positive values favoring this catalytic response moreover it is remarkable that suva254 table 7s supplementary dataset 20 also showed a negative coefficient that is declining the doc mineralization this is opposite to what it was formerly revealed in terms of the color removal in that case favoring decolourization in spite of suva254 has been long recognized favoring conventional coagulation flocculation processes 36 and also indirectly the oxidizing attack by hydroxyl radicals formed in aops 39 our results show that it is not the case as a function of mineralization of the dissolved carbon by the cwpo process activated by al fe pilcs it could be explained because although the early oxidizing attack on the hydrophobic strongly aromatic moieties of nom high suva254 values successfully takes place these transformations do not involve significant mineralization of the dissolved carbon but instead rapid reduction in the aromatic content see the evolution of uv254 and suva254 at urban plants here studied fig 3 meanwhile for lower suva254 values the mineralization into co2 seemed to happen more easily it correlates well with the reaction pathway proposed several decades ago for the fenton oxidation of phenol 40 a common model molecule closely resembling one of the most abundant functional groups in the real dissolved nom in that case the first steps of oxidation occur with transformations into hydroquinone catechol p benzoquinone and o benzoquinone but it is not until the formation of 2 5 dioxo 3 hexenodioc acid and muconic acid when the carbon mineralization actually starts likewise the scavenging effect of chlorides may seriously diminish the doc mineralization even performing over low input suva254 in the case of the rural plants fig 2e unlike what observed in the case of the water samples supplying urban dwtps there was a significant influence of the physicochemical properties of the input waters table 1 on the doc depletion by simple adsorption probably this is why the phosphate content from the multiple regression analysis table 7s supplementary dataset 20 apparently showed to strongly favor the overall doc depletion at final time of reaction even though phosphates are well known scavenging species of oxidizing radicals formed in aops 7 conversely the iron content was not significant at all on any of the measured responses table 3 and then it was not considered in the multiple regression model finally it is very interesting to speculate about the most advantageous stage of treatment at conventional urban plants where the cwpo could be coupled to enhance the overall quality of the produced drinking water first of all it seems clear that based on the results already analyzed in terms of color and doc removal the effluent of chlorination can be ruled out because of the strong scavenging effect undergone by the cwpo or any other aop in the presence of chlorides therefore it is convenient to analyze the average final doc obtained from every stage of treatment at the urban plants and the cwpo experiments over the same water samples table 4 since in average the lower final doc content was achieved over the ep samples 1 08 mg c dm3 slightly below the one obtained over the treated rw ones 1 37 mg c dm3 it suggests ep to be the stage of treatment at urban plants where the cwpo process might perform more advantageous of course it would be preferable if some further data could be analyzed adding the treatments to compare rw cwpo physicochemical treatment vs rw physicochemical treatment cwpo but it should be performed latter at full size real scale or at least pilot scale experiments however in the context of the current work it is still possible to evaluate both scenarios in terms of the efficiency of h2o2 consumption it is quite important assessing the cost effectiveness of the coupling c h2o2 consumption broadly distributed values of utilization of the added hydrogen peroxide were recorded for raw water samples supplying either urban and rural plants 38 9 72 3 fig 5s a e supplementary dataset 20 as well as for the physicochemical effluents 52 0 93 9 whereas narrower values were measured in the post chlorinated streams 52 5 67 6 table 2 accordingly the rw and ep samples were more susceptible against the random utilization of the oxidizing agent by the high variability in the physicochemical properties of the input samples because of the presence of several side reactions consuming peroxide the peroxide consumption has shown to be the cwpo response most highly affected by the physicochemical properties displayed by every real surface water sample since this parameter does not primarily depend on either the initial charge or polarity of the nom content but in a greater extent on the presence of scavenging species in each matrix increasing the consumption of the oxidizing agent without this being necessarily translated in a deeper level of degradation or mineralization of the organic substrates indeed in the case of urban plants all water samples fell in the region of 52 0 71 8 of peroxide consumption with the exception of ep dwtp pasto that exhibited the highest use of h2o2 93 9 however it is worth noting that this sample did not display higher mineralization as compared to its corresponding raw water this confirms that the presence of chlorides in the post physicochemical effluent favors parasitic reactions of peroxide decreasing the overall process efficiency the consumption of hydrogen peroxide was greater for dwtp pasto and dwtp túquerres samples respect to those from dwtp ipiales with the exception of the samples ec dwtp ipiales and ec dwtp túquerres higher doc mineralizations were also recorded for rw dwtp túquerres and rw dwtp pasto 77 3 and 74 9 respectively in comparison to ep dwtp ipiales 52 0 it reveals that the consumed hydrogen peroxide was mostly activated by the solid catalyst in the treatment of dwtp túquerres and dwtp pasto whereas in the case of dwtp ipiales a significant fraction of the added peroxide became wasted by parasitic reactions probably facilitated by their higher turbidity table 1 the treatment of raw waters supplying rural plants revealed a decrease in the consumption of hydrogen peroxide in the following order rw r chaguaipe rw r yaramal rw r charandú rw r lomaz rw r orejuela although this trend approximately follows a decreasing order of the initial doc and therefore of the net amount of peroxide added to each reaction two exceptions are remarkable i rw r yaramal displayed a higher peroxide consumption than rw r charandú although the former one had around half initial doc this may be associated with a very high presence of chlorides in rw r yaramal compared to rw r charandú but as said also because of the strong effect exerted by the content of phosphates table 1 ii rw r orejuela exhibited lower peroxide consumption than rw r lomaz although it had more than double the initial doc of the second one it probably occurred because rw r orejuela displayed around 5 times less alkalinity and 10 times less initial turbidity but also lower content of dissolved fe despite of showing a concentration of chlorides about 6 times greater which suggests that turbidity alkalinity and fe beside to the content of chlorides increase the peroxide consumption in this catalytic system reducing the overall efficiency of the process it has been reported that the fenton removal of contaminants is higher under acidic conditions as more iron dissolves in the ph range 3 0 4 0 10 favoring an homogeneous fenton reaction in parallel with the heterogeneous fenton particularly in the presence of solid catalysts with poor chemical stability it was not the case in the presence of the al fe pilc clay catalyst since the measured iron leaching was always very low table 2 indeed for both urban and rural plants the lower use of peroxide matched with the lower ph values in the input streams which could be explained by the fact that at higher ph levels the decomposition of h2o2 in water and oxygen was favored besides it also suggests that no significant change was observed in the fenton activation of hydrogen peroxide as a function of the ph of the water sample again it probably obeyed to the role played by ros other than hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals taking place in the presence of dissolved nom it has been recently reported 41 42 that the dissolved nom may exert a photosensitizer effect in the presence of visible light although the catalytic experiments here displayed were not performed under any irradiation other than the natural light of the lab it is not possible to disregard that such a photocatalytic contribution took place in our experiments therefore probably the turbidity in raw waters depleted the cwpo performance in our experiments by reducing the interaction of the natural with the dissolved nom the multiple regression analysis revealed that all po4 3 ph and cl in this order were significant explaining the h2o2 consumed in our experiments table 8s supplementary dataset 20 whereas there was not a significant contribution of the suva254 over this response as said the consumption of h2o2 is the major contributor to the operating cost of the cwpo process hence the unconverted h2o2 a priori cannot be easily recovered in this application and should be destroyed before the effluent being fed into a drinking water distribution tank 43 thus the efficiency ε of h2o2 consumption is an important parameter to be considered in the potential application of the cwpo process in a real scale system fig 4 displays ε obtained in the treatment of the synthetic nom surrogates and the three types of real water samples collected at urban plants rw ep and ec the synthetic surrogate samples were used through the statistical optimization of the process the samples marked within a red dotted circle correspond to the optimal conditions of the first 0 002 mg h2o2 mg doc mg fe elsewhere recently reported 17 and the second 0 037 mg h2o2 mg doc mg fe here displayed series of optimal conditions of reaction for the cwpo al fe pilc catalytic system as it can be seen although the second optimization described in the current study partially sacrificed the efficiency of the h2o2 consumption ɛ dropped from 0 638 to 0 437 both delivered quite similar selectivity to doc mineralization over the same synthetic surrogate of nom whereas the maximal achieved mineralization was enhanced from 75 to 89 by using both a peroxide dose of 3 77 mg h2o2 mg doc and a catalyst load of 3 81 g al fe pilc dm3 as shown in fig 4 both conditions can be combined for practical purposes in an optimal dose of added peroxide per unit mass of doc and unit mass of active sites in the solid catalyst 0 037 mg h2o2 mg doc mg fe besides it allows to establish the most cost effective alternative for the application of the cwpo complementing conventional drinking water treatment plants dwtps the value here achieved for ε under optimal conditions of reaction in the degradation of the synthetic surrogate of nom ε 0 437 is more than three fold enhanced in comparison with the efficiency reported in other recent studies fig 4 whereas the selectivity of doc mineralization σ remained close to 90 for instance inchaurrondo et al 25 found a maximal ε 0 107 with σ 90 employing 25 g dm3 of catalyst load 1 3 times the stoichiometric ratio of h2o2 6 578 mg dm3 under 70 c in the cwpo degradation of 1 g dm3 of phenol meanwhile zazo et al 2011 24 found ε 0 043 0 124 at different temperatures 25 130 c using the stoichiometric dose of h2o2 500 mg dm3 and 10 mg dm3 fe2 studying the intensification of the classical fenton process in the phenol degradation moreover a challenging issue is the jump from the treatment of a spiked synthetic surrogate to real water samples which is the main focus of this study it is somehow expectable a compulsory decrease in ε both the efficiency of the h2o2 consumption and the selectivity to doc mineralization followed the similar trends rw ep ec and rw ep ec respectively although similar ε values were found for ec and ep the hydrogen peroxide consumption was not related with the doc mineralization since σ was clearly lower for ec thus taking into account the more efficient consumption of h2o2 the most suitable point to apply the technology seems to be the raw waters rw cwpo physicochemical treatment however it must be carefully handled because the higher the input doc content the greater the amount of h2o2 added per unit volume of treated water which is the case for the rw samples moreover probably it could be not necessarily too expensive considering the typical doc contents in typical surface waters employed as supplies often below 10 mg dm3 and hardly ever exceeding 15 mg dm3 conversely the application of the oxidizing technology over the physicochemical effluent rw physicochemical treatment cwpo might be also feasible although implying lower efficiency of the h2o2 consumption besides it must be considered the coagulant in average being better used treating the raw water supply than the effluent of the cwpo treatment getting lower remaining doc table 4 which in turn minimizes the latter formation of disinfection by products d nitrogen removal real surface water samples collected either from urban or rural plants showed dissolved nitrogen dn values between 0 16 and 0 81 mg n dm3 table 1 on the samples from dwtps the dn degradation followed the trend rw ep ec through the conventional stages of treatment although at final time of the experiments fig 6s supplementary dataset 20 the average of the rural plants samples almost matched the nitrogen removal of raw waters supplying urban plants at earlier times of the cwpo reaction there was an important influence of the aromatic content apparently promoting the removal of nitrogen table 1 it is remarkable that the significantly higher contents of all chlorides phosphates nitrates and total iron in rural plants in this case did not show to affect the cwpo mineralization of the dn it has been reported 44 that several organic compounds such as proteins amino sugars porphyrins nucleic acids and alkaloids from vascular plants microbial and algae sources as well as agrochemicals e g fertilizers contain nitrogen contributing to the nitrogen in natural organic matter heterocyclic aromatic compounds including pyrroles pyridines pyrazines indoles and carbazoles use to be in greater abundance in nom s transphilic and colloidal fractions therefore it is very likely that part of the degraded aromatic content was related with nitrogen containing compounds nevertheless the maximal achieved mineralization of nitrogen was in comparison significantly lower than that observed for the doc removal in the same samples see at figs 6s and 2 in spite of the high efficiency of the cwpo reaction catalyzed by al fe pilcs recently reported removing 78 of the dn content from a solution of methyl orange 5 0 g al fe pilc dm3 50 of the stoichiometric dose of h2o2 30 including cleavage of nn in the azo dye and its derived aromatic amines the rate of degradation seems to be very different from that of the carbon content and strongly depends on the degree of oxidation of this element contained in every targeted pollutant thus in terms of the nitrogen removal the couplings rw cwpo rural plants and either rw cwpo or ep cwpo urban plants are all suitable options to be considered in the implementation of a cwpo unit complementing currently operating conventional dwtps 3 4 3 iron leaching the concentration of leached iron in the real water samples was quite low 0 1 0 25 mg dm3 indicating the high stability of the al fe pilc clay catalyst in good correlation with previous studies 17 where concentrations between 0 1 0 3 mg dm3 of iron were found an interesting variant of the cwpo process reported in recent years has been the use of natural minerals with high iron content for water treatment in one particular case the mineralization took place in an homogeneous fenton in parallel to the heterogeneous fenton process due to the significant dissolution of iron from the mineral favored at acidic ph 45 which works very well for wastewater treatment nevertheless since in water for human consumption iron concentrations are restricted to specific limits let s say around 0 3 mg dm3 the control of the iron leaching is mandatory for this application 3 4 4 evolution of suva254 upon the cwpo treatment of real surface water the suva254 correlates the uv254 and doc contents that in our context mainly estimate the susceptibility of nom to be degraded by the conventional physicochemical or the cwpo treatments a comparison between uv254 doc and suva254 for either the cwpo treated or untreated samples from urban rw ep and ec and rural plants are shown in the fig 3 first of all a decreasing doc removal upon the cwpo treatment of samples from dwtps going in the direction rw ep ec was observed it can be ascribed to lower contribution of the hydrophobic fraction of nom to the full doc content in the same trend along the conventional treatment as shown by the decreasing suva254 values although no limit values have been defined it is widely claimed that suva254 4 0 indicates mainly hydrophobic and especially aromatic compounds whereas suva254 3 0 can be used to indicate predominantly hydrophilic character 46 47 besides in most of the cases either at urban or rural plants the uv254 removal was greater than that of dissolved organic carbon showing a high specificity of the oxidizing process first converting the aromatic content without significant carbon mineralization hence as a general trend it appears that such a content was removed more effectively than other nom fractions at earlier times of reaction where probably a decline of the π electron systems took place alongside decreasing the number of aromatic rings or conjugated bonds in chain structures or the conversion of linear ring systems to non linear ones 47 nevertheless water samples from túquerres dwtp túquerres showed a quite different behavior where the doc content was removed in higher proportion with respect to the uv254 probably because in this case the starting nom showed to be most likely hydrophilic suva254 2 0 46 on the other hand suva254 in average showed lower or at least comparable values after the cwpo treatment irrespective of the type of water raw or partially treated the same trend was verified in the treatment of real waters supplying the rural plants fig 3d however the cwpo process demonstrated to be particularly efficient at urban plants depleting the aromatic content in raw surface waters exhibiting starting suva254 exceeding a certain limit around 2 0 in the case of rural plants the oxidizing process showed to be useful decreasing the aromatic content in terms of both the uv254 absorbance and the suva254 values conversely water samples collected in the urban dwtp of túquerres displayed starting suva254 values below 2 0 which always increased after the cwpo reaction although the cwpo treatment fig 3a and b on water samples rw dwtp pasto and rw dwtp ipiales decreased suva254 the physicochemical treatment of the dwtps in both cases was quite efficient and achieved to remove greater percentage of the hydrophobic content meanwhile the suva254 changed less after the oxidizing treatment applied over both the ep and ec effluents on the other hand the samples from túquerres urban plant displayed lower starting suva254 values table 1 typical of nom fractions with higher aliphatic character also more difficult to be degraded the physicochemical treatment of this type of influent streams usually needs greater doses of coagulants 39 in this case the amount of dissolved organic carbon was preferentially removed over the uv254 content fig 3c so that the aromatic residue got concentrated on a smaller fraction of dissolved organic carbon it might seem at first sight that samples of dwtp túquerres displayed better quality by comparison with the others studied samples due to lower concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and turbidity however the presence of aromatic compounds of low molecular weight and difficult to degrade may require greater care in the context of the potential of formation of dbps upon chlorination in summary there were collected two types of rw samples at the urban dwtps studied i suva254 3 0 dwtp pasto and dwtp ipiales where the physicochemical treatment by conventional means is suitable and ii suva254 2 0 dwtp túquerres in the first case most of the starting hydrophobic material could be removed by typical coagulation flocculation suggesting the physicochemical treatment before the aop to be more cost effective likewise in the second case the cwpo treatment of the raw water might allow the removal of more hydrophilic nom just the moiety where the physicochemical treatment is not that efficient while the cwpo effluent might be more susceptible for successful treatment by coagulation flocculation since the suva254 for instance of the rw dwtp túquerres treated by cwpo increased from 0 7 to 2 4 3 5 proposed mechanism for the al fe pilc catalyzed cwpo degradation of dissolved nom a plausible mechanism for the nom degradation by the al fe pilc catalyzed cwpo is displayed in fig 5 although the adsorption played a significant role in the measured color removal fig 4s supplementary dataset 20 it was not fundamental in the subsequent mineralization of the doc content fig 2 the strong adsorption of the nom s chromophores during the first 30 min of the catalytic essays partially blocked the proper diffusion of the oxidant towards the metal active sites which would explain the poor mineralization rates measured at early times of the cwpo reaction followed by the rapid rise once exceeded around 2 h of the oxidizing reaction fig 2 moreover the blocking of active sites was just partial probably since the most active sites in the al fe pilcs are mainly located in the microporous zone of the catalyst where the higher molecular weights of nom could not access it is opposite to what it was recently reported by maqbool et al 49 over n doped reduced graphene oxide activated persulfate where the nom removal occurred in the sequence adsorption oxidation and the adsorption was claimed to be a fundamental step thus the al fe pilc activated cwpo degradation of dissolved nom could be explained in terms of two kinds of possible interactions between the catalyst and the complex organic substrates i van der waals and ii mostly electrostatic in this regard nom is a poly electrolytic organic mixture with quite flexible distribution of molecular weights and sizes it has been reported that ph values over 5 0 promote the formation of molecular building blocks through self assembled structures due to the presence of van der waals intermolecular forces capable of stabilizing the aggregates 48 lambert 50 recently reported the presence of hydrophobic interactions favored by the highly complex nom structure whose aromatic content tends to remain together and segregated from the aqueous solution therefore since the dissolved nom features a well known amphiphilic nature 48 either isolated hydrophobic domains or polar subunits may be in contact with the catalyst depending on both the polar character and the charge density of the catalyst s surface in the case of clay derived materials including the pillared clays the siloxanes in the basal planes or the lamellar edges are known to be hydrophobic adequate surfaces for nom aromatic centers in this regard the measured pzc of the al fe pilctechnical clay catalyst was found at ph 4 52 fig 7s supplementary dataset 20 thus at lower ph values the charge of the catalyst s surface is expected to be predominantly positive and negative when they are above the phpzc then since the ph values of all the real waters were between 6 07 8 12 table 1 the catalyst s surface through the cwpo experiments was negatively charged on the other hand nom may encompass important contents of aromatic aliphatic phenolic and quinonic functions the humic substances usually representing approximately 50 of the doc in nom 36 are rich in aromatic carbon phenolic structures and conjugated double bonds 38 given the large number of carboxylic groups they also exhibit it has been reported that most of the nom fractions contain the same types of carboxylic acids in different concentrations and then the ionization of carboxylic and phenolic acid groups must be taken into account tipping et al 51 reported three pka values for fulvic acids 2 4 3 6 and 5 6 whereas gomez et al 52 six pka values for humic acids 2 6 4 3 5 5 6 7 8 0 and 9 6 hence at ph values higher than 9 0 the charge is more likely the result of the phenolic groups whereas between 7 5 and 9 0 all carboxylic acids are expected to be ionized 53 therefore for all waters here studied which are expected to closely represent most of the surface waters supplying dwtps all around the world it is expected all functional groups of fulvic acids and at least 50 of the humic substances to be ionized bearing negative net charges consequently it explains why along the first 30 min of the cwpo experiments over the samples with either the lowest and highest ph values here assessed 6 07 and 8 12 corresponding to rw r lomaz and rw r chaguaipe respectively fig 4s e a significantly higher color removal was measured for the first sample it could be ascribed to both lower solubility of the high molecular weight less negatively charged fractions of nom and stronger interactions between not ionized groups and the catalyst s surface as the ph declined consequently it is not surprising that ph of input waters was found to be a significant parameter over the color removal in the statistical correlation of variables by multiple regression analysis table 6s supplementary dataset 20 notwithstanding the foregoing it is remarkable that no statistical effect was found for the input ph over the final achieved doc mineralization it suggests that at decreasing ph the van der waals interactions between hydrophobic fractions and the catalyst s surface prevailed over the electrostatic ones which in spite of directly influencing the color removal only marginally affected the doc mineralization it can be illustrated by comparison of the cwpo treatment over samples rw dwtp túquerres and rw dwtp pasto although the former one exhibited highly hydrophilic character in contrast with the highly hydrophobic of the second the final doc mineralization was quite similar table 2 accordingly the results here obtained can be gathered into the following plausible mechanism for the nom degradation in real surface waters by the cwpo oxidizing process catalyzed by al fe pilcs the adsorption of the complex organic substrates on the catalyst s surface was favored at lower ph values but mainly driven by hydrophobic interactions at the earlier times of reaction the adsorption of the heavier more hydrophobic fractions of nom the already so called catalyst coating 54 delay the effective interaction between the fe active sites mainly stabilized within the microporous region of this kind of clay catalysts and the hydrogen peroxide nevertheless the doc mineralization did not show to be governed by such previous adsorption suggesting that both hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions either adsorbed or not in advance got successfully attacked by the oxidizing species 4 conclusions an aluminum iron pillared clay al fe pilc catalyst was successfully prepared using technical grade reagents al fe pilctechnical exhibiting quite comparable textural and still better catalytic properties in comparison with the material prepared from analytical grade costly reagents al fe pilcanalytical the cwpo degradation of a synthetic surrogate of nom in the presence of the al fe pilcanalytical catalyst displayed optimal performance using a dose of 3 77 mg h2o2 mg doc and 3 81 g dm3 of the catalyst equivalent to 102 mg active fe dm3 for practical purposes it is proposed the use of the optimal dose of added peroxide per unit mass of both doc and fe active sites in the solid catalyst to be 0 037 mg h2o2 mg doc mg fe high color removal 95 and doc mineralization 89 were achieved in 3 h under pretty mild ambient conditions of reaction whereas neither ph temperature or input doc concentrations showed any significant effect within the assessed ranges typical of surface waters at countries in the tropic the levels of leached fe in all experiments always below 0 3 mg dm3 confirmed the doc mineralization via homogeneous fenton being negligible thanks to the highly stable catalyst under the input circumneutral ph which in turn slightly decreased throughout the catalytic experiments due to formation of light carboxylic acids the catalytic system was thoroughly evaluated in the treatment of real surface waters currently supplying five rural and three urban drinking water treatment plants at different types of water samples raw water effluents of physicochemical or disinfection treatments the depletion in the catalytic performance in comparison with the treatment of a synthetic surrogate of nom was found to follow the physicochemical features of the input streams mostly the presence of scavenging species instead than the variable ambient conditions of ph temperature or input doc the doc mineralization unlike the color removal was not governed by the previous adsorption of these complex substrates on the catalyst s surface because the active sites in this type of modified clays get predominantly stabilized within the microporous region where the heavier nom fractions undergo strong steric hindrance sulfates and chlorides in this order showed detrimental effect on the doc removal because of their scavenging effect whereas alkalinity starting color and phosphates slightly favored this catalytic response apparently by promoting doc adsorption instead than doc mineralization conversely the dissolved iron content in the real water samples was not significant at all on any of the measured responses disregarding significant degradation of nom in this natural streams by homogeneous fenton just through peroxide addition high starting suva254 values did not show to favor the doc mineralization since although the early oxidizing attack on the hydrophobic strongly aromatic moieties successfully took place these transformations did not involve significant loss of dissolved carbon into co2 in good agreement with the reaction pathway already known for the fenton oxidation of phenol a common model molecule closely resembling the predominant functional groups in the real dissolved nom taking into account all i the doc mineralization the most essential response to be maximized in the purpose of enhancing a conventional drinking water treatment system with this advanced oxidation process by strongly preventing the later formation of disinfection by products upon chlorination ii the more cost effective consumption of h2o2 and iii the input suva254 value of the every available input stream it is proposed that the most advantageous coupling of the cwpo treatment to conventional dwtps should be raw water cwpo physicochemical treatment for raw waters featuring input suva254 values 2 0 dm3 mg doc m and raw water physicochemical treatment cwpo for input suva254 values 2 0 dm3 mg doc m it will seriously facilitate stakeholders to realize the best potential implementation of the cwpo process assisting currently operating dwtps to improve the overall quality of the produced drinking water finally it was evidenced that decreasing ph leads the interactions between hydrophobic fractions and the al fe pilc catalyst s surface to prevail over the electrostatic ones which in spite of directly influencing the color removal only marginally affected the doc mineralization thus the doc mineralization in this heterogeneous catalytic system is not governed by the previous adsorption of the complex organic substrates allowing for the hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions either adsorbed or not in advance to get successfully attacked and mineralized by the generated

natural organic matter nom strongly affects the quality of water in urban drinking water treatment plants dwtp either directly through the contribution to undesirable organoleptic properties such as color odor and taste of water or indirectly as the largest contributor to the formation of hazardous disinfection byproducts dbps 1 the conventional process used in urban drinking water treatment plants often based on coagulation flocculation followed by sedimentation flotation and filtration does not really achieve to fully remove nom 2 this process usually accomplishes to eliminate much of the hydrophobic fraction and the heaviest molecular weight fractions but a nom content mainly constituted by low molecular weight compounds remains 3 in many rural plants r nom usually represents even a greater risk due to the disinfectant in most of the cases chlorine being mostly added straight on the raw water supplies 4 mainly aimed at eliminating pathogens but at the same time strongly favoring the formation of dbps on the other hand some advanced oxidation processes aops could be cost effective alternatives to enhance drinking water treatment either at urban dwtps and rural r facilities moreover although the aops have been strongly investigated through the past two decades in the degradation of variety of contaminants in wastewaters they have been rather scarcely assessed intended to improve drinking water production 5 among the aops the catalytic wet peroxide oxidation cwpo is an heterogeneous fenton process that has shown excellent performance in the treatment of surface water sources even under middle environmental conditions of temperature and pressure 6 the use of an appropriate solid catalyst can substantially reduce the operational costs since it can be easily separated from the reacted effluent preventing formation and disposal of sludge typical of the homogeneous classic fenton process while it also enables proper operation within a wider ph range in the treatment of real water samples as compared with the homogeneous fenton well known to efficiently operate within the range 2 4 3 4 7 in this regard several studies about the heterogeneous fenton removal of organic compounds in water have been performed under acidic ph 8 10 but works under close to neutral ph values featured by real surface water supplies remain rather scarce one of the main drawbacks affecting this family of heterogeneous processes is the loss of activity of the catalysts due to iron leaching 11 12 however the mixed al fe pillared clay catalyst has demonstrated a highly stable content of active iron still under the aggressive oxidizing conditions of the fenton reaction 13 therefore the cwpo treatment employing al fe pilcs is a very interesting alternative in the treatment of dissimilar surface water samples additional to ph the dose of h2o2 the single reagent truly consumed along the process hence mainly contributing to the operational costs employed is other important parameter to take into account facing a potential scaling up of the cwpo technology or any other fenton based treatment the optimal dose of h2o2 strongly depends on all the initial load and chemical structure of the pollutants the ph and temperature of the influent stream the presence of scavenging species of reactive oxygen species ros type and phase solid or liquid of the catalyst employed active metal type of reactor continuous batch or semibatch and whether light irradiation is used among others thus broad range of doses and concentrations of h2o2 have been reported for instance following values and conditions 60 mg h2o2 dm3 7 1 mg c dm3 of surface water ph 6 5 temperature 30 c 1 0 mg of dissolved fe3 dm3 batch reactor simulated sunlight irradiation 300 nm 800 nm

from a synthetic surrogate of nom 75 of dissolved organic carbon doc and 86 of color were both successfully removed by using just 0 45 mg h2o2 mg doc 9 0 mg dm3 and 5 97 g dm3 of the al fe pilc clay catalyst ph 7 0 t 25 0 c starting doc 19 0 mg c dm3 and ambient pressure 72 kpa in a glass jacketed semi batch reactor iron leaching 0 1 0 3 mg dm3 however a strong depletion in the doc mineralization close to 50 was also found when the optimal conditions of reaction were assessed in the treatment of a real raw surface water then in spite of the promising performance of the cwpo process to assist drinking water treatment facilities in the presence of al fe pillared clay catalysts it is still mandatory to improve its performance in the treatment of variety of real water supplies as well as to measure the differential influence exerted by the most abundant dissolved ros scavenging species inorganic anions mostly likewise in the case of urban plants driving conventional physicochemical treatment it is not yet clear the most appropriate stage e g input raw water vs coagulation flocculation effluent or disinfection effluent where the cwpo or any other aop coupling would result more useful improving the output drinking water quality furthermore in the case of rural plants especially at low income countries where regularly just disinfection is occasionally performed it is still required to determine the true potential of the cwpo technology treating close to fully raw surface water in other words as a novel compact drinking water treatment plant accordingly in this study the efficiency of the cwpo process activated by an al fe pilc clay catalyst was evaluated in the removal of dissolved natural organic matter from different real surface water supplies either raw or partially treated water at several stages of three conventional urban dwtps in turn three sampling points into each plant and five rural plants were treated under natural and varied conditions of ph and temperature using our previous study as a starting reference 17 optimal conditions of the cwpo degradation of a synthetic nom surrogate achieved by multi response statistical tools were further refined now taking into account the presence of well known scavenging inorganic anions in several real surface water supplies besides the catalyst preparation was further enhanced now accessible from technical grade reagents making easier a potential scaling up of the process by smaller costs the catalytic results are analyzed in terms of doc and total nitrogen mineralization color removal 456 nm

apparent color uv254 absorbance turbidity alkalinity and contents of main inorganic anions on the catalytic performance using statistical tools of multiple correlation analysis finally a plausible mechanism for the cwpo degradation of dissolved nom catalyzed by al fe pilcs is proposed on the basis of the catalytic results 2 experimental 2 1 materials poly acrylic acid analytical standard

kg bench scale to assess the effect of changing the purity of the reagents used in the treatment of surface water samples the detailed procedure is available elsewhere 13 which can be briefly summarized as follows the pillaring concentrated solutions were prepared by mixing alcl3 6h2o fecl3 6h2o in the lowest possible volume of water followed by the slow addition of powdered elemental aluminum at 70 c under gentle stirring and reflux until full dissolution the resulting concentrated solution was then aged under constant stirring at 70 c for around 5 5 h and left to stand at room temperature for further 38 h afterwards the starting clay mineral a colombian bentonite extensively characterized 18 19 was slowly added over 4 h under constant and gentle stirring at 70 c on the previously prepared al fe hydrolyzed concentrated precursor the resulting concentrated clay dispersion was kept at 70 c for 8 h under vigorous stirring and finally left to stand for 12 h at room temperature the solids were then washed until the conductivity dropped to around 20 μs cm 1 in the washing liquors the washed material was then dried at 60 c and finally heated in air at 400 c for 2 h table 1s supplementary dataset 20 displays the main physicochemical properties of both al fe pillared clays and their corresponding starting minerals the al fe pilcanalytical catalyst was prepared from analytical reagents whereas the al fe pilctechnical material corresponds to the one prepared from technical grade reagents the chemical composition of the refined starting clays and their corresponding pillared materials was measured by x ray fluorescence xrf in a bruker s8 tiger equipment of 4 kw dispersive wavelength with a rh anode as the source of x rays and scintillation heavy

mol dm3 of ammonium acetate solution followed by repeated washing drying and micro kjeldahl analysis by acid base back titration of the nh3 desorbed from the nh4 homoionized materials 21 the textural analyses were conducted from the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms measured at 77 k in a micromeritics 3 flex adsorption analyzer on 150 200 mg samples solids were previously degassed as follows heating at 10 c min from rt to 90 c then kept isothermal for 1 0 h heating at 10 c min up to 300 c and final isothermal plateau throughout 12 h specific surfaces were calculated using the multipoint brunauer emmett teller bet method within the best linear region for each solid according to the keii and rouquerol criteria micropore surfaces were determined using the t plot method harkins jura and de boer 17 finally the ph of the point of zero charge phpzc of the al fe pilctechnical clay catalyst was measured by a batch equilibration technique in accordance with the procedure reported by čerović et al 22 2 3 real surface water samples the sampling sites were classified into two types i urban drinking water treatment plants all provided with conventional filtration coagulation sedimentation and disinfection stages of treatment and ii rural aqueducts r where only primary disinfection is usually performed before right drinking assessed urban plants are located at

requirements of the 360 480 currently inhabited city ipiales dwtp ipiales and túquerres dwtp túquerres plants serve 77 491 and 20 586 inhabited cities respectively aluminum sulfate or aluminum poly chloride are regularly used as coagulant agents sampling points within each urban plant dwtp pasto dwtp ipiales and dwtp túquerres are henceforth displayed as follows fig 1s supplementary dataset 20 1 raw water rw 2 effluent of physicochemical treatment ep and 3 effluent of the chlorination unit ec in the other hand five rural aqueducts r surrounding the municipality of ipiales were also studied

as above mentioned in rural plants just chlorine is sometimes added over completely raw water before consumption however since this process is not carried out systematically only raw water rw was sampled from every one of these rural aqueducts sampling was made through the rainy season according to standard methodology 23 2 4 physicochemical characterization of water samples ph and temperature

constant air bubbling 2 0 dm3 min the amount of the powdered solid clay catalyst particle size diameter 60 mesh was added into the reaction vessel and h2o2 solution 100 cm3 started to be stepwise added in proper concentration to fulfill the intended dose of h2o2 for each experiment under constant flow rate 0 56 cm3 min during 3 h sampling was made throughout 4 h of the test total time of every experiment the extra hour corresponded to 30 min of equilibrium between the solid catalyst and the liquid mixture before the addition of h2o2 and final 30 min after ending hydrogen peroxide addition all catalytic tests either on the synthetic surrogate of nom or the real surface water samples were performed by triplicate several control experiments were performed under following conditions i hydrogen peroxide using 7 0 mg c dm3 of synthetic nom 3 8 mg h2o2 mg doc in absence of catalyst in order to determine the effect of the free peroxide attack on the catalytic responses ii catalyst adsorption using 7 0 mg c dm3 of synthetic nom 3 8 g dm3 of al fe pilctechnical without any addition of h2o2 to establish the effect of the adsorption on the catalytic responses and iii homogeneous fenton employing 7 0 mg c dm3 of synthetic nom 0 3 mg fe2 dm3 added in the form of feso4 7h2o 3 8 mg h2o2 mg doc all tests were carried out at ph 7 00 and t 18 0 c the response parameters and their corresponding average standard deviations are sorted in table 3s supplementary dataset 20 an average standard deviation was calculated for every catalytic response color removal doc mineralization and h2o2 consumed and type of water sample synthetic surrogate of water raw surface water effluent of the physicochemical treatment or effluent of chlorination the selectivity to mineralization σ and the efficiency of h2o2 consumption ε previously defined elsewhere 24 25 were properly adapted in this study for comparison purposes the selectivity towards mineralization eq 3 is here defined by the ratio between the experimental doc consumption eq 1 and the theoretical doc eq 2 since the nom is a complex mixture of different molecular weights and organic functionalities the theoretical doc removal cannot be established from i e the h2o2 consumed by stoichiometric calculations however in order to estimate the selectivity to mineralization σ an ideal peroxide consumption was supposed to take place when the full color removal corresponds to doc mineralized which is expressed as shown in eq 2 1 c o n s u m e d d o c m g d m 3 d o c i d o c f 2 t h e o r e t i c a l c o n s u m e d d o c m g

nom was carried out on the synthetic surrogate of water it was prepared according to the method reported before 17 26 in order to closely resemble the planned doc concentrations required in each test the schematic composition of the synthetic water sample is shown at fig 2s supplementary dataset 20 it was crucial in order to realize if the typical variability in the input doc concentrations would significantly affect the catalytic performance of the system as operated on the field a set of experiments was run seeking to refine the process optimization previously achieved and in detail described in 17 a rotatable and orthogonal 22 factorial design of experiments was used where the cwpo factors were i dose of hydrogen peroxide mg h2o2 mg doc and ii catalyst concentration g dm3 ph temperature and input concentration of dissolved natural organic matter mg c dm3 were all handled as covariates measurable but not controllable in actual drinking water treatment plants the experimental ranges of factors and covariates are shown in table 4s supplementary dataset 20 the experimental ranges of the covariates were set according to their fitting to the statistical probability distribution found over the full collected real data of doc largest extreme value distribution collected samples 59 within the range 0 mg c dm3 28 9 mg c dm3 temperature logistic distribution collected samples 46 within the range 10 3 c 20 0 c average 13 9 c standard deviation 1 80 c and ph logistic distribution collected samples 59 within the range 6 08 8 89 mean 7 24 standard deviation 0 603 in surface water samples from several municipalities of nariño 17 whereas the kolmogorov smirnov test was used to determine the goodness of fit to the distribution of every variable in its interval 27 in the case of temperature since there were two well distinguished studied most populated geographical zones andean and pacific coastal in nariño province the two boundary measured temperatures were considered for the andean zone whereas the pacific zone was fitted to a largest extreme value distribution n 13 within the range 27 2 c 29 2 c the statistical arrange of experiments doe consisted of 16 trials see table 5s supplementary dataset 20 the statistical analysis of the data was made by the response surface methodology rsm using the statgraphics software package centurion xvi version 16 1 03 the multiple response optimization of the experimental factors was performed by raising a desirability function 27 targeting simultaneous maximal possible values for all responses doc mineralization h2o2 consumed and color removal the statistical significance of the variables and covariates was estimated by the p values at 95 confidence afterwards using the realized optimal conditions of reaction on the nom surrogate the cwpo degradation was evaluated in the treatment of the target real surface water samples from the responses of the catalytic experiments a bivariate correlation was raised as an exploratory analysis to find out a possible correlation between the three main measured responses and the input physicochemical properties ph t true color uv254 doc dn suva254 turbidity alkalinity cl po4 3 no3 so4 2 and dissolved iron table 1 first the standard shapiro wilk s w normality test at a significance level α 0 05 was applied to determine whether the data adhered to a normal distribution or not 28 the correlation was assessed using either spearman or pearson correlation coefficients at a significance level α 0 05 finally the adjustment was made by multiple regression analysis the p value 0 05 was used to determine the statistical significance of the input physicochemical properties variables on the measured catalytic responses tests of autocorrelation durbin watson and normality in the residuals shapiro wilk as well of homoscedasticity were verified over the statistical model 2 7 analytical methods the samples taken throughout every catalytic test 25 0 cm3 were immediately micro filtered millipore 0 45 μm to determine absorbance a at 456 nm for calculation of the true color removal absorbance at 254 nm and doc content recording of the doc mineralization specific uv absorbance suva254 was calculated as follows suva254 dm3 mg 1 m 1 a 254 nm doc mg dm3 100 concentration of free h2o2 was determined by the iodometric method linear range 0 0 mg dm3 15 0 mg dm3 29 and expressed as percentage of h2o2 consumed 17 iron leached was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy aas thermo scientific ice 3000 series spectrometer detection limit 0 0043 mg dm3 doc was determined by the method of the non purgeable organic carbon npoc with a shimadzu toc l cph analyzer in the presence of a pt high sensitivity catalyst detection limit 4 0 μg c dm3 dissolved nitrogen dn content was measured by a chemiluminescence detector prior thermal treatment of the sample at 720 c mg n dm3 30 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of the al fe pilc clay catalysts the main structural and textural properties of the catalysts employed in this work are displayed in table 1s supplementary dataset 20 first of all both catalysts showed basal spacings d001 greater than their corresponding starting minerals and within the range of the pillared clays with the mixed al fe system 1 70 1 86 nm 31 32 in the same trend the specific surfaces were also significantly improved as compared with the starting minerals whose increases were mainly represented in creation of new micropores 18 in the other hand in spite of the lower incorporation of aluminum and iron in the al fe pilctechnical catalyst it is noteworthy that quite comparable textural properties were obtained in comparison with the material prepared from analytical grade reagents it probably got favored thanks to the significantly higher compensation of the starting cationic exchange capacity cec obtained in the case of al fe pilctechnical in comparison with al fe pilcanalytical 33 3 2 optimal parameters for the cwpo degradation of a synthetic surrogate of nom 3 2 1 statistical multi response optimization the refinement of our previous statistical optimization 17 reached stressed enhancing of the doc mineralization by both increasing the range of hydrogen peroxide dosing per concentration unit of input doc whereas slightly decreasing the range of catalyst loading based on the trend suggested by the previously found multi response surface the optimal operating parameters obtained for hydrogen peroxide dose h2o2 dose and catalyst concentration al fe pilc were 3 77 mg h2o2 mg doc and 3 81 g dm3 of the al fe pilcanalytical catalyst respectively since different al fe pilcs and even other solid fe immobilized catalysts may yield dissimilar levels of available fe it is useful to express the optimal catalyst loading in our clay catalysts in terms of the concentration of fe active in the catalytic reactor 102 mg fe dm3 for al fe pilcanalytical the multiple response desirability function yielded a maximal value of 0 89 out of 1 00 fig 3s supplementary dataset 20 which shows that individual optimum conditions maximizing every single response properly fitted the overall multiple response in other words these are the levels of factors h2o2 dose and al fe pilc leading to the best combined doc mineralization color removal and maximal efficiency of the h2o2 consumption in the cwpo degradation of nom by al fe pilcs and probably extensible to other similar fe active cwpo catalysts 3 2 2 effect of the covariates ph t and input doc on the catalytic responses in the other hand a careful inspection of the effects exerted by each non controllable variables covariate on the recorded responses was made hence eight replicates of the central points were used to feed a multiple regression analysis where identical levels of both factors remained constant h2o2 2 1 mg h2o2 mg doc and al fe pilc 4 00 g dm3 four of these experiments were made under the same covariate values runs 7 8 14 and 16 table 5s supplementary dataset 20 corresponding to the central points of the distribution given by each covariate in real water samples ph 7 0 nom 0 7 00 mg c dm3 18 0 c whereas the four remaining experiments runs 2 3 10 and 11 table 5s supplementary dataset 20 displayed the upper and lower values of such distributions the catalytic results did not show statistical significance confirming that under the studied range of variable parameters starting nom 0 04 15 0 mg c dm3 temperature 9 20 27 9 c ph 6 2 8 4 the process efficiency was not significantly affected by the covariates corroborating a previous study 17 which represents a great advantage when applying cwpo to assist treatment of real surface water supplies under typical environmental conditions between the tropics over the full year 3 3 catalytic behavior of the al fe pilc catalyst prepared from technical grade reagents the catalytic behavior of both employed catalysts was compared under the found set of optimal conditions of the cwpo reaction over the synthetic surrogate of surface water fig 1 a the color removal was quite similar in the presence of both catalysts 95 whereas the doc mineralization was around 10 higher in the presence of the al fe pilctechnical catalyst both catalysts exhibited pretty high levels of carbon mineralization considering the set of middle ambient conditions of reaction used natural ph and t and input doc within the average measured values in raw water supplies of dwtps and rural plants as it can be seen the role of both the catalyst s adsorption 10 8 and the straight oxidation of the organic substrates by the molecular h2o2 9 8 were negligible and not able to explain the measured levels of doc mineralization besides the mineralization promoted via homogeneous fenton reaction in all experiments always below 0 3 mg dm3 table 2 was negligible 1 95 the color removal was 16 4 disregarding any significant contribution of this side process at circumneutral ph finally under optimal conditions of reaction the efficiency of hydrogen peroxide consumption 80 after 4 h in the presence of the cheaper al fe pilctechnical catalyst was quite similar to that exhibited by the al fe pilcanalytical one fig 1b since the oxidizing agent is the only reagent truly consumed and the solid catalyst is the core driving the process this result may significantly facilitate the cost effective application of this catalytic process assisting urban or rural plants at real scale in the short term 3 4 al fe pilc catalyzed cwpo treatment of real water samples every real surface water was treated in the presence of the al fe pilctechnical clay catalyst under optimal conditions of the cwpo reaction above determined the physicochemical properties of the real surface water samples are displayed in table 1 and those of the cwpo treated water samples in table 2 hereafter such a set of properties will be assessed as a function of i the type of dwtp supplied urban or rural r and ii the type of starting water raw rw effluent of the physicochemical treatment ep or effluent of the chlorination unit ec 3 4 1 effect of ph and temperature of real waters on the performance of the cwpo treatment the real surface water samples displayed ph values between around 6 0 and 8 0 and temperatures in the range 10 0 c 19 0 c table 1 within the experimental ranges yet considered in the statistical optimization of the oxidizing process for each parameter table 4s the cwpo treatment showed acceptable efficiency at every assessed natural ph and temperature table 2 the ph in all of the cases slightly dropped upon treatment probably due to formation of light carboxylic acid by products as already documented for lignin and other phenol like model molecules 34 35 in this regard the doc mineralization of water samples with high initial ph values such as rw r chaguaipe ph0 8 12 doc removal mineralization 74 2 did not get significantly affected by the natural trend of hydrogen peroxide to self decompose into water and oxygen at increasing ph 7 indeed it was observed that at lower input ph values like in the case of rw r lomaz ph0 6 07 the doc mineralization was lower 52 6 then the doc mineralization in real surface waters showed to be more affected by the presence of scavenging species mainly inorganic anions than by the circum neutral ph values featuring this natural streams it strongly connects with the statistical analysis of correlation that ruled out any significant effect of natural ph or temperature of these sources on the cwpo performance within the assessed range t 9 20 27 9 c ph 6 2 8 4 3 4 2 color removal doc mineralization h2o2 consumed and dn removal through the cwpo treatment of real surface waters the color removal fig 4s doc mineralization fig 2 and h2o2 consumed fig 5s supplementary dataset 20 through the catalytic oxidation were analyzed as a function of the type of drinking water treatment plant supplied dwtp vs r and type of starting water rw vs ep vs ec for urban plants the removal of true color from raw waters supplying them were obtained in the range 73 7 91 3 and the doc mineralizations between 51 2 and 77 3 for water samples previously treated by the conventional physicochemical method lower values of color removal in the range of 70 4 85 5 and doc mineralizations between 27 3 and 61 1 were obtained finally treatment on samples previously treated by the disinfection process yielded color removals in the interval 84 0 92 5 and doc mineralizations between 22 6 and 54 8 in the case of rural plants the color removal for raw waters supplying the studied rural plants was in the range 69 4 95 2 and the doc mineralizations between 26 6 and 74 2 these general results are hereafter analyzed in depth as a function of every catalytic recorded response but also taking into account the physicochemical properties featured by each type of real surface water sample a true color removal 456 nm on most of the studied streams a rapid color disappearance was observed through the 30 min of adsorption desorption equilibrium between the dissolved nom and the catalyst surface which represented 50 70 of the total depletion observed at final time of the experiments fig 4s supplementary dataset 20 thus color removal in this case was mainly governed by the early adsorption of chromophores however it is worth noting that no significant effect of adsorption should be expected for the cwpo color removal in continuous regime where the steady state must be obviously fulfilled hence whereas under semi batch regime the h2o2 must gradually displace adsorbed organics from the surface to adsorb onto the fe sites under continuous flow the hydrogen peroxide should maintain the nom adsorption partially restricted and mainly far of the neighbors to the active sites in the case of the urban dwtps figs 4s a d although there was an apparent trend from low to high color removal at final time of reaction rw ep ec it must be stressed that such differences were not statistically significant see table 3s supplementary dataset 20 instead it looked to depend more on both factors the higher initial color content of rw as compared to both ep and ec together with the decreasing hydrophobic nature of the dissolved nom across the advance of the conventional stages of treatment in the urban plants see later suva254 whose adsorption on the catalyst surface seemed to be favored see figs 4s a d at 30 min on the other hand rw r lomaz suva254 17 0 table 1 displayed one of the highest color removal within the water samples from rural plants at final time of reaction fig 4s e therefore high suva254 values seemed to favor the catalytic degradation of the chromophores remaining in the fluid phase after the adsorption on the al fe pilc clay catalysts it is expected that due to the quite variable composition of nom from one source to another its elimination by oxidation as well as adsorption must be different primarily as a function of the specific distribution of polar fractions of nom dissolved in water 36 so it is evident that at final time of reaction there was a strong correlation between input suva254 and the color removal it was confirmed with the statistical analysis of correlation spearman either for urban or rural plants input parameters of po4 3 concentration apparent color suva254 and ph in this order in blue table 3 displayed correlation with the color removal achieved by the cwpo treatment besides whereas suva254 and apparent color displayed a positive correlation in other words higher input values favored the color removal the opposite was found for the concentration of phosphates and the ph this is somehow expectable since phosphates may scavenge oxidizing radicals 7 decreasing the process efficiency whereas it is well known that oxidizing potential of ros typically formed in fenton reactions vanishes at increasing ph values 7 37 on the other hand those parameters that displayed statistical correlation with the catalytic response table 3 were fed into a multiple regression analysis table 6s supplementary dataset 20 besides those ones that could influence the response although did not show statistical significance in the spearman correlation turbidity and so4 2 concentration giving rise to an r2 of 98 8 the estimated coefficients obtained for these parameters were negative 1 48 and 0 52 respectively which means that the higher either turbidity or so4 2 concentration the lower color removal achieved by the cwpo treatment this can be clearly illustrated by the raw water sample rw r yaramal that showed the lowest color removal in this case mostly ascribed to the highest po4 3 concentration 0 170 mg dm3 table 1 within this series of rural samples in the case of the raw waters supplying urban plants rw dwtp pasto 91 3 displayed a color removal significantly higher than rw dwtp ipiales 73 7 it probably occurred because of the higher turbidity and concentration of sulfates in rw dwtp ipiales 6 3 ntu and 40 4 mg so4 2 dm3 in comparison with rw dwtp pasto 3 9 ntu and 3 00 mg so4 2 dm3 likewise rw dwtp túquerres in spite of displaying low turbidity 2 0 ntu showed low color removal that in this case could be attributed to both high concentration of sulfates 17 7 mg dm3 and low suva254 2 0 conversely in the case of the effluents of the physicochemical units although the turbidity was in general lower than in their corresponding rw samples the concentration of sulfates and chlorides increased by the addition of coagulants and the suva254 decreased effects which combined led to lower color removal for ep respect to rw samples therefore only based in the extent of the color removal across the different stages of treatment in the dwtps fig 4s d and the statistical analysis of correlation it is difficult to establish the most appropriate stage for coupling a cwpo unit to assist urban plants as said there was no marked difference in the final values achieved by the oxidizing treatment over each type of input water fig 4s d although rw samples in average displayed higher values of suva254 and lower contents of sulfates favoring the color removal in comparison with ep and ec samples they also exhibited higher concentrations of phosphates ph and turbidity depleting it therefore it is mandatory to assess the performance of the cwpo technology also in terms of doc mineralization and h2o2 consumed b doc mineralization doc mineralization is for sure the most important and desired response that any aop might promote in the purpose of supplementing conventional dwtps the carbon mineralization is the main way by which the later formation of disinfection by products dbps upon chlorination can be prevented or significantly reduced the doc values of the real surface waters were found falling within a broad range 1 52 mg c dm3 13 4 mg c dm3 table 1 the doc mineralization along the earlier 30 min of treatment was always significantly lower than the color removal fig 2 where in the case of the urban plants fig 2a d just approximately 10 20 of the starting doc got retained into the catalyst surface by simple adsorption however it strongly varied for the raw waters supplying rural plants fig 2e primarily related with the content of phosphates and the content of dissolved iron in the second place table 1 apparently both factors strongly favored the adsorption of doc on the al fe pilc catalyst nevertheless the mineralization by the oxidant is better evaluated at reaction times greater than 180 min 210 min of every experiment once the fractions more strongly adsorbed on the external surface of the catalyst got broken which could explain the general trend of rapid rise of the measured mineralization at the final tracked reaction time in urban plants a trend of doc mineralization at final time of reaction opposite to that of color removal was found that is rw 50 77 ep 27 61 ec 23 58 through the conventional stages of treatment corroborated in fig 2d for the average of the 3 studied urban plants this could be related to a higher initial doc content of rw compared to ep and ec except in the case of dwtp ipiales table 2 this means that the mineralization in this catalytic system was favored by the initial concentration of doc in principle it also suggests the mineralization efficiency being favored by the higher suva254 values table 1 in the starting water against the ep and ec samples in other words this mineralization apparently occurred preferentially over the hydrophobic fraction of dissolved nom and more easily over the aromatic content of these organic substrates moreover this behavior should be also partially ascribed to the strong presence of scavenging species inhibiting the aop treatment over either ep or ec samples because of the earlier addition of coagulants in the physicochemical stage of treatment the same trend was observed in the raw waters supplying the rural plants where the doc mineralization was also favored by higher values of both initial doc and suva254 table 1 this also allowed us to infer that the oxidative degradation of these macromolecular contaminants widely present in surface waters catalyzed by al fe pilcs is not mediated by the previous adsorption of the contaminants in the neighborhood of the active sites if it is taken into account that in this type of catalysts these are predominantly stabilized within the microporous region where the nom fractions with the highest molecular weights must be expected to undergo strong steric hindrance a comparison of raw waters against their corresponding effluents of the physicochemical treatment in all the assessed urban plants revealed that almost three fold higher values of doc removal were achieved by the cwpo treatment on the rw samples than the conventional coagulation flocculation process taking place in dwtp pasto and dwtp túquerres in the case of ipiales urban plant this value was still around twice the one accomplished by its physicochemical unit in this regard it has been reported that coagulation treatments baseline coagulation optimized for turbidity removal successfully eliminate over 50 of the nom present in water preferably for nom with suva254 4 while enhanced coagulation coagulation optimized for doc removal reaches values 8 30 above normal coagulation 36 trying to explain why measured doc removals were rather low 23 30 upon the physicochemical treatment currently developed at the studied urban plants several factors must be taken into account on factor can be the high concentration of chlorides and sulfates i e in rw dwtp ipiales that has been found to adversely affect the efficiency of the coagulation process in the doc removal 36 in second place coagulation has been conventionally applied in water treatment to decrease turbidity and color as well as suspended particles and pathogens however it is very important to highlight that the optimum operating conditions promoting either turbidity or color removal by coagulation are not necessarily the same favoring doc removal 36 in this sense from a comparison of the measured both turbidity removal 87 46 and 5 0 and the doc removal 23 0 and 30 in the urban plants of pasto ipiales and túquerres respectively it can be observed that in rw dwtp pasto and rw dwtp ipiales the removal of turbidity was higher than the doc removal while in rw dwtp túquerres the coagulation process should be more rather focused on the doc removal because of the too low values of turbidity in the input water supply in the case of rw dwtp pasto the doc removal by coagulation was favored by the high suva254 value of the input water 4 9 dm3 mg doc m which can be ascribed to the presence of more hydrophobic fractions of nom meanwhile in the hydrophilic fraction the coagulation process needs to be optimized in order to improve the efficiency of doc removal where usually higher doses of coagulant are required along with acidic ph 38 a higher hydrophilic character in rw dwtp túquerres according to its much lower suva254 0 7 dm3 mg doc m as compared with rw dwtp pasto suva254 4 9 dm3 mg doc m and rw dwtp ipiales suva254 3 0 dm3 mg doc m explains the low efficiency in the coagulation process at this urban plant once approached the cwpo over rw and its corresponding comparison with the efficiency of the conventional physicochemical treatment it is noteworthy that in partially treated samples ep or ec the lower performance exhibited by the cwpo treatment in the doc mineralization probably obeyed to higher average contents of chlorides in ep in comparison with their rw counterparts as reported in a previous study 17 the chlorides act as strong trapping agents of radical oxidizing species in example the reaction rate constant between ho and cl is approximately ten to thirty times higher 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 than the one for the reaction of ho with nom 1 4 4 5 108 m 1 s 1 then a clear competition is established between nom and these inorganic anions 17 thus in general for dwtp ipiales lower mineralizations were obtained as compared to samples from dwtp túquerres and dwtp pasto which could be attributed to higher inhibition of the cwpo process by the presence of high concentrations of chlorides 23 7 mg cl dm3 in average therefore in this study the cwpo process on raw water significantly increased the doc removal in comparison with the conventional physicochemical treatment but showed to be strongly affected by concentrations of chlorides exceeding around 10 mg dm3 in this regard post chlorinated samples of course also showed further inhibition mainly because of their contents of chlorides consistently increased in comparison with their rw and ep counterparts moreover the effect exerted by other species and properties featured by every starting water also deserves to be carefully examined the statistical analysis of bivariate correlation table 3 confirmed the significant effect of chlorides depleting the catalytic performance of the cwpo process besides the multiple regression analysis table 7s supplementary dataset 20 displayed that po4 3 suva254 so4 2 alkalinity cl and starting color in this order were the most significant parameters of the real surface water samples affecting the doc mineralization at the final time of reaction as expected chlorides and sulfates showed negative coefficients related to their scavenging effect whereas phosphates alkalinity and starting color displayed positive values favoring this catalytic response moreover it is remarkable that suva254 table 7s supplementary dataset 20 also showed a negative coefficient that is declining the doc mineralization this is opposite to what it was formerly revealed in terms of the color removal in that case favoring decolourization in spite of suva254 has been long recognized favoring conventional coagulation flocculation processes 36 and also indirectly the oxidizing attack by hydroxyl radicals formed in aops 39 our results show that it is not the case as a function of mineralization of the dissolved carbon by the cwpo process activated by al fe pilcs it could be explained because although the early oxidizing attack on the hydrophobic strongly aromatic moieties of nom high suva254 values successfully takes place these transformations do not involve significant mineralization of the dissolved carbon but instead rapid reduction in the aromatic content see the evolution of uv254 and suva254 at urban plants here studied fig 3 meanwhile for lower suva254 values the mineralization into co2 seemed to happen more easily it correlates well with the reaction pathway proposed several decades ago for the fenton oxidation of phenol 40 a common model molecule closely resembling one of the most abundant functional groups in the real dissolved nom in that case the first steps of oxidation occur with transformations into hydroquinone catechol p benzoquinone and o benzoquinone but it is not until the formation of 2 5 dioxo 3 hexenodioc acid and muconic acid when the carbon mineralization actually starts likewise the scavenging effect of chlorides may seriously diminish the doc mineralization even performing over low input suva254 in the case of the rural plants fig 2e unlike what observed in the case of the water samples supplying urban dwtps there was a significant influence of the physicochemical properties of the input waters table 1 on the doc depletion by simple adsorption probably this is why the phosphate content from the multiple regression analysis table 7s supplementary dataset 20 apparently showed to strongly favor the overall doc depletion at final time of reaction even though phosphates are well known scavenging species of oxidizing radicals formed in aops 7 conversely the iron content was not significant at all on any of the measured responses table 3 and then it was not considered in the multiple regression model finally it is very interesting to speculate about the most advantageous stage of treatment at conventional urban plants where the cwpo could be coupled to enhance the overall quality of the produced drinking water first of all it seems clear that based on the results already analyzed in terms of color and doc removal the effluent of chlorination can be ruled out because of the strong scavenging effect undergone by the cwpo or any other aop in the presence of chlorides therefore it is convenient to analyze the average final doc obtained from every stage of treatment at the urban plants and the cwpo experiments over the same water samples table 4 since in average the lower final doc content was achieved over the ep samples 1 08 mg c dm3 slightly below the one obtained over the treated rw ones 1 37 mg c dm3 it suggests ep to be the stage of treatment at urban plants where the cwpo process might perform more advantageous of course it would be preferable if some further data could be analyzed adding the treatments to compare rw cwpo physicochemical treatment vs rw physicochemical treatment cwpo but it should be performed latter at full size real scale or at least pilot scale experiments however in the context of the current work it is still possible to evaluate both scenarios in terms of the efficiency of h2o2 consumption it is quite important assessing the cost effectiveness of the coupling c h2o2 consumption broadly distributed values of utilization of the added hydrogen peroxide were recorded for raw water samples supplying either urban and rural plants 38 9 72 3 fig 5s a e supplementary dataset 20 as well as for the physicochemical effluents 52 0 93 9 whereas narrower values were measured in the post chlorinated streams 52 5 67 6 table 2 accordingly the rw and ep samples were more susceptible against the random utilization of the oxidizing agent by the high variability in the physicochemical properties of the input samples because of the presence of several side reactions consuming peroxide the peroxide consumption has shown to be the cwpo response most highly affected by the physicochemical properties displayed by every real surface water sample since this parameter does not primarily depend on either the initial charge or polarity of the nom content but in a greater extent on the presence of scavenging species in each matrix increasing the consumption of the oxidizing agent without this being necessarily translated in a deeper level of degradation or mineralization of the organic substrates indeed in the case of urban plants all water samples fell in the region of 52 0 71 8 of peroxide consumption with the exception of ep dwtp pasto that exhibited the highest use of h2o2 93 9 however it is worth noting that this sample did not display higher mineralization as compared to its corresponding raw water this confirms that the presence of chlorides in the post physicochemical effluent favors parasitic reactions of peroxide decreasing the overall process efficiency the consumption of hydrogen peroxide was greater for dwtp pasto and dwtp túquerres samples respect to those from dwtp ipiales with the exception of the samples ec dwtp ipiales and ec dwtp túquerres higher doc mineralizations were also recorded for rw dwtp túquerres and rw dwtp pasto 77 3 and 74 9 respectively in comparison to ep dwtp ipiales 52 0 it reveals that the consumed hydrogen peroxide was mostly activated by the solid catalyst in the treatment of dwtp túquerres and dwtp pasto whereas in the case of dwtp ipiales a significant fraction of the added peroxide became wasted by parasitic reactions probably facilitated by their higher turbidity table 1 the treatment of raw waters supplying rural plants revealed a decrease in the consumption of hydrogen peroxide in the following order rw r chaguaipe rw r yaramal rw r charandú rw r lomaz rw r orejuela although this trend approximately follows a decreasing order of the initial doc and therefore of the net amount of peroxide added to each reaction two exceptions are remarkable i rw r yaramal displayed a higher peroxide consumption than rw r charandú although the former one had around half initial doc this may be associated with a very high presence of chlorides in rw r yaramal compared to rw r charandú but as said also because of the strong effect exerted by the content of phosphates table 1 ii rw r orejuela exhibited lower peroxide consumption than rw r lomaz although it had more than double the initial doc of the second one it probably occurred because rw r orejuela displayed around 5 times less alkalinity and 10 times less initial turbidity but also lower content of dissolved fe despite of showing a concentration of chlorides about 6 times greater which suggests that turbidity alkalinity and fe beside to the content of chlorides increase the peroxide consumption in this catalytic system reducing the overall efficiency of the process it has been reported that the fenton removal of contaminants is higher under acidic conditions as more iron dissolves in the ph range 3 0 4 0 10 favoring an homogeneous fenton reaction in parallel with the heterogeneous fenton particularly in the presence of solid catalysts with poor chemical stability it was not the case in the presence of the al fe pilc clay catalyst since the measured iron leaching was always very low table 2 indeed for both urban and rural plants the lower use of peroxide matched with the lower ph values in the input streams which could be explained by the fact that at higher ph levels the decomposition of h2o2 in water and oxygen was favored besides it also suggests that no significant change was observed in the fenton activation of hydrogen peroxide as a function of the ph of the water sample again it probably obeyed to the role played by ros other than hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals taking place in the presence of dissolved nom it has been recently reported 41 42 that the dissolved nom may exert a photosensitizer effect in the presence of visible light although the catalytic experiments here displayed were not performed under any irradiation other than the natural light of the lab it is not possible to disregard that such a photocatalytic contribution took place in our experiments therefore probably the turbidity in raw waters depleted the cwpo performance in our experiments by reducing the interaction of the natural with the dissolved nom the multiple regression analysis revealed that all po4 3 ph and cl in this order were significant explaining the h2o2 consumed in our experiments table 8s supplementary dataset 20 whereas there was not a significant contribution of the suva254 over this response as said the consumption of h2o2 is the major contributor to the operating cost of the cwpo process hence the unconverted h2o2 a priori cannot be easily recovered in this application and should be destroyed before the effluent being fed into a drinking water distribution tank 43 thus the efficiency ε of h2o2 consumption is an important parameter to be considered in the potential application of the cwpo process in a real scale system fig 4 displays ε obtained in the treatment of the synthetic nom surrogates and the three types of real water samples collected at urban plants rw ep and ec the synthetic surrogate samples were used through the statistical optimization of the process the samples marked within a red dotted circle correspond to the optimal conditions of the first 0 002 mg h2o2 mg doc mg fe elsewhere recently reported 17 and the second 0 037 mg h2o2 mg doc mg fe here displayed series of optimal conditions of reaction for the cwpo al fe pilc catalytic system as it can be seen although the second optimization described in the current study partially sacrificed the efficiency of the h2o2 consumption ɛ dropped from 0 638 to 0 437 both delivered quite similar selectivity to doc mineralization over the same synthetic surrogate of nom whereas the maximal achieved mineralization was enhanced from 75 to 89 by using both a peroxide dose of 3 77 mg h2o2 mg doc and a catalyst load of 3 81 g al fe pilc dm3 as shown in fig 4 both conditions can be combined for practical purposes in an optimal dose of added peroxide per unit mass of doc and unit mass of active sites in the solid catalyst 0 037 mg h2o2 mg doc mg fe besides it allows to establish the most cost effective alternative for the application of the cwpo complementing conventional drinking water treatment plants dwtps the value here achieved for ε under optimal conditions of reaction in the degradation of the synthetic surrogate of nom ε 0 437 is more than three fold enhanced in comparison with the efficiency reported in other recent studies fig 4 whereas the selectivity of doc mineralization σ remained close to 90 for instance inchaurrondo et al 25 found a maximal ε 0 107 with σ 90 employing 25 g dm3 of catalyst load 1 3 times the stoichiometric ratio of h2o2 6 578 mg dm3 under 70 c in the cwpo degradation of 1 g dm3 of phenol meanwhile zazo et al 2011 24 found ε 0 043 0 124 at different temperatures 25 130 c using the stoichiometric dose of h2o2 500 mg dm3 and 10 mg dm3 fe2 studying the intensification of the classical fenton process in the phenol degradation moreover a challenging issue is the jump from the treatment of a spiked synthetic surrogate to real water samples which is the main focus of this study it is somehow expectable a compulsory decrease in ε both the efficiency of the h2o2 consumption and the selectivity to doc mineralization followed the similar trends rw ep ec and rw ep ec respectively although similar ε values were found for ec and ep the hydrogen peroxide consumption was not related with the doc mineralization since σ was clearly lower for ec thus taking into account the more efficient consumption of h2o2 the most suitable point to apply the technology seems to be the raw waters rw cwpo physicochemical treatment however it must be carefully handled because the higher the input doc content the greater the amount of h2o2 added per unit volume of treated water which is the case for the rw samples moreover probably it could be not necessarily too expensive considering the typical doc contents in typical surface waters employed as supplies often below 10 mg dm3 and hardly ever exceeding 15 mg dm3 conversely the application of the oxidizing technology over the physicochemical effluent rw physicochemical treatment cwpo might be also feasible although implying lower efficiency of the h2o2 consumption besides it must be considered the coagulant in average being better used treating the raw water supply than the effluent of the cwpo treatment getting lower remaining doc table 4 which in turn minimizes the latter formation of disinfection by products d nitrogen removal real surface water samples collected either from urban or rural plants showed dissolved nitrogen dn values between 0 16 and 0 81 mg n dm3 table 1 on the samples from dwtps the dn degradation followed the trend rw ep ec through the conventional stages of treatment although at final time of the experiments fig 6s supplementary dataset 20 the average of the rural plants samples almost matched the nitrogen removal of raw waters supplying urban plants at earlier times of the cwpo reaction there was an important influence of the aromatic content apparently promoting the removal of nitrogen table 1 it is remarkable that the significantly higher contents of all chlorides phosphates nitrates and total iron in rural plants in this case did not show to affect the cwpo mineralization of the dn it has been reported 44 that several organic compounds such as proteins amino sugars porphyrins nucleic acids and alkaloids from vascular plants microbial and algae sources as well as agrochemicals e g fertilizers contain nitrogen contributing to the nitrogen in natural organic matter heterocyclic aromatic compounds including pyrroles pyridines pyrazines indoles and carbazoles use to be in greater abundance in nom s transphilic and colloidal fractions therefore it is very likely that part of the degraded aromatic content was related with nitrogen containing compounds nevertheless the maximal achieved mineralization of nitrogen was in comparison significantly lower than that observed for the doc removal in the same samples see at figs 6s and 2 in spite of the high efficiency of the cwpo reaction catalyzed by al fe pilcs recently reported removing 78 of the dn content from a solution of methyl orange 5 0 g al fe pilc dm3 50 of the stoichiometric dose of h2o2 30 including cleavage of nn in the azo dye and its derived aromatic amines the rate of degradation seems to be very different from that of the carbon content and strongly depends on the degree of oxidation of this element contained in every targeted pollutant thus in terms of the nitrogen removal the couplings rw cwpo rural plants and either rw cwpo or ep cwpo urban plants are all suitable options to be considered in the implementation of a cwpo unit complementing currently operating conventional dwtps 3 4 3 iron leaching the concentration of leached iron in the real water samples was quite low 0 1 0 25 mg dm3 indicating the high stability of the al fe pilc clay catalyst in good correlation with previous studies 17 where concentrations between 0 1 0 3 mg dm3 of iron were found an interesting variant of the cwpo process reported in recent years has been the use of natural minerals with high iron content for water treatment in one particular case the mineralization took place in an homogeneous fenton in parallel to the heterogeneous fenton process due to the significant dissolution of iron from the mineral favored at acidic ph 45 which works very well for wastewater treatment nevertheless since in water for human consumption iron concentrations are restricted to specific limits let s say around 0 3 mg dm3 the control of the iron leaching is mandatory for this application 3 4 4 evolution of suva254 upon the cwpo treatment of real surface water the suva254 correlates the uv254 and doc contents that in our context mainly estimate the susceptibility of nom to be degraded by the conventional physicochemical or the cwpo treatments a comparison between uv254 doc and suva254 for either the cwpo treated or untreated samples from urban rw ep and ec and rural plants are shown in the fig 3 first of all a decreasing doc removal upon the cwpo treatment of samples from dwtps going in the direction rw ep ec was observed it can be ascribed to lower contribution of the hydrophobic fraction of nom to the full doc content in the same trend along the conventional treatment as shown by the decreasing suva254 values although no limit values have been defined it is widely claimed that suva254 4 0 indicates mainly hydrophobic and especially aromatic compounds whereas suva254 3 0 can be used to indicate predominantly hydrophilic character 46 47 besides in most of the cases either at urban or rural plants the uv254 removal was greater than that of dissolved organic carbon showing a high specificity of the oxidizing process first converting the aromatic content without significant carbon mineralization hence as a general trend it appears that such a content was removed more effectively than other nom fractions at earlier times of reaction where probably a decline of the π electron systems took place alongside decreasing the number of aromatic rings or conjugated bonds in chain structures or the conversion of linear ring systems to non linear ones 47 nevertheless water samples from túquerres dwtp túquerres showed a quite different behavior where the doc content was removed in higher proportion with respect to the uv254 probably because in this case the starting nom showed to be most likely hydrophilic suva254 2 0 46 on the other hand suva254 in average showed lower or at least comparable values after the cwpo treatment irrespective of the type of water raw or partially treated the same trend was verified in the treatment of real waters supplying the rural plants fig 3d however the cwpo process demonstrated to be particularly efficient at urban plants depleting the aromatic content in raw surface waters exhibiting starting suva254 exceeding a certain limit around 2 0 in the case of rural plants the oxidizing process showed to be useful decreasing the aromatic content in terms of both the uv254 absorbance and the suva254 values conversely water samples collected in the urban dwtp of túquerres displayed starting suva254 values below 2 0 which always increased after the cwpo reaction although the cwpo treatment fig 3a and b on water samples rw dwtp pasto and rw dwtp ipiales decreased suva254 the physicochemical treatment of the dwtps in both cases was quite efficient and achieved to remove greater percentage of the hydrophobic content meanwhile the suva254 changed less after the oxidizing treatment applied over both the ep and ec effluents on the other hand the samples from túquerres urban plant displayed lower starting suva254 values table 1 typical of nom fractions with higher aliphatic character also more difficult to be degraded the physicochemical treatment of this type of influent streams usually needs greater doses of coagulants 39 in this case the amount of dissolved organic carbon was preferentially removed over the uv254 content fig 3c so that the aromatic residue got concentrated on a smaller fraction of dissolved organic carbon it might seem at first sight that samples of dwtp túquerres displayed better quality by comparison with the others studied samples due to lower concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and turbidity however the presence of aromatic compounds of low molecular weight and difficult to degrade may require greater care in the context of the potential of formation of dbps upon chlorination in summary there were collected two types of rw samples at the urban dwtps studied i suva254 3 0 dwtp pasto and dwtp ipiales where the physicochemical treatment by conventional means is suitable and ii suva254 2 0 dwtp túquerres in the first case most of the starting hydrophobic material could be removed by typical coagulation flocculation suggesting the physicochemical treatment before the aop to be more cost effective likewise in the second case the cwpo treatment of the raw water might allow the removal of more hydrophilic nom just the moiety where the physicochemical treatment is not that efficient while the cwpo effluent might be more susceptible for successful treatment by coagulation flocculation since the suva254 for instance of the rw dwtp túquerres treated by cwpo increased from 0 7 to 2 4 3 5 proposed mechanism for the al fe pilc catalyzed cwpo degradation of dissolved nom a plausible mechanism for the nom degradation by the al fe pilc catalyzed cwpo is displayed in fig 5 although the adsorption played a significant role in the measured color removal fig 4s supplementary dataset 20 it was not fundamental in the subsequent mineralization of the doc content fig 2 the strong adsorption of the nom s chromophores during the first 30 min of the catalytic essays partially blocked the proper diffusion of the oxidant towards the metal active sites which would explain the poor mineralization rates measured at early times of the cwpo reaction followed by the rapid rise once exceeded around 2 h of the oxidizing reaction fig 2 moreover the blocking of active sites was just partial probably since the most active sites in the al fe pilcs are mainly located in the microporous zone of the catalyst where the higher molecular weights of nom could not access it is opposite to what it was recently reported by maqbool et al 49 over n doped reduced graphene oxide activated persulfate where the nom removal occurred in the sequence adsorption oxidation and the adsorption was claimed to be a fundamental step thus the al fe pilc activated cwpo degradation of dissolved nom could be explained in terms of two kinds of possible interactions between the catalyst and the complex organic substrates i van der waals and ii mostly electrostatic in this regard nom is a poly electrolytic organic mixture with quite flexible distribution of molecular weights and sizes it has been reported that ph values over 5 0 promote the formation of molecular building blocks through self assembled structures due to the presence of van der waals intermolecular forces capable of stabilizing the aggregates 48 lambert 50 recently reported the presence of hydrophobic interactions favored by the highly complex nom structure whose aromatic content tends to remain together and segregated from the aqueous solution therefore since the dissolved nom features a well known amphiphilic nature 48 either isolated hydrophobic domains or polar subunits may be in contact with the catalyst depending on both the polar character and the charge density of the catalyst s surface in the case of clay derived materials including the pillared clays the siloxanes in the basal planes or the lamellar edges are known to be hydrophobic adequate surfaces for nom aromatic centers in this regard the measured pzc of the al fe pilctechnical clay catalyst was found at ph 4 52 fig 7s supplementary dataset 20 thus at lower ph values the charge of the catalyst s surface is expected to be predominantly positive and negative when they are above the phpzc then since the ph values of all the real waters were between 6 07 8 12 table 1 the catalyst s surface through the cwpo experiments was negatively charged on the other hand nom may encompass important contents of aromatic aliphatic phenolic and quinonic functions the humic substances usually representing approximately 50 of the doc in nom 36 are rich in aromatic carbon phenolic structures and conjugated double bonds 38 given the large number of carboxylic groups they also exhibit it has been reported that most of the nom fractions contain the same types of carboxylic acids in different concentrations and then the ionization of carboxylic and phenolic acid groups must be taken into account tipping et al 51 reported three pka values for fulvic acids 2 4 3 6 and 5 6 whereas gomez et al 52 six pka values for humic acids 2 6 4 3 5 5 6 7 8 0 and 9 6 hence at ph values higher than 9 0 the charge is more likely the result of the phenolic groups whereas between 7 5 and 9 0 all carboxylic acids are expected to be ionized 53 therefore for all waters here studied which are expected to closely represent most of the surface waters supplying dwtps all around the world it is expected all functional groups of fulvic acids and at least 50 of the humic substances to be ionized bearing negative net charges consequently it explains why along the first 30 min of the cwpo experiments over the samples with either the lowest and highest ph values here assessed 6 07 and 8 12 corresponding to rw r lomaz and rw r chaguaipe respectively fig 4s e a significantly higher color removal was measured for the first sample it could be ascribed to both lower solubility of the high molecular weight less negatively charged fractions of nom and stronger interactions between not ionized groups and the catalyst s surface as the ph declined consequently it is not surprising that ph of input waters was found to be a significant parameter over the color removal in the statistical correlation of variables by multiple regression analysis table 6s supplementary dataset 20 notwithstanding the foregoing it is remarkable that no statistical effect was found for the input ph over the final achieved doc mineralization it suggests that at decreasing ph the van der waals interactions between hydrophobic fractions and the catalyst s surface prevailed over the electrostatic ones which in spite of directly influencing the color removal only marginally affected the doc mineralization it can be illustrated by comparison of the cwpo treatment over samples rw dwtp túquerres and rw dwtp pasto although the former one exhibited highly hydrophilic character in contrast with the highly hydrophobic of the second the final doc mineralization was quite similar table 2 accordingly the results here obtained can be gathered into the following plausible mechanism for the nom degradation in real surface waters by the cwpo oxidizing process catalyzed by al fe pilcs the adsorption of the complex organic substrates on the catalyst s surface was favored at lower ph values but mainly driven by hydrophobic interactions at the earlier times of reaction the adsorption of the heavier more hydrophobic fractions of nom the already so called catalyst coating 54 delay the effective interaction between the fe active sites mainly stabilized within the microporous region of this kind of clay catalysts and the hydrogen peroxide nevertheless the doc mineralization did not show to be governed by such previous adsorption suggesting that both hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions either adsorbed or not in advance got successfully attacked by the oxidizing species 4 conclusions an aluminum iron pillared clay al fe pilc catalyst was successfully prepared using technical grade reagents al fe pilctechnical exhibiting quite comparable textural and still better catalytic properties in comparison with the material prepared from analytical grade costly reagents al fe pilcanalytical the cwpo degradation of a synthetic surrogate of nom in the presence of the al fe pilcanalytical catalyst displayed optimal performance using a dose of 3 77 mg h2o2 mg doc and 3 81 g dm3 of the catalyst equivalent to 102 mg active fe dm3 for practical purposes it is proposed the use of the optimal dose of added peroxide per unit mass of both doc and fe active sites in the solid catalyst to be 0 037 mg h2o2 mg doc mg fe high color removal 95 and doc mineralization 89 were achieved in 3 h under pretty mild ambient conditions of reaction whereas neither ph temperature or input doc concentrations showed any significant effect within the assessed ranges typical of surface waters at countries in the tropic the levels of leached fe in all experiments always below 0 3 mg dm3 confirmed the doc mineralization via homogeneous fenton being negligible thanks to the highly stable catalyst under the input circumneutral ph which in turn slightly decreased throughout the catalytic experiments due to formation of light carboxylic acids the catalytic system was thoroughly evaluated in the treatment of real surface waters currently supplying five rural and three urban drinking water treatment plants at different types of water samples raw water effluents of physicochemical or disinfection treatments the depletion in the catalytic performance in comparison with the treatment of a synthetic surrogate of nom was found to follow the physicochemical features of the input streams mostly the presence of scavenging species instead than the variable ambient conditions of ph temperature or input doc the doc mineralization unlike the color removal was not governed by the previous adsorption of these complex substrates on the catalyst s surface because the active sites in this type of modified clays get predominantly stabilized within the microporous region where the heavier nom fractions undergo strong steric hindrance sulfates and chlorides in this order showed detrimental effect on the doc removal because of their scavenging effect whereas alkalinity starting color and phosphates slightly favored this catalytic response apparently by promoting doc adsorption instead than doc mineralization conversely the dissolved iron content in the real water samples was not significant at all on any of the measured responses disregarding significant degradation of nom in this natural streams by homogeneous fenton just through peroxide addition high starting suva254 values did not show to favor the doc mineralization since although the early oxidizing attack on the hydrophobic strongly aromatic moieties successfully took place these transformations did not involve significant loss of dissolved carbon into co2 in good agreement with the reaction pathway already known for the fenton oxidation of phenol a common model molecule closely resembling the predominant functional groups in the real dissolved nom taking into account all i the doc mineralization the most essential response to be maximized in the purpose of enhancing a conventional drinking water treatment system with this advanced oxidation process by strongly preventing the later formation of disinfection by products upon chlorination ii the more cost effective consumption of h2o2 and iii the input suva254 value of the every available input stream it is proposed that the most advantageous coupling of the cwpo treatment to conventional dwtps should be raw water cwpo physicochemical treatment for raw waters featuring input suva254 values 2 0 dm3 mg doc m and raw water physicochemical treatment cwpo for input suva254 values 2 0 dm3 mg doc m it will seriously facilitate stakeholders to realize the best potential implementation of the cwpo process assisting currently operating dwtps to improve the overall quality of the produced drinking water finally it was evidenced that decreasing ph leads the interactions between hydrophobic fractions and the al fe pilc catalyst s surface to prevail over the electrostatic ones which in spite of directly influencing the color removal only marginally affected the doc mineralization thus the doc mineralization in this heterogeneous catalytic system is not governed by the previous adsorption of the complex organic substrates allowing for the hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions either adsorbed or not in advance to get successfully attacked and mineralized by the generated

water including heavy metals further research is ongoing to enhance their removal efficiency for heavy metals previous studies involving the impregnation of metal oxides onto carbon adsorbents have reported an increase in cnf adsorption capacity the incorporated ferric oxide fe2o3 can exist in different polymorphs in this study cnf impregnated with 10 wt fe2o3 nanoparticles was studied for its capacity to remove cadmium ions cd2 from water both raw and fe2o3 modified cnf fe cnf were characterized using several techniques the sem edx and xrf confirmed a successful impregnation of fe2o3 while xrd ftir and tga showed that fe2o3 was incorporated in the form of γ fe2o3 a non toxic and biodegradable polymorph the effect of ph contact time temperature and agitation speed on cd2 ions removal was tested in batch mode adsorption experiments the results revealed that cd2 ions removal efficiency achieved by fe cnf was around 80 within 30 min of treating of 2 0 mg l cd solution at ph 8 adsorbent dosage of 5 g l and agitation speed of 150 rpm the sorption of cd2 ions followed a pseudo second order model and the thermodynamic studies indicated that iron impregnation changed the adsorption mechanism from a primarily endothermic process to a more efficient exothermic physical adsorption mechanism furthermore the potential to regenerate and re use the prepared fe cnf was established in 3 cycles of adsorption desorption experiments the 79 cadmium recovery rate from fe cnf indicated its potential suitability for analytical purposes the study demonstrated the advantage of impregnating cnf with ferric oxide to enhance the removal efficiency of cd2 ions from an aqueous solution keywords carbon nanofibers cadmium adsorption ferric oxide γ fe2o3 1 introduction both organic and inorganic chemical contaminants in water have detrimental health effects on humans and the environment many organic pollutants impact a noxious odor to drinking water rendering the water unappealing to drinkers inorganic contaminants however especially toxic heavy metals are not detectable by odor or taste and therefore constitute a more serious danger to human health persistent exposure to cadmium cd poisoning is notoriously the cause of the itai itai disease osteomalacia 1 long term ingestion via food material acute poisoning or drinking of cd contaminated water can cause renal failure trigger lung cancer and stimulate diarrhea 2 although a substantial amount of human cd ingestion originates from cigarette smoking consumption of food grown with cd containing fertilizers also contributes to cadmium s bioaccumulation in human tissues 3 the widespread use of cd in electroplating painting and battery making factories results in cd pollution of both surface and groundwater sources 4 moreover leaching from landfills and wastes from ore mining contaminate water sources and channels with cd consequently the world health organization who has set a guideline value of 0 003 mg l 1 as the acceptable maximum contaminant level mcl in drinking water 2 in contrast the united states environmental protection agency usepa has set an mcl of 0 005 mg l 1 for drinking water 2 5 the improvement of treatment methods for reducing the cd level in water is crucial to achieving these limits ion exchange chemical precipitation and reverse osmosis are classical methods of removing pollutants from contaminated water resources however recent research efforts have demonstrated adsorption to be a viable cost effective alternative 6 accordingly there has been a rise in the development and assessment of new natural adsorbent materials such as sludge activated carbon 7 9 fly ash waste 10 14 and agricultural waste such as rice husks and peanut hulls 15 17 because some of these materials removal efficiency and adsorption capacity are low research efforts seeking novel promising adsorbents are ongoing particle surface area is one important parameter to consider when selecting a potential adsorbent 18 while large surface areas are desirable their effectiveness are equally important especially for large molecules such as dyes 19 carbon based nanomaterials nms such as carbon nanotubes cnt and carbon nanofibers cnf are notable materials with large surface areas due to their nanoscale size and uniform microporous structure cnf in particular are a group of lightweight carbon nanomaterials with exceptional surface area properties up to 200 m2 g 1 20 nevertheless until recently only a few studies in the literature reported the application of cnf for adsorption and water treatment 21 24 initially cnf was mostly used in electronics capacitors catalysis and in improving the resistivity of rubber 25 26 in a few studies where cnf and cnt were utilized in their as received forms as adsorbents for cd their removal efficiencies were not encouraging for instance al khaldi et al 21 reported cd removal efficiency of only 27 and 34 for unmodified cnt and cnf respectively after two hours of treatment engineering these carbon nms could improve their sorption efficiencies efforts to improve the surface properties of carbon nms to enhance their adsorption capacity through functionalization using acids 20 27 28 alkaline reagents 29 and oxidizing agents such as h2o2 and kmno4 4 have been recently undertaken in these studies surface modifications significantly improved the efficiency of trace metals removal 4 28 30 and sorption of organic contaminants 20 27 29 from water similarly the impregnation of metal oxides onto carbon adsorbents has shown an increase in their adsorption capacity 11 31 34 in particular iron oxide impregnation doubled the adsorptive capacity of carbon nms to remove phenol 33 benzene 35 from aqueous solutions in another study fe impregnated cnts performed better in treating arsenic contaminated drinking water than cnt functionalized with acid cooh 36 the iron oxide impregnation process involves calcination i e heating at a temperature range of 250 500 c removing impurities and activating the nanoparticle surface reaction sites in addition to this the form of impregnated fe2o3 changes during calcination out of the three fe2o3 polymorphs i e alpha beta and gamma fe2o3 γ fe2o3 has the smallest particle size 4 9 nm 37 38 unlike α fe2o3 with size up to 90 nm 39 furthermore the good surface 40 and magnetic properties 41 of γ fe2o3 make it more desirable for adsorptive water treatment purposes than other polymorphs it is also non toxic and biodegradable 42 nevertheless in previous studies researchers did not pay much attention to the type of fe2o3 polymorph impregnated onto the nanoparticles to our knowledge this is the first study that has characterized the fe2o3 polymorph responsible for the enhanced adsorptive capacity of iron impregnated carbon nanofiber this study demonstrates the application of the surface reactivity of fe2o3 impregnated cnf in the sorption of cadmium from contaminated water in the present study cnf was modified by impregnation with ferric oxide fe2o3 to enhance their ability to adsorb cd2 species from contaminated water the effects of various treatment parameters such as ph contaminant concentration contact time adsorbent dose agitation and temperature was investigated furthermore analysis of the adsorption isotherms kinetics and thermodynamics was performed to study the mechanisms of cd2 ions adsorption by both raw and modified cnf finally we report the potential ability of the prepared fe cnf for application in analytical purposes as observed from the adsorption desorption and regeneration studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and adsorbents all chemicals used in the experiments were of analytical grade hplc grade absolute ethanol hno3 69 purity and ferric nitrate nanohydrate purity 98 used as a precursor for ferric oxide were supplied by sigma aldrich usa cadmium standard stock solution at a concentration of 1000 mg l 1 was supplied by ultra scientific usa lower concentrations were prepared from the stock solution via serial dilution deionized water milli q millipore was used throughout the experiments for solution preparation and 2 nitric acid was used for washing glassware the cnf materials were purchased from nanostructured amorphous materials inc usa with a purity of 95 internal diameters of 200 500 nm and lengths of 10 40 μm 2 2 cnf impregnation the cnf was impregnated with fe2o3 at a ratio of 9 1 w w using a modified procedure previously described in the literature 35 in brief ferric oxide impregnated cnf fe cnf was prepared by first dissolving 1 0 g of fe no3 3 9h2o in 300 ml of absolute ethanol and mixing thoroughly until a homogenous solution was formed then 9 0 g of the supplied cnf was introduced into the solution and sonicated at 60 amplitude for 30 min to prevent agglomeration after sonication the mixture was dried in an oven at 75 c for 24 h to completely evaporate the ethanol impregnation was completed with calcination in a muffle furnace at 350 c for 3 5 h 2 3 adsorbent characterization the raw cnf and fe cnf were morphologically and chemically characterized using a jsm 5900lv field emission scanning electron microscope fesem equipped with an energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx detector the elemental composition of the adsorbents was further confirmed using an x ray fluorescence xrf spectrometer jsx 3400rⅱ jeol equipped with a liquid nitrogen si li semiconductor detector the mineralogical features of the materials were assessed using a d 8 advance x ray diffractometer xrd bruker with a cu k radiation source the xrd patterns were recorded over a 2θ diffraction angle range of 10 to 100 additionally a fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer tensor 27 bruker was used to determine whether the impregnation procedure added or modified any surface functional groups similarly since fe impregnation may alter the thermal behavior of materials a thermo gravimetric analysis tga was conducted using a thermal analyzer the modified analysis method involved the use of air and an initial temperature ramp at 10 c min 1 from room temperature to 100 c where the sample was allowed to equilibrate before continuing to 900 c 2 4 batch adsorption experiments adsorption experiments were conducted on a batch scale to investigate the effects of various parameters such as solution ph contact time initial cd concentration adsorbent dose temperature and agitation speed on the removal efficiencies of raw and fe cnf during the adsorption studies all factors were fixed except the parameter being investigated which was varied as per the layout all experiments were conducted in 50 ml vials on orbital shakers and at room temperature except for the experiments designed for thermodynamic studies the ph of the cadmium solution was adjusted between 3 9 using 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hno3 the adsorbent dose was varied between 0 5 10 g l 1 whereas the initial cd concentration was varied in the range of 0 5 10 mg l 1 at equilibrium time the solution was filtered using a 0 2 μm microfilter and the filtrate was analyzed to determine the cd ions concentration using an optima 8300 icp oes spectrophotometer perkinelmer the cd level was measured within 2 h at time intervals of 30 min the cd removal efficiency in percent and adsorption capacity qe in mg g 1 were computed using the common formulae r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c i c e c i 100 and q e c i c e where ci and ce are the initial and equilibrium cd concentrations respectively in mg l 1 and is the adsorbent dose in g l 1 the procedures followed in the impregnation and experimental batch adsorption are summarized in the scheme presented in fig 1 2 4 1 desorption and adsorbent regeneration a new set of sorption experiments were carried out to investigate the recovery of the removed cadmium and recyclability of the prepared fe cnf and precursor cnf in the experiments 5 mg l cd was agitated with 8 g l adsorbent at 150 rpm for 30 min after filtration the cd in the filtrate was measured with icp to obtain the removal efficiency at the first cycle the residue was oven dried and then dissolved in a measured volume of 10 hno3 and shaken vigorously to desorb the cd on the adsorbent into the acid the aqueous solution was also analyzed with icp to determine the recoverable cadmium from the used adsorbents furthermore the adsorbent was then rinsed several times with di water until the wash out water tested neutral to litmus paper the adsorbent was again dried in oven and used for the second cycle of cd adsorption this was repeated in 3 cycles the adsorbents were characterized by sem edx to confirm any change to the adsorbent chemical composition 2 5 equilibrium and kinetics studies 2 5 1 adsorption equilibrium isotherms isotherm studies were conducted under fixed experimental conditions of an adsorbent dose of 10 g l 1 an agitation speed of 150 rpm a contact time of 15 min a solution ph of 8 and room temperature but with varying initial cd concentrations from 0 5 10 mg l 1 the data obtained were fitted to four isotherm models the langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm models these models are mathematical expressions describing the amount of adsorbate taken up by the adsorbent and the equilibrium amount of adsorbate remaining in the solution at a constant temperature fitting experimental equilibrium data to isotherm models are useful both for adsorbent characterization and for designing adsorption processes for practical application the langmuir isotherm assumes that adsorption mainly occurs at monolayer binding sites and that the adsorbents have homogenous surfaces the langmuir equation can be linearized as follows 1 q e 1 k l q m c e 1 q m where qm is the maximum adsorption capacity in mg g 1 and kl is the langmuir constant in l mg 1 related to the energy of adsorption the intercept and slope of a straight line plot of 1 q e against 1 c e can be used to determine qm and kl respectively the constant kl is important for determining the separation factor rl as shown in the following equation r l 1 1 k l c i rl is a dimensionless factor that provides information about whether adsorption is favorable the freundlich adsorption isotherm is the earliest isotherm model unlike the langmuir model it assumes multilayer adsorption on heterogeneous adsorbent surfaces the corresponding linear equation can be expressed as follows ln q e ln k e 1 n ln c e where ke in l g 1 is the freundlich constant which represents the amount of adsorbate taken up by the adsorbent for a unit equilibrium concentration the value of this constant is related to the bonding energy the factor 1 n is referred to as the heterogeneity factor the value of n is indicative of the type of adsorption process that is occurring when adsorption data are fitted to the freundlich isotherm the slope and intercept of the straight line plot of ln qe versus ln c e can be used to calculate the values of ke and n the temkin adsorption isotherm assumes that the heat energy of adsorption is a function of the surface coverage it considers the adsorbent adsorbate interaction by assuming that the binding sites on the adsorbent are uniformly distributed the model equation is linearized as follows q e b l n a b l n c e where a in l mg 1 is the equilibrium binding constant and b a dimensionless constant is related to the temkin constant b in j mol 1 by the equation b r t b where r universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and t in k is the absolute temperature finally the d r isotherm assumes that adsorption involves a weak van der waals force and multilayer and heterogeneous adsorbent surfaces the d r model is particularly important for determining whether an adsorption process is physical or chemical in nature the linearized form of the d r equation is expressed as follows ln q e ln q m β ε 2 where ԑ is the polanyi potential expressed as ε r t l n 1 1 c e β in mol2 j 2 is a constant related to the free energy of adsorption and qm in mg g 1 is the theoretical saturation capacity also known as the d r constant the constant β is useful for determining the energy of adsorption e in kj mol 1 which provides information about the type of adsorption process using the expression e 1 2 β the slope and intercept of a linear curve fit to experimental data plotted as ε 2 against ln qe can be used to estimate β and qm respectively 2 5 2 adsorption kinetics the kinetics of an adsorption system describes the rate at which the adsorbate is taken up by the adsorbent kinetics studies are helpful for understanding and evaluating the mechanism and performance of an adsorption system especially with the selection of the optimal operation conditions or parameters many kinetics models have been proposed 43 45 however the most commonly applicable ones which are considered in this study are the pseudo first order pfo pseudo second order pso and intra particle diffusion ipd models the linearized pfo equation can be written as ln q e q t l n q e k 1 t where qt is the adsorption capacity at time t in min and k1 is the pfo constant in min 1 the slope and intercept of the straight line curve of ln qe qt against t can be used to calculate k1 and the theoretical value of qe the pso equation 43 can be simplified as t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k2 is the pso rate constant in g mg 1 min 1 a straight line plot of t qt against t produces a slope and intercept that can be used to determine the theoretical value of qe and the rate constant k2 the ipd equation proposed by weber and morris 45 can be expressed as q t k d t 1 2 c where kd in mg g 1 min 0 5 is the ipd rate constant and is the slope of a straight line plot of qt against t1 2 the intercept c has a non zero value when other surface phenomena in addition to ipd are contributing to adsorption 2 5 3 thermodynamics thermodynamic studies yield information about the spontaneity of an adsorption system experiments to study the thermodynamics of the system of interest were conducted under optimal conditions except for a varying temperature t from 288 k to 328 k the standard gibbs free energy δg 0 in kj mol 1 was calculated using the following equation δg 0 rt lnk where k is a dimensionless thermodynamic equilibrium constant determined from the expression k c a c e here ca is the concentration in mg l 1 of the adsorbate cadmium in this case adsorbed onto the adsorbent material and ce is the concentration of the adsorbate remaining in the solution at equilibrium the thermodynamic constant is related to the standard entropy change δs0 in j mol 1 and the standard enthalpy change δh in kj mol 1 by the following equation l n k δ s r δ h r t the values of δh and δs can be determined from the slope and intercept of a straight line plot of lnk against 1 t 2 6 statistical analysis the goodness of fit of the models was tested in terms of mean absolute error using the following formula m a e 1 n i 1 n q e e x p q e t h e o i 1 n q e e x p x 100 where q e e x p is the experimental value of qe and qe theo is the theoretical value of qe all data to be analyzed were entered into microsoft excel and the statistical analyses were performed mainly in sigmaplot 11 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of raw and modified cnf the raw cnf and fe cnf were characterized in terms of their morphological properties elemental compositions and functional groups the thermal properties of the adsorbent materials were also assessed to investigate the effect of iron impregnation on the materials thermal behavior 3 1 1 surface morphology and elemental analysis fig 2 a and b show sem images of raw cnf and fe cnf these images reveal that the modification was successful as evident from the iron particles observable on the surfaces of the nanofibers as white spots indicated with red arrows interestingly the surfaces of the modified nanofibers appear less rough compared to those of the raw cnf this could be an effect of ultrasonication which is known to de agglomerate nanoparticles 46 the edx results show that the proportions of fe and o in the fe cnf have doubled and tripled respectively compared with the original amounts in the raw cnf fig 2c and d these proportions correspond to an empirical formula of fe2o3 confirming that the impregnated compound is a ferric oxide it is important to state that the fe found in the raw cnf could have been part of the 5 impurity stated on the label of the supplied cnf since xrf cannot detect carbon the elemental composition of the 5 impurities is better studied with xrf spectroscopy as shown in fig 3 the other elements present in the impurities together with fe are phosphorus p sulfur s calcium ca and trace amount of copper cu moreover the xrf analysis of the elemental compositions of the raw and modified cnf also shows an increase in iron content in the fe cnf however the content of some other elements such as p and s is reduced as shown in fig 3 these observations indicate that the modification procedure which includes oven drying and calcination through which elements like sulfur could sublime result in only a small change in the elemental composition of the cnf material 3 1 2 functional group characterization and phase analysis the impregnation procedure involved ethanol and thermal treatments drying and calcination which could influence the presence and types of functional groups on the carbon nanofibers we therefore carried out ftir analysis to study any change in the functional groups in general as shown in fig 4 both the raw and modified cnf have similar functional groups however the cooh stretching signal at approximately 3300 3700 cm 1 is broader in the fe cnf furthermore there is a somewhat pronounced difference in the rcoo peaks at 1406 cm 1 exposure of cnf to ethanol used to dissolved iron nitrate not only adds more oh to the surface of the fe cnf but probably also accounts for the conversion of some of the co to rcoo thus raw cnf has a sharper co peak near 1632 cm 1 these confer more exchangeable protons on fe cnf surfaces these exchangeable protons could participate in the trace metal adsorption in terms of the mineralogical xrd analysis fig 5 shows that both the modified and raw cnf exhibit peak patterns matching that of standard carbon materials containing fe2o3 minerals the intensity of the peak corresponding to bixbyite a fe2o3 mineral is higher in the raw cnf whereas the peak corresponding to maghemite is sharper in the fe cnf these observations indicate that although both remain mainly carbon materials the iron mineral present in the raw cnf is retained in the fe cnf and the newly added ferric oxide is present mainly as maghemite minerals furthermore the roughness in xrd patterns of both materials indicates that they are principally amorphous with few nanocrystalline particles amorphous materials are usually good adsorbents 47 3 1 3 thermogravimetric tga characterization fig 6 a shows the tga curves of the raw and fe cnf the modified cnf showed a more rapid weight loss this could be because it contains a higher proportion of fe2o3 which enhances the thermal conductivity of the material 35 making it decompose faster at high temperatures the derivative thermogravimetric dtg curves in fig 6b clarify that decomposition occurred at approximately 540 c and 600 c for the fe cnf and raw cnf respectively when a sample containing fe2o3 is thermally treated to temperatures of approximately 500 c 600 c two major forms of fe2o3 particles appear due to fe2o3 polymorphism 48 of these two forms γ fe2o3 principally maghemite nanoparticles are seen only at approximately 530 c whereas β fe2o3 mainly bixbyite appears at approximately 590 c 48 correspondingly we note that the fe in the raw cnf as shown earlier in the xrf and edx results is present mainly as β fe2o3 as corroborated by the xrd results whereas fe2o3 was impregnated onto the fe cnf predominantly as γ fe2o3 polymorph this polymorph has desirable properties such as small size good surface properties and non toxicity 41 42 making it suitable for water treatment 3 2 effects of treatment conditions on the removal of cd by fe cnf 3 2 1 effect of ph adsorption is essentially a mass transfer process that involves the migration of adsorbate ions from an aqueous solution to the surface of adsorbent material the net ionic migration is a function of the surface charge and the solution ph 49 as shown in the previous section ftir results the surfaces of our adsorbents contain negatively charged species as a result of surface oxygen complexes of cooh and phenolic oh which create brønsted type surface acid sites that are ready to accept protons batch adsorption results fig 7 confirm this surface charge theory in general a ph increase resulted in higher cadmium cd2 ions removal efficiency for both the fe cnf and the raw cnf this result is similar to what has been reported previously for cadmium adsorption using activated carbon 50 furthermore the fe cnf performed better than the raw cnf at all ph values however with an increase in solution ph from 8 to 9 the removal efficiency of the fe cnf dropped sharply this behavior is attributed to the transformation of cadmium ions into trihydroxocadmate ions cd oh 3 with increasing solution ph that is an increasing number of hydroxyl ions oh 51 as well as an excess of negative charges available at the adsorbent surfaces leading to the repulsion of the negatively charged cadmium species at the surfaces of the fe cnf the fact that this sharp decline in cadmium removal efficiency at a solution ph of 9 was not observed for the raw cnf suggests that the number of negative charges available on the surface of the raw cnf material is limited and not sufficient to induce significant charge repulsion 3 2 2 effect of contact time determination of the time required to reach the equilibrium adsorption rate is essential in adsorption studies experiments to determine the effect of the contact time were performed at a solution ph of 8 an initial cd concentration of 2 mg l 1 an adsorbent dose of 5 g l 1 and an agitation speed of 150 rpm fig 8 shows that both adsorbents exhibited similar adsorption rate patterns in which adsorption proceeded rapidly for the first 15 min and then stays steady up to 120 min the rapid initial rate was due to the existence of abundant vacant active sites on the adsorbents which swiftly fill up with cd ions 52 53 nevertheless the cadmium adsorption rate of the fe cnf was more than double 47 versus 18 at 15 min that of the raw cnf although some slight fluctuations occurred with increasing contact time and the maximum removal efficiencies 23 3 for the raw cnf and 49 7 for the fe cnf were reached at 90 min the improvement at 90 min was not significant enough to suggest a shift in the equilibrium contact time away from 15 min therefore a contact time of 15 min was adopted for subsequent batch experiments this short treatment time is important because many previous cadmium adsorption studies have proposed longer contact times ranging from 2 h 54 to 3 5 days 50 3 2 3 effect of agitation speed after the optimal solution ph 8 and contact time 15 min were determined the effect of the agitation speed was investigated the results fig 9 indicate that the agitation speed did not have a significant effect on the cadmium removal efficiency of the raw cnf also as shown in fig 10 raw cnf is hydrophobic and separates above the aqueous solution limiting the contact between cd ions and active sites on the raw cnf on the other hand sorption by fecnf is affected by shaking speed fig 9 revealed that increasing the agitation speed from 50 to 150 rpm enhanced the cd removal efficiency from less than 50 to approximately 70 in the case of fe cnf agitation increases the rate of diffusion of cd ions toward the active sites on an adsorbent 28 notably however when the agitation speed increased beyond 150 rpm the removal efficiency was markedly lowered this reduction in efficiency is attributable to the breakdown of the weak bonds holding the cd ions onto the active sites of the adsorbent in addition it could also be related to cd ions being shaken off of or missing the active sites due to the excessive speed of the particles and ions in the solution especially if physisorption is the predominant contributor to the adsorption process 3 3 equilibrium and kinetics studies 3 3 1 adsorption isotherms the parameters of isotherm models provide information about an adsorption system that enhances the understanding of the adsorption process table 1 presents the model parameters obtained by fitting the equilibrium adsorption data recorded in this study to four isotherm models the mean absolute errors mae in between the experimental and theoretical modeled data are also shown for each model the experimental results for both adsorbents fit the langmuir model well with correlation coefficients r2 of 0 984 and 0 965 for the raw cnf and fe cnf respectively however the relatively large mae value of 15 5 for the fe cnf versus only 2 87 for the raw cnf suggests poor model fitting this result indicates that the adsorption of cd ions by fe cnf is not dominated by monolayer adsorption or homogenous surface action the rl values calculated from the langmuir constant kl are greater than 0 but less than 1 implying favorable adsorption furthermore although the fe cnf adsorption data fit the freundlich model very well r2 0 985 the raw cnf data are poorly fitted by this model r2 0 808 this finding confirms the heterogeneity of the fe cnf surfaces permitting multilayer adsorption the phenomenon shown in fig 10 also supports this conclusion both adsorbents show an acceptable fit to the temkin model importantly it is observed that the surface coverage of the fe cnf is double that of the raw cnf as suggested by the values of the temkin constant b 88 17 kj mol 1 versus 45 63 kj mol 1 shown in table 1 the values of this constant also indicate the predominance of van der waals forces in governing the adsorptive binding of cd ions to the fe cnf surfaces it is known that binding energy in the range of 1 0 ev suggests physisorption whereas binding energy of 1 0 ev suggests chemisorption 55 56 therefore although adsorption occurs principally through physisorption for both materials there is some likelihood of associative or weak chemisorption in the adsorption of cd ions by raw cnf the energies of adsorption e estimated from the d r isotherm model are reported in table 1 as 3 53 kj mol 1 for the fe cnf and 5 00 kj mol 1 for the raw cnf zheng et al 57 categorized energies of adsorption in the ranges of 1 8 kj mol 1 and 8 16 kj mol 1 as corresponding to essentially physical sorption and essentially chemical sorption respectively for both materials the energies of adsorption for cd ions fall within the physisorption range further suggesting that the adsorption mechanisms of these materials are mainly physical in nature 3 3 2 adsorption thermodynamics thermodynamic studies are important for determining the spontaneity of adsorption processes from table 2 we can see that although the adsorption of cadmium by both the raw and modified cnf is spontaneous δg0 is negative for both materials at all temperatures the adsorption processes occur through two contrasting routes while the adsorption of cd ions by the raw cnf is endothermic δh is positive the adsorption mechanism of the fe cnf is exothermic δh is negative the positive entropy change δs0 of the raw cnf indicates increasing randomness at the solid solution interphase conversely the negative δs0 of fe cnf implies a decrease in the number of degrees of freedom of the adsorbed cd ions on the adsorbent surface 58 this feature explains the capacity of the modified adsorbent to take up and retain more ions finally the magnitude of the change in the gibbs free energy δg is useful for categorizing adsorption as either a physical or a chemical process in general physisorption has a δg value in the range of 20 to 0 kj mol 1 and the δg values for chemisorption lie between 80 and 400 kj mol 1 58 59 in this study the magnitudes of δg under all conditions fall within the range of values corresponding to physisorption this finding is consistent with the previous observations discussed with respect to the temkin and d r isotherms 3 3 3 adsorption kinetics the experimental data obtained from the investigation of the contact time effect were fitted to three kinetic models pfo kinetics pso kinetics and ipd kinetics the correlation coefficients r2 model constants and mae values for these models are listed in table 3 the r2 and mae values indicate that the experimental data recorded in this study are a better fit for the pso model 0 98 for raw cnf and 0 99 for fe cnf than for the pfo and ipd models the theoretical qe values estimated from the pso model indicate that the adsorption capacity of the fe cnf is double that of the raw cnf 0 492 versus 0 238 the value is also comparable to the qe values of cd adsorption reported in the literature for carbon nanomaterials see table 4 the fe cnf also show a significantly higher adsorption rate 11 82 s 1 compared with the raw cnf 0 18 s 1 the contribution of the diffusion mechanism to the adsorption process was investigated using the ipd model as mentioned in section 2 5 2 a plot of qt against t1 2 forms a straight line if a diffusion mechanism contributes to the adsorption process the intercept c will be zero if ipd is the only rate determining factor 53 58 in this case the plots form straight lines indicating the presence of diffusion but have non zero intercepts meaning that diffusion is not the sole mechanism controlling the adsorption rate 3 4 desorption and regeneration studies the amount of cadmium recoverable from the adsorbents was investigated in a set of adsorption desorption experiments in the adsorption part 2402 μg l and 348 μg l out of initial 5500 μg l were taken up by fe cnf and raw cnf respectively table 5 after desorption 79 6 and 58 3 of adsorbed cadmium were recovered from used fe cnf and cnf respectively these high recoveries were in line with the physical adsorption mechanisms hypothesized by the isotherm models the recyclability of the adsorbents was investigated in 3 cycles as shown in fig 11 the adsorptive performance of fe cnf increased after every cycle but no clear pattern in the change in the efficiency of raw cnf in cd sorption the surface of the spent fe cnf was studied with sem edx to verify any morphological change and to confirm the presence of adsorbed cadmium the sem image fig 12 shows no noticeable morphological change the elemental composition has however changed slightly to include a trace amount of cd taken up by the adsorbent 4 conclusion carbon nanofibers cnf were successfully impregnated with ferric oxide fe2o3 nanoparticles detailed characterization of the raw and modified materials revealed that modification resulted in the incorporation of fe2o3 onto the cnf as γ fe2o3 polymorph a non toxic and biodegradable form the γ fe2o3 polymorph had a unique property of enhancing the adsorption of metal ions optimum cadmium removal of about 80 was achieved within the first 30 min of treating 2 mg l cd solution at solution ph 8 the adsorbent dosage of 5 g l and agitation speed of 150 rpm the experimental data were fitted to various models of adsorption isotherms kinetics and thermodynamics fe2o3 impregnation enhanced cadmium cd2 ions removal efficiency of cnf by approximately 2 folds and changed the adsorption mechanism from primarily endothermic to a more efficient exothermic physical adsorption mechanism this study demonstrates that careful impregnation of cnf with ferric oxide produces environmentally safe re usable adsorbent and significantly improves the adsorptive performance of cnf which has hitherto been relatively poor declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

13457,carbon nanofibers cnf possess remarkable surface properties and have been used in many applications including water treatment they are used for the removal of many contaminants from polluted water including heavy metals further research is ongoing to enhance their removal efficiency for heavy metals previous studies involving the impregnation of metal oxides onto carbon adsorbents have reported an increase in cnf adsorption capacity the incorporated ferric oxide fe2o3 can exist in different polymorphs in this study cnf impregnated with 10 wt fe2o3 nanoparticles was studied for its capacity to remove cadmium ions cd2 from water both raw and fe2o3 modified cnf fe cnf were characterized using several techniques the sem edx and xrf confirmed a successful impregnation of fe2o3 while xrd ftir and tga showed that fe2o3 was incorporated in the form of γ fe2o3 a non toxic and biodegradable polymorph the effect of ph contact time temperature and agitation speed on cd2 ions removal was tested in batch mode adsorption experiments the results revealed that cd2 ions removal efficiency achieved by fe cnf was around 80 within 30 min of treating of 2 0 mg l cd solution at ph 8 adsorbent dosage of 5 g l and agitation speed of 150 rpm the sorption of cd2 ions followed a pseudo second order model and the thermodynamic studies indicated that iron impregnation changed the adsorption mechanism from a primarily endothermic process to a more efficient exothermic physical adsorption mechanism furthermore the potential to regenerate and re use the prepared fe cnf was established in 3 cycles of adsorption desorption experiments the 79 cadmium recovery rate from fe cnf indicated its potential suitability for analytical purposes the study demonstrated the advantage of impregnating cnf with ferric oxide to enhance the removal efficiency of cd2 ions from an aqueous solution keywords carbon nanofibers cadmium adsorption ferric oxide γ fe2o3 1 introduction both organic and inorganic chemical contaminants in water have detrimental health effects on humans and the environment many organic pollutants impact a noxious odor to drinking water rendering the water unappealing to drinkers inorganic contaminants however especially toxic heavy metals are not detectable by odor or taste and therefore constitute a more serious danger to human health persistent exposure to cadmium cd poisoning is notoriously the cause of the itai itai disease osteomalacia 1 long term ingestion via food material acute poisoning or drinking of cd contaminated water can cause renal failure trigger lung cancer and stimulate diarrhea 2 although a substantial amount of human cd ingestion originates from cigarette smoking consumption of food grown with cd containing fertilizers also contributes to cadmium s bioaccumulation in human tissues 3 the widespread use of cd in electroplating painting and battery making factories results in cd pollution of both surface and groundwater sources 4 moreover leaching from landfills and wastes from ore mining contaminate water sources and channels with cd consequently the world health organization who has set a guideline value of 0 003 mg l 1 as the acceptable maximum contaminant level mcl in drinking water 2 in contrast the united states environmental protection agency usepa has set an mcl of 0 005 mg l 1 for drinking water 2 5 the improvement of treatment methods for reducing the cd level in water is crucial to achieving these limits ion exchange chemical precipitation and reverse osmosis are classical methods of removing pollutants from contaminated water resources however recent research efforts have demonstrated adsorption to be a viable cost effective alternative 6 accordingly there has been a rise in the development and assessment of new natural adsorbent materials such as sludge activated carbon 7 9 fly ash waste 10 14 and agricultural waste such as rice husks and peanut hulls 15 17 because some of these materials removal efficiency and adsorption capacity are low research efforts seeking novel promising adsorbents are ongoing particle surface area is one important parameter to consider when selecting a potential adsorbent 18 while large surface areas are desirable their effectiveness are equally important especially for large molecules such as dyes 19 carbon based nanomaterials nms such as carbon nanotubes cnt and carbon nanofibers cnf are notable materials with large surface areas due to their nanoscale size and uniform microporous structure cnf in particular are a group of lightweight carbon nanomaterials with exceptional surface area properties up to 200 m2 g 1 20 nevertheless until recently only a few studies in the literature reported the application of cnf for adsorption and water treatment 21 24 initially cnf was mostly used in electronics capacitors catalysis and in improving the resistivity of rubber 25 26 in a few studies where cnf and cnt were utilized in their as received forms as adsorbents for cd their removal efficiencies were not encouraging for instance al khaldi et al 21 reported cd removal efficiency of only 27 and 34 for unmodified cnt and cnf respectively after two hours of treatment engineering these carbon nms could improve their sorption efficiencies efforts to improve the surface properties of carbon nms to enhance their adsorption capacity through functionalization using acids 20 27 28 alkaline reagents 29 and oxidizing agents such as h2o2 and kmno4 4 have been recently undertaken in these studies surface modifications significantly improved the efficiency of trace metals removal 4 28 30 and sorption of organic contaminants 20 27 29 from water similarly the impregnation of metal oxides onto carbon adsorbents has shown an increase in their adsorption capacity 11 31 34 in particular iron oxide impregnation doubled the adsorptive capacity of carbon nms to remove phenol 33 benzene 35 from aqueous solutions in another study fe impregnated cnts performed better in treating arsenic contaminated drinking water than cnt functionalized with acid cooh 36 the iron oxide impregnation process involves calcination i e heating at a temperature range of 250 500 c removing impurities and activating the nanoparticle surface reaction sites in addition to this the form of impregnated fe2o3 changes during calcination out of the three fe2o3 polymorphs i e alpha beta and gamma fe2o3 γ fe2o3 has the smallest particle size 4 9 nm 37 38 unlike α fe2o3 with size up to 90 nm 39 furthermore the good surface 40 and magnetic properties 41 of γ fe2o3 make it more desirable for adsorptive water treatment purposes than other polymorphs it is also non toxic and biodegradable 42 nevertheless in previous studies researchers did not pay much attention to the type of fe2o3 polymorph impregnated onto the nanoparticles to our knowledge this is the first study that has characterized the fe2o3 polymorph responsible for the enhanced adsorptive capacity of iron impregnated carbon nanofiber this study demonstrates the application of the surface reactivity of fe2o3 impregnated cnf in the sorption of cadmium from contaminated water in the present study cnf was modified by impregnation with ferric oxide fe2o3 to enhance their ability to adsorb cd2 species from contaminated water the effects of various treatment parameters such as ph contaminant concentration contact time adsorbent dose agitation and temperature was investigated furthermore analysis of the adsorption isotherms kinetics and thermodynamics was performed to study the mechanisms of cd2 ions adsorption by both raw and modified cnf finally we report the potential ability of the prepared fe cnf for application in analytical purposes as observed from the adsorption desorption and regeneration studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and adsorbents all chemicals used in the experiments were of analytical grade hplc grade absolute ethanol hno3 69 purity and ferric nitrate nanohydrate purity 98 used as a precursor for ferric oxide were supplied by sigma aldrich usa cadmium standard stock solution at a concentration of 1000 mg l 1 was supplied by ultra scientific usa lower concentrations were prepared from the stock solution via serial dilution deionized water milli q millipore was used throughout the experiments for solution preparation and 2 nitric acid was used for washing glassware the cnf materials were purchased from nanostructured amorphous materials inc usa with a purity of 95 internal diameters of 200 500 nm and lengths of 10 40 μm 2 2 cnf impregnation the cnf was impregnated with fe2o3 at a ratio of 9 1 w w using a modified procedure previously described in the literature 35 in brief ferric oxide impregnated cnf fe cnf was prepared by first dissolving 1 0 g of fe no3 3 9h2o in 300 ml of absolute ethanol and mixing thoroughly until a homogenous solution was formed then 9 0 g of the supplied cnf was introduced into the solution and sonicated at 60 amplitude for 30 min to prevent agglomeration after sonication the mixture was dried in an oven at 75 c for 24 h to completely evaporate the ethanol impregnation was completed with calcination in a muffle furnace at 350 c for 3 5 h 2 3 adsorbent characterization the raw cnf and fe cnf were morphologically and chemically characterized using a jsm 5900lv field emission scanning electron microscope fesem equipped with an energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx detector the elemental composition of the adsorbents was further confirmed using an x ray fluorescence xrf spectrometer jsx 3400rⅱ jeol equipped with a liquid nitrogen si li semiconductor detector the mineralogical features of the materials were assessed using a d 8 advance x ray diffractometer xrd bruker with a cu k radiation source the xrd patterns were recorded over a 2θ diffraction angle range of 10 to 100 additionally a fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer tensor 27 bruker was used to determine whether the impregnation procedure added or modified any surface functional groups similarly since fe impregnation may alter the thermal behavior of materials a thermo gravimetric analysis tga was conducted using a thermal analyzer the modified analysis method involved the use of air and an initial temperature ramp at 10 c min 1 from room temperature to 100 c where the sample was allowed to equilibrate before continuing to 900 c 2 4 batch adsorption experiments adsorption experiments were conducted on a batch scale to investigate the effects of various parameters such as solution ph contact time initial cd concentration adsorbent dose temperature and agitation speed on the removal efficiencies of raw and fe cnf during the adsorption studies all factors were fixed except the parameter being investigated which was varied as per the layout all experiments were conducted in 50 ml vials on orbital shakers and at room temperature except for the experiments designed for thermodynamic studies the ph of the cadmium solution was adjusted between 3 9 using 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hno3 the adsorbent dose was varied between 0 5 10 g l 1 whereas the initial cd concentration was varied in the range of 0 5 10 mg l 1 at equilibrium time the solution was filtered using a 0 2 μm microfilter and the filtrate was analyzed to determine the cd ions concentration using an optima 8300 icp oes spectrophotometer perkinelmer the cd level was measured within 2 h at time intervals of 30 min the cd removal efficiency in percent and adsorption capacity qe in mg g 1 were computed using the common formulae r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c i c e c i 100 and q e c i c e where ci and ce are the initial and equilibrium cd concentrations respectively in mg l 1 and is the adsorbent dose in g l 1 the procedures followed in the impregnation and experimental batch adsorption are summarized in the scheme presented in fig 1 2 4 1 desorption and adsorbent regeneration a new set of sorption experiments were carried out to investigate the recovery of the removed cadmium and recyclability of the prepared fe cnf and precursor cnf in the experiments 5 mg l cd was agitated with 8 g l adsorbent at 150 rpm for 30 min after filtration the cd in the filtrate was measured with icp to obtain the removal efficiency at the first cycle the residue was oven dried and then dissolved in a measured volume of 10 hno3 and shaken vigorously to desorb the cd on the adsorbent into the acid the aqueous solution was also analyzed with icp to determine the recoverable cadmium from the used adsorbents furthermore the adsorbent was then rinsed several times with di water until the wash out water tested neutral to litmus paper the adsorbent was again dried in oven and used for the second cycle of cd adsorption this was repeated in 3 cycles the adsorbents were characterized by sem edx to confirm any change to the adsorbent chemical composition 2 5 equilibrium and kinetics studies 2 5 1 adsorption equilibrium isotherms isotherm studies were conducted under fixed experimental conditions of an adsorbent dose of 10 g l 1 an agitation speed of 150 rpm a contact time of 15 min a solution ph of 8 and room temperature but with varying initial cd concentrations from 0 5 10 mg l 1 the data obtained were fitted to four isotherm models the langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm models these models are mathematical expressions describing the amount of adsorbate taken up by the adsorbent and the equilibrium amount of adsorbate remaining in the solution at a constant temperature fitting experimental equilibrium data to isotherm models are useful both for adsorbent characterization and for designing adsorption processes for practical application the langmuir isotherm assumes that adsorption mainly occurs at monolayer binding sites and that the adsorbents have homogenous surfaces the langmuir equation can be linearized as follows 1 q e 1 k l q m c e 1 q m where qm is the maximum adsorption capacity in mg g 1 and kl is the langmuir constant in l mg 1 related to the energy of adsorption the intercept and slope of a straight line plot of 1 q e against 1 c e can be used to determine qm and kl respectively the constant kl is important for determining the separation factor rl as shown in the following equation r l 1 1 k l c i rl is a dimensionless factor that provides information about whether adsorption is favorable the freundlich adsorption isotherm is the earliest isotherm model unlike the langmuir model it assumes multilayer adsorption on heterogeneous adsorbent surfaces the corresponding linear equation can be expressed as follows ln q e ln k e 1 n ln c e where ke in l g 1 is the freundlich constant which represents the amount of adsorbate taken up by the adsorbent for a unit equilibrium concentration the value of this constant is related to the bonding energy the factor 1 n is referred to as the heterogeneity factor the value of n is indicative of the type of adsorption process that is occurring when adsorption data are fitted to the freundlich isotherm the slope and intercept of the straight line plot of ln qe versus ln c e can be used to calculate the values of ke and n the temkin adsorption isotherm assumes that the heat energy of adsorption is a function of the surface coverage it considers the adsorbent adsorbate interaction by assuming that the binding sites on the adsorbent are uniformly distributed the model equation is linearized as follows q e b l n a b l n c e where a in l mg 1 is the equilibrium binding constant and b a dimensionless constant is related to the temkin constant b in j mol 1 by the equation b r t b where r universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and t in k is the absolute temperature finally the d r isotherm assumes that adsorption involves a weak van der waals force and multilayer and heterogeneous adsorbent surfaces the d r model is particularly important for determining whether an adsorption process is physical or chemical in nature the linearized form of the d r equation is expressed as follows ln q e ln q m β ε 2 where ԑ is the polanyi potential expressed as ε r t l n 1 1 c e β in mol2 j 2 is a constant related to the free energy of adsorption and qm in mg g 1 is the theoretical saturation capacity also known as the d r constant the constant β is useful for determining the energy of adsorption e in kj mol 1 which provides information about the type of adsorption process using the expression e 1 2 β the slope and intercept of a linear curve fit to experimental data plotted as ε 2 against ln qe can be used to estimate β and qm respectively 2 5 2 adsorption kinetics the kinetics of an adsorption system describes the rate at which the adsorbate is taken up by the adsorbent kinetics studies are helpful for understanding and evaluating the mechanism and performance of an adsorption system especially with the selection of the optimal operation conditions or parameters many kinetics models have been proposed 43 45 however the most commonly applicable ones which are considered in this study are the pseudo first order pfo pseudo second order pso and intra particle diffusion ipd models the linearized pfo equation can be written as ln q e q t l n q e k 1 t where qt is the adsorption capacity at time t in min and k1 is the pfo constant in min 1 the slope and intercept of the straight line curve of ln qe qt against t can be used to calculate k1 and the theoretical value of qe the pso equation 43 can be simplified as t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k2 is the pso rate constant in g mg 1 min 1 a straight line plot of t qt against t produces a slope and intercept that can be used to determine the theoretical value of qe and the rate constant k2 the ipd equation proposed by weber and morris 45 can be expressed as q t k d t 1 2 c where kd in mg g 1 min 0 5 is the ipd rate constant and is the slope of a straight line plot of qt against t1 2 the intercept c has a non zero value when other surface phenomena in addition to ipd are contributing to adsorption 2 5 3 thermodynamics thermodynamic studies yield information about the spontaneity of an adsorption system experiments to study the thermodynamics of the system of interest were conducted under optimal conditions except for a varying temperature t from 288 k to 328 k the standard gibbs free energy δg 0 in kj mol 1 was calculated using the following equation δg 0 rt lnk where k is a dimensionless thermodynamic equilibrium constant determined from the expression k c a c e here ca is the concentration in mg l 1 of the adsorbate cadmium in this case adsorbed onto the adsorbent material and ce is the concentration of the adsorbate remaining in the solution at equilibrium the thermodynamic constant is related to the standard entropy change δs0 in j mol 1 and the standard enthalpy change δh in kj mol 1 by the following equation l n k δ s r δ h r t the values of δh and δs can be determined from the slope and intercept of a straight line plot of lnk against 1 t 2 6 statistical analysis the goodness of fit of the models was tested in terms of mean absolute error using the following formula m a e 1 n i 1 n q e e x p q e t h e o i 1 n q e e x p x 100 where q e e x p is the experimental value of qe and qe theo is the theoretical value of qe all data to be analyzed were entered into microsoft excel and the statistical analyses were performed mainly in sigmaplot 11 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of raw and modified cnf the raw cnf and fe cnf were characterized in terms of their morphological properties elemental compositions and functional groups the thermal properties of the adsorbent materials were also assessed to investigate the effect of iron impregnation on the materials thermal behavior 3 1 1 surface morphology and elemental analysis fig 2 a and b show sem images of raw cnf and fe cnf these images reveal that the modification was successful as evident from the iron particles observable on the surfaces of the nanofibers as white spots indicated with red arrows interestingly the surfaces of the modified nanofibers appear less rough compared to those of the raw cnf this could be an effect of ultrasonication which is known to de agglomerate nanoparticles 46 the edx results show that the proportions of fe and o in the fe cnf have doubled and tripled respectively compared with the original amounts in the raw cnf fig 2c and d these proportions correspond to an empirical formula of fe2o3 confirming that the impregnated compound is a ferric oxide it is important to state that the fe found in the raw cnf could have been part of the 5 impurity stated on the label of the supplied cnf since xrf cannot detect carbon the elemental composition of the 5 impurities is better studied with xrf spectroscopy as shown in fig 3 the other elements present in the impurities together with fe are phosphorus p sulfur s calcium ca and trace amount of copper cu moreover the xrf analysis of the elemental compositions of the raw and modified cnf also shows an increase in iron content in the fe cnf however the content of some other elements such as p and s is reduced as shown in fig 3 these observations indicate that the modification procedure which includes oven drying and calcination through which elements like sulfur could sublime result in only a small change in the elemental composition of the cnf material 3 1 2 functional group characterization and phase analysis the impregnation procedure involved ethanol and thermal treatments drying and calcination which could influence the presence and types of functional groups on the carbon nanofibers we therefore carried out ftir analysis to study any change in the functional groups in general as shown in fig 4 both the raw and modified cnf have similar functional groups however the cooh stretching signal at approximately 3300 3700 cm 1 is broader in the fe cnf furthermore there is a somewhat pronounced difference in the rcoo peaks at 1406 cm 1 exposure of cnf to ethanol used to dissolved iron nitrate not only adds more oh to the surface of the fe cnf but probably also accounts for the conversion of some of the co to rcoo thus raw cnf has a sharper co peak near 1632 cm 1 these confer more exchangeable protons on fe cnf surfaces these exchangeable protons could participate in the trace metal adsorption in terms of the mineralogical xrd analysis fig 5 shows that both the modified and raw cnf exhibit peak patterns matching that of standard carbon materials containing fe2o3 minerals the intensity of the peak corresponding to bixbyite a fe2o3 mineral is higher in the raw cnf whereas the peak corresponding to maghemite is sharper in the fe cnf these observations indicate that although both remain mainly carbon materials the iron mineral present in the raw cnf is retained in the fe cnf and the newly added ferric oxide is present mainly as maghemite minerals furthermore the roughness in xrd patterns of both materials indicates that they are principally amorphous with few nanocrystalline particles amorphous materials are usually good adsorbents 47 3 1 3 thermogravimetric tga characterization fig 6 a shows the tga curves of the raw and fe cnf the modified cnf showed a more rapid weight loss this could be because it contains a higher proportion of fe2o3 which enhances the thermal conductivity of the material 35 making it decompose faster at high temperatures the derivative thermogravimetric dtg curves in fig 6b clarify that decomposition occurred at approximately 540 c and 600 c for the fe cnf and raw cnf respectively when a sample containing fe2o3 is thermally treated to temperatures of approximately 500 c 600 c two major forms of fe2o3 particles appear due to fe2o3 polymorphism 48 of these two forms γ fe2o3 principally maghemite nanoparticles are seen only at approximately 530 c whereas β fe2o3 mainly bixbyite appears at approximately 590 c 48 correspondingly we note that the fe in the raw cnf as shown earlier in the xrf and edx results is present mainly as β fe2o3 as corroborated by the xrd results whereas fe2o3 was impregnated onto the fe cnf predominantly as γ fe2o3 polymorph this polymorph has desirable properties such as small size good surface properties and non toxicity 41 42 making it suitable for water treatment 3 2 effects of treatment conditions on the removal of cd by fe cnf 3 2 1 effect of ph adsorption is essentially a mass transfer process that involves the migration of adsorbate ions from an aqueous solution to the surface of adsorbent material the net ionic migration is a function of the surface charge and the solution ph 49 as shown in the previous section ftir results the surfaces of our adsorbents contain negatively charged species as a result of surface oxygen complexes of cooh and phenolic oh which create brønsted type surface acid sites that are ready to accept protons batch adsorption results fig 7 confirm this surface charge theory in general a ph increase resulted in higher cadmium cd2 ions removal efficiency for both the fe cnf and the raw cnf this result is similar to what has been reported previously for cadmium adsorption using activated carbon 50 furthermore the fe cnf performed better than the raw cnf at all ph values however with an increase in solution ph from 8 to 9 the removal efficiency of the fe cnf dropped sharply this behavior is attributed to the transformation of cadmium ions into trihydroxocadmate ions cd oh 3 with increasing solution ph that is an increasing number of hydroxyl ions oh 51 as well as an excess of negative charges available at the adsorbent surfaces leading to the repulsion of the negatively charged cadmium species at the surfaces of the fe cnf the fact that this sharp decline in cadmium removal efficiency at a solution ph of 9 was not observed for the raw cnf suggests that the number of negative charges available on the surface of the raw cnf material is limited and not sufficient to induce significant charge repulsion 3 2 2 effect of contact time determination of the time required to reach the equilibrium adsorption rate is essential in adsorption studies experiments to determine the effect of the contact time were performed at a solution ph of 8 an initial cd concentration of 2 mg l 1 an adsorbent dose of 5 g l 1 and an agitation speed of 150 rpm fig 8 shows that both adsorbents exhibited similar adsorption rate patterns in which adsorption proceeded rapidly for the first 15 min and then stays steady up to 120 min the rapid initial rate was due to the existence of abundant vacant active sites on the adsorbents which swiftly fill up with cd ions 52 53 nevertheless the cadmium adsorption rate of the fe cnf was more than double 47 versus 18 at 15 min that of the raw cnf although some slight fluctuations occurred with increasing contact time and the maximum removal efficiencies 23 3 for the raw cnf and 49 7 for the fe cnf were reached at 90 min the improvement at 90 min was not significant enough to suggest a shift in the equilibrium contact time away from 15 min therefore a contact time of 15 min was adopted for subsequent batch experiments this short treatment time is important because many previous cadmium adsorption studies have proposed longer contact times ranging from 2 h 54 to 3 5 days 50 3 2 3 effect of agitation speed after the optimal solution ph 8 and contact time 15 min were determined the effect of the agitation speed was investigated the results fig 9 indicate that the agitation speed did not have a significant effect on the cadmium removal efficiency of the raw cnf also as shown in fig 10 raw cnf is hydrophobic and separates above the aqueous solution limiting the contact between cd ions and active sites on the raw cnf on the other hand sorption by fecnf is affected by shaking speed fig 9 revealed that increasing the agitation speed from 50 to 150 rpm enhanced the cd removal efficiency from less than 50 to approximately 70 in the case of fe cnf agitation increases the rate of diffusion of cd ions toward the active sites on an adsorbent 28 notably however when the agitation speed increased beyond 150 rpm the removal efficiency was markedly lowered this reduction in efficiency is attributable to the breakdown of the weak bonds holding the cd ions onto the active sites of the adsorbent in addition it could also be related to cd ions being shaken off of or missing the active sites due to the excessive speed of the particles and ions in the solution especially if physisorption is the predominant contributor to the adsorption process 3 3 equilibrium and kinetics studies 3 3 1 adsorption isotherms the parameters of isotherm models provide information about an adsorption system that enhances the understanding of the adsorption process table 1 presents the model parameters obtained by fitting the equilibrium adsorption data recorded in this study to four isotherm models the mean absolute errors mae in between the experimental and theoretical modeled data are also shown for each model the experimental results for both adsorbents fit the langmuir model well with correlation coefficients r2 of 0 984 and 0 965 for the raw cnf and fe cnf respectively however the relatively large mae value of 15 5 for the fe cnf versus only 2 87 for the raw cnf suggests poor model fitting this result indicates that the adsorption of cd ions by fe cnf is not dominated by monolayer adsorption or homogenous surface action the rl values calculated from the langmuir constant kl are greater than 0 but less than 1 implying favorable adsorption furthermore although the fe cnf adsorption data fit the freundlich model very well r2 0 985 the raw cnf data are poorly fitted by this model r2 0 808 this finding confirms the heterogeneity of the fe cnf surfaces permitting multilayer adsorption the phenomenon shown in fig 10 also supports this conclusion both adsorbents show an acceptable fit to the temkin model importantly it is observed that the surface coverage of the fe cnf is double that of the raw cnf as suggested by the values of the temkin constant b 88 17 kj mol 1 versus 45 63 kj mol 1 shown in table 1 the values of this constant also indicate the predominance of van der waals forces in governing the adsorptive binding of cd ions to the fe cnf surfaces it is known that binding energy in the range of 1 0 ev suggests physisorption whereas binding energy of 1 0 ev suggests chemisorption 55 56 therefore although adsorption occurs principally through physisorption for both materials there is some likelihood of associative or weak chemisorption in the adsorption of cd ions by raw cnf the energies of adsorption e estimated from the d r isotherm model are reported in table 1 as 3 53 kj mol 1 for the fe cnf and 5 00 kj mol 1 for the raw cnf zheng et al 57 categorized energies of adsorption in the ranges of 1 8 kj mol 1 and 8 16 kj mol 1 as corresponding to essentially physical sorption and essentially chemical sorption respectively for both materials the energies of adsorption for cd ions fall within the physisorption range further suggesting that the adsorption mechanisms of these materials are mainly physical in nature 3 3 2 adsorption thermodynamics thermodynamic studies are important for determining the spontaneity of adsorption processes from table 2 we can see that although the adsorption of cadmium by both the raw and modified cnf is spontaneous δg0 is negative for both materials at all temperatures the adsorption processes occur through two contrasting routes while the adsorption of cd ions by the raw cnf is endothermic δh is positive the adsorption mechanism of the fe cnf is exothermic δh is negative the positive entropy change δs0 of the raw cnf indicates increasing randomness at the solid solution interphase conversely the negative δs0 of fe cnf implies a decrease in the number of degrees of freedom of the adsorbed cd ions on the adsorbent surface 58 this feature explains the capacity of the modified adsorbent to take up and retain more ions finally the magnitude of the change in the gibbs free energy δg is useful for categorizing adsorption as either a physical or a chemical process in general physisorption has a δg value in the range of 20 to 0 kj mol 1 and the δg values for chemisorption lie between 80 and 400 kj mol 1 58 59 in this study the magnitudes of δg under all conditions fall within the range of values corresponding to physisorption this finding is consistent with the previous observations discussed with respect to the temkin and d r isotherms 3 3 3 adsorption kinetics the experimental data obtained from the investigation of the contact time effect were fitted to three kinetic models pfo kinetics pso kinetics and ipd kinetics the correlation coefficients r2 model constants and mae values for these models are listed in table 3 the r2 and mae values indicate that the experimental data recorded in this study are a better fit for the pso model 0 98 for raw cnf and 0 99 for fe cnf than for the pfo and ipd models the theoretical qe values estimated from the pso model indicate that the adsorption capacity of the fe cnf is double that of the raw cnf 0 492 versus 0 238 the value is also comparable to the qe values of cd adsorption reported in the literature for carbon nanomaterials see table 4 the fe cnf also show a significantly higher adsorption rate 11 82 s 1 compared with the raw cnf 0 18 s 1 the contribution of the diffusion mechanism to the adsorption process was investigated using the ipd model as mentioned in section 2 5 2 a plot of qt against t1 2 forms a straight line if a diffusion mechanism contributes to the adsorption process the intercept c will be zero if ipd is the only rate determining factor 53 58 in this case the plots form straight lines indicating the presence of diffusion but have non zero intercepts meaning that diffusion is not the sole mechanism controlling the adsorption rate 3 4 desorption and regeneration studies the amount of cadmium recoverable from the adsorbents was investigated in a set of adsorption desorption experiments in the adsorption part 2402 μg l and 348 μg l out of initial 5500 μg l were taken up by fe cnf and raw cnf respectively table 5 after desorption 79 6 and 58 3 of adsorbed cadmium were recovered from used fe cnf and cnf respectively these high recoveries were in line with the physical adsorption mechanisms hypothesized by the isotherm models the recyclability of the adsorbents was investigated in 3 cycles as shown in fig 11 the adsorptive performance of fe cnf increased after every cycle but no clear pattern in the change in the efficiency of raw cnf in cd sorption the surface of the spent fe cnf was studied with sem edx to verify any morphological change and to confirm the presence of adsorbed cadmium the sem image fig 12 shows no noticeable morphological change the elemental composition has however changed slightly to include a trace amount of cd taken up by the adsorbent 4 conclusion carbon nanofibers cnf were successfully impregnated with ferric oxide fe2o3 nanoparticles detailed characterization of the raw and modified materials revealed that modification resulted in the incorporation of fe2o3 onto the cnf as γ fe2o3 polymorph a non toxic and biodegradable form the γ fe2o3 polymorph had a unique property of enhancing the adsorption of metal ions optimum cadmium removal of about 80 was achieved within the first 30 min of treating 2 mg l cd solution at solution ph 8 the adsorbent dosage of 5 g l and agitation speed of 150 rpm the experimental data were fitted to various models of adsorption isotherms kinetics and thermodynamics fe2o3 impregnation enhanced cadmium cd2 ions removal efficiency of cnf by approximately 2 folds and changed the adsorption mechanism from primarily endothermic to a more efficient exothermic physical adsorption mechanism this study demonstrates that careful impregnation of cnf with ferric oxide produces environmentally safe re usable adsorbent and significantly improves the adsorptive performance of cnf which has hitherto been relatively poor declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

the direct wastewater discharge into water bodies elevated levels of nitrogen compounds have existed environmentally associated issues such as eutrophication of water bodies rivers and lakes pose an adverse effect on aquatic lives and human related health challenges 3 besides many countries and regions around the world are facing continuously growing pressure on their limited freshwater resources particularly in arid regions such as egypt 4 which faces a new challenge of water scarcity due to the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd so polluted water reuse becomes encouraged whenever it is safe and economically feasible to cover an increase in water demand 5 6 thus continuous and coordinated research focused on the abatement of gross pollution using eco friendly water treatment facilities most especially in developing countries is needed because most developing countries have inadequate sewerage systems and simply use watercourses as open sewers some water bodies such as lakes and rivers have become hotspot pollution areas marriott lake in egypt is considered as one of them 7 which receives a huge amount of municipal wastewater daily the high levels of pollutants delivered to the lake could negatively affect water quality and consequently pose an adverse effect on aquatic life and fish production 8 9 moreover in most developing countries pollution is the most critical public health risk 10 hence it is important to treat influent from water bodies pre treatment techniques by settling ponds integrated with different mechanisms of removal via several treatment processes are considered simple and low cost methods for water and wastewater treatment 2 11 typically settling techniquesare mainly considered as a treatment option for total suspended solids 11 moreover the ability of settling techniques to handle the removal of nitrogenous compound has not been fully explored and enhancing their performance could be a promising strategy due to their relatively low cost and mostly recommended as pre treatment step for advanced techniques besides settling techniques become a common pre treatment system for constructed wetlands aimed at reducing the clogging 4 12 settling techniques depend on many different mechanisms mainly biological mechanisms such as assimilation biodegradation metabolism adsorption flocculation precipitation and ion exchange 13 a condition such as a warm climate could enhance the removal efficiencies of pollutants 14 a higher majority of settling pretreatment systems include simple settling basins 15 factors such as the availability of land appropriate weather and efficiency of removal over time are key preliminary considerations for adopting settling systems for water treatment 2 moreover aeration has become another critical operating parameter for most biological water and wastewater treatment systems where it enhances the dissolved oxygen concentration consequently adding a source of aeration helps provide necessary conditions for nitrogenous compounds removal and microbial communities which may be artificially controlled by employing mechanical aerators 16 however these aerobic conditions are provided by mechanical aeration systems which have high energy consumption could account for about 45 75 of the total operating energy 17 sedimentation basins attached to systems like constructed wetlands could also increase the hydraulic retention time hrt of the system within a modest land surface area available 10 alternatively the presence of gravel media allows a good environment for living microorganisms which should have some advantages such as offering the existence of both aerobic and anaerobic pores inside the matrix to boost de nitrification nitrification and organic compounds removal as well as being a source of carbon to reduce the reliance of de nitrification metabolism 18 in this study pmsts were designed and tested for the treatment of influent water from marriott lake in egypt to identify a novel and simple route of sustainable treatment scenario as a sole treatment or potential pre treatment step for other low cost technologies the specific objectives were to i evaluate to what extent different modified configurations of settling units could aid in the treatment under varying operating conditions aeration regimes seasonal variation and hrt ii to elucidate the effect of modified systems on pollutant removal such as turbidity do bod5 nh4 n no3 n no2 tn tp and microbes finally the collected information will inform the design of an affordable surface flow system that can aid in the treatment of influent water from polluted lakes 2 material and methods 2 1 site location the water used in this study was supplied from marriott lake

oceanography and fisheries alexandria egypt this area experiences a minimum temperature of 16 2 c in winter and a maximum temperature of 33 2 c in summer with a high level of relative humidity these experiments were conducted on site over four seasons starting from april 2017 until march 2018 2 2 pilot scale setup fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of the pilot scale setup and its components as well fig 2 a d presents photos from the experimental site for different elements of the pilot scale setup polymethyl methacrylate basins were used to construct the settling units with dimensions of 1 m2 1 m on each side with a working volume of 1 m3 and placed outdoor each unit represents one operational condition and the units were randomly stationed fig 2a settling units were designed and operated with various operating conditions table 1 shows various operating conditions among different pmsts the treatment units include the control unit without gravel or aeration source while the combination tank unit constituted an influent which was first aerated for two days in presence of gravel then the contents of the upper water level were delivered into another tank provided with gravel and no aeration source called combination tank the air gravel unit has gravel and aerated while no air gravel has gravel only while the air unit has only aeration in absence of gravel the bottom of some tanks according to design requirements were covered with a thin layer 10 cm height of commercial gravel 5 10 mm particle size fig 2b the whole system was provided with a 1 5 hp water pump to fill tanks at the beginning of each run the pump supplies the pmsts with water from the inlet water basin to the el max station fig 2c all the pmsts were equipped with inlet and outlet hydraulic pipe structures influent was through a perforated plastic pipe diffuser placed across the entire width at the upstream side of the unit these diffusers were fastened on the tank in such that they were perfectly horizontal the aerated tanks were supported with a 2 hp air blower maximum air flow rate 210 m3 h and 1 5 kw as shown in fig 2d to deliver air to the aerated units samples were taken from a thin tube inserted into the selected point 70 cm from the top of each unit and withdrawn from a small valve outside the tank fig 2b the experiments were repeated twice per season to study the effect of different environmental conditions on the process the hydraulic retention time for each experiment hrt was 1 9 days table 2 depicts the characteristics of the influent water from the lake during the four seasons 2 3 measurements and methods water samples were collected daily through the duration of the experiment from the sampling valves in each unit all samples were analyzed following

hsd p 0 05 evaluated values for a homogenous variance 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in physicochemical properties the concentrations variations and removal rates of the different pollutants turbidity do bod5 nh4 n no3 n no2 tn and tp were measured at different settling units over hrt 1 9 days under seasonal variations as depicted in figs 2 6 3 1 1 water turbidity the water turbidity parameter in all treatment units showed a declining trend over the different hrts fig 3 there was an observable similarity in the reduction trends in all treatment units by the first day over the different seasons there was an average reduction of turbidity from water initial concentrations of 45 9 9 2 to 12 8 2 1 ntu 72 13 reduction on 8th day in spring from 59 5 3 22 to 12 3 1 2 ntu 79 3 reduction by 9th day in summer from 65 00 3 8 to 12 3 1 1 ntu 81 07 reduction on 9th day in autumn and from 154 00 6 6 to 2 43 0 9 ntu 98 42 reduction on 7th day in winter in winter it was observed that water turbidity decreased gradually with increasing hrt until 5 days after which it increased a little to the end there was no significant difference in water turbidity among the different settling configurations meanwhile hrt and season have a significant effect on the reduction rate as known turbidity is defined as the reduction of clarity in water due to suspended or colloidal particles such as clay silt and other organic matter 24 25 prolonged time for turbid water in settling systems could promote the downward movement of all suspended solids by gravity a process which is driven when the velocity of the water is decreased below the point of the suspended solids 26 this confirms the sharp decline in turbidity in this study after the first day which is due to settling of bigger sized particles while the smaller sized particles could take a time higher than the used hrts to settle down carbone et al 27 reported the same phenomena paired with high turbidity reduction after the provision of adequate time regarding the effect of seasonal variation on water turbidity winter season attained the highest performance efficiency 98 42 removal on hrt 7th day in the no air gravel unit despite having high initial turbidity compared with the other seasons alumukiar et al 10 reported that cold conditions in winter surface ice the lack of aeration negatively affect the biological treatment and sedimentation processes another reason may be observed limitation growth in algal or phytoplankton compared to spring summer and autumn as a result of favorable environmental conditions which could be higher 1 5 times in summer than winter and the total biomass available in most species could also be 4 times higher in warmer than in winter 28 moreover the high turbidity removal of the no air gravels unit compared to the aerated system could be because the aeration creates turbulence in the water which limits the settlement of solids sayara et al 17 reported that aeration could associate with other drawbacks like producing a bulky sludge that makes a poor settling ability this implies that non aerated units performed better than aerated units regarding water turbidity overall aeration on the upper layer of tanks resulted in little variance a study by micek et al 29 achieved a turbidity removal efficiency of 68 3 by settling using household wastewater moreover a turbid effluent level of 4 5 ntu was recorded in south africa at the trichardt wastewater treatment plant by negwamba and dinka 26 additionally since no significant difference was found between the different units these configurations may be appropriate for systems where turbidity is the targeted pollutant to be removed in this study different hrts recorded varying maximum turbidity removal over the different seasonal variation however after two days all systems reported a steady performance based on these findings stable performance was recorded from hrt 2 days to hrt 7 days the final effluent quality after turbidity removal is likely acceptable for fish farming requirements as noted by khan et al 30 3 1 2 do parameter fig 4 depicts do concentration over four seasons with different hrts for different settling configurations do values increased gradually until the middle of the experimental run then decreased towards the end over the different hrts and seasons initial do values were different from one season to another highest in winter followed by summer then spring and least in autumn in spring the highest do concentration reached 7 89 mg l 1 from an initial concentration of 5 35 mg l 1 corresponding to 47 do increase at hrt 3 days in the settling unit air gravels against 5 45 mg l 1 for the control system do concentration decreased at the end of the run for all settling units with an initial do concentration of 5 58 mg l 1 in summer the highest do value of 7 88 mg l 1 was recorded after hrt 6 days at combination tank unit against 6 03 mg l 1 for control in autumn the highest do concentration of 7 52 mg l 1 for air unit which was recorded on the second day while other settling units showed a fluctuation trend during winter all settling units indicated a gradual increase in do over the different hrts and the highest do concentration value achieved was 8 1 mg l 1 for air gravel against 6 33 mg l 1 for control do concentration was influenced by the seasonal variation p 0 05 hrt has a significant effect on the do concentration meanwhile differences between settling units were found significant do standard concentrations achieved in this study over the different hrts could support aquatic life 20 31 32 being do is a key factor in controlling the physicochemical and biological processes the obtained data indicated an enhancement of oxygen level at low hrt for both aerated and non aerated units which reached up to 7 mg l 1 although the aerated units should be higher in do concentration non aerated systems performed better this could be due to the modified aeration regime was only in the surface layer while the sampling point at 70 cm from the top in addition rapid reduction in turbidity could be another possible cause of enhanced do according to omotade 33 moreover the systems which contained gravels had higher do values in comparison with the control system which may be attributed to the activities of microbes as will be discussed in detail in subsequent sections however after the first day there was a remarkable increase in do until the middle of the run the highest do value was recorded in the winter due to the low level of temperature this implies that the seasonal variation influences the pmsts performance although no variance was found in the control unit over different seasons thus this change could be attributed to the influence of gravels 18 while the decreasing trend after that may be due to the other biochemical processes that consume oxygen for their activity also for both spring and autumn the highest do concentration was recorded on the second day the combination tank unit performed better among other systems during all seasons except autumn 3 1 3 bod5 reduction in this study a significant reduction of bod5 was recorded at different settling units as shown in fig 5 bod5 concentration declined dramatically from the beginning to the end during the spring season among different settling units a maximum bod5 reduction of 88 33 was recorded for both no air gravel and air units after 8 days a sharp decrease in bod5 concentration was recorded in summer for all units air unit recorded the highest reduction rate of bod5 79 86 reduction hrt 6 days against 39 57 for control in autumn combination tank unit achieved the best performance of bod5 reduction 66 6 hrt 5 days against an average of 33 3 for other units the highest bod5 reduction in the winter was observed at air unit 60 22 hrt 5 days season and hrt had significant effects on bod5 reduction p 0 05 also significant variances were found between the different settling units the bod5 concentration declined sharply over the hrts and seasons especially in summer and spring as a result of raised do concentrations and the reduction rate was maximum in the spring this could have resulted from the temperature variation among seasons which affects the biodegradation process in different settling units 9 20 a study by bosak et al 34 reported a similar trend where cold conditions in winter negatively affected biological treatment and sedimentation typically bod5 removal efficiency is also influenced by loading rates and hrt and stagnant conditions could decrease the effluent bod5 concentrations 14 another possible mechanism of bod5 reduction is the physical filtration mechanism of the substrate which filters and traps organic solids for a long time thereby enabling biodegradation of organic solids in the filtration bed 35 in this study the no air gravel unit had the best performance for bod5 removal compared to other settling units due to its do performance and presence of gravel micek et al 29 reported a bod5 removal rate of 50 4 from a multiple chamber settling tank as a primary treatment unit connected to a hybrid constructed wetland also the bod5 reduction rate was approximately 22 with anaerobic ponds under similar environmental conditions that were recorded in egypt by ghazy et al 36 the gravel used in this study acted as a substrate which supported the lives of microorganisms and assisted the bod5 removal 18 the maximum bod5 removal recorded in this study 88 3 hrt 8days is in agreement with the findings of omotade et al 37 who used a designed sedimentation tank for treating aquaculture wastewater with a bod5 removal rate of 86 3 1 4 nutrients compounds fig 6a shows the ammonia nh4 n removal rate over the different hrts and seasons there was a remarkable decrease in nh4 n concentrations during summer in all settling units which attained 57 9 99 2 99 24 99 16 and 99 26 percent for control combination tank air gravel no air gravel and air units respectively at 2 days hrt recording the highest removal rate among other seasons in spring there was a gradual increase in removal rates as hrt increases recording the highest removal value on the ninth day while in autumn the highest nh4 n removal was 96 51 on the 9th day of settling which was recorded at the air gravel unit while the control combination tank no air gravel air units achieved removal percentages of 56 27 81 98 84 3 and 94 34 respectively the maximum nh4 n removal efficiency recorded in winter was 88 76 on the 8th day by the air unit overall seasonal variation and hrt had a significant effect on nh4 n removal p 0 05 besides significant differences were obtained between the performance of different settling units towards the removal of nh4 n total nitrogen tn concentrations decreased considerably from the beginning to the end of the run fig 6b in spring different variances recorded between settling units no air gravel system recorded the maximum tn removal efficiency a gradual increase in tn removal with the increase of hrt was observed for the whole system in summer the highest removal value was measured by the end of the experimental run 83 59 for air gravel unit against 32 54 75 23 82 74 and 81 84 for control combination tank no air gravel and air units respectively in autumn and winter similar performance was observed the different settling configurations had better performance than the control system the highest removal value of tn was 68 22 and this occurred after 9 days in autumn and 69 9 after 8 days in winter for combination tank and no air gravel units respectively seasonal variation had a significant effect on tn removal p 0 05 a variance between settling units was found and hrt was significant on tn removal rates nitrite no2 had a different trend as shown in fig 6c where the concentration has changed dramatically recording a significant change for different settling units in spring and summer little change was depicted between settling units over hrts higher efficiency of removal was recorded in autumn where air gravel achieved the highest performance among other settling units in winter a significant increase was observed for air gravel unit over time seasonal variation had a significant effect on no2 removal p 0 05 while no difference occurred between different settling units fig 6d shows the concentration of no3 n over different settling units among the four seasons interestingly it was evident that the no3 n concentrations in the influent increased over different settling units in spring the combination tank unit recorded an increase in nitrate concentration than other settling units on the third day in summer all settling systems had a little increase of no3 n effluent concentrations than influent concentration except for air gravel and no air gravel units the autumn season achieved higher performance than summer in all settling units in winter the air unit had the highest no3 n effluent concentrations among all other units seasonal variation had a significant effect on no3 removal p 0 05 while no difference occurred between settled systems the behavior of inorganic nitrogen was observed seasonally with effluents from pmsts having a higher concentration of nitrogen during colder seasons winter and autumn than warmer seasons summer and spring however the opposite behavior was observed for nitrite and nitrate this finding was observed in previous studies which found a significant effect of seasonal variation on nitrogen components removal from settling units 38 kadlec and wallace 28 also reported that nitrogen removal efficiencies in warm seasons tend to be higher than that in winter the nitrogen compounds in the presented pmsts were likely to be removed by mechanisms such as uptake by living organisms nitrification process denitrification due to anaerobic conditions made available as a result of high depth and ammonia volatilization 16 29 sayara et al 17 reported that a large amount of oxygen is required for nitrogen compounds removal in conventional systems where 4 2 g o2 g nh4 n for ammonium removal and at least 2 mg l of oxygen in a simplified nitrification reaction in addition to a suitable substrate as an external source of carbon for denitrification reactions this implies that air unit has the highest average nh4 n loading removal during the different hrts while no air gravel unit was the highest in tn thus in this study the removal of nh4 n reached 99 9 for no air gravels unit in the summer the higher temperatures i e warmer climate promoted the biological removal processes that function optimally at temperature ranges between 25 and35 c which likely affected positively the performance of the system 28 39 this influence the performance of pmsts over the different seasons although high removal efficiencies of nh4 n in other seasons could be attributed to other factors not only to temperature however the performance drop in summer season on the third day could be due to microbial activities then it returned with increased performance to the end bosak et al 34 stated that changes in tn in an aerated sedimentation basin fed with agricultural wastewater were directly linked to changes in nh4 n concentration indicating that volatilization and nitrification denitrification were primary n removal pathways the continuous provision of appropriate environmental conditions such as ph temperature dissolved oxygen and availability of large surface area for microbial attachment favored effective nitrification in settled units 40 in this study the final concentration of nh4 n decreased to less than 0 1 mg l after the settling process which performed better than the findings reported in the literature also the interesting observation of the increase of no3 concentration could be credited to the conversion of a part of nh4 n to no3 which led to an increase of no3 concentration implying an enhancement of the nitrification process in the system 41 this was realized in autumn and also in agreement with that reported by 31 furthermore the gravel was considered as a good environment for the attachment of biofilm communities of microorganisms which could be the main contributor to tn reduction into the systems 42 tn removal reached 83 59 for air gravel unit in the summer season on 9th day hrt this system showed a better performance for tn removal due to oxygen injection required for the nitrification process however this performance was higher only in summer and no air gravel unit recorded the maximum performance on other seasons the decrease of tn with a slight increase in no3 n could be explained by the denitrification of all available no3 n to n2 gas and this has also been proven by bosak et al 34 moreover the highest performance of pmsts on tn removal was achieved in summer this is in agreement with a previous study by 14 who found that nitrogen removal efficiencies in the warm season are higher compared to winter the control unit showed low performance than other settling units indicating the role of gravel and aeration 43 also reported 44 removal using facultative ponds and 40 removal of tn using stabilization ponds at low temperature 44 3 1 5 total phosphorus removal performance fig 7 shows the removal efficiency of total phosphorus tp over 9 days period by different settling units during the four seasons the concentration of tp decreased gradually from the beginning of the experimental run until the end from 1 488 0 21 to 0 282 0 344 0248 0 142 and 0 157 mg l 1 corresponding to 81 08 76 88 83 36 90 47 and 89 42 of tp reduction for control combination tank air gravel no air gravel and air units respectively on the 9th day in spring the unit no air gravel achieved the best performance among all settling units by recording the highest removal efficiency during all seasons it attained 88 15 tp removal on the 7th day in summer 70 73 tp removal in autumn and 67 74 removal in winter on the 8th day it was observed that in cold seasons autumn and winter the tp removal rate was decreased with the increase in hrt recording overall performance less than warm seasons consequently seasonal variation and hrt have a significant effect on tp p 0 05 among the different settling units generally one of the main mechanisms of phosphorus removal is assimilation into biomass by settling conditions also other numerous mechanisms chemical biological and physical are involved 45 46 in this study no air gravel unit achieved the best performance 90 47 among all pmsts which might be due to the high binding capability of the gravel and or the assimilation potential of the biomass available in the water 47 thus no significant effect of aeration on tp removal against no aeration condition as no air gravel unit came out as the best unit which also supports the assimilation mechanism and adsorption ability of gravel this finding is in sharp contrast with 48 who realized by evaluating the effect of aeration on wetlands that tp removal and do positively correlate with a result of redox manipulation by aeration which facilitates phosphorous removal processes through precipitation and adsorption to the substrate gravel the aeration conditions supplied in our system were quite low compared and not optimal for effective precipitation as reported in the study by 48 authors presume that long hydraulic retention time provided adequate conditions for algae growth and hence adsorption of phosphorus by the algae biomass 45 49 the growth of algae and stagnant conditions of the influent allowed more tp to settle spring and summer had very high influence on tp removal against autumn and winter this variation may be due to temperature difference that influences the microbial distribution and algal growth which as explained in previous studies has a significant impact on settling systems performance concerning tp removal 38 the results here were above the expected ranges reported by the literature where about 46 removal in wastewater was achieved in a treatment facility in brazil where a facultative pond was used 43 and 55 removal by using a stabilization pond technique for purifying urban wastewater in mashhad city iran 44 3 2 microbial removal microbial removal of vibrio sp escherichia coli total bacterial count and anaerobic bacterial communities were measured over the different seasons in pmsts different units were either operated in the presence or absence of aeration plus the control unit as shown in fig 8 a d a slightly close trend of vibrio sp removal was detected in autumn and winter however the highest count was recorded in spring and summer over the different hrts compared with the control tank in summer vibrio sp count had a gradual increase in aerated units than the non aerated units recording 100 removal for the combination tank no air gravel and air gravel and 95 with the air unit as against 75 for control for day 1 hrt this was followed by spring where no vibrio sp was detected in all units after day 1 hrt against 21 1 removal for control then the count increased with hrt increases fig 8a similar results were observed in terms of the effect of seasonal variations for total coliform where complete removal 100 was recorded during autumn and winter while in summer maximum count was detected on 9 days hrt with removal rates of 54 64 5 87 9 72 6 and 64 5 respectively for control combination tank air gravel no air gravel and air units fig 8b in autumn it was evident also evident that the maximum reduction in total coliform was 100 removal which occurred on day 1 hrt furthermore the data on the total bacterial count and anaerobic bacterial community over the different seasons and hrts are shown in fig 8c and d in winter total bacterial count was lower in non aerated units than aerated units recording 97 3 100 96 3 100 and 99 3 respectively for control combination tank air gravel no air gravel and air units but the total count of bacteria was found in a high level at all remaining seasons for all settling units unlike total bacteria anaerobic bacteria trend varied it was observed that the optimum removal occurred in the aerated units rather than the non aerated units however the non aerated units attained a slightly stable increase in anaerobic bacteria over the varying seasons in spring the control unit showed a drastic increase in anaerobic bacterial community a fluctuated trend was recorded toward total count removal while for anaerobic bacterial community a stable trend was recorded for the constructed pmsts in terms of seasonal variations winter and autumn seasons were optimal for the removal of total bacteria and anaerobic bacteria respectively for the different settling tank units fig 9 a d shows that the microbial count in substrates collected from the units that have gravel and in settled particles for those units without gravel overall a close trend was found in spring season for total coliform by all units compared to the control unit while in summer the total coliform was higher in control than that in other units autumn and winter showed the lowest count of total coliform recording 2 cfu ml 1 in no air gravel unit in winter and 3 cfu ml 1 in combination tank unit in autumn a similar trend was found in summer autumn and winter for anaerobic bacterial count of 90 75 and 50 cfu ml 1 respectively for air gravel unit while in spring the anaerobic bacterial count in all pmsts was found higher than the initial count of 50 cfu ml 1 interestingly a higher number of vibrio sp count was present in the control unit than other units over all seasons the combination tank recorded the lowest total count of 50 cfu ml 1 in winter and 60 cfu ml 1 in spring against 150 cfu ml 1 in autumn and 105 cfu ml 1 in summer for no air gravel tank generally it was found that there excited significant differences between pathogenic concentrations in the tanks over different hrts and seasonal variations the most important pathogenic bacteria in the influent to the pmsts are most likely those transmitted by the faecal oral route 50 it was clear in our study that there are excited significant differences between pathogenic concentrations in the units over the different hrts and seasonal variations 51 on exploring the mechanisms of pathogen removal it was reported that to date no conclusive results are available on the effects of seasonal fluctuations on pathogen removal different studies were reported contrasting results on the effect of different seasons on pathogen removal in the present study the main pathogenic bacteria that were determined in treated settlement tanks are vibrio sp escherichia coli total bacterial count and anaerobic bacteria recently 52 isolated hundred and sixty bacterial strains among those e coli was the most common followed by s faecalis k pneumonia e aerogenes s typhi s typhimurium s sonni and y pestis meanwhile our study showed that complete removal of pathogenic microbes in pmsts is highly possible in autumn and winter than in summer and spring it is also worth noting that the pmsts also have the potential to reduce pathogens because of natural die off and hostile environmental conditions 47 a key observation made was that unlike total bacteria anaerobic bacterial had a completely different trend it was observed that the optimum removal occurred in the aerated units rather than the non aerated units this could be linked to the availability of oxygen in the aerated units limited the activities of anaerobic bacteria 53 the result here was above the expected ranges reported in the literature where the reduction percentages of total coliform tc fecal coliform fc e coli were found by 98 8 95 6 and 79 4 respectively at the similar environmental conditions in egypt through stabilization ponds 36 3 3 optimum operational conditions based on the data obtained seven days hrt is the optimum time for the removal of pollutants in most settling units hence it was used for further analysis to evaluate the performance of different pmsts units the average removal percentage of the studied pollutants at different settling units during the four seasons was measured according to fig 10 the efficiency of settling units was almost similar in removing turbidity and nh4 n for other pollutants no air gravel settling unit showed the best performance concerning other units hence the use of no air gravel unit is recommended as the best performed unit with minimal cost due to the absence of aeration the average removal percentage achieved by no air gravel at optimum conditions was as follows turbidity 80 13 bod5 68 22 nh4 n 87 71 tn 61 30 and tp 74 80 however the pollutants loads removal rate through the no air gravel unit in optimum operating conditions was 5 95 0 58 g m ² d 1 for organic pollutants 0 519 0 186 g m ² d 1 for nh4 n while tn load removal rate was 0 834 0 213 g m ² d 1 finally tp load removal was about 0 14 0 027 g m ² d 1 these results could facilitate the comparison between different settling units per day and per unit area and give a direct indication of the removal capacity of the studied system to researchers and engineers 4 conclusions pilot modified setting techniques pmsts was studied as a novel route for treatment of water effluent from marriot lake in egypt the effect of pmsts on physicochemical properties and microbial removal were explored the no air gravel unit performed the best among all pmsts the average removal achieved after 7 days hrt was as follows turbidity 80 13 bod5 68 22 nh3 n 87 71 tn 61 30 and tp 74 80 total removal 100 removal for microbial vibrio sp escherichia coli escherichia coli and anaerobic bacteria communities were achieved in some seasons and some microbes were detected in

13458,increased population and industrialization have resulted in adverse environmental problems which have put great stress on existing water bodies in most developing countries settling techniques have some potential ability to remove pollutants from lake water to assess its performance potential pilot modified settling techniques pmsts were built and monitored seasonally in triplicate to estimate changes in physicochemical properties and microbial community for influent water from marriott lake in egypt the experimental design included units with different operating conditions of settling techniques namely control combination tank air gravel no air gravel and air each unit represents one operational condition the pmsts were operated under seasonal variation and hydraulic retention time hrt 1 9 days the concentration variations and removal rates of different pollutants including turbidity do bod5 nh4 n no3 n no2 tn and tp were measured in different settling units to obtain optimum operating conditions of pmsts the average removal percent of the studied pollutants in different settling units was measured the maximum performance was achieved by no air gravel unit pmsts have significant potential and could be widely used as a pre treatment step for other water treatment techniques or directly for other purposes keywords water treatment settling unit aeration nutrient compounds microbial activity 1 introduction over the last few decades a rapid increase in population and industrialization has resulted in adverse environmental problems 1 2 and because of the direct wastewater discharge into water bodies elevated levels of nitrogen compounds have existed environmentally associated issues such as eutrophication of water bodies rivers and lakes pose an adverse effect on aquatic lives and human related health challenges 3 besides many countries and regions around the world are facing continuously growing pressure on their limited freshwater resources particularly in arid regions such as egypt 4 which faces a new challenge of water scarcity due to the grand ethiopian renaissance dam gerd so polluted water reuse becomes encouraged whenever it is safe and economically feasible to cover an increase in water demand 5 6 thus continuous and coordinated research focused on the abatement of gross pollution using eco friendly water treatment facilities most especially in developing countries is needed because most developing countries have inadequate sewerage systems and simply use watercourses as open sewers some water bodies such as lakes and rivers have become hotspot pollution areas marriott lake in egypt is considered as one of them 7 which receives a huge amount of municipal wastewater daily the high levels of pollutants delivered to the lake could negatively affect water quality and consequently pose an adverse effect on aquatic life and fish production 8 9 moreover in most developing countries pollution is the most critical public health risk 10 hence it is important to treat influent from water bodies pre treatment techniques by settling ponds integrated with different mechanisms of removal via several treatment processes are considered simple and low cost methods for water and wastewater treatment 2 11 typically settling techniquesare mainly considered as a treatment option for total suspended solids 11 moreover the ability of settling techniques to handle the removal of nitrogenous compound has not been fully explored and enhancing their performance could be a promising strategy due to their relatively low cost and mostly recommended as pre treatment step for advanced techniques besides settling techniques become a common pre treatment system for constructed wetlands aimed at reducing the clogging 4 12 settling techniques depend on many different mechanisms mainly biological mechanisms such as assimilation biodegradation metabolism adsorption flocculation precipitation and ion exchange 13 a condition such as a warm climate could enhance the removal efficiencies of pollutants 14 a higher majority of settling pretreatment systems include simple settling basins 15 factors such as the availability of land appropriate weather and efficiency of removal over time are key preliminary considerations for adopting settling systems for water treatment 2 moreover aeration has become another critical operating parameter for most biological water and wastewater treatment systems where it enhances the dissolved oxygen concentration consequently adding a source of aeration helps provide necessary conditions for nitrogenous compounds removal and microbial communities which may be artificially controlled by employing mechanical aerators 16 however these aerobic conditions are provided by mechanical aeration systems which have high energy consumption could account for about 45 75 of the total operating energy 17 sedimentation basins attached to systems like constructed wetlands could also increase the hydraulic retention time hrt of the system within a modest land surface area available 10 alternatively the presence of gravel media allows a good environment for living microorganisms which should have some advantages such as offering the existence of both aerobic and anaerobic pores inside the matrix to boost de nitrification nitrification and organic compounds removal as well as being a source of carbon to reduce the reliance of de nitrification metabolism 18 in this study pmsts were designed and tested for the treatment of influent water from marriott lake in egypt to identify a novel and simple route of sustainable treatment scenario as a sole treatment or potential pre treatment step for other low cost technologies the specific objectives were to i evaluate to what extent different modified configurations of settling units could aid in the treatment under varying operating conditions aeration regimes seasonal variation and hrt ii to elucidate the effect of modified systems on pollutant removal such as turbidity do bod5 nh4 n no3 n no2 tn tp and microbes finally the collected information will inform the design of an affordable surface flow system that can aid in the treatment of influent water from polluted lakes 2 material and methods 2 1 site location the water used in this study was supplied from marriott lake

oceanography and fisheries alexandria egypt this area experiences a minimum temperature of 16 2 c in winter and a maximum temperature of 33 2 c in summer with a high level of relative humidity these experiments were conducted on site over four seasons starting from april 2017 until march 2018 2 2 pilot scale setup fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of the pilot scale setup and its components as well fig 2 a d presents photos from the experimental site for different elements of the pilot scale setup polymethyl methacrylate basins were used to construct the settling units with dimensions of 1 m2 1 m on each side with a working volume of 1 m3 and placed outdoor each unit represents one operational condition and the units were randomly stationed fig 2a settling units were designed and operated with various operating conditions table 1 shows various operating conditions among different pmsts the treatment units include the control unit without gravel or aeration source while the combination tank unit constituted an influent which was first aerated for two days in presence of gravel then the contents of the upper water level were delivered into another tank provided with gravel and no aeration source called combination tank the air gravel unit has gravel and aerated while no air gravel has gravel only while the air unit has only aeration in absence of gravel the bottom of some tanks according to design requirements were covered with a thin layer 10 cm height of commercial gravel 5 10 mm particle size fig 2b the whole system was provided with a 1 5 hp water pump to fill tanks at the beginning of each run the pump supplies the pmsts with water from the inlet water basin to the el max station fig 2c all the pmsts were equipped with inlet and outlet hydraulic pipe structures influent was through a perforated plastic pipe diffuser placed across the entire width at the upstream side of the unit these diffusers were fastened on the tank in such that they were perfectly horizontal the aerated tanks were supported with a 2 hp air blower maximum air flow rate 210 m3 h and 1 5 kw as shown in fig 2d to deliver air to the aerated units samples were taken from a thin tube inserted into the selected point 70 cm from the top of each unit and withdrawn from a small valve outside the tank fig 2b the experiments were repeated twice per season to study the effect of different environmental conditions on the process the hydraulic retention time for each experiment hrt was 1 9 days table 2 depicts the characteristics of the influent water from the lake during the four seasons 2 3 measurements and methods water samples were collected daily through the duration of the experiment from the sampling valves in each unit all samples were analyzed following

hsd p 0 05 evaluated values for a homogenous variance 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in physicochemical properties the concentrations variations and removal rates of the different pollutants turbidity do bod5 nh4 n no3 n no2 tn and tp were measured at different settling units over hrt 1 9 days under seasonal variations as depicted in figs 2 6 3 1 1 water turbidity the water turbidity parameter in all treatment units showed a declining trend over the different hrts fig 3 there was an observable similarity in the reduction trends in all treatment units by the first day over the different seasons there was an average reduction of turbidity from water initial concentrations of 45 9 9 2 to 12 8 2 1 ntu 72 13 reduction on 8th day in spring from 59 5 3 22 to 12 3 1 2 ntu 79 3 reduction by 9th day in summer from 65 00 3 8 to 12 3 1 1 ntu 81 07 reduction on 9th day in autumn and from 154 00 6 6 to 2 43 0 9 ntu 98 42 reduction on 7th day in winter in winter it was observed that water turbidity decreased gradually with increasing hrt until 5 days after which it increased a little to the end there was no significant difference in water turbidity among the different settling configurations meanwhile hrt and season have a significant effect on the reduction rate as known turbidity is defined as the reduction of clarity in water due to suspended or colloidal particles such as clay silt and other organic matter 24 25 prolonged time for turbid water in settling systems could promote the downward movement of all suspended solids by gravity a process which is driven when the velocity of the water is decreased below the point of the suspended solids 26 this confirms the sharp decline in turbidity in this study after the first day which is due to settling of bigger sized particles while the smaller sized particles could take a time higher than the used hrts to settle down carbone et al 27 reported the same phenomena paired with high turbidity reduction after the provision of adequate time regarding the effect of seasonal variation on water turbidity winter season attained the highest performance efficiency 98 42 removal on hrt 7th day in the no air gravel unit despite having high initial turbidity compared with the other seasons alumukiar et al 10 reported that cold conditions in winter surface ice the lack of aeration negatively affect the biological treatment and sedimentation processes another reason may be observed limitation growth in algal or phytoplankton compared to spring summer and autumn as a result of favorable environmental conditions which could be higher 1 5 times in summer than winter and the total biomass available in most species could also be 4 times higher in warmer than in winter 28 moreover the high turbidity removal of the no air gravels unit compared to the aerated system could be because the aeration creates turbulence in the water which limits the settlement of solids sayara et al 17 reported that aeration could associate with other drawbacks like producing a bulky sludge that makes a poor settling ability this implies that non aerated units performed better than aerated units regarding water turbidity overall aeration on the upper layer of tanks resulted in little variance a study by micek et al 29 achieved a turbidity removal efficiency of 68 3 by settling using household wastewater moreover a turbid effluent level of 4 5 ntu was recorded in south africa at the trichardt wastewater treatment plant by negwamba and dinka 26 additionally since no significant difference was found between the different units these configurations may be appropriate for systems where turbidity is the targeted pollutant to be removed in this study different hrts recorded varying maximum turbidity removal over the different seasonal variation however after two days all systems reported a steady performance based on these findings stable performance was recorded from hrt 2 days to hrt 7 days the final effluent quality after turbidity removal is likely acceptable for fish farming requirements as noted by khan et al 30 3 1 2 do parameter fig 4 depicts do concentration over four seasons with different hrts for different settling configurations do values increased gradually until the middle of the experimental run then decreased towards the end over the different hrts and seasons initial do values were different from one season to another highest in winter followed by summer then spring and least in autumn in spring the highest do concentration reached 7 89 mg l 1 from an initial concentration of 5 35 mg l 1 corresponding to 47 do increase at hrt 3 days in the settling unit air gravels against 5 45 mg l 1 for the control system do concentration decreased at the end of the run for all settling units with an initial do concentration of 5 58 mg l 1 in summer the highest do value of 7 88 mg l 1 was recorded after hrt 6 days at combination tank unit against 6 03 mg l 1 for control in autumn the highest do concentration of 7 52 mg l 1 for air unit which was recorded on the second day while other settling units showed a fluctuation trend during winter all settling units indicated a gradual increase in do over the different hrts and the highest do concentration value achieved was 8 1 mg l 1 for air gravel against 6 33 mg l 1 for control do concentration was influenced by the seasonal variation p 0 05 hrt has a significant effect on the do concentration meanwhile differences between settling units were found significant do standard concentrations achieved in this study over the different hrts could support aquatic life 20 31 32 being do is a key factor in controlling the physicochemical and biological processes the obtained data indicated an enhancement of oxygen level at low hrt for both aerated and non aerated units which reached up to 7 mg l 1 although the aerated units should be higher in do concentration non aerated systems performed better this could be due to the modified aeration regime was only in the surface layer while the sampling point at 70 cm from the top in addition rapid reduction in turbidity could be another possible cause of enhanced do according to omotade 33 moreover the systems which contained gravels had higher do values in comparison with the control system which may be attributed to the activities of microbes as will be discussed in detail in subsequent sections however after the first day there was a remarkable increase in do until the middle of the run the highest do value was recorded in the winter due to the low level of temperature this implies that the seasonal variation influences the pmsts performance although no variance was found in the control unit over different seasons thus this change could be attributed to the influence of gravels 18 while the decreasing trend after that may be due to the other biochemical processes that consume oxygen for their activity also for both spring and autumn the highest do concentration was recorded on the second day the combination tank unit performed better among other systems during all seasons except autumn 3 1 3 bod5 reduction in this study a significant reduction of bod5 was recorded at different settling units as shown in fig 5 bod5 concentration declined dramatically from the beginning to the end during the spring season among different settling units a maximum bod5 reduction of 88 33 was recorded for both no air gravel and air units after 8 days a sharp decrease in bod5 concentration was recorded in summer for all units air unit recorded the highest reduction rate of bod5 79 86 reduction hrt 6 days against 39 57 for control in autumn combination tank unit achieved the best performance of bod5 reduction 66 6 hrt 5 days against an average of 33 3 for other units the highest bod5 reduction in the winter was observed at air unit 60 22 hrt 5 days season and hrt had significant effects on bod5 reduction p 0 05 also significant variances were found between the different settling units the bod5 concentration declined sharply over the hrts and seasons especially in summer and spring as a result of raised do concentrations and the reduction rate was maximum in the spring this could have resulted from the temperature variation among seasons which affects the biodegradation process in different settling units 9 20 a study by bosak et al 34 reported a similar trend where cold conditions in winter negatively affected biological treatment and sedimentation typically bod5 removal efficiency is also influenced by loading rates and hrt and stagnant conditions could decrease the effluent bod5 concentrations 14 another possible mechanism of bod5 reduction is the physical filtration mechanism of the substrate which filters and traps organic solids for a long time thereby enabling biodegradation of organic solids in the filtration bed 35 in this study the no air gravel unit had the best performance for bod5 removal compared to other settling units due to its do performance and presence of gravel micek et al 29 reported a bod5 removal rate of 50 4 from a multiple chamber settling tank as a primary treatment unit connected to a hybrid constructed wetland also the bod5 reduction rate was approximately 22 with anaerobic ponds under similar environmental conditions that were recorded in egypt by ghazy et al 36 the gravel used in this study acted as a substrate which supported the lives of microorganisms and assisted the bod5 removal 18 the maximum bod5 removal recorded in this study 88 3 hrt 8days is in agreement with the findings of omotade et al 37 who used a designed sedimentation tank for treating aquaculture wastewater with a bod5 removal rate of 86 3 1 4 nutrients compounds fig 6a shows the ammonia nh4 n removal rate over the different hrts and seasons there was a remarkable decrease in nh4 n concentrations during summer in all settling units which attained 57 9 99 2 99 24 99 16 and 99 26 percent for control combination tank air gravel no air gravel and air units respectively at 2 days hrt recording the highest removal rate among other seasons in spring there was a gradual increase in removal rates as hrt increases recording the highest removal value on the ninth day while in autumn the highest nh4 n removal was 96 51 on the 9th day of settling which was recorded at the air gravel unit while the control combination tank no air gravel air units achieved removal percentages of 56 27 81 98 84 3 and 94 34 respectively the maximum nh4 n removal efficiency recorded in winter was 88 76 on the 8th day by the air unit overall seasonal variation and hrt had a significant effect on nh4 n removal p 0 05 besides significant differences were obtained between the performance of different settling units towards the removal of nh4 n total nitrogen tn concentrations decreased considerably from the beginning to the end of the run fig 6b in spring different variances recorded between settling units no air gravel system recorded the maximum tn removal efficiency a gradual increase in tn removal with the increase of hrt was observed for the whole system in summer the highest removal value was measured by the end of the experimental run 83 59 for air gravel unit against 32 54 75 23 82 74 and 81 84 for control combination tank no air gravel and air units respectively in autumn and winter similar performance was observed the different settling configurations had better performance than the control system the highest removal value of tn was 68 22 and this occurred after 9 days in autumn and 69 9 after 8 days in winter for combination tank and no air gravel units respectively seasonal variation had a significant effect on tn removal p 0 05 a variance between settling units was found and hrt was significant on tn removal rates nitrite no2 had a different trend as shown in fig 6c where the concentration has changed dramatically recording a significant change for different settling units in spring and summer little change was depicted between settling units over hrts higher efficiency of removal was recorded in autumn where air gravel achieved the highest performance among other settling units in winter a significant increase was observed for air gravel unit over time seasonal variation had a significant effect on no2 removal p 0 05 while no difference occurred between different settling units fig 6d shows the concentration of no3 n over different settling units among the four seasons interestingly it was evident that the no3 n concentrations in the influent increased over different settling units in spring the combination tank unit recorded an increase in nitrate concentration than other settling units on the third day in summer all settling systems had a little increase of no3 n effluent concentrations than influent concentration except for air gravel and no air gravel units the autumn season achieved higher performance than summer in all settling units in winter the air unit had the highest no3 n effluent concentrations among all other units seasonal variation had a significant effect on no3 removal p 0 05 while no difference occurred between settled systems the behavior of inorganic nitrogen was observed seasonally with effluents from pmsts having a higher concentration of nitrogen during colder seasons winter and autumn than warmer seasons summer and spring however the opposite behavior was observed for nitrite and nitrate this finding was observed in previous studies which found a significant effect of seasonal variation on nitrogen components removal from settling units 38 kadlec and wallace 28 also reported that nitrogen removal efficiencies in warm seasons tend to be higher than that in winter the nitrogen compounds in the presented pmsts were likely to be removed by mechanisms such as uptake by living organisms nitrification process denitrification due to anaerobic conditions made available as a result of high depth and ammonia volatilization 16 29 sayara et al 17 reported that a large amount of oxygen is required for nitrogen compounds removal in conventional systems where 4 2 g o2 g nh4 n for ammonium removal and at least 2 mg l of oxygen in a simplified nitrification reaction in addition to a suitable substrate as an external source of carbon for denitrification reactions this implies that air unit has the highest average nh4 n loading removal during the different hrts while no air gravel unit was the highest in tn thus in this study the removal of nh4 n reached 99 9 for no air gravels unit in the summer the higher temperatures i e warmer climate promoted the biological removal processes that function optimally at temperature ranges between 25 and35 c which likely affected positively the performance of the system 28 39 this influence the performance of pmsts over the different seasons although high removal efficiencies of nh4 n in other seasons could be attributed to other factors not only to temperature however the performance drop in summer season on the third day could be due to microbial activities then it returned with increased performance to the end bosak et al 34 stated that changes in tn in an aerated sedimentation basin fed with agricultural wastewater were directly linked to changes in nh4 n concentration indicating that volatilization and nitrification denitrification were primary n removal pathways the continuous provision of appropriate environmental conditions such as ph temperature dissolved oxygen and availability of large surface area for microbial attachment favored effective nitrification in settled units 40 in this study the final concentration of nh4 n decreased to less than 0 1 mg l after the settling process which performed better than the findings reported in the literature also the interesting observation of the increase of no3 concentration could be credited to the conversion of a part of nh4 n to no3 which led to an increase of no3 concentration implying an enhancement of the nitrification process in the system 41 this was realized in autumn and also in agreement with that reported by 31 furthermore the gravel was considered as a good environment for the attachment of biofilm communities of microorganisms which could be the main contributor to tn reduction into the systems 42 tn removal reached 83 59 for air gravel unit in the summer season on 9th day hrt this system showed a better performance for tn removal due to oxygen injection required for the nitrification process however this performance was higher only in summer and no air gravel unit recorded the maximum performance on other seasons the decrease of tn with a slight increase in no3 n could be explained by the denitrification of all available no3 n to n2 gas and this has also been proven by bosak et al 34 moreover the highest performance of pmsts on tn removal was achieved in summer this is in agreement with a previous study by 14 who found that nitrogen removal efficiencies in the warm season are higher compared to winter the control unit showed low performance than other settling units indicating the role of gravel and aeration 43 also reported 44 removal using facultative ponds and 40 removal of tn using stabilization ponds at low temperature 44 3 1 5 total phosphorus removal performance fig 7 shows the removal efficiency of total phosphorus tp over 9 days period by different settling units during the four seasons the concentration of tp decreased gradually from the beginning of the experimental run until the end from 1 488 0 21 to 0 282 0 344 0248 0 142 and 0 157 mg l 1 corresponding to 81 08 76 88 83 36 90 47 and 89 42 of tp reduction for control combination tank air gravel no air gravel and air units respectively on the 9th day in spring the unit no air gravel achieved the best performance among all settling units by recording the highest removal efficiency during all seasons it attained 88 15 tp removal on the 7th day in summer 70 73 tp removal in autumn and 67 74 removal in winter on the 8th day it was observed that in cold seasons autumn and winter the tp removal rate was decreased with the increase in hrt recording overall performance less than warm seasons consequently seasonal variation and hrt have a significant effect on tp p 0 05 among the different settling units generally one of the main mechanisms of phosphorus removal is assimilation into biomass by settling conditions also other numerous mechanisms chemical biological and physical are involved 45 46 in this study no air gravel unit achieved the best performance 90 47 among all pmsts which might be due to the high binding capability of the gravel and or the assimilation potential of the biomass available in the water 47 thus no significant effect of aeration on tp removal against no aeration condition as no air gravel unit came out as the best unit which also supports the assimilation mechanism and adsorption ability of gravel this finding is in sharp contrast with 48 who realized by evaluating the effect of aeration on wetlands that tp removal and do positively correlate with a result of redox manipulation by aeration which facilitates phosphorous removal processes through precipitation and adsorption to the substrate gravel the aeration conditions supplied in our system were quite low compared and not optimal for effective precipitation as reported in the study by 48 authors presume that long hydraulic retention time provided adequate conditions for algae growth and hence adsorption of phosphorus by the algae biomass 45 49 the growth of algae and stagnant conditions of the influent allowed more tp to settle spring and summer had very high influence on tp removal against autumn and winter this variation may be due to temperature difference that influences the microbial distribution and algal growth which as explained in previous studies has a significant impact on settling systems performance concerning tp removal 38 the results here were above the expected ranges reported by the literature where about 46 removal in wastewater was achieved in a treatment facility in brazil where a facultative pond was used 43 and 55 removal by using a stabilization pond technique for purifying urban wastewater in mashhad city iran 44 3 2 microbial removal microbial removal of vibrio sp escherichia coli total bacterial count and anaerobic bacterial communities were measured over the different seasons in pmsts different units were either operated in the presence or absence of aeration plus the control unit as shown in fig 8 a d a slightly close trend of vibrio sp removal was detected in autumn and winter however the highest count was recorded in spring and summer over the different hrts compared with the control tank in summer vibrio sp count had a gradual increase in aerated units than the non aerated units recording 100 removal for the combination tank no air gravel and air gravel and 95 with the air unit as against 75 for control for day 1 hrt this was followed by spring where no vibrio sp was detected in all units after day 1 hrt against 21 1 removal for control then the count increased with hrt increases fig 8a similar results were observed in terms of the effect of seasonal variations for total coliform where complete removal 100 was recorded during autumn and winter while in summer maximum count was detected on 9 days hrt with removal rates of 54 64 5 87 9 72 6 and 64 5 respectively for control combination tank air gravel no air gravel and air units fig 8b in autumn it was evident also evident that the maximum reduction in total coliform was 100 removal which occurred on day 1 hrt furthermore the data on the total bacterial count and anaerobic bacterial community over the different seasons and hrts are shown in fig 8c and d in winter total bacterial count was lower in non aerated units than aerated units recording 97 3 100 96 3 100 and 99 3 respectively for control combination tank air gravel no air gravel and air units but the total count of bacteria was found in a high level at all remaining seasons for all settling units unlike total bacteria anaerobic bacteria trend varied it was observed that the optimum removal occurred in the aerated units rather than the non aerated units however the non aerated units attained a slightly stable increase in anaerobic bacteria over the varying seasons in spring the control unit showed a drastic increase in anaerobic bacterial community a fluctuated trend was recorded toward total count removal while for anaerobic bacterial community a stable trend was recorded for the constructed pmsts in terms of seasonal variations winter and autumn seasons were optimal for the removal of total bacteria and anaerobic bacteria respectively for the different settling tank units fig 9 a d shows that the microbial count in substrates collected from the units that have gravel and in settled particles for those units without gravel overall a close trend was found in spring season for total coliform by all units compared to the control unit while in summer the total coliform was higher in control than that in other units autumn and winter showed the lowest count of total coliform recording 2 cfu ml 1 in no air gravel unit in winter and 3 cfu ml 1 in combination tank unit in autumn a similar trend was found in summer autumn and winter for anaerobic bacterial count of 90 75 and 50 cfu ml 1 respectively for air gravel unit while in spring the anaerobic bacterial count in all pmsts was found higher than the initial count of 50 cfu ml 1 interestingly a higher number of vibrio sp count was present in the control unit than other units over all seasons the combination tank recorded the lowest total count of 50 cfu ml 1 in winter and 60 cfu ml 1 in spring against 150 cfu ml 1 in autumn and 105 cfu ml 1 in summer for no air gravel tank generally it was found that there excited significant differences between pathogenic concentrations in the tanks over different hrts and seasonal variations the most important pathogenic bacteria in the influent to the pmsts are most likely those transmitted by the faecal oral route 50 it was clear in our study that there are excited significant differences between pathogenic concentrations in the units over the different hrts and seasonal variations 51 on exploring the mechanisms of pathogen removal it was reported that to date no conclusive results are available on the effects of seasonal fluctuations on pathogen removal different studies were reported contrasting results on the effect of different seasons on pathogen removal in the present study the main pathogenic bacteria that were determined in treated settlement tanks are vibrio sp escherichia coli total bacterial count and anaerobic bacteria recently 52 isolated hundred and sixty bacterial strains among those e coli was the most common followed by s faecalis k pneumonia e aerogenes s typhi s typhimurium s sonni and y pestis meanwhile our study showed that complete removal of pathogenic microbes in pmsts is highly possible in autumn and winter than in summer and spring it is also worth noting that the pmsts also have the potential to reduce pathogens because of natural die off and hostile environmental conditions 47 a key observation made was that unlike total bacteria anaerobic bacterial had a completely different trend it was observed that the optimum removal occurred in the aerated units rather than the non aerated units this could be linked to the availability of oxygen in the aerated units limited the activities of anaerobic bacteria 53 the result here was above the expected ranges reported in the literature where the reduction percentages of total coliform tc fecal coliform fc e coli were found by 98 8 95 6 and 79 4 respectively at the similar environmental conditions in egypt through stabilization ponds 36 3 3 optimum operational conditions based on the data obtained seven days hrt is the optimum time for the removal of pollutants in most settling units hence it was used for further analysis to evaluate the performance of different pmsts units the average removal percentage of the studied pollutants at different settling units during the four seasons was measured according to fig 10 the efficiency of settling units was almost similar in removing turbidity and nh4 n for other pollutants no air gravel settling unit showed the best performance concerning other units hence the use of no air gravel unit is recommended as the best performed unit with minimal cost due to the absence of aeration the average removal percentage achieved by no air gravel at optimum

without nitrogen gas accumulation in the reactor s headspace over time in order to eliminate nitrogen gas build up in the pressurized reactor s headspace the main unsaturated flow pressurized reactor was connected to an external degassing unit via liquid recirculation pressurized liquid from the main reactor was intermittently discharged to the degassing unit where dissolved n2 gas effervesced and escaped to the atmosphere the degassed effluent water was continuously recirculated back to the main reactor to maintain steady state nitrogen and hydrogen gas partial pressures denitrifying rates of up to 6 g n l reactor d were achieved in the reactor system under freshwater and brine conditions nitrate removal was over 97 with nitrate effluent concentrations lower than 10 mg n l for influent

high denitrification rates dissolved nitrogen concentrations in the reactor were super saturated 125 150 while on the other hand dissolved hydrogen was undersaturated 30 60 due to intense bacteria

hydrogenotrophic denitrification pressurized reactor high nitrate concentrations degassing 1 introduction nitrates are one of the most common groundwater contaminants around the globe and health and environmental regulations impose their removal 1 physicochemical technologies for nitrate removal from groundwater such as reverse osmosis ion exchange and electro dialysis are well established technologies however they produce large amounts of waste brine containing high concentrations of nitrate chlorides and other ions with concentrations of up to 10 times than that of the source groundwater 2 3 disposal of these concentrates to either the sewerage system or to water bodies is a major environmental problem 4 this paper focuses on the removal of high concentrations of nitrate using a novel pressurized hydrogenotrophic biological denitrification reactor the technology can be applied to brines originating from membrane technologies designed to remove nitrate from groundwater or for high nitrate groundwater 5 compared to heterotrophic denitrification commonly applied in wastewater treatment 6 8 hydrogen based denitrification is an attractive option for groundwater remediation due to the relatively low biomass yield clean nature and relatively low price 9 10 however the main drawbacks limiting the use of h2 for biological denitrification are safety concerns 11 12 poor h2 gas utilization and low transfer rate which characterize systems based on direct h2 bubbling 13 17 membrane biofilm reactors 18 24 bio electrochemical reactors 25 31 and other systems 32 33 have been designed to enable more efficient safer and high rate h2 delivery to the biofilm however membrane fouling and scaling together with problems of biomass control are possible drawbacks of these systems 9 the use of hydrogenotrophic systems based on pressurized reactors with closed headspace has been limited since either continuous or intermittent discharge purging of the n2 gas produced is practiced resulting in low h2 utilization and risk during operation due to hydrogen loss to the atmosphere an innovative pressurized reactor system has been developed at the technion for typical polluted groundwater using hydrogen gas as the electron donor for biological denitrification 34 35 and perchlorate reduction 36 the reactor s main advantage and uniqueness is the high utilization of the hydrogen gas because the common practice of purging of the nitrogen gas produced during denitrification is not required the pressurized reactor vessel is operated under an unsaturated flow regime as a trickling filter where water is recirculated over biofilm carriers during continuous feeding a gas liquid equilibrium is established in the pressurized reactor according to henry s law and excess n2 produced by denitrification is carried out by the effluent in dissolved form without further accumulation in the reactor s headspace this process is practical for low influent nitrate concentrations where the total gas pressure h2 n2 under steady state conditions reached only 3 atm for denitrification of 25 mg no3 n l 34 since the nitrogen gas pressure that develops in the headspace of a closed reactor is proportional to the nitrate concentration removed during denitrification applying this technique for waters with high concentrations of nitrate will result in extremely high pressures in the reactor the present paper investigates a modified version of the pressurized reactor that can treat waters with high nitrate concentrations without the need to increase the operational pressure or resorting to intermittent gas purging the modified version incorporates an external degassing unit open to the atmosphere and connected to the pressurized reactor by recirculation where dissolved n2 is released in gaseous form to the atmosphere the results presented here demonstrate the feasibility of the modified pressurized reactor to treat freshwater

constructed of clear pvc piping 110 mm diameter and connected to the main reactor by recirculation 2 2 reactor system operation the pressurized reactor was operated under an unsaturated flow regime where water was recirculated internally and trickled over biofilm carriers the reactor was continuously fed with nitrate contaminated water when enough liquid collected at the reactor s bottom and reached a level switch a drain valve opened and treated water was released pulsed discharge the reactor s gas phase was closed to the atmosphere and pressurized by the supplied h2 and the n2 formed during denitrification a degassing unit open to the atmosphere was added to the pressurized reactor and connected via external recirculation in order to avoid high operational n2 gas pressures that would occur treating a high nitrate concentration influent fig 1 when liquid was intermittently discharged from the pressurized reactor to the degassing unit dissolved n2 effervesced and was released in gaseous form to the atmosphere the degassed effluent water in the degassing unit was continuously recirculated back to the main reactor 2 3 determination of degassing rates the maximal nitrogen degassing rate is obtained when equilibrium exists between the dissolved nitrogen concentration and partial pressure of n2 gas in the reactor and between the effluent dissolved n2 gas concentration and atmospheric pressure 1 r d e g a s n 2 m a x m l n 2 m i n q e x t k h n 2 p p n 2 r e p p n 2 a t m c 1 where qext is the external recirculation flow rate l m i n k h n 2 is the henry constant

respectively and c1 is the conversion coefficient from concentration to volume for nitrogen which equals to 0 8 m l n 2 m g the rate of nitrogen degassing in the reactor under abiotic conditions and without biofilm carriers was determined by measuring the pressure drop in the reactor over time during external recirculation operation the reactor was operated with initial n2 absolute pressures of 3 and 4 atm gauge pressure of 2 and 3 atm at each pressure the external recirculation flow rate was varied between 0 2 and 0 8 l min and the decrease in reactor pressure was converted into the volume of

temperature and t r e is the actual temperature in the reactor 2 4 bio reactor startup and operation the pressurized reactor was inoculated with biomass from a previously operating hydrogenotrophic reactor at ph 7 and initially operated with an influent concentration of 25 mg no3 n l until nitrate removal rates of 2 2 5 g n l reactor d were achieved after startup the influent nitrate concentration was gradually increased from 25 to 400 mg n l while the influent flow rate was decreased in order to maintain similar nitrate loading rates in order to avoid inorganic carbon limitation for biomass growth at high nitrate concentrations 2 g sodium bicarbonate per liter influent was added and the reactor ph set point was changed from neutral ph at startup to ph 8 7 above the bicarbonate equivalence point to prevent excess acid dosing reactor temperature was maintained at 30 c during operation the pressurized hydrogenotrophic biofilm reactor was connected via a regulator to a standard high pressure cylinder containing compressed hydrogen gas using the regulator the total pressure of the system was set at startup the partial pressure of h2 was high in the reactor as denitrification proceeded hydrogen gas was consumed and partially replaced by nitrogen gas with the composition of the binary gas being determined by the amount of degassing via external recirculation and effluent discharge the external recirculation flow rate to the degassing unit was adjusted to achieve steady state where neither an increase nor decrease of the gases partial pressures n2 or h2 in the reactor s headspace was observed 2 5 biomass yield and denitrification stoichiometry for determination of hydrogen utilization efficiency a 10 day experiment was conducted on the pressurized reactor system in order to determine the biomass yield and hydrogenotrophic denitrification stoichiometry used in calculating hydrogen utilization efficiency the reactor operated at 4 3 atm total pressure 1 34 atm partial pressure of h2 gas and the external recirculation was set at 0 4 l min influent nitrate concentration was close to 400 mg n l with nitrate removal rate of about 2 5 g n l reactor d the dissolved hydrogen concentration was measured at 0 5 0 04 mg l and 0 mg l for the reactor and degassing unit respectively effluent water samples were taken daily for suspended solids determinations vss tss in addition triplicate samples from the daily reactor cleaning cycle of nitrogen gas scourging and water washing were collected for vss and tss determination at the end of the 10 day period the reactor was opened and any excess biofilm that developed on piping and reactor walls was collected and measured biomass yield was calculated at 0 42 g vss per g n removed similar to other reported values for denitrification 9 the stoichiometric equation for the hydrogenotrophic denitrification reactor assuming cell formula of c5h7o2n was determined as 4 3 1 h 2 n o 3 0 26 c o 2 h

identification of microbial population only predominant microbial populations are given the remaining microbial population is shown as others 3 results and discussion 3 1 calculated and observed nitrogen gas degassing rates under abiotic conditions the hypothesis of this research project was that excess nitrogen produced by denitrification of high nitrate concentrations in a pressurized reactor can be removed by recirculating liquid from the main reactor to an external degassing unit open to the atmosphere where dissolved nitrogen gas is released the extent of degassing depends on both the external recirculation flow rate to the degassing unit and the partial pressure of n2 in the reactor in order to assess the merit of the hypothesis the maximal nitrogen degassing rate was first calculated based on theoretical considerations and compared with results from experiments with nitrogen gas only using an abiotic reactor equipped with an external degassing unit the maximal theoretical degassing rate for 16 l total reactor volume 6 l active reactor volume was calculated and is presented in fig 2 with the corresponding nitrate removal rate the solid lines in fig 2 represent n2 maximal theoretical degassing rates for reactor absolute pressures of 3 and 4 atm as a function of the external recirculation flow rate to the degassing unit theoretical calculations demonstrate that by operating at higher external recirculation rates and or higher reactor n2 partial pressures degassing rates will increase removing more nitrogen produced in denitrification the results show that under abiotic conditions the average degassing rate for the external recirculation range tested were 68 1 3 8 and 71 6 2 5 of maximal theoretical values for 3 and 4 atm respectively due to non equilibrium conditions fig 2 the degassing rate for 3 atm n2 was slightly lower than 4 atm n2 due to the smaller difference between reactor internal pressure and atmospheric pressure based on fig 2 the degassing rate for a 6 l active reactor volume with a daily removal rate of 3 g no3 n l reactor d should be approximately 15 l d which can be achieved by setting an external recirculation rate of 0 6 l min at a reactor n2 pressure of 3 atm or alternatively qext of 0 3 l min at n2 pressure of 4 atm these initial results demonstrate that a pressurized denitrification reactor with external recirculation can work at low absolute pressures 5 atm with relatively low external recirculation delivering a degasification rate sufficient for high daily denitrification rates calculation of degassing rates in binary gas systems such as that found in a pressurized hydrogenotrophic denitrifying reactor is more complicated and can only be determined empirically due to the possible synergistic effects of the two gases under pressure an experiment with a binary gas mixture characteristic of actual reactor operation of 3 atm n2 and 1 atm h2 at an external recirculation of 0 4 l min showed a much higher nitrogen degassing rate 85 of the theoretical amount the increase in degassing rate of a binary gas vs single gas is probably due to the increased effervescence cause by the degassing of the secondary gas in this case hydrogen 3 2 nitrogen degassing during bio reactor operation the production and degassing of nitrogen gas from an active biological denitrifying reactor is significantly different than the abiotic simulation previously examined in the abiotic system the reactor is first pressurized with n2 gas from an external gas cylinder n2 gas subsequently dissolves in the water volume of the reactor and during external recirculation dissolved n2 is released to atmosphere in the degassing unit in contrast bacteria reduce nitrate to n2 gas during biological denitrification that is released directly into the liquid phase of the reactor in dissolved form under non equilibrium conditions prevailing in the reactor nitrogen gas should be super saturated in the liquid phase where it is produced relative to the partial pressure of n2 gas that develops in the headspace of the reactor this should significantly improve the external degassing unit s performance since it is performed on dissolved nitrogen in the recirculating liquid after bioreactor startup see materials and methods the external recirculation flow rates necessary to maintain constant partial pressure for n2 and h2 under varying conditions were determined experimentally the reactor was operated with nitrogen gas partial pressures between 2 and 3 5 atm and nitrate removal rates of 2 and 3 g n l reactor d under h2 gas partial pressures of 1 3 and 2 0 atm respectively broken lines fig 3 as previously observed during abiotic degassing the amount of external recirculation necessary to remove n2 gas produced by denitrification to maintain steady state conditions went down as the partial pressure of n2 in the reactor increased demonstrating that degassing is more effective when there is a higher difference between atmospheric pressure and the partial pressure of the nitrogen in the reactor also pictured in fig 3 is the theoretical partial pressure of n2 gas calculated to maintain steady state for the same external recirculation flow rates solid lines fig 3 shows that the biological reactor operated at significantly lower partial pressures of n2 than that predicted at equilibrium using henry s law indicating a high level of n2 super saturation in the liquid phase nitrogen gas super saturation for nitrate removal rates of 2 and 3 g l reactor day was calculated to be 125 and 150 respectively the higher super saturation observed when operating at the higher nitrogen removal rate further reduced the amount of external recirculation necessary to maintain steady state an increase of only 20 35 over the range of n2 partial pressures tested the higher level of n2 super saturation under higher loading at the same nitrogen partial pressure was due to the higher nitrogen gas production by the bacteria in the liquid phase enabling more effective degassing for a given external recirculation rate the results show that under practical nitrate loading rates of 2 and 3 g n l reactor day and at relatively low operating pressures and external recirculation rate the degassing rate is enough to maintain steady state conditions in the pressurized reactor no nitrogen accumulation 3 3 operation of the hydrogenotrophic pressurized biofilm reactor at higher loading rates as a function of hydrogen pressure to further demonstrate the pressurized reactor s capability to handle higher nitrate loading rates the pressurized reactor was operated with increasing influent flow rates at influent concentrations of 365 380 mg no3 n l in these experiments the nitrogen steady state partial pressure was maintained at 2 atm similar to the partial pressure that developed in the reactor when denitrifying potable water with only 25 mg no3 n l as observed in earlier research 34 the hydrogen partial pressure was increased in order to increase the hydrogen gas transfer rate from the gas to liquid phase as required at each loading rate the hydrogen partial pressure was adjusted in order to obtain an effluent nitrate concentration in line with local regulations 10 mg no3 n l at the highest loading rate the effluent nitrate concentration increased to 16 mg n l above the standard suggesting insufficient biofilm surface area under the existing conditions table 1 shows the operation conditions at the different loading rates while fig 4 shows nitrate removal rate as a function of hydrogen pressure and concentration in order to maintain low nitrate effluent concentrations as the nitrate loading rate increased an increase in hydrogen partial pressure of 0 36 atm per g no3 n removed l reactor d was necessary fig 4 the linearity shown in the graph proves that indeed hydrogen pressure is the rate limiting parameter moreover due to the dynamic conditions in the reactor the dissolved hydrogen concentration was found to be significantly undersaturated 0 44 mg l atm as compared to the theoretical ratio at equilibrium according to henry s law 1 5 mg l atm the above results prove the ability of the pressurized reactor to operate continuously under steady state conditions without nitrogen gas accumulation with an influent nitrate concentration of 400 mg n l and at high denitrification rates 6 g n l reactor day the rates obtained are generally an order of magnitude above those reported in other hydrogenotrophic reactor systems 9 using a reactor with degassing via external recirculation allowed for operation at a low pressure of less than 5 atm as compared to 25 atm for the same continuous system without a degassing unit 34 38 39 3 4 hydrogen utilization efficiency as a function of external recirculation the denitrification system was operated under steady state conditions with varying external recirculation rates the main parameter affecting h2 utilization measurements of the hydrogen concentration before and after the degassing unit were used to determine the hydrogen degassing rate results of hydrogen utilization efficiency as a function of the external recirculation rate are given in fig 5 the results clearly show the linear relation between the external recirculation and h2 utilization with very high utilization efficiencies above 95 at the lower recirculation rates up to 0 43 l min the high utilization efficiencies are mainly a result of the super saturation of dissolved nitrogen which allowed for lower recirculation flow rate and the relatively low dissolved hydrogen concentrations necessary to achieve high rate denitrification 3 5 operation of the pressurized reactor under brine conditions 3 5 nacl to demonstrate the ability of the pressurized hydrogenotrophic bioreactor to remove nitrate under salt concentrations typical to brines from membrane technologies the reactor was fed with saline solutions of up to 3 5 the reactor s transition period from feeding nitrate polluted freshwater to brine conditions was carried out over a period of 25 days where the nacl concentration in the influent was gradually increased to 3 5 during the transition period the reactor was operated at a constant nitrate loading rate of 2 g l reactor d influent nitrate concentration of 400 mg n l and partial pressure of h2 gas between 1 and 1 2 atm after completing the transition to brine feeding conditions with no loss of denitrification capacity the pressurized reactor was subjected to increasing nitrate loading rates by increasing the influent flow rate the influent no3 n remained at 400 mg l as in the previous case with tap water amended with nitrate the partial pressure of hydrogen gas was increased in order to maintain low nitrate effluent concentrations as the nitrate loading rate was increased under increased nitrate loads the reactor demonstrated high removal rates of 5 7 g n l reactor d with effluent no3 n under the standard of 10 mg l except at the highest nitrate removal rate 17 0 mg l as in the case of feeding solution based on freshwater water fig 6 3 6 microbial diversity under groundwater and brine conditions the microbial diversity in the pressurized hydrogenotrophic was characterized by ngs new generation sequencing during four different periods 1 reactor inoculation 2 after startup at neutral ph and low influent nitrate concentrations 3 during freshwater operation at high influent nitrate concentrations and ph 8 7 and 4 during the transition from freshwater to brine water conditions at high influent nitrate concentrations and ph 8 7 the inoculum for the bioreactor originated from a laboratory scale pressurized hydrogenotrophic denitrification reactor operating at low influent nitrate concentrations of up to 25 mg l no3 n groundwater and neutral ph of 7 0 7 5 table 2 summarizes the results a significant change in the dominant bacterial genera was observed mainly from dechloromonas and zoogloea as the main denitrifiers at inoculation and after startup to thauera during the course of operation with high nitrate concentrations the main reason for the major shift in bacterial population was the change in operating ph from neutral ph during startup to ph 8 7 due to increased inorganic carbon required under conditions of high influent nitrate concentrations interestingly during the transition from freshwater groundwater low salt conditions to brine no significant change in the microbial population was observed thauera genus continued to dominate the thauera genus has been reported in the literature for hydrogenotrophic denitrification at high ph 40 it can be concluded that the ph effect on microbial diversity is much stronger than the effect of salt concentration from close to zero at reactor inoculum to almost 90 after 20 months of reactor operation 4 conclusions a pressurized hydrogenotrophic denitrification system designed to operate under high influent nitrate concentrations was designed and successfully operated purging of nitrogen gas build up in the reactor s head space was avoided by integrating an external degassing unit to the main reactor via liquid recirculation the system was able to maintain steady state conditions at low external recirculation rates and low total pressures while achieving high denitrifying rates nitrate removal and hydrogen utilization efficiency using groundwater or brine as feed water in comparison to predicted values calculated based on equilibrium using henry s law significantly lower partial pressures or recirculation flow rates were necessary to achieve steady state conditions due to high levels of n2 super saturation in the liquid phase declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements this study was supported by the kamin program of the

constructed of clear pvc piping 110 mm diameter and connected to the main reactor by recirculation 2 2 reactor system operation the pressurized reactor was operated under an unsaturated flow regime where water was recirculated internally and trickled over biofilm carriers the reactor was continuously fed with nitrate contaminated water when enough liquid collected at the reactor s bottom and reached a level switch a drain valve opened and treated water was released pulsed discharge the reactor s gas phase was closed to the atmosphere and pressurized by the supplied h2 and the n2 formed during denitrification a degassing unit open to the atmosphere was added to the pressurized reactor and connected via external recirculation in order to avoid high operational n2 gas pressures that would occur treating a high nitrate concentration influent fig 1 when liquid was intermittently discharged from the pressurized reactor to the degassing unit dissolved n2 effervesced and was released in gaseous form to the atmosphere the degassed effluent water in the degassing unit was continuously recirculated back to the main reactor 2 3 determination of degassing rates the maximal nitrogen degassing rate is obtained when equilibrium exists between the dissolved nitrogen concentration and partial pressure of n2 gas in the reactor and between the effluent dissolved n2 gas concentration

reactor at ph 7 and initially operated with an influent concentration of 25 mg no3 n l until nitrate removal rates of 2 2 5 g n l reactor d were achieved after startup the influent nitrate concentration was gradually increased from 25 to 400 mg n l while the influent flow rate was decreased in order to maintain similar nitrate loading rates in order to avoid inorganic carbon limitation for biomass growth at high nitrate concentrations 2 g sodium bicarbonate per liter influent was added and the reactor ph set point was changed from neutral ph at startup to ph 8 7 above the bicarbonate equivalence point to prevent excess acid dosing reactor temperature was maintained at 30 c during operation the pressurized hydrogenotrophic biofilm reactor was connected via a regulator to a standard high pressure cylinder containing compressed hydrogen gas using the regulator the total pressure of the system was set at startup the partial pressure of h2 was high in the reactor as denitrification proceeded hydrogen gas was consumed and partially replaced by nitrogen gas with the composition of the binary gas being determined by the amount of degassing via external recirculation and effluent discharge the external recirculation flow rate to the degassing unit was adjusted to achieve steady state where neither an increase nor decrease of the gases partial pressures n2 or h2 in the reactor s headspace was observed 2 5 biomass yield and denitrification stoichiometry for determination of hydrogen utilization efficiency a 10 day experiment was conducted on the pressurized reactor system in order to determine the biomass yield and hydrogenotrophic denitrification stoichiometry used in calculating hydrogen utilization efficiency the reactor operated at 4 3 atm total

nitrogen gas degassing rates under abiotic conditions the hypothesis of this research project was that excess nitrogen produced by denitrification of high nitrate concentrations in a pressurized reactor can be removed by recirculating liquid from the main reactor to an external degassing unit open to the atmosphere where dissolved nitrogen gas is released the extent of degassing depends on both the external recirculation flow rate to the degassing unit and the partial pressure of n2 in the reactor in order to assess the merit of the hypothesis the maximal nitrogen degassing rate was first calculated based on theoretical considerations and compared with results from experiments with nitrogen gas only using an abiotic reactor equipped with an external degassing unit the maximal theoretical degassing rate for 16 l total reactor volume 6 l active reactor volume was calculated and is presented in fig 2 with the corresponding nitrate removal rate the solid lines in fig 2 represent n2 maximal theoretical degassing rates for reactor absolute pressures of 3 and 4 atm as a function of the external recirculation flow rate to the degassing unit theoretical calculations demonstrate that by operating at higher external recirculation rates and or higher reactor n2 partial pressures degassing rates will increase removing more nitrogen produced in denitrification the results show that under abiotic conditions the average degassing rate for the external recirculation range tested were 68 1 3 8 and 71 6 2 5 of maximal theoretical values for 3 and 4 atm respectively due to non equilibrium conditions fig 2 the degassing rate for 3 atm n2 was slightly lower than 4 atm n2 due to the smaller difference between reactor internal pressure and atmospheric pressure based on fig 2 the degassing rate for a 6 l active reactor volume with a daily removal rate of 3 g no3 n l reactor d should be approximately 15 l d which can be achieved by setting an external recirculation rate of 0 6 l min at a reactor n2 pressure of 3 atm or alternatively qext of 0 3 l min at n2 pressure of 4 atm these initial results demonstrate that a pressurized denitrification reactor with external recirculation can work at low absolute pressures 5 atm with relatively low external recirculation delivering a degasification rate sufficient for high daily denitrification rates calculation of degassing rates in binary gas systems such as that found in a pressurized hydrogenotrophic denitrifying reactor is more complicated and can only be determined empirically due to the possible synergistic effects of the two gases under pressure an experiment with a binary gas mixture characteristic of actual reactor operation of 3 atm n2 and 1 atm h2 at an external recirculation of 0 4 l min showed a much higher nitrogen degassing rate 85 of the theoretical amount the increase in degassing rate of a binary gas vs single gas is probably due to the increased effervescence cause by the degassing of the secondary gas in this case hydrogen 3 2 nitrogen degassing during bio reactor operation the production and degassing of nitrogen gas from an active biological denitrifying reactor is significantly different than the abiotic simulation previously examined in the abiotic system the reactor is first pressurized with n2 gas from an external gas cylinder n2 gas subsequently dissolves in the water volume of the reactor and during external recirculation dissolved n2 is released to atmosphere in the degassing unit in contrast bacteria reduce nitrate to n2 gas during biological denitrification that is released directly into the liquid phase of the reactor in dissolved form under non equilibrium conditions prevailing in the reactor nitrogen gas should be super saturated in the liquid phase where it is produced relative to the partial pressure of n2 gas that develops in the headspace of the reactor this should significantly improve the external degassing unit s performance since it is performed on dissolved nitrogen in the recirculating liquid after bioreactor startup see materials and methods the external recirculation flow rates necessary to maintain constant partial pressure for n2 and h2 under varying conditions were determined experimentally the reactor was operated with nitrogen gas partial pressures between 2 and 3 5 atm and nitrate removal rates of 2 and 3 g n l reactor d under h2 gas partial pressures of 1 3 and 2 0 atm respectively broken lines fig 3 as previously observed during abiotic degassing the amount of external recirculation necessary to remove n2 gas produced by denitrification to maintain steady state conditions went down as the partial pressure of n2 in the reactor increased demonstrating that degassing is more effective when there is a higher difference between atmospheric pressure and the partial pressure of the nitrogen in the reactor also pictured in fig 3 is the theoretical partial pressure of n2 gas calculated to maintain steady state for the same external recirculation flow rates solid lines fig 3 shows that the biological reactor operated at significantly lower partial pressures of n2 than that predicted at equilibrium using henry s law indicating a high level of n2 super saturation in the liquid phase nitrogen gas super saturation for nitrate removal rates of 2 and 3 g l reactor day was calculated to be 125 and 150 respectively the higher super saturation observed when operating at the higher nitrogen removal rate further reduced the amount of external recirculation necessary to maintain steady state an increase of only 20 35 over the range of n2 partial pressures tested the higher level of n2 super saturation under higher loading at the same nitrogen partial pressure was due to the higher nitrogen gas production by the bacteria in the liquid phase enabling more effective degassing for a given external recirculation rate the results show that under practical nitrate loading rates of 2 and 3 g n l reactor day and at relatively low operating pressures and external recirculation rate the degassing rate is enough to maintain steady state conditions in the pressurized reactor no nitrogen accumulation 3 3 operation of the hydrogenotrophic pressurized biofilm reactor at higher loading rates as a function of hydrogen pressure to further demonstrate the pressurized reactor s capability to handle higher nitrate loading rates the pressurized reactor was operated with increasing influent flow rates at influent concentrations of 365 380 mg no3 n l in these experiments the nitrogen steady state partial pressure was maintained at 2 atm similar to the partial pressure that developed in the reactor when denitrifying potable water with only 25 mg no3 n l as observed in earlier research 34 the hydrogen partial pressure was increased in order to increase the hydrogen gas transfer rate from the gas to liquid phase as required at each loading rate the hydrogen partial pressure was adjusted in order to obtain an effluent nitrate concentration in line with local regulations 10 mg no3 n l at the highest loading rate the effluent nitrate concentration increased to 16 mg n l above the standard suggesting insufficient biofilm surface area under the existing conditions table 1 shows the operation conditions at the different loading rates while fig 4 shows nitrate removal rate as a function of hydrogen pressure and concentration in order to maintain low nitrate effluent concentrations as the nitrate loading rate increased an increase in hydrogen partial pressure of 0 36 atm per g no3 n removed l reactor d was necessary fig 4 the linearity shown in the graph proves that indeed hydrogen pressure is the rate limiting parameter moreover due to the dynamic conditions in the reactor the dissolved hydrogen concentration was found to be significantly undersaturated 0 44 mg l atm as compared to the theoretical ratio at equilibrium according to henry s law 1 5 mg l atm the above results prove the ability of the pressurized reactor to operate continuously under steady state conditions without nitrogen gas accumulation with an influent nitrate concentration of 400 mg n l and at high denitrification rates 6 g n l reactor day the rates obtained are generally an order of magnitude above those reported in other hydrogenotrophic reactor systems 9 using a reactor with degassing via external recirculation allowed for operation at a low pressure of less than 5 atm as compared to 25 atm for the same continuous system without a degassing unit 34 38 39 3 4 hydrogen utilization efficiency as a function of external recirculation the denitrification system was operated under steady state conditions with varying external recirculation rates the main parameter affecting h2 utilization measurements of the hydrogen concentration before and after the degassing unit were used to determine the hydrogen degassing rate results of hydrogen utilization efficiency as a function of the external recirculation rate are given in fig 5 the results clearly show the linear relation between the external recirculation and h2 utilization with very high utilization efficiencies above 95 at the lower recirculation rates up to 0 43 l min the high utilization efficiencies are mainly a result of the super saturation of dissolved nitrogen which allowed for lower recirculation flow rate and the relatively low dissolved hydrogen concentrations necessary to achieve high rate denitrification 3 5 operation of the pressurized reactor under brine conditions 3 5 nacl to demonstrate the ability of the pressurized hydrogenotrophic bioreactor to remove nitrate under salt concentrations typical to brines from membrane technologies the reactor was fed with saline solutions of up to 3 5 the reactor s transition period from feeding nitrate polluted freshwater to brine conditions was carried out over a period of 25 days where the nacl concentration in the influent was gradually increased to 3 5 during the transition period the reactor was operated at a constant nitrate loading rate of 2 g l reactor d influent nitrate concentration of 400 mg n l and partial pressure of h2 gas between 1 and 1 2 atm after completing the transition to brine feeding conditions with no loss of denitrification capacity the pressurized reactor was subjected to increasing nitrate loading rates by increasing the influent flow rate the influent no3 n remained at 400 mg l as in the previous case with tap water amended with nitrate the partial pressure of hydrogen gas was increased in order to maintain low nitrate effluent concentrations as the nitrate loading rate was increased under increased nitrate loads the reactor demonstrated high removal rates of 5 7 g n l reactor d with effluent no3 n under the standard of 10 mg l except at the highest nitrate removal rate 17 0 mg l as in the case of feeding solution based on freshwater water fig 6 3 6 microbial diversity under groundwater and brine conditions the microbial diversity in the pressurized hydrogenotrophic was characterized by ngs new generation sequencing during four different periods 1 reactor inoculation 2 after startup at neutral ph and low influent nitrate concentrations 3 during freshwater operation at high influent nitrate concentrations and ph 8 7 and 4 during the transition from freshwater to brine water conditions at high influent nitrate concentrations and ph 8 7 the inoculum for the bioreactor originated from a laboratory scale pressurized hydrogenotrophic denitrification reactor operating at low influent nitrate concentrations of up to 25 mg l no3 n groundwater and neutral ph of 7 0 7 5 table 2 summarizes the results a significant change in the dominant bacterial genera was observed mainly from dechloromonas and zoogloea as the main denitrifiers at inoculation and after startup to thauera during the course of operation with high nitrate concentrations the main reason for the major shift in bacterial population was the change in operating ph from neutral ph during startup to ph 8 7 due to increased inorganic carbon required under conditions of high influent nitrate concentrations interestingly during the transition from freshwater groundwater low salt conditions to brine no significant change in the microbial population was observed thauera genus continued to dominate the thauera genus has been reported in the literature for hydrogenotrophic denitrification at high ph 40 it can be concluded that the ph effect on microbial diversity is much stronger than the effect of salt concentration from close to zero at reactor inoculum to almost 90 after 20 months of reactor operation 4 conclusions a pressurized hydrogenotrophic denitrification system designed to operate under high influent nitrate concentrations was designed and successfully operated purging of nitrogen gas build up in the reactor s head space was avoided by integrating an external degassing unit to the main reactor via liquid recirculation the system was able to maintain steady state conditions at low external recirculation rates and low total pressures while achieving high denitrifying rates nitrate removal and hydrogen utilization efficiency using groundwater or brine as feed water in comparison to predicted values calculated based on equilibrium using henry s law significantly lower partial pressures or recirculation flow rates were necessary to achieve steady state conditions due to high levels of n2 super saturation in the liquid phase declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements this study was supported by the kamin program of the
