4895,identifying floods and producing flood susceptibility maps are crucial steps for decision makers to prevent and manage disasters plenty of studies have used machine learning models to produce reliable susceptibility maps nevertheless most research ignores the importance of developing appropriate feature engineering methods in this study we propose a local spatial sequential long short term memory neural network lss lstm for flood susceptibility prediction in shangyou county china the three main contributions of this study are summarized below first of all it is a new perspective to use the deep learning technique of lstm for flood susceptibility prediction second we integrate an appropriate feature engineering method with lstm to predict flood susceptibility third we implement two optimization techniques of data augmentation and batch normalization to further improve the performance of the proposed method the lss lstm method can not only capture the attribution information of flood conditioning factors and the local spatial information of flood data but also has powerful sequential modelling capabilities to deal with the spatial relationship of floods the experimental results demonstrate that the lss lstm method achieves satisfactory prediction performance 93 75 and 0 965 in terms of accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic roc curve keywords flood susceptibility prediction long short term memory neural network deep learning feature engineering 1 introduction floods are one of the most common and catastrophic natural hazards in the world giovannettone et al 2018 according to the united nations office for disaster risk reduction 150 016 floods occurred between 1996 and 2015 severely affecting natural systems and human activities hong et al 2018a flood susceptibility refers to the possibility of flooding in a certain area based on a series of geo environmental conditions ahmadlou et al 2018 bui et al 2019b flood susceptibility prediction fsp can provide helpful guidance for decision makers to effectively manage and prevent flood hazards therefore producing reliable and accurate susceptibility maps is important in flood prone areas in recent years machine learning techniques for fsp have demonstrated powerful features and achieved successful results including decision trees bui et al 2019c choubin et al 2019 khosravi et al 2018 support vector machine choubin et al 2019 tehrany et al 2014 random forest chapi et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 and artificial neural network campolo et al 2003 gebrehiwot et al 2019 recently some studies have tried to use hybrid strategies to obtain more powerful fsp models for example subsampling and bootstrapping algorithms were combined with machine learning models to predict flood susceptibility dodangeh et al 2020 researchers integrated the frequency ratio and logistic regression model for fsp costache et al 2020b reduced error pruning tree models were integrated with bagging and random subspace ensemble strategies chen et al 2019 in addition some researchers used meta heuristic optimization algorithms to find the optimal parameters of intelligence models ahmadlou et al 2018 bui et al 2019a 2019b wang et al 2019c these methods use different strategies to capture flood occurrence characteristics from the existing background information and then predict unknown flood locations feature engineering is an essential step in machine learning it uses the domain knowledge of the data to create features that make the model work better turner et al 1999 in fsp feature engineering can convert the original flood data into specific data representations so as to better describe the susceptibility prediction task as a predictive model this operation determines the processing perspective of the flood susceptibility model when faced with flood data therefore it is very important to develop an appropriate feature engineering method for machine learning models to better understand and learn information about flood occurrence in general when using machine learning methods for fsp feature engineering methods based on one dimensional vectors are widely used due to its convenience in operation chapi et al 2017 khosravi et al 2019 wang et al 2019b this method converts the original flood data into a set of one dimensional feature vectors specifically the entire study area is first converted into a raster format with a specified spatial resolution then flood susceptibility prediction can be regarded as a binary classification process to distinguish whether the grid cell pixel in the study area will suffer flood disasters each grid cell is composed of a set of feature values flood conditioning factors therefore machine learning methods can predict flood susceptibility by learning these feature vectors however there will be some drawbacks when using the aforementioned fsp machine learning methods first the standard guidelines of feature engineering for flood data are still controversial secondly various machine learning models have their own feature learning characteristics and proper feature engineering methods can maximize the classification capabilities of these models zheng and casari 2018 however few studies aim to explore feature engineering methods for specific models for fsp therefore it is crucial to develop appropriate feature engineering methods for specific prediction models to achieve reliable flood susceptibility maps in the past few years deep learning techniques have achieved encouraging results in many fields such as pattern recognition hu et al 2015 scene annotation zhou et al 2014 and natural language processing collobert and weston 2008 recently several deep learning techniques have been successfully used for disaster susceptibility prediction such as convolutional neural network fang et al 2020a 2020b sameen et al 2019 wang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019 recurrent neural network rnn wang et al 2020b fully connected sparse autoencoder neural network huang et al 2019 and deep neural network bui et al 2020 2019d among these incredible techniques rnn has attracted great interest because it can periodically capture sequential data by using a special recurrent hidden unit lecun et al 2015 however conventional rnn has the problems of gradient vanishing and exploding and it is difficult to solve the long term sequential input problem bengio et al 1994 to tackle the above problems an improved long short term memory neural network lstm rnn is proposed compared with conventional rnns it has better performance in solving sequence tasks hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 ma et al 2015 in particular lstm has been used for flood forecasting and has achieved impressive results le et al 2019 liu et al 2018 however the application of lstm in regional flood susceptibility analysis is still very few in addition in our previous study wang et al 2020a we found that incorporating spatial information into the flood susceptibility model can improve the accuracy of prediction but there is still redundant spatial information in the local space the special forget mechanism of the lstm structure can remember key information and discard useless information which can solve the above problems to a certain extent sak et al 2014 in this study we propose a local spatial sequential long short term memory neural network lss lstm for fsp in shangyou county china the three main contributions of this study are outlined below first it is a new perspective to use the deep learning technique of lstm as a classifier for fsp second we combine an appropriate feature engineering method with lstm to convert the original flood data into spatial sequences third we implement two powerful optimization techniques of data augmentation and batch normalization to further improve the performance of the lss lstm method based on these contributions the lss lstm method can not only capture the attribution information of flood conditioning factors and the local spatial information of flood data but also has powerful sequential modelling capability to deal with the spatial relationship of floods 2 study area and available data 2 1 study area shangyou county is located in the southern part of jiangxi province with an area of about 1543 km2 between 25 42 n to 26 01 n and 114 00 e to 114 40 e the altitude of the study area is between 110 m and 1901 m above sea level fig 1 shangyou county is located in the hilly area in the middle of luoxiao mountains the northeast northwest and southwest of the county are mountains and the southeast is hills and valley basins the altitude of the low hills is 200 m above sea level and the relative altitude is 50 m shangyou county slopes from northwest to southeast and hills and valleys are mainly distributed in the southeast of the area meanwhile approximately 90 of the natural land is covered by vegetation including grass and forest and agricultural land only accounts for 6 the geological structure of shangyou county is diverse and complex this area is located in the uplift belt of the southern section of the cathaysia plate straddling the luoxiao zhuguang uplift and the yushan uplift the study area has frequent magmatic activity is and strong structural deformation the faults are most developed in the northwest and northeast neotectonic movement is not obvious mainly intermittent uplift the exposed strata are mainly sinian cambrian ordovician devonian carboniferous cretaceous and quaternary the magmatic rocks are dominated by caledonian and yanshanian granites the main types of rock are metamorphic rocks and magmatic rocks the rock mass is highly weathered and has fissures from a climate perspective this county belongs to the humid monsoon climate zone in the subtropical hilly region from 1959 to 2014 the annual average temperature and sunshine duration were 18 6 and 1708 3 h respectively and the average annual precipitation was between 933 7 and 2147 6 mm in general shangyou county has abundant precipitation and extreme climatic conditions and floods often occur after heavy rainfall 2 2 flood inventory map producing a reliable flood inventory map is a crucial step in flood susceptibility assessment gebrehiwot et al 2019 termeh et al 2018 the map provides detailed location information of the flooded area in fact flood events are always polygons in the study area to show the spatial distribution of floods the practice that floods are represented as points has been used in previous publications diakakis et al 2012 salvati et al 2010 when modelling the flood susceptibility in a specific area there is no need to use entire polygons in this study the flooded areas were identified by collecting previous records extensive field surveys and unmanned aerial vehicle data the flooded area contains four flood events that occurred from july 26 to 29 2006 then we collected 108 historical flood locations from flood polygons to construct a flood inventory map all available data came from the jiangxi meteorological bureau 1 http jx cma gov cn 1 and the department of civil affairs of jiangxi province 2 http www jxmzw gov cn 2 since there is no direct access to non flood points in this study area we have no standard guide to select accurate non flood data therefore we randomly selected the same number of non flood points 108 from areas without floods this is a simple and universal sampling process widely used in previous studies bui et al 2019a chen et al 2019 costache et al 2020a the distribution of flood and non flood points is presented in fig 1 2 3 flood conditioning factors since flooding is triggered by a variety of environmental factors it can ensure the reliability and accuracy of fsp results by choosing appropriate conditioning factors bui et al 2020 chapi et al 2017 in this study we mainly selected flood conditioning factors based on previous studies and expert knowledge for example flat areas are likely to flood as water flows down from higher terrain li et al 2012 as for shangyou county areas with lower heights and slopes are more prone to river floods the curvature indicates the degree of deformation of the inclined surface hudson and kesel 2000 concluded that areas with curvature values between 1 and 2 are prone to flooding aspect is another key factor as windward slopes are prone to precipitation aspect is related to the intensity of solar radiation which affects the surface vegetation and soil moisture soil type reflects water permeability and water storage capacity and directly affects the drainage process chapi et al 2017 choubin et al 2019 heitmuller et al 2015 concluded that lithology determines the shape of the river channel and affects the development of the floodplain in addition lithology affects the formation of soil characteristics to a certain extent tehrany et al 2019 zazo et al 2018 the distance of the river factor is chosen because the river network is the main route for flood discharge and expansion shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 different types of land use directly or indirectly affect water infiltration and evapotranspiration bui et al 2019b giovannettone et al 2018 tiwari et al 2016 the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi shows the density of surface vegetation cover and huang et al 2012 studied the relationship between ndvi and floods furthermore areas with sparse vegetation are very likely to be flooded due to poor water storage capacity caprario and finotti 2019 ndvi is defined as follows 1 ndvi r nir r r r nir r r where r nir and r r are the spectral reflectance of the near infrared band and the red band in the electromagnetic spectrum respectively the reason for choosing the annual average precipitation factor is that the floods in shangyou county mostly occur during or after heavy rainfall the stream power index spi reflects the erosive power of current which affects the stability of the terrain fuller 2008 studied the relationship between geomorphic conditions and floods and claimed that high stream power can lead to catastrophic channel variation the sediment transport index sti factor has been widely used in flood susceptibility analysis chapi et al 2017 chen et al 2019 tehrany et al 2019 sti represents the influence of terrain on erosion and reflects the intensity of sediment movement caused by water movement werner et al 2005 in addition billi 2011 concluded that the mobility of sediment transport can increase the frequency of floods the factors of spi and sti are calculated as follows moore et al 1993 moore and wilson 1992 2 spi a s tan β 3 sti a s 22 13 0 6 sin β 0 0896 1 3 where a s and β represent the area of the basin and the slope gradient respectively the topographic wetness index twi describes soil saturation associated with water accumulation in the basin mahmoud and gan 2018 tehrany et al 2015 the calculation method of the twi factor is as follows beven and kirkby 1979 4 twi ln α tan β where α is the upslope area per unit contour length and β represents the slope angle as mentioned previously we considered 13 flood conditioning factors for fsp in this study based on theoretical analysis and literature review fig 2 table 1 lists the relevant information for all factors it should be noted that the dem data was acquired from aster advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer gdem version 2 3 http gdem ersdac jspacesystems or jp 3 with a spatial resolution of 30 30 m 3 methodology 3 1 data preparation data preparation is an essential step before performing flood susceptibility modelling we used arcgis software to calculate the factors of altitude aspect curvature and slope from dem data extract the river network from the topographic map and calculate the distance to rivers factor by using the euclidean tool the land use factor came from landsat 7 etm satellite imagery and the classification accuracy was 85 by using the conventional maximum likelihood algorithm this classification algorithm has excellent performance in land use classification tasks paola and schowengerdt 1995 we calculated the ndvi factor from the satellite image using envi software and the factors of spi sti and twi based on dem data by using saga software first data of different scale were vectorized on the arcgis platform then we extracted specific flood conditioning factors from these vector data and converted them into raster form all factors were converted to a raster format with 30 m spatial resolution which is consistent with the dem data these factors have also been reclassified into different categories based on previous studies expert knowledge and flood spatial distribution characteristics costache et al 2020a khosravi et al 2019 sameen et al 2019 in this study 70 flood and non flood locations 76 and 76 were randomly selected for training models while the remaining 30 of flood and non flood locations 32 and 32 were used to construct the test set 3 2 information gain ratio to analyze the relationship between flood conditioning factors and flood occurrence the information gain ratio igr method is used to evaluate the importance of flood conditioning factors the igr method is a commonly used feature selection method and has been widely used in flood susceptibility analysis bui et al 2020 chapi et al 2017 khosravi et al 2019 assuming that the training set s contains n classes the expected information is calculated as follows 5 h s i 1 n p i log 2 p i where p i is the probability that a sample belongs to class c i the factor a has m values and its average entropy is calculated as follows 6 e a i 1 m p i h s the split information value represents the potential information obtained by dividing s into m parts corresponding to m results on the attribute a and can be calculated as follows 7 splitinf o a s i 1 m x i s i s log 2 s i s finally the variable importance value vi is defined as follows 8 v i a h s e a splitinf o a s factors with higher vi values are more important for prediction models if these values are equal to 0 it can be considered that the corresponding factors have no contribution to flood occurrence and should be removed from flood susceptibility modelling 3 3 rnn and lstm neural network as a type of artificial neural network rnn has achieved great success in the fields involving sequential data analysis choi et al 2017 ma et al 2015 mou et al 2017 from the graphic structure of the regular rnn shown in fig 3 we can see that the rnn can store information of the previous hidden state and apply it to the output together with the current input in this way rnns can capture dynamic representations from sequential data by using a specific recurrent hidden state lecun et al 2015 lstm is a special type of rnn designed to capture the long term dependence of sequential data hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the lstm network consists of an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer and its structure is similar to rnn but the difference between rnn and lstm is that the latter replaces the basic unit of the regular rnn with a memory block graves et al 2013 as shown in fig 4 the memory block contains three gate functions that play different roles in information flow process let x x 1 x 2 x n be a sequential input and y y 1 y 2 y n denotes the output sequence the forget gate is a key state that determines whether the current information should be forgotten or remembered for a certain time step t it can be calculated as follows 9 f t σ w fx x t w fh h t 1 b f where w fx and w fh are the forget weight matrix and the forget hidden weight matrix respectively b f is the bias of the forget gate and σ is the sigmoid function the input gate i t determines the information updating and c t memorizes the new information and they are defined as follows 10 i t σ w ix x t w ih h t 1 b i 11 c t tanh w cx x t w ch h t 1 b c where w ix and w ch denote the weight matrix b i and b c are the bias vectors of the input gate and the updating cell state respectively then the new memory cell state c t is updated as follows 12 c t f t c t 1 i t c t where c t 1 is the previous memory cell state and represents the element wise product finally the output gate controls the output activations the hidden layer sent to next time step is defined as follows 13 h t o t tanh c t 14 o t σ w ox x t w oh h t 1 b o where w ox is the output weight matrix w oh is the output hidden weight matrix and b o is the bias of the output gate 3 4 modelling process of lss lstm the proposed lss lstm method mainly consists of three steps layer stacking feature engineering and lstm construction as illustrated in fig 5 in the layer stacking step each flood conditioning factor can be viewed as a single band image of size 2156 1722 and all the conditioning factor layers are stacked together to form a multi band image in the feature engineering step we produce each image patch pixel by pixel from the multi band image as shown in the fig 5 b each central pixel and its neighboring pixels in a 3 3 window are first extracted and then the resultant image patch has a size of 3 3 13 and consists of 9 vectors image patches contain the characteristics and the spatial information of the factors then these vectors are sorted according to spatial continuity to construct sequential data with a size of 9 13 in the lstm construction step the lstm structure is constructed to possess these extracted sequential data the sorted vectors are gradually sent to the lstm architecture and the results are output only at the final time step as far as we know flood events are not only related to their morphological geological and hydrological conditions but also related to the neighboring environment information giovannettone et al 2018 sampson et al 2015 according to the inherent properties of lstm mentioned previously useful information of previous vectors useful for flood prediction can be stored and passed to subsequent hidden layer states irrelevant information and redundant information will be discarded by using the forget gate of lstm in the final time step all important information is aggregated and contribute to flood susceptibility analysis 3 5 model optimization over fitting is a common problem in applying deep learning methods schmidhuber 2015 specifically over fitting occurs when the learning model is closely fitted to the training data and causes a negative impact on predicting new data in this study two optimization techniques of data augmentation and batch normalization are used to solve the problem of over fitting in the modelling process 3 5 1 data augmentation since it is difficult to obtain sufficient flood samples for model construction the data augmentation technique is used to increase the number of training samples which can improve the generalization ability of the prediction model in general the training set can be augmented by rotating and flipping each extracted image patch fig 6 shows seven types of transformations of image patches with capital letter f during the augmentation process we can obtain 4 different samples by rotating the image patch by 90 180 and 270 including the image patch itself and obtain four new samples by flipping the four image patches in the horizontal direction finally the training set can be increased by 8 times for example the original training set in this study contains 152 samples after the data augmentation procedure the final training set used for lss lstm modelling includes 1216 samples 3 5 2 batch normalization batch normalization can normalize the neural network layer by adjusting and scaling activations which can improve the generalization ability and convergence speed of the model ioffe and szegedy 2015 we conduct this technique to fix the mean and variance of the layer input in the training process of the lss lstm method the training data is sent to the neural network in batches for one of the batches b with m samples the mean and variance are first calculated as follows 15 μ b 1 m i 1 m x i 16 σ 2 1 m i 1 m x i μ b 2 then each sample is separately normalized as follows 17 x i x i μ b σ b 2 ε i 1 2 m where ε is a very small constant for numerical stability next the normalized values are scaled and shifted by a pair of parameters that are calculated as follows 18 y i γ x i β i 1 2 m where γ and β are learnt in the subsequent optimization process finally the output of the batch normalization transformation is passed to the neural network layer 3 6 model evaluation criteria model evaluation is a crucial step in assessing the effectiveness of various fsp methods ahmadlou et al 2018 wang et al 2019c in this study the receiver operating characteristic roc curve that plots sensitivity and 1 specificity on y axis and x axis respectively and the area under roc auc is used for evaluation the auc value ranges from 0 to 1 and the higher the value the better the model performance in addition several statistical criteria shown in table 2 are also used to assess the performance of the fsp model 4 results and discussion 4 1 relationship analysis between conditioning factors and flood occurrence the vi values of different flood conditioning factors are shown in fig 7 all factors have a positive impact on the occurrence of floods specifically the highest and lowest vi values of slope and aspect are 0 2929 and 0 0142 respectively this is because river flood disasters usually occur on flat terrain with low slopes in addition other studies have confirmed similar observations bui et al 2020 chen et al 2019 termeh et al 2018 to further explore the relationship between the conditioning factors and the occurrence of floods we calculated the frequency ratio fr values of various factors fr can measure the likelihood of flooding in the area corresponding to each category of a conditioning factor the fr value is calculated based on the ratio of flood percentage to the domain percentage in a specific class arabameri et al 2019 tehrany et al 2015 the higher the fr value the more prone to flooding in the corresponding area termeh et al 2018 fig 8 shows the fr values of different conditioning factors please refer to table a1 in appendix for details as for the altitude factor the fr value of areas with an altitude of 300 m is higher than that of other areas and 89 81 of historical floods occurred in the corresponding areas this observation is related to our previous analysis that flat areas are more prone to flooding furthermore our results are relevant to other studies arabameri et al 2019 shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 as far as the aspect factor the fr value of the flat class is the highest 3 54 however since the flat class has almost no grid cells and floods this class has no guiding significance for floods meanwhile the fr values of other classes are closer indicating that the relationship between the aspect factor and flood occurrence is weak this observation can also explain why the vi value of aspect obtained using the igr method is the lowest the region with a curvature value between 1 and 1 has the highest fr value the corresponding area is determined to be a flat area accounting for 74 07 of the historical flood locations the distance to river factor is critical because rivers are the main channels for flood drainage and expansion bui et al 2019d from fig 8 we can find that the fr value decreases as distance to rivers increases also the fr value of this class with a distance of 0 and 200 m from the river is much higher than other classes and the corresponding area accounts for 92 59 of the historical flood locations therefore the distance to rivers factor is the second most important variable according to the results of the igr method land use is another important factor in flooding among these categories grassland areas have the highest percentage of flooding 83 33 because grasslands are usually located in flat areas moreover no floods have occurred in forest areas because these area has strong water storage capacity and can mitigate flood disasters caprario and finotti 2019 chapi et al 2017 for lithology the fr value of class i is the highest at 1 61 while the fr value of class a is 0 this is because the area of class a is mainly composed of dolomite and the drainage density is low so the possibility of flooding is low for ndvi the fr value decreases as the ndvi value increases the higher the ndvi value the better the vegetation growth conditions as a result vegetation areas can store large amounts of water and reduce the possibility of flooding regarding the rainfall factor all classes except the lowest rainfall class obtained high fr values other studied have also confirmed that heavy rainfall will increase the likelihood of flooding giovannettone et al 2018 rahmati et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 the region with a slope 10 has the highest fr value and other regions have an fr value close to zero it can be found that flat terrain is more prone to flooding as far as soil is concerned ach and atc have higher fr values of 3 91 and 1 18 than other soil types a number of studies have confirmed that soil is related to the occurrence of flooding because soil type directly determines soil permeability and structure gonzález arqueros et al 2018 tehrany et al 2014 2015 the spi value 200 has the highest fr value of 1 51 and the spi value between 25 and 50 has the lowest fr value of 0 32 for the sti factor the class to the spi value 10 has the highest fr value of 1 50 and the corresponding area accounts for 73 15 of the historical flood locations this observation is consistent with previous studies namely low sti causes high flooding potential hong et al 2018b tehrany et al 2019 for the twi factor the fr value increases as the twi value increases because a higher twi value indicates a higher water storage level which is also consistent with other studies chapi et al 2017 shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 tehrany et al 2015 in this study we extracted flood conditioning factors from different sources and screened factors based on the above relationship analysis the quality of the data source is important for flood susceptibility modelling aster gdem products are freely available and easily accessible and have been widely used to extract flood conditioning factors in many studies iosub et al 2020 khosravi et al 2019 tien bui et al 2019 moreover some advanced dem products such as shuttle radar topography mission srtm dem and multi error removed improved terrain merit dem have higher accuracy than aster gdem in hydrological analysis therefore it is necessary to discuss the impact of different advanced dem data for flood susceptibility modelling in addition we should note that there is a temporal mismatch between flood occurrence and flood conditioning factors generally lithology and soil can be regarded as constant factors and may not change over time however dem land use and ndvi will be affected by major changes seasonally or over a period of decades even within the same year certain flood conditioning factors may change significantly this is an important widespread and difficult problem in fsp most researchers treat flood conditioning factors as constant variables and ignore temporal mismatch bui et al 2019d chapi et al 2017 giovannettone et al 2018 moreover roy et al 2020 discussed flood susceptibility results based on multi temporal land use and rainfall factors in the future it will be necessary to dynamically analyze the flood susceptibility with different temporal factors 4 2 model performance in the lss lstm modelling process the training strategy and hyperparameter settings have a significant impact on the model performance the purpose of the training process is to minimize the loss value and iteratively update the parameters using a specific optimization method as shown in fig 9 the loss value of training and validation data gradually decreases as the epoch increases indicating that the training process is satisfactory in this study all the hyperparameters used in the lss lstm method were optimized using the grid search method based on the five fold cross validation procedure table 3 lists the search space and optimized results the final network architecture of the lss lstm model contains an input layer a hidden layer containing 25 lstm cells and a hidden layer moreover a batch normalization layer is added before each activation function layer all experiments were performed using python under the framework of keras 4 https keras io 4 and scikit learn 5 https scikit learn org 5 after modelling we used the lss lstm method to predict flood susceptibility table 4 shows the prediction performance the lss lstm method achieved an accuracy of 93 75 which means that the method can effectively distinguish between flood samples and non flood samples in this experiment the flood susceptibility model is used to predict the probability of flooding in a given area therefore it is necessary to accurately predict the flood area and higher accuracy values are critical to our results in addition another key point is that the flood model cannot miss any potential flood areas this is because if we fail to find areas where floods may occur the prevention and management of that area may be ignored which may cause devastating damage to society therefore sensitivity is an important indicator in the fsp field the results show that the lss lstm method achieves a very high sensitivity value of 96 67 which indicates that the model can find almost all potential flood locations fig 10 shows the roc curve using the test set as mentioned in previous studies arabameri et al 2019 kanani sadat et al 2019 an auc value 0 9 is a good predictive result therefore the proposed lss lstm method obtains relative good prediction performance with an auc value of 0 965 in our experiment we calculated the susceptibility index of 1 714 419 grid cells in the study area to build a flood susceptibility map all susceptibility indices were sorted in ascending order and divided into five classes using the natural jenks breaks method chapi et al 2017 shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 tehrany et al 2019 fig 11 shows the final flood susceptibility map obtained by the proposed lss lstm method most of the floods are located in very high and high susceptible zones which are mainly located in the east and south of the study area with low altitude and slope and close to rivers the sub region a in the susceptibility map is the location of shangyoujiang reservoir and the sub region b is close to the shangyou river which is the main tributary of the gangjiang river system in the yangtze river basin to quantitatively analyze the resultant susceptibility map the flood density fd index that is the percentage of flood pixels pfp divides by the percentage of susceptible class pixels psp was used for evaluation as shown in table 5 the very high susceptibility class achieved the highest fd value of 13 39 followed by the classes of high 2 99 and moderate 0 29 meanwhile no flood occurred in very low and low susceptible areas indicating that the flood susceptibility map is reliable in the low susceptible area it is also very illuminating for management making it easier for people to focus on these high susceptible areas in addition the obtained flood density distribution trend is of completely consistent with several previous studies bui et al 2020 shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 termeh et al 2018 4 3 model sensitivity analysis generally the results of a robust flood susceptibility model should not change much if the input data changes within a reasonable range to effectively prove that the prediction results of the lss lstm method are universal not accidental this study analysed two random manipulations that occurred during the lss lstm modelling process to measure the sensitivity of the model for the first random manipulation we randomly selected the training and test sets 10 times therefore a total of 10 lss lstm models were constructed for evaluation table 6 reports the results of several evaluation criteria executed 10 times for the proposed method all the evaluation criteria demonstrate stable and reasonable fluctuations for example the mean and standard deviation std of auc are 0 958 and 0 016 and those of acc are 91 95 and 2 06 respectively in summary the results show that the proposed method is not sensitive to the randomness of the training test splitting process and is robust to flood susceptibility analysis for the second random manipulation we randomly changed the stacking order of conditioning factors for 10 times when all the conditioning factors were stacked together as shown in fig 5 a table 7 shows the results of lss lstm performed 10 times all the evaluation criteria have a reasonable fluctuations for example the mean and std of auc are 0 958 and 0 011 and those of acc were 92 35 and 1 30 respectively compared with the results of lss lstm with different training test sets table 6 the results of lss lstm with different factor stacking orders fluctuate less the phenomenon indicates that model performance is not very sensitive to changes in the stacking order of factors this is because the modelling samples contain different flood information and each random splitting process may generate a completely new training test set however when we change the stacking order of the conditioning factors in the lss lstm modelling process the total amount of information contained in the factors does not change in addition from the inherent structure of lstm we can know that the network is not sensitive to the order of factors 4 4 model uncertainty analysis to analyze the uncertainty of applying the lss lstm method in fsp we constructed two uncertainty scenarios 10 susceptibility estimates obtained from the lss lstm method with different training test sets and 10 susceptibility estimates obtained from the lss lstm method with different factors stacking orders for convenience we named the above two scenarios as uncertainty scenario a and uncertainty scenario b respectively due to the large amount of statistical calculation cost we first calculated the average of 10 susceptibility estimates for each uncertainty scenario and then arranged them in ascending order next we selected 85 720 grid cells from the average susceptibility estimation based on a systematic sampling with a periodic interval of 20 which can represent the susceptibility value distribution of the study area a comparison between the single susceptibility estimate the same as the fig 11 and the average susceptibility estimate is shown in fig 12 guzzetti et al 2006 compared the mean value of 50 susceptibility estimates and a single susceptibility estimate which proved that the correlation between them is very high peng et al 2014 performed a comparison between the average of five susceptibility estimates and a single susceptibility estimate and obtained a high correlation r 2 0 909 as well as shown in fig 12 the two uncertainty scenarios showed a very high correlation r 2 0 939 and r 2 0 915 between the single susceptibility estimate and the average susceptibility estimate indicating the susceptibility predicted by the lss lstm method is robust in addition in order to quantify the uncertainty of flood prediction methods we used a measure strategy proposed by guzzetti et al 2006 fig 13 plots the mean susceptibility estimate on the x axis against two standard deviations 2std of the susceptibility estimate on the y axis for the two uncertainty scenarios the 2std value increases from very low to moderate susceptibility and then decreases to very high susceptibility specifically the 2std value is relatively low 0 35 for the low and high susceptibility zones which indicates the lss lstm method can achieve stable predictions in these two susceptible zones this conclusion has guiding and important significance because it is necessary to accurately and stably predict the flood location on the other hand minimizing the problem of predicting potential flooded areas as non flooded areas is also important for further hazard management furthermore the scatter distribution shown in fig 13 is sparser for moderate susceptibility indicating that the lss lstm method cannot stably predict whether a grid cell with moderate susceptibility is flooded or non flooded the variation in fig 13 can be fitted by the following equations 19 y 0 964 x 2 0 946 x 0 x 1 r 2 0 616 20 y 1 078 x 2 1 07 x 0 x 1 r 2 0 520 where x is the estimated susceptibility and y denotes the 2std value in this way eq 19 and eq 20 can be used to quantitatively assess the model uncertainty of each grid cell 4 5 hyperparameters sensitivity analysis accurate setting of hyperparameters is essential for flood susceptibility modelling rijal et al 2018 santos et al 2019 especially for constructing deep learning neural networks in this subsection we discuss the impact of three hyperparameters on flood susceptibility analysis in the first experiment we analysed the impact of batch normalization on flood susceptibility thus we compared the results of the lss lstm models optimized with and without batch normalization fig 14 shows the changes in the training and validation accuracy of the two models during the training process the lss lstm method using batch normalization achieved higher training and validation accuracies than those by the lss lstm method without batch normalization indicating that lss lstm can be effectively improved by using batch normalization this is because batch normalization can solve the problem of internal covariate shift in the training process ioffe and szegedy 2015 more specifically the input distribution of each hidden layer in the lss lstm method is converted to a normal distribution which can avoid the vanishing gradient problem and accelerate convergence hence the purpose of improving accuracy and generalization can be achieved in the second experiment we compared the lss lstm models optimized with and without data augmentation in fig 15 the lss lstm method using data augmentation achieved higher training and validation accuracies than those by the lss lstm method without data augmentation the data augmentation method is a simple and convenient trick that can artificially expand the size of the training set some publications have proven its effectiveness in improving generalization ability and application accuracy of deep learning methods in several fields han et al 2018 ma et al 2019 renda et al 2019 in the field of flood susceptibility analysis real flood samples are very limited and the collection of flood samples is very time consuming which may hinder the application of deep learning in this field the results of applying data augmentation in this study demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the prediction ability of lss lstm which can provide reference and help for other researchers to apply deep learning methods in fsp in the third experiment we analyzed the parameter of window size mentioned in section 3 2 it is an important hyperparameter in the lss lstm modelling process fig 16 shows the auc value of the proposed method as the number of window sizes increases during training when this parameter is set to 3 the lss lstm method obtains the highest auc value meanwhile since a larger window size may bring a lot of irrelevant and redundant information the auc value will decrease as the parameter increases from 5 to 11 which will have a negative impact on flood susceptibility prediction 4 6 comparison with state of the art techniques to prove the effectiveness of the lss lstm method we selected three benchmark deep learning techniques for comparison regular deep neural network dnn one dimensional convolutional neural network 1d cnn and three dimensional convolutional neural network 3d cnn the input form of dnn and 1d cnn uses a common one dimensional vector based method and 3d cnn extracts factor information and local spatial information from window patches the implementation details of dnn 1d cnn and 3d cnn can refer to several previous publications bui et al 2020 2019d wang et al 2020a note that the data augmentation method in section 3 5 1 was used in the 3d cnn modelling process in this study table 8 lists the prediction accuracies of these four methods the highest accuracy value of the lss lstm method reached 93 75 followed by 3d cnn 92 19 1d cnn 90 63 and dnn 89 06 moreover 1d cnn obtains the highest sensitivity value of 100 followed by lss lstm 96 67 3d cnn 96 55 and dnn 96 43 the roc curves of the three methods using the test set are shown in fig 17 the lss lstm method has the highest auc value of 0 965 followed by 3d cnn 0 956 1d cnn 0 929 and dnn 0 917 indicating that this method is superior to other flood prediction methods in fact as far as we know the predictive ability of any model has its limitations due to the different morphological and hydrological conditions of a certain study area we cannot be sure that lss lstm can always maintain its superiority in various inundated areas however the application mode of lstm in flood susceptibility analysis can help other researchers to a certain extent moreover the reasons why the lss lstm method has the potential to demonstrate exciting performance can be explained from the following three aspects first as described in section 3 3 lstm is one of the powerful deep learning technique that has achieved reliable results in many fields graves and jaitly 2014 mou et al 2017 sundermeyer et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 second the occurrence of flooding is not spatially independent and is closely related to the adjacent terrain units third the forget gate in lstm can effectively filter out useless information from the input data thereby improving the predictive ability of the model therefore the lss lstm method not only captures the hidden information in flood conditioning factors but also considers local spatial information from the perspective of a specific sequence furthermore as mentioned in section 4 4 the proper selection of window size related to batch normalization and data augmentation techniques can further improve the prediction performance of the lss lstm method analyzing the impact of different training sample sizes is very important for measuring model performance schulz et al 2020 yang et al 2020 to further prove the superiority of the lss lstm method over the other methods we conducted used different training sample sizes to perform sample sensitivity analysis for comparison different proportions ranging from 10 to 90 of the flood historical locations with a step size of 20 were randomly selected as the training samples fig 18 plots the impact of different training samples in the study area on auc when the percentage of training data increases from 30 to 70 the auc value obtained by the lss lstm method is higher than the other three methods the reason for this observation is that the lss lstm method can use sufficient data to learn the best fit function moreover optimization techniques of data augmentation and batch normalization can help avoid over fitting and improve predictive ability note that the lss lstm method cannot achieve higher performance compared with the other three methods that use 10 and 90 training sets since 10 of the training samples cannot provide enough flood information for modelling when the training samples accounts for 90 of the total samples the test sample size is too small therefore results obtained by models that use 10 and 90 training sets cannot accurately reflect the prediction performance of corresponding models 5 conclusions in this study we propose a new lss lstm method to obtain a reliable and accurate flood susceptibility map by integrating an appropriate feature engineering technique with lstm the proposed method can retain the superior sequence modelling ability of lstm and can capture the local spatial information of the flood the main conclusions based on the experimental results can be summarized as follows first the proposed lss lstm method achieved satisfactory prediction performance and its accuracy and auc value were 93 75 and 0 965 respectively second the lss lstm method is insensitive to the randomness of the training test set splitting process and the stacking order of factors third the lss lstm method achieved better results than the benchmark methods of dnn 1d cnn and 3d cnn in terms of several evaluation criteria finally the prediction accuracy of lss lstm can be effectively improved through the two manipulations of data augmentation and batch normalization as a conclusion the proposed lss lstm method can provide inspiration for decision makers to prevent and mitigate flood hazards in the future our research will explore more representative feature engineering methods that can accurately describe flood information for other state of the art models credit

4895,identifying floods and producing flood susceptibility maps are crucial steps for decision makers to prevent and manage disasters plenty of studies have used machine learning models to produce reliable susceptibility maps nevertheless most research ignores the importance of developing appropriate feature engineering methods in this study we propose a local spatial sequential long short term memory neural network lss lstm for flood susceptibility prediction in shangyou county china the three main contributions of this study are summarized below first of all it is a new perspective to use the deep learning technique of lstm for flood susceptibility prediction second we integrate an appropriate feature engineering method with lstm to predict flood susceptibility third we implement two optimization techniques of data augmentation and batch normalization to further improve the performance of the proposed method the lss lstm method can not only capture the attribution information of flood conditioning factors and the local spatial information of flood data but also has powerful sequential modelling capabilities to deal with the spatial relationship of floods the experimental results demonstrate that the lss lstm method achieves satisfactory prediction performance 93 75 and 0 965 in terms of accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic roc curve keywords flood susceptibility prediction long short term memory neural network deep learning feature engineering 1 introduction floods are one of the most common and catastrophic natural hazards in the world giovannettone et al 2018 according to the united nations office for disaster risk reduction 150 016 floods occurred between 1996 and 2015 severely affecting natural systems and human activities hong et al 2018a flood susceptibility refers to the possibility of flooding in a certain area based on a series of geo environmental conditions ahmadlou et al 2018 bui et al 2019b flood susceptibility prediction fsp can provide helpful guidance for decision makers to effectively manage and prevent flood hazards therefore producing reliable and accurate susceptibility maps is important in flood prone areas in recent years machine learning techniques for fsp have demonstrated powerful features and achieved successful results including decision trees bui et al 2019c choubin et al 2019 khosravi et al 2018 support vector machine choubin et al 2019 tehrany et al 2014 random forest chapi et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 and artificial neural network campolo et al 2003 gebrehiwot et al 2019 recently some studies have tried to use hybrid strategies to obtain more powerful fsp models for example subsampling and bootstrapping algorithms were combined with machine learning models to predict flood susceptibility dodangeh et al 2020 researchers integrated the frequency ratio and logistic regression model for fsp costache et al 2020b reduced error pruning tree models were integrated with bagging and random subspace ensemble strategies chen et al 2019 in addition some researchers used meta heuristic optimization algorithms to find the optimal parameters of intelligence models ahmadlou et al 2018 bui et al 2019a 2019b wang et al 2019c these methods use different strategies to capture flood occurrence characteristics from the existing background information and then predict unknown flood locations feature engineering is an essential step in machine learning it uses the domain knowledge of the data to create features that make the model work better turner et al 1999 in fsp feature engineering can convert the original flood data into specific data representations so as to better describe the susceptibility prediction task as a predictive model this operation determines the processing perspective of the flood susceptibility model when faced with flood data therefore it is very important to develop an appropriate feature engineering method for machine learning models to better understand and learn information about flood occurrence in general when using machine learning methods for fsp feature engineering methods based on one dimensional vectors are widely used due to its convenience in operation chapi et al 2017 khosravi et al 2019 wang et al 2019b this method converts the original flood data into a set of one dimensional feature vectors specifically the entire study area is first converted into a raster format with a specified spatial resolution then flood susceptibility prediction can be regarded as a binary classification process to distinguish whether the grid cell pixel in the study area will suffer flood disasters each grid cell is composed of a set of feature values flood conditioning factors therefore machine learning methods can predict flood susceptibility by learning these feature vectors however there will be some drawbacks when using the aforementioned fsp machine learning methods first the standard guidelines of feature engineering for flood data are still controversial secondly various machine learning models have their own feature learning characteristics and proper feature engineering methods can maximize the classification capabilities of these models zheng and casari 2018 however few studies aim to explore feature engineering methods for specific models for fsp therefore it is crucial to develop appropriate feature engineering methods for specific prediction models to achieve reliable flood susceptibility maps in the past few years deep learning techniques have achieved encouraging results in many fields such as pattern recognition hu et al 2015 scene annotation zhou et al 2014 and natural language processing collobert and weston 2008 recently several deep learning techniques have been successfully used for disaster susceptibility prediction such as convolutional neural network fang et al 2020a 2020b sameen et al 2019 wang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019 recurrent neural network rnn wang et al 2020b fully connected sparse autoencoder neural network huang et al 2019 and deep neural network bui et al 2020 2019d among these incredible techniques rnn has attracted great interest because it can periodically capture sequential data by using a special recurrent hidden unit lecun et al 2015 however conventional rnn has the problems of gradient vanishing and exploding and it is difficult to solve the long term sequential input problem bengio et al 1994 to tackle the above problems an improved long short term memory neural network lstm rnn is proposed compared with conventional rnns it has better performance in solving sequence tasks hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 ma et al 2015 in particular lstm has been used for flood forecasting and has achieved impressive results le et al 2019 liu et al 2018 however the application of lstm in regional flood susceptibility analysis is still very few in addition in our previous study wang et al 2020a we found that incorporating spatial information into the flood susceptibility model can improve the accuracy of prediction but there is still redundant spatial information in the local space the special forget mechanism of the lstm structure can remember key information and discard useless information which can solve the above problems to a certain extent sak et al 2014 in this study we propose a local spatial sequential long short term memory neural network lss lstm for fsp in shangyou county china the three main contributions of this study are outlined below first it is a new perspective to use the deep learning technique of lstm as a classifier for fsp second we combine an appropriate feature engineering method with lstm to convert the original flood data into spatial sequences third we implement two powerful optimization techniques of data augmentation and batch normalization to further improve the performance of the lss lstm method based on these contributions the lss lstm method can not only capture the attribution information of flood conditioning factors and the local spatial information of flood data but also has powerful sequential modelling capability to deal with the spatial relationship of floods 2 study area and available data 2 1 study area shangyou county is located in the southern part of jiangxi province with an area of about 1543 km2 between 25 42 n to 26 01 n and 114 00 e to 114 40 e the altitude of the study area is between 110 m and 1901 m above sea level fig 1 shangyou county is located in the hilly area in the middle of luoxiao mountains the northeast northwest and southwest of the county are mountains and the southeast is hills and valley basins the altitude of the low hills is 200 m above sea level and the relative altitude is 50 m shangyou county slopes from northwest to southeast and hills and valleys are mainly distributed in the southeast of the area meanwhile approximately 90 of the natural land is covered by vegetation including grass and forest and agricultural land only accounts for 6 the geological structure of shangyou county is diverse and complex this area is located in the uplift belt of the southern section of the cathaysia plate straddling the luoxiao zhuguang uplift and the yushan uplift the study area has frequent magmatic activity is and strong structural deformation the faults are most developed in the northwest and northeast neotectonic movement is not obvious mainly intermittent uplift the exposed strata are mainly sinian cambrian ordovician devonian carboniferous cretaceous and quaternary the magmatic rocks are dominated by caledonian and yanshanian granites the main types of rock are metamorphic rocks and magmatic rocks the rock mass is highly weathered and has fissures from a climate perspective this county belongs to the humid monsoon climate zone in the subtropical hilly region from 1959 to 2014 the annual average temperature and sunshine duration were 18 6 and 1708 3 h respectively and the average annual precipitation was between 933 7 and 2147 6 mm in general shangyou county has abundant precipitation and extreme climatic conditions and floods often occur after heavy rainfall 2 2 flood inventory map producing a reliable flood inventory map is a crucial step in flood susceptibility assessment gebrehiwot et al 2019 termeh et al 2018 the map provides detailed location information of the flooded area in fact flood events are always polygons in the study area to show the spatial distribution of floods the practice that floods are represented as points has been used in previous publications diakakis et al 2012 salvati et al 2010 when modelling the flood susceptibility in a specific area there is no need to use entire polygons in this study the flooded areas were identified by collecting previous records extensive field surveys and unmanned aerial vehicle data the flooded area contains four flood events that occurred from july 26 to 29 2006 then we collected 108 historical flood locations from flood polygons to construct a flood inventory map all available data came from the jiangxi meteorological bureau 1 http jx cma gov cn 1 and the department of civil affairs of jiangxi province 2 http www jxmzw gov cn 2 since there is no direct access to non flood points in this study area we have no standard guide to select accurate non flood data therefore we randomly selected the same number of non flood points 108 from areas without floods this is a simple and universal sampling process widely used in previous studies bui et al 2019a chen et al 2019 costache et al 2020a the distribution of flood and non flood points is presented in fig 1 2 3 flood conditioning factors since flooding is triggered by a variety of environmental factors it can ensure the reliability and accuracy of fsp results by choosing appropriate conditioning factors bui et al 2020 chapi et al 2017 in this study we mainly selected flood conditioning factors based on previous studies and expert knowledge for example flat areas are likely to flood as water flows down from higher terrain li et al 2012 as for shangyou county areas with lower heights and slopes are more prone to river floods the curvature indicates the degree of deformation of the inclined surface hudson and kesel 2000 concluded that areas with curvature values between 1 and 2 are prone to flooding aspect is another key factor as windward slopes are prone to precipitation aspect is related to the intensity of solar radiation which affects the surface vegetation and soil moisture soil type reflects water permeability and water storage capacity and directly affects the drainage process chapi et al 2017 choubin et al 2019 heitmuller et al 2015 concluded that lithology determines the shape of the river channel and affects the development of the floodplain in addition lithology affects the formation of soil characteristics to a certain extent tehrany et al 2019 zazo et al 2018 the distance of the river factor is chosen because the river network is the main route for flood discharge and expansion shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 different types of land use directly or indirectly affect water infiltration and evapotranspiration bui et al 2019b giovannettone et al 2018 tiwari et al 2016 the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi shows the density of surface vegetation cover and huang et al 2012 studied the relationship between ndvi and floods furthermore areas with sparse vegetation are very likely to be flooded due to poor water storage capacity caprario and finotti 2019 ndvi is defined as follows 1 ndvi r nir r r r nir r r where r nir and r r are the spectral reflectance of the near infrared band and the red band in the electromagnetic spectrum respectively the reason for choosing the annual average precipitation factor is that the floods in shangyou county mostly occur during or after heavy rainfall the stream power index spi reflects the erosive power of current which affects the stability of the terrain fuller 2008 studied the relationship between geomorphic conditions and floods and claimed that high stream power can lead to catastrophic channel variation the sediment transport index sti factor has been widely used in flood susceptibility analysis chapi et al 2017 chen et al 2019 tehrany et al 2019 sti represents the influence of terrain on erosion and reflects the intensity of sediment movement caused by water movement werner et al 2005 in addition billi 2011 concluded that the mobility of sediment transport can increase the frequency of floods the factors of spi and sti are calculated as follows moore et al 1993 moore and wilson 1992 2 spi a s tan β 3 sti a s 22 13 0 6 sin β 0 0896 1 3 where a s and β represent the area of the basin and the slope gradient respectively the topographic wetness index twi describes soil saturation associated with water accumulation in the basin mahmoud and gan 2018 tehrany et al 2015 the calculation method of the twi factor is as follows beven and kirkby 1979 4 twi ln α tan β where α is the upslope area per unit contour length and β represents the slope angle as mentioned previously we considered 13 flood conditioning factors for fsp in this study based on theoretical analysis and literature review fig 2 table 1 lists the relevant information for all factors it should be noted that the dem data was acquired from aster advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer gdem version 2 3 http gdem ersdac jspacesystems or jp 3 with a spatial resolution of 30 30 m 3 methodology 3 1 data preparation data preparation is an essential step before performing flood susceptibility modelling we used arcgis software to calculate the factors of altitude aspect curvature and slope from dem data extract the river network from the topographic map and calculate the distance to rivers factor by using the euclidean tool the land use factor came from landsat 7 etm satellite imagery and the classification accuracy was 85 by using the conventional maximum likelihood algorithm this classification algorithm has excellent performance in land use classification tasks paola and schowengerdt 1995 we calculated the ndvi factor from the satellite image using envi software and the factors of spi sti and twi based on dem data by using saga software first data of different scale were vectorized on the arcgis platform then we extracted specific flood conditioning factors from these vector data and converted them into raster form all factors were converted to a raster format with 30 m spatial resolution which is consistent with the dem data these factors have also been reclassified into different categories based on previous studies expert knowledge and flood spatial distribution characteristics costache et al 2020a khosravi et al 2019 sameen et al 2019 in this study 70 flood and non flood locations 76 and 76 were randomly selected for training models while the remaining 30 of flood and non flood locations 32 and 32 were used to construct the test set 3 2 information gain ratio to analyze the relationship between flood conditioning factors and flood occurrence the information gain ratio igr method is used to evaluate the importance of flood conditioning factors the igr method is a commonly used feature selection method and has been widely used in flood susceptibility analysis bui et al 2020 chapi et al 2017 khosravi et al 2019 assuming that the training set s contains n classes the expected information is calculated as follows 5 h s i 1 n p i log 2 p i where p i is the probability that a sample belongs to class c i the factor a has m values and its average entropy is calculated as follows 6 e a i 1 m p i h s the split information value represents the potential information obtained by dividing s into m parts corresponding to m results on the attribute a and can be calculated as follows 7 splitinf o a s i 1 m x i s i s log 2 s i s finally the variable importance value vi is defined as follows 8 v i a h s e a splitinf o a s factors with higher vi values are more important for prediction models if these values are equal to 0 it can be considered that the corresponding factors have no contribution to flood occurrence and should be removed from flood susceptibility modelling 3 3 rnn and lstm neural network as a type of artificial neural network rnn has achieved great success in the fields involving sequential data analysis choi et al 2017 ma et al 2015 mou et al 2017 from the graphic structure of the regular rnn shown in fig 3 we can see that the rnn can store information of the previous hidden state and apply it to the output together with the current input in this way rnns can capture dynamic representations from sequential data by using a specific recurrent hidden state lecun et al 2015 lstm is a special type of rnn designed to capture the long term dependence of sequential data hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the lstm network consists of an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer and its structure is similar to rnn but the difference between rnn and lstm is that the latter replaces the basic unit of the regular rnn with a memory block graves et al 2013 as shown in fig 4 the memory block contains three gate functions that play different roles in information flow process let x x 1 x 2 x n be a sequential input and y y 1 y 2 y n denotes the output sequence the forget gate is a key state that determines whether the current information should be forgotten or remembered for a certain time step t it can be calculated as follows 9 f t σ w fx x t w fh h t 1 b f where w fx and w fh are the forget weight matrix and the forget hidden weight matrix respectively b f is the bias of the forget gate and σ is the sigmoid function the input gate i t determines the information updating and c t memorizes the new information and they are defined as follows 10 i t σ w ix x t w ih h t 1 b i 11 c t tanh w cx x t w ch h t 1 b c where w ix and w ch denote the weight matrix b i and b c are the bias vectors of the input gate and the updating cell state respectively then the new memory cell state c t is updated as follows 12 c t f t c t 1 i t c t where c t 1 is the previous memory cell state and represents the element wise product finally the output gate controls the output activations the hidden layer sent to next time step is defined as follows 13 h t o t tanh c t 14 o t σ w ox x t w oh h t 1 b o where w ox is the output weight matrix w oh is the output hidden weight matrix and b o is the bias of the output gate 3 4 modelling process of lss lstm the proposed lss lstm method mainly consists of three steps layer stacking feature engineering and lstm construction as illustrated in fig 5 in the layer stacking step each flood conditioning factor can be viewed as a single band image of size 2156 1722 and all the conditioning factor layers are stacked together to form a multi band image in the feature engineering step we produce each image patch pixel by pixel from the multi band image as shown in the fig 5 b each central pixel and its neighboring pixels in a 3 3 window are first extracted and then the resultant image patch has a size of 3 3 13 and consists of 9 vectors image patches contain the characteristics and the spatial information of the factors then these vectors are sorted according to spatial continuity to construct sequential data with a size of 9 13 in the lstm construction step the lstm structure is constructed to possess these extracted sequential data the sorted vectors are gradually sent to the lstm architecture and the results are output only at the final time step as far as we know flood events are not only related to their morphological geological and hydrological conditions but also related to the neighboring environment information giovannettone et al 2018 sampson et al 2015 according to the inherent properties of lstm mentioned previously useful information of previous vectors useful for flood prediction can be stored and passed to subsequent hidden layer states irrelevant information and redundant information will be discarded by using the forget gate of lstm in the final time step all important information is aggregated and contribute to flood susceptibility analysis 3 5 model optimization over fitting is a common problem in applying deep learning methods schmidhuber 2015 specifically over fitting occurs when the learning model is closely fitted to the training data and causes a negative impact on predicting new data in this study two optimization techniques of data augmentation and batch normalization are used to solve the problem of over fitting in the modelling process 3 5 1 data augmentation since it is difficult to obtain sufficient flood samples for model construction the data augmentation technique is used to increase the number of training samples which can improve the generalization ability of the prediction model in general the training set can be augmented by rotating and flipping each extracted image patch fig 6 shows seven types of transformations of image patches with capital letter f during the augmentation process we can obtain 4 different samples by rotating the image patch by 90 180 and 270 including the image patch itself and obtain four new samples by flipping the four image patches in the horizontal direction finally the training set can be increased by 8 times for example the original training set in this study contains 152 samples after the data augmentation procedure the final training set used for lss lstm modelling includes 1216 samples 3 5 2 batch normalization batch normalization can normalize the neural network layer by adjusting and scaling activations which can improve the generalization ability and convergence speed of the model ioffe and szegedy 2015 we conduct this technique to fix the mean and variance of the layer input in the training process of the lss lstm method the training data is sent to the neural network in batches for one of the batches b with m samples the mean and variance are first calculated as follows 15 μ b 1 m i 1 m x i 16 σ 2 1 m i 1 m x i μ b 2 then each sample is separately normalized as follows 17 x i x i μ b σ b 2 ε i 1 2 m where ε is a very small constant for numerical stability next the normalized values are scaled and shifted by a pair of parameters that are calculated as follows 18 y i γ x i β i 1 2 m where γ and β are learnt in the subsequent optimization process finally the output of the batch normalization transformation is passed to the neural network layer 3 6 model evaluation criteria model evaluation is a crucial step in assessing the effectiveness of various fsp methods ahmadlou et al 2018 wang et al 2019c in this study the receiver operating characteristic roc curve that plots sensitivity and 1 specificity on y axis and x axis respectively and the area under roc auc is used for evaluation the auc value ranges from 0 to 1 and the higher the value the better the model performance in addition several statistical criteria shown in table 2 are also used to assess the performance of the fsp model 4 results and discussion 4 1 relationship analysis between conditioning factors and flood occurrence the vi values of different flood conditioning factors are shown in fig 7 all factors have a positive impact on the occurrence of floods specifically the highest and lowest vi values of slope and aspect are 0 2929 and 0 0142 respectively this is because river flood disasters usually occur on flat terrain with low slopes in addition other studies have confirmed similar observations bui et al 2020 chen et al 2019 termeh et al 2018 to further explore the relationship between the conditioning factors and the occurrence of floods we calculated the frequency ratio fr values of various factors fr can measure the likelihood of flooding in the area corresponding to each category of a conditioning factor the fr value is calculated based on the ratio of flood percentage to the domain percentage in a specific class arabameri et al 2019 tehrany et al 2015 the higher the fr value the more prone to flooding in the corresponding area termeh et al 2018 fig 8 shows the fr values of different conditioning factors please refer to table a1 in appendix for details as for the altitude factor the fr value of areas with an altitude of 300 m is higher than that of other areas and 89 81 of historical floods occurred in the corresponding areas this observation is related to our previous analysis that flat areas are more prone to flooding furthermore our results are relevant to other studies arabameri et al 2019 shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 as far as the aspect factor the fr value of the flat class is the highest 3 54 however since the flat class has almost no grid cells and floods this class has no guiding significance for floods meanwhile the fr values of other classes are closer indicating that the relationship between the aspect factor and flood occurrence is weak this observation can also explain why the vi value of aspect obtained using the igr method is the lowest the region with a curvature value between 1 and 1 has the highest fr value the corresponding area is determined to be a flat area accounting for 74 07 of the historical flood locations the distance to river factor is critical because rivers are the main channels for flood drainage and expansion bui et al 2019d from fig 8 we can find that the fr value decreases as distance to rivers increases also the fr value of this class with a distance of 0 and 200 m from the river is much higher than other classes and the corresponding area accounts for 92 59 of the historical flood locations therefore the distance to rivers factor is the second most important variable according to the results of the igr method land use is another important factor in flooding among these categories grassland areas have the highest percentage of flooding 83 33 because grasslands are usually located in flat areas moreover no floods have occurred in forest areas because these area has strong water storage capacity and can mitigate flood disasters caprario and finotti 2019 chapi et al 2017 for lithology the fr value of class i is the highest at 1 61 while the fr value of class a is 0 this is because the area of class a is mainly composed of dolomite and the drainage density is low so the possibility of flooding is low for ndvi the fr value decreases as the ndvi value increases the higher the ndvi value the better the vegetation growth conditions as a result vegetation areas can store large amounts of water and reduce the possibility of flooding regarding the rainfall factor all classes except the lowest rainfall class obtained high fr values other studied have also confirmed that heavy rainfall will increase the likelihood of flooding giovannettone et al 2018 rahmati et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 the region with a slope 10 has the highest fr value and other regions have an fr value close to zero it can be found that flat terrain is more prone to flooding as far as soil is concerned ach and atc have higher fr values of 3 91 and 1 18 than other soil types a number of studies have confirmed that soil is related to the occurrence of flooding because soil type directly determines soil permeability and structure gonzález arqueros et al 2018 tehrany et al 2014 2015 the spi value 200 has the highest fr value of 1 51 and the spi value between 25 and 50 has the lowest fr value of 0 32 for the sti factor the class to the spi value 10 has the highest fr value of 1 50 and the corresponding area accounts for 73 15 of the historical flood locations this observation is consistent with previous studies namely low sti causes high flooding potential hong et al 2018b tehrany et al 2019 for the twi factor the fr value increases as the twi value increases because a higher twi value indicates a higher water storage level which is also consistent with other studies chapi et al 2017 shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 tehrany et al 2015 in this study we extracted flood conditioning factors from different sources and screened factors based on the above relationship analysis the quality of the data source is important for flood susceptibility modelling aster gdem products are freely available and easily accessible and have been widely used to extract flood conditioning factors in many studies iosub et al 2020 khosravi et al 2019 tien bui et al 2019 moreover some advanced dem products such as shuttle radar topography mission srtm dem and multi error removed improved terrain merit dem have higher accuracy than aster gdem in hydrological analysis therefore it is necessary to discuss the impact of different advanced dem data for flood susceptibility modelling in addition we should note that there is a temporal mismatch between flood occurrence and flood conditioning factors generally lithology and soil can be regarded as constant factors and may not change over time however dem land use and ndvi will be affected by major changes seasonally or over a period of decades even within the same year certain flood conditioning factors may change significantly this is an important widespread and difficult problem in fsp most researchers treat flood conditioning factors as constant variables and ignore temporal mismatch bui et al 2019d chapi et al 2017 giovannettone et al 2018 moreover roy et al 2020 discussed flood susceptibility results based on multi temporal land use and rainfall factors in the future it will be necessary to dynamically analyze the flood susceptibility with different temporal factors 4 2 model performance in the lss lstm modelling process the training strategy and hyperparameter settings have a significant impact on the model performance the purpose of the training process is to minimize the loss value and iteratively update the parameters using a specific optimization method as shown in fig 9 the loss value of training and validation data gradually decreases as the epoch increases indicating that the training process is satisfactory in this study all the hyperparameters used in the lss lstm method were optimized using the grid search method based on the five fold cross validation procedure table 3 lists the search space and optimized results the final network architecture of the lss lstm model contains an input layer a hidden layer containing 25 lstm cells and a hidden layer moreover a batch normalization layer is added before each activation function layer all experiments were performed using python under the framework of keras 4 https keras io 4 and scikit learn 5 https scikit learn org 5 after modelling we used the lss lstm method to predict flood susceptibility table 4 shows the prediction performance the lss lstm method achieved an accuracy of 93 75 which means that the method can effectively distinguish between flood samples and non flood samples in this experiment the flood susceptibility model is used to predict the probability of flooding in a given area therefore it is necessary to accurately predict the flood area and higher accuracy values are critical to our results in addition another key point is that the flood model cannot miss any potential flood areas this is because if we fail to find areas where floods may occur the prevention and management of that area may be ignored which may cause devastating damage to society therefore sensitivity is an important indicator in the fsp field the results show that the lss lstm method achieves a very high sensitivity value of 96 67 which indicates that the model can find almost all potential flood locations fig 10 shows the roc curve using the test set as mentioned in previous studies arabameri et al 2019 kanani sadat et al 2019 an auc value 0 9 is a good predictive result therefore the proposed lss lstm method obtains relative good prediction performance with an auc value of 0 965 in our experiment we calculated the susceptibility index of 1 714 419 grid cells in the study area to build a flood susceptibility map all susceptibility indices were sorted in ascending order and divided into five classes using the natural jenks breaks method chapi et al 2017 shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 tehrany et al 2019 fig 11 shows the final flood susceptibility map obtained by the proposed lss lstm method most of the floods are located in very high and high susceptible zones which are mainly located in the east and south of the study area with low altitude and slope and close to rivers the sub region a in the susceptibility map is the location of shangyoujiang reservoir and the sub region b is close to the shangyou river which is the main tributary of the gangjiang river system in the yangtze river basin to quantitatively analyze the resultant susceptibility map the flood density fd index that is the percentage of flood pixels pfp divides by the percentage of susceptible class pixels psp was used for evaluation as shown in table 5 the very high susceptibility class achieved the highest fd value of 13 39 followed by the classes of high 2 99 and moderate 0 29 meanwhile no flood occurred in very low and low susceptible areas indicating that the flood susceptibility map is reliable in the low susceptible area it is also very illuminating for management making it easier for people to focus on these high susceptible areas in addition the obtained flood density distribution trend is of completely consistent with several previous studies bui et al 2020 shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 termeh et al 2018 4 3 model sensitivity analysis generally the results of a robust flood susceptibility model should not change much if the input data changes within a reasonable range to effectively prove that the prediction results of the lss lstm method are universal not accidental this study analysed two random manipulations that occurred during the lss lstm modelling process to measure the sensitivity of the model for the first random manipulation we randomly selected the training and test sets 10 times therefore a total of 10 lss lstm models were constructed for evaluation table 6 reports the results of several evaluation criteria executed 10 times for the proposed method all the evaluation criteria demonstrate stable and reasonable fluctuations for example the mean and standard deviation std of auc are 0 958 and 0 016 and those of acc are 91 95 and 2 06 respectively in summary the results show that the proposed method is not sensitive to the randomness of the training test splitting process and is robust to flood susceptibility analysis for the second random manipulation we randomly changed the stacking order of conditioning factors for 10 times when all the conditioning factors were stacked together as shown in fig 5 a table 7 shows the results of lss lstm performed 10 times all the evaluation criteria have a reasonable fluctuations for example the mean and std of auc are 0 958 and 0 011 and those of acc were 92 35 and 1 30 respectively compared with the results of lss lstm with different training test sets table 6 the results of lss lstm with different factor stacking orders fluctuate less the phenomenon indicates that model performance is not very sensitive to changes in the stacking order of factors this is because the modelling samples contain different flood information and each random splitting process may generate a completely new training test set however when we change the stacking order of the conditioning factors in the lss lstm modelling process the total amount of information contained in the factors does not change in addition from the inherent structure of lstm we can know that the network is not sensitive to the order of factors 4 4 model uncertainty analysis to analyze the uncertainty of applying the lss lstm method in fsp we constructed two uncertainty scenarios 10 susceptibility estimates obtained from the lss lstm method with different training test sets and 10 susceptibility estimates obtained from the lss lstm method with different factors stacking orders for convenience we named the above two scenarios as uncertainty scenario a and uncertainty scenario b respectively due to the large amount of statistical calculation cost we first calculated the average of 10 susceptibility estimates for each uncertainty scenario and then arranged them in ascending order next we selected 85 720 grid cells from the average susceptibility estimation based on a systematic sampling with a periodic interval of 20 which can represent the susceptibility value distribution of the study area a comparison between the single susceptibility estimate the same as the fig 11 and the average susceptibility estimate is shown in fig 12 guzzetti et al 2006 compared the mean value of 50 susceptibility estimates and a single susceptibility estimate which proved that the correlation between them is very high peng et al 2014 performed a comparison between the average of five susceptibility estimates and a single susceptibility estimate and obtained a high correlation r 2 0 909 as well as shown in fig 12 the two uncertainty scenarios showed a very high correlation r 2 0 939 and r 2 0 915 between the single susceptibility estimate and the average susceptibility estimate indicating the susceptibility predicted by the lss lstm method is robust in addition in order to quantify the uncertainty of flood prediction methods we used a measure strategy proposed by guzzetti et al 2006 fig 13 plots the mean susceptibility estimate on the x axis against two standard deviations 2std of the susceptibility estimate on the y axis for the two uncertainty scenarios the 2std value increases from very low to moderate susceptibility and then decreases to very high susceptibility specifically the 2std value is relatively low 0 35 for the low and high susceptibility zones which indicates the lss lstm method can achieve stable predictions in these two susceptible zones this conclusion has guiding and important significance because it is necessary to accurately and stably predict the flood location on the other hand minimizing the problem of predicting potential flooded areas as non flooded areas is also important for further hazard management furthermore the scatter distribution shown in fig 13 is sparser for moderate susceptibility indicating that the lss lstm method cannot stably predict whether a grid cell with moderate susceptibility is flooded or non flooded the variation in fig 13 can be fitted by the following equations 19 y 0 964 x 2 0 946 x 0 x 1 r 2 0 616 20 y 1 078 x 2 1 07 x 0 x 1 r 2 0 520 where x is the estimated susceptibility and y denotes the 2std value in this way eq 19 and eq 20 can be used to quantitatively assess the model uncertainty of each grid cell 4 5 hyperparameters sensitivity analysis accurate setting of hyperparameters is essential for flood susceptibility modelling rijal et al 2018 santos et al 2019 especially for constructing deep learning neural networks in this subsection we discuss the impact of three hyperparameters on flood susceptibility analysis in the first experiment we analysed the impact of batch normalization on flood susceptibility thus we compared the results of the lss lstm models optimized with and without batch normalization fig 14 shows the changes in the training and validation accuracy of the two models during the training process the lss lstm method using batch normalization achieved higher training and validation accuracies than those by the lss lstm method without batch normalization indicating that lss lstm can be effectively improved by using batch normalization this is because batch normalization can solve the problem of internal covariate shift in the training process ioffe and szegedy 2015 more specifically the input distribution of each hidden layer in the lss lstm method is converted to a normal distribution which can avoid the vanishing gradient problem and accelerate convergence hence the purpose of improving accuracy and generalization can be achieved in the second experiment we compared the lss lstm models optimized with and without data augmentation in fig 15 the lss lstm method using data augmentation achieved higher training and validation accuracies than those by the lss lstm method without data augmentation the data augmentation method is a simple and convenient trick that can artificially expand the size of the training set some publications have proven its effectiveness in improving generalization ability and application accuracy of deep learning methods in several fields han et al 2018 ma et al 2019 renda et al 2019 in the field of flood susceptibility analysis real flood samples are very limited and the collection of flood samples is very time consuming which may hinder the application of deep learning in this field the results of applying data augmentation in this study demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the prediction ability of lss lstm which can provide reference and help for other researchers to apply deep learning methods in fsp in the third experiment we analyzed the parameter of window size mentioned in section 3 2 it is an important hyperparameter in the lss lstm modelling process fig 16 shows the auc value of the proposed method as the number of window sizes increases during training when this parameter is set to 3 the lss lstm method obtains the highest auc value meanwhile since a larger window size may bring a lot of irrelevant and redundant information the auc value will decrease as the parameter increases from 5 to 11 which will have a negative impact on flood susceptibility prediction 4 6 comparison with state of the art techniques to prove the effectiveness of the lss lstm method we selected three benchmark deep learning techniques for comparison regular deep neural network dnn one dimensional convolutional neural network 1d cnn and three dimensional convolutional neural network 3d cnn the input form of dnn and 1d cnn uses a common one dimensional vector based method and 3d cnn extracts factor information and local spatial information from window patches the implementation details of dnn 1d cnn and 3d cnn can refer to several previous publications bui et al 2020 2019d wang et al 2020a note that the data augmentation method in section 3 5 1 was used in the 3d cnn modelling process in this study table 8 lists the prediction accuracies of these four methods the highest accuracy value of the lss lstm method reached 93 75 followed by 3d cnn 92 19 1d cnn 90 63 and dnn 89 06 moreover 1d cnn obtains the highest sensitivity value of 100 followed by lss lstm 96 67 3d cnn 96 55 and dnn 96 43 the roc curves of the three methods using the test set are shown in fig 17 the lss lstm method has the highest auc value of 0 965 followed by 3d cnn 0 956 1d cnn 0 929 and dnn 0 917 indicating that this method is superior to other flood prediction methods in fact as far as we know the predictive ability of any model has its limitations due to the different morphological and hydrological conditions of a certain study area we cannot be sure that lss lstm can always maintain its superiority in various inundated areas however the application mode of lstm in flood susceptibility analysis can help other researchers to a certain extent moreover the reasons why the lss lstm method has the potential to demonstrate exciting performance can be explained from the following three aspects first as described in section 3 3 lstm is one of the powerful deep learning technique that has achieved reliable results in many fields graves and jaitly 2014 mou et al 2017 sundermeyer et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 second the occurrence of flooding is not spatially independent and is closely related to the adjacent terrain units third the forget gate in lstm can effectively filter out useless information from the input data thereby improving the predictive ability of the model therefore the lss lstm method not only captures the hidden information in flood conditioning factors but also considers local spatial information from the perspective of a specific sequence furthermore as mentioned in section 4 4 the proper selection of window size related to batch normalization and data augmentation techniques can further improve the prediction performance of the lss lstm method analyzing the impact of different training sample sizes is very important for measuring model performance schulz et al 2020 yang et al 2020 to further prove the superiority of the lss lstm method over the other methods we conducted used different training sample sizes to perform sample sensitivity analysis for comparison different proportions ranging from 10 to 90 of the flood historical locations with a step size of 20 were randomly selected as the training samples fig 18 plots the impact of different training samples in the study area on auc when the percentage of training data increases from 30 to 70 the auc value obtained by the lss lstm method is higher than the other three methods the reason for this observation is that the lss lstm method can use sufficient data to learn the best fit function moreover optimization techniques of data augmentation and batch normalization can help avoid over fitting and improve predictive ability note that the lss lstm method cannot achieve higher performance compared with the other three methods that use 10 and 90 training sets since 10 of the training samples cannot provide enough flood information for modelling when the training samples accounts for 90 of the total samples the test sample size is too small therefore results obtained by models that use 10 and 90 training sets cannot accurately reflect the prediction performance of corresponding models 5 conclusions in this study we propose a new lss lstm method to obtain a reliable and accurate flood susceptibility map by integrating an appropriate feature engineering technique with lstm the proposed method can retain the superior sequence modelling ability of lstm and can capture the local spatial information of the flood the main conclusions based on the experimental results can be summarized as follows first the proposed lss lstm method achieved satisfactory prediction performance and its accuracy and auc value were 93 75 and 0 965 respectively second the lss lstm method is insensitive to the randomness of the training test set splitting process and the stacking order of factors third the lss lstm method achieved better results than the benchmark methods of dnn 1d cnn and 3d cnn in terms of several evaluation criteria finally the prediction accuracy of lss lstm can be effectively improved through the two manipulations of data augmentation and batch normalization as a conclusion the proposed lss lstm method can provide inspiration for decision makers to prevent and mitigate flood hazards in the future our research will explore more representative feature engineering methods that can accurately describe flood information for other state of the art models credit

4896,a flume experiment was carried out to improve understanding of interactions between turbidity currents and aquatic vegetation canopies and their landscape scale consequences it focussed on comparing hydrodynamics and sediment deposition in continuous canopies with those in vegetation patches and on the effects of varying water depth both of which are previously unreported the currents particulate load was characterised as a mix of fine and coarse fractions varying canopy frontal densities a and water depths h were used fifteen runs were carried out with the flume fully vegetated and a further ten with shorter vegetation patches in all runs the currents evolved as expected through inertial drag dominated and viscous regimes the positions at which transitions between the regimes occurred were measured and analysed in the fully vegetated runs both transition positions varied linearly with ah for ah 0 8 and were constant when ah 0 8 we argue that the variation at lower values of ah is caused by non canopy drag forces becoming non negligible compared to the canopy drag an equation is derived that models as a function of a and h the size a vegetation patch needs to be for its effect on turbidity currents to be the same as that of a continuous canopy the sediment depositional flux rate for fine particles from the currents within the vegetation was greater than that for coarse particles by a factor of 1 57 this suggests that bed sediment deposited within canopy patches by turbidity currents will be on average finer than that in gaps between patches as has been found previously for currents and waves thus this effect will contribute to the development of inter tidal and shallow sub tidal landscapes characterized by patches of dense vegetation and fine sediments surrounded by bare regions with coarser sediments our results imply that the distances over which the phenomena we document occur in typical inter tidal and shallow sub tidal contexts are of the same order of magnitude as sizes of patches of saltmarsh plants and seagrasses this indicates that the reported patch length effects are highly relevant to understanding eco hydrological interactions in these contexts keywords turbidity current vegetation canopy patch length sedimentation hydrodynamics 1 introduction 1 1 biophysical interactions in aquatic plant canopies the effects of aquatic plant canopies on hydrodynamic sedimentary and geomorphological processes have been studied in many contexts including seagrass meadows e g agawin and duarte 2002 folkard 2005 el allaoui et

hession 2013 gurnell 2014 licci et al 2019 lowe et al 2010 montakhab et al 2012 and in more general or idealized studies e g nepf 1999 madsen et al 2001 zong and nepf 2010 liu and nepf 2015 manners et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 they have been found widely to act as ecosystem engineers e g ludwig et al 2005 nepf 2012 modifying landscape evolution via biophysical interactions at multiple scales folkard 2019 in addition macrofauna living in submerged coastal environments actively interact with plant canopies to the point of controlling resuspension and therefore erodibility and sediment distribution joensuu et al 2018 understanding these interactions and their consequences is therefore crucial for understanding the functioning of coasts lakes and rivers in recent years because of climate change and other anthropogenic stresses aquatic plant canopies have become increasingly degraded through either fragmentation adam 2002 tamburello et al 2012 or reduction of the area they cover richardson et al 2007 colomer et al 2017 dwirea et al 2018 serra et al 2018 xiu et al 2019 for this reason research into their biophysical interactions has recently focussed on fragmented and finite sized canopies bouma et al 2007 zong and nepf 2010 el allaoui et al 2015 2016 zhang et al 2018 most studies of biophysical interactions of fragmented aquatic vegetation canopies have considered their interactions with uni directional flows in this context one of the main ways in which vegetation canopies engineer their physical environment is through reducing bed erosion madsen et al 2001 and increasing deposition of sediment agawin and duarte 2002 montakhab et al 2012 zong and nepf 2010 this triggers a positive feedback as retention of fine sediment which is rich in organic material and nutrients by the vegetation promotes the expansion of the vegetated region gurnell 2014 a minimum patch size and minimum stem density within a patch of vegetation is required for it to have the capability to engineer its physical environment in this way licci et al 2019 and to produce a positive feedback for the vegetation bouma et al 2009 deposition of sediment within vegetation canopies is dependent on the mean flow speed and the characteristics of the vegetation liu and nepf 2015 hence as well as completely fragmented canopies having sediment dynamics that are dependent on their spatial structure this is also the case in continuous canopies in which plant properties such as stem diameter flexibility and density are spatially heterogeneous e g schulze et al 2019 thus the hydrodynamics of heterogeneous canopies depend on variations of canopy characteristics at both the patch and meadow scale adhitya et al 2014 the interactions of vegetation canopies and uni directional flows may also produce negative feedbacks for example when the enhancement of flow speed adjacent to lateral patch edges produces scouring which inhibits plant growth and patch development schoelynck et al 2012 bouma et al 2013 differences in patch diameter inter patch distances and plant densities have been found to produce differences in velocity flow structures around patches for example both the amount of flow acceleration around patches and the lateral distance from the patch to the point where maximum flow acceleration occurs increase with increasing patch size vandenbruwaene et al 2011 the presence of scale dependent feedbacks such as these create self organised heterogeneity in landscapes and are key mechanisms responsible for shifts between unvegetated and vegetated landscape states bouma et al 2009 they have important implications for ecosystem functioning such as increased ecosystem productivity and increased resilience and resistance to environmental change rietkerk and van de koppel 2008 el allaoui et al 2015 el allaoui et al 2016 and colomer et al 2017 extended studies of hydrodynamic interactions with heterogeneous vegetation canopies in oscillating flows as with the work cited above they found that the spatial scale of variations patch and gap size and canopy characteristics stem density to be the most important factors determining wave transformations levels of turbulent kinetic energy and therefore sediment dynamics in particular el allaoui et al 2015 and colomer et al 2017 studied the hydrodynamics in gaps aligned with the direction of the wave and found that the lateral vegetation altered the gap for distances below 1 5 hv being hv the vegetation height el allaoui et al 2016 studied the hydrodynamics in gaps situated perpendicular to the direction of the wave they found a greater sheltering for gaps surrounded by denser canopies and for smaller gaps to date there has been little work on biophysical interactions between heterogeneous or fragmented vegetation canopies and a third hydrodynamic phenomenon beyond the uni directional currents and waves discussed above namely gravity currents in the context of considering canopies effects on sediment dynamics and thus the sort of feedbacks described the most pertinent forms of gravity currents are those driven by suspended particle concentration namely turbidity currents soler et al 2017 2020 considered the interactions of turbidity currents with continuous uniform vegetation canopies and the effects of varying turbidity current particulate concentration canopy density and vegetation type indicating that turbidity currents were able to retain sufficient sediment in suspension to maintain their flow until they became significantly influenced by the drag exerted by the obstacles furthermore they found that while turbidity current was flowing in the drag dominated regime the deposited material became increasingly dominated by fine sediment at a rate dependent on the vegetation type starting this transition at a distance equivalent to 5 1 7 6 times the total water depth barcelona et al 2018 considered the interaction of turbidity currents with longitudinal patches i e patches of vegetation aligned with the direction of the propagation of the turbidity current in order to find the effect of longitudinal gap size on gravity current evolution and on the sedimentary rates their studies indicated that a critical canopy volume lower than 0 025 was required to produce significant changes in hydrodynamics and sedimentation rates here we extend this work by investigating for the first time the effects of water depth on turbidity current vegetation patch interactions and the hydrodynamics and sediment deposition patterns of turbidity currents in finite length transversal patches of vegetation i e patches of vegetation oriented perpendicular to the direction of the turbidity current development 1 2 gravity current hydrodynamics gravity current hydrodynamics have been studied for many years both theoretically benjamin 1968 and experimentally simpson 1982 shin et al 2004 the most common approach used in experimental studies has been lock exchange flume experiments in which two fluids of different densities usually generated by salt dissolution are initially at rest in a flume and separated from each other by a lock gate when the gate is removed differences in the hydrostatic pressure cause the denser fluid to flow as a gravity current beneath the less dense fluid along the bottom boundary of the flume forcing the less dense fluid to flow in the opposite direction over the denser fluid as the gravity current flows along the flume it passes through three regimes e g huppert and simpson 1980 maxworthy et al 2002 see table 1 in the first known as the inertial regime the current proceeds as if released from an infinite reservoir and the position of the front of the current hereinafter referred to as the current toe following tanino et al 2005 xc varies in direct proportion to time t and depends on the reduced gravity g and water depth h tanino et al 2005 when the lock gate is removed it generates an interfacial wave that propagates in the opposite direction to the gravity current until it reflects off the back wall of the flume this reflected wave then flows in the same direction as the gravity current and at the point it catches up with the current toe the second regime begins in this self similar regime the current motion is determined by a balance between buoyancy and inertial forces and the flow slows over time such that the position of the toe varies as t 2 3 maxworthy et al 2002 however if the current is propagating through an array of obstacles for example simulated or natural vegetation it evolves instead from the inertial regime to a drag dominated regime e g tanino et al 2005 la rocca et al 2008 zhang and nepf 2008 2011 gonzalez juez et al 2010 nogueira et al 2013 2014 bhaganagar 2014 soler et al 2017 2020 here the gravity current is affected by the drag due to the obstacles which dominates over both inertial forces and the drag forces caused by the flume bed and sidewalls in this regime the speed of the current toe reduces more than in the self similar regime found in obstacle free cases varying from xc t 2 3 to xc t 1 2 hatcher et al 2000 in order to quantify the drag forces due to an array of obstacles it is necessary to calculate its drag coefficient cda for randomly distributed arrays of vertical cylinders often used to simulate plant stems ghisalberti and nepf 2004 found that 1 c da c d 1 16 1 16 9 31 a d 38 6 a d 2 59 8 a d 3 where a nd a is the frontal area of the cylinders per unit volume nepf 1999 n is the number of stems d is stem diameter and a is the bed area over which the n stems are distributed cd is the drag coefficient associated with the individual obstacles which are assumed to be cylinders and is a function of the cylinder reynolds number rec ud ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and u the speed of the current toe such that cd 1 10rec 2 3 white 1991 this expression for cd applies for rec values ranging from 1 to 105 and dimensionless array densities ad 0 03 nepf 1999 note that this implies that the drag coefficient of a randomly distributed array of obstacles in a flume will increase as a gravity current travels along the flume due to the reduction in the velocity of the gravity current the third and last regime through which gravity currents pass is called the viscous regime and occurs when the current has spread so far that it has become thin enough for viscous forces between the two fluids to become important and overcome the inertial forces in this regime the speed of the current toe reduces until its position varies as xc t 1 5 1 3 turbidity currents turbidity currents are gravity currents in which the density varying agent is the concentration of particles in suspension their dynamics can be more complicated than those of gravity currents in which the density varying agent is conservative on the timescale of the current s development for example heat or salt concentration this is because of sediment loss due to deposition and or sediment entrainment due to bed scouring which change the density difference that drives the current altering its temporal evolution francisco et al 2017 bonnecaze et al 1993 found that the position of the toe of a turbidity current of finite volume spreading over a rigid unobstructed horizontal surface in shallow water evolved following xc t 2 3 table 1 the spatial and temporal evolution of turbidity currents is dependent on their grain size distribution that is the ratio between the amounts of fine and coarse particle they carry felix 2002 currents dominated by fine particles travel over larger distances which results in sedimentation further downstream than in currents dominated by coarse particles harris et al 2002 moreover the runout distance to which coarse particles are transported by turbidity currents increases substantially when the proportion of fines in the turbidity current is increased gladstone et al 1998 in natural environments turbidity currents are often observed travelling or to have travelled through arrays of obstacles one example of this is turbidity currents flowing through aquatic vegetation canopies in experiments investigating this configuration soler et al 2017 found that the controlling factor in the temporal evolution of the current toe position was the canopy drag they also compared their results to experiments studying a salinity driven gravity current passing through an array of obstacles hatcher et al 2000 and found that although xc t 1 2 in both cases the effect of depositional loss of sediment particles from the turbidity current was a reduction of 70 in the constant of proportionality in this relationship coastal areas of aquatic vegetation which are subject to ever increasing anthropic pressures have become heavily degraded resulting in their fragmentation folkard 2019 creating a mosaic of vegetation and bare soil areas the presence of patches also produces wakes that can affect patches situated downstream folkard 2005 2019 taking into account the engineering capability of vegetation which modifies the hydrodynamics within its surroundings it is expected that the patch length scale plays a critical role in the development of the turbidity currents within vegetation patches and downstream as noted above studies of turbidity currents interactions with arrays of obstacles or vegetation canopies to date have focussed on cases where the array or canopy is continuous and uniform cases where the vegetation canopy is of finite extent have not previously been considered this leaves open the questions of how the size of finite patches affects their influence on turbidity current hydrodynamics and sediment transport processes and specifically how long vegetated patches need to be to provide dynamic effects equivalent to those of continuous vegetated canopies the equivalent question to that addressed by licci et al 2019 for vegetation patches in uni directional flows in rivers these questions are addressed in the present study by measuring the effects on current hydrodynamics and sediment deposition of vegetation patches that end at different points within the currents evolution through the three dynamic regimes described above and comparing them to the effects of continuous vegetation canopies 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental set up the experiment was conducted in a methacrylate flume 4 0 m long 0 3 m high and 0 3 m wide that was separated into two sections with a removable vertical lock gate fig 1 the shorter reservoir section was filled with a mixture of sediment and water that would create the turbidity current while the longer section was filled with water only the longer experimental section was populated with vertical pvc dowels with a diameter of 6 mm to mimic emergent rigid vegetation like that found in many salt marshes as juncus maritimus harvey et al 2009 leonard et al 1995 tanino et al 2005 to construct the model canopy a pvc base sheet was perforated at positions selected using a random number generator following pujol et al 2013 and a single dowel secured in each hole the density of vegetation canopies real or simulated can be quantified using various parameters commonly solid plant fraction spf is used this is defined as the percentage of the bed area occupied by vegetation stems spf 100nπ d 2 2 where n is the number of stems per unit bed area and d the stem diameter pujol et al 2010 here runs were carried out with canopy density values from spf 1 356 plants m 2 to 4 1424 plants m 2 as well as a control run without plants spf 0 canopy density is also quantified using a nd the canopy frontal area per unit bed area or simply frontal area density or the dimensionless array density ad spf 25p all these parameters for each experimental run are shown in table 2 note that the values of ad varied from 0 013 spf 1 to 0 051 spf 4 and all fall within the range observed in natural vegetation canopies with 0 01 ad 0 1 bouma et al 2007 2 2 preparation of the turbidity current fluid the flume was filled with water to a height h the day before each run to allow the water temperature to equilibrate the lock gate was then lowered into position separating the two sections to generate the turbidity current 3l of water was taken from the reservoir section fig 1 in which the mass of sediment needed to produce an initial concentration of c0 6 gl 1 was added throughout the whole of the reservoir the turbidity current concentration corresponded to 0 21 by volume falling within the range of 0 1 to 7 categorised as low particle concentration by volume by meiburg and kneller 2010 the sediment water mixture was stirred vigorously for five minutes to ensure a homogeneous sediment suspension and then returned to the reservoir section and mixed thoroughly the sediment was taken from the pletera ponds at the empordà marshes natural park in ne spain in order to provide natural sediment characteristics the collected sediment was first cleaned removing leaves and roots and then sieved to remove particles 0 5 mm the particle size distribution of the remaining sediment was measured with a lisst 100 particle size analyser sequoia scientific inc bellevue wa usa it was found to have a bimodal size distribution fig 2 79 0 of the mass was made up of particles with diameters ranging from 6 2 to 104 μm coarse fraction 17 9 was made up of particles with diameters ranging from 2 2 to 6 2 μm fine fraction the coarse fraction fell into the category of weakly cohesive particles fine to coarse silts and small sand particles and the fine particles into the category of very cohesive particles clays and very fine silts according to the classification of van rijn 2007 and blott and pye 2012 the remaining 3 1 of the sediment volume consisted of only a few particles with larger volumes which quickly settled out of the turbidity currents and therefore were not considered in the analysis 2 3 simulated vegetation patches and experimental run parameter values twenty five experimental runs all with an initial concentration c0 6 0 gl 1 were carried out parameter values for each run are shown in table 2 firstly in addition to a control run with no vegetation run 1 fourteen runs runs 2 15 were carried out with the whole 280 cm length of the flume s experimental section populated with simulated vegetation so that the patch length lpatch was in effect 280 cm these were designed to investigate the influence of varying water depth and canopy density on the downstream distances at which the turbidity currents underwent the dynamic regime transitions described above whilst they were within the vegetation canopy therefore water depth and canopy density were varied from run to run using values of h 3 6 9 12 and 15 cm and spf 1 2 2 5 3 3 5 and 4 respectively subsequently ten runs runs 16 25 were carried out in which the patches of simulated vegetation were shorter in these two water depths h 6 and 12 cm were used and the canopy density was held constant at spf 4 the shorter patch lengths were chosen such that they ended at different points in the dynamic evolution of the turbidity current in the run in which lpatch 280 cm spf 4 and h 12 cm run 7 table 2 the maximum value of each parameter five different patch lengths were chosen one which ended within the inertial regime three ending within the drag dominated regime and one extending into the viscous regime thus the experimental configuration was characterized by three parameters the vegetation canopy length lpatch m the water depth h m and the frontal area per unit volume a m 1 which quantified the canopy density with the turbidity current s characteristics held constant from these we constructed two non dimensional parameters which we used as the independent variables in our analyses lpatch h the aspect ratio of the vegetation canopy and ah ndh a the canopy frontal area per unit bed area the values of these for each run are shown in table 2 the ranges over which runs are distributed are 5 8 lpatch h 93 3 and 0 13 ah 1 27 and the control case for which lpatch h ah 0 2 4 development of the turbidity current once the sediment water mixture had settled in the reservoir section of the flume the lock gate was released allowing it to flow as a turbidity current into the experimental section in all runs the initial inertial regime speed of the current toe was two to three orders of magnitude greater than the settling velocity of the coarse particles and three to four orders of magnitude higher than settling velocities of the fine particles thus the current was considered to be conservative in this stage of its evolution i e the density anomaly driving the current remained constant a moving ccd video camera was situated at the top of the flume fig 1a to determine the position and speed of the current toe its position xc was located on the video images using edge detection parallax error was 3 and was not corrected for and measured on a scale with 0 1 cm gradations mounted on the flume bed in all runs the obscuration of the line of sight by the dowels was not enough to affect the view of the current toe the toe speed was calculated from the position and time data recorded on the video footage of its progression down the flume following previous studies tanino et al 2005 soler et al 2020 we converted the toe position into the non dimensional parameter cdaaxc and used this in our analyses of the current s hydrodynamic progression down the flume this parameter is a measure of the drag force due to the vegetation normalized by the inertial force of the current at its toe hence we refer to it hereafter as the normalized toe drag in order to analyse the pattern of sediment deposition from the turbidity current fourteen sediments traps st0 to st13 were located along the flume bed the first one st0 was located in the reservoir section 20 cm upstream of the lock gate the other thirteen st1 st13 were evenly distributed along the flume bed at intervals of 20 cm starting 20 cm to the right of the lock gate and finishing 10 cm from the far end of the flume each trap had a volume of 21 3 ml 1 and was inserted into the pvc base without extruding above the flume bed to avoid any interference with the passage of the turbidity current fig 1b when the turbidity current arrived at the end of the canopy all the traps were covered manually with lids to avoid collection of sediment that settled out of the current after it had been reflected by the end wall in order to avoid overestimation of the amount of sediment captured by the traps further upstream caused by the longer time of sedimentation the effective time that each st was collecting sediment was recorded in each run the sediment collected in each trap was analysed with the lisst 100 following serra et al 2002 2005 which gave the volume occupied by particles in each of 32 size classes logarithmically distributed in the range 2 5 500 µm because the major sediment constituent in all the traps was silt particles 79 the particle volume concentration μl l was transformed into deposited sediment mass by assuming that the density of the particles was 2 798 gcm 3 the standard value for silt particle density mandal and maiti 2015 no flocculation of fine sediment was observed so its potential effects were not taken into account in this conversion the deposited mass per unit bed area was then converted to a depositional flux at each sediment trap by dividing by the time over which the deposition occurred this value was divided by the initial horizontal flux of sediment carried by the current as it emerged from the reservoir giving a non dimensional depositional flux rate df for each trap 3 results 3 1 turbidity current evolution within fully vegetated canopies the temporal evolution of the current toe position xc in the fully vegetated runs was dependent on the canopy density in general as the canopy increased the toe speed reduced fig 3 initially in all runs until approximately t 30 s the turbidity current was in the inertial regime as xc varied linearly with time i e the flow speed was constant in the non vegetated case spf 0 after the inertial regime the flow slowed down taking on a time dependence xc t 2 3 while the deceleration was greater in the vegetated runs the evolution of xc in run 6 is shown in fig 4 a as an example of transition from the inertial regime xc t 1 to the drag dominated regime xc t 1 2 and finally to the viscous regime xc t 1 5 the positions at which these regime transitions occurred are referred to hereafter as xc lini the position at which the current transitions from the inertial regime and the drag dominated regime is initiated and xc lend the position at which the drag dominated regime ends and the viscous regime begins the normalized toe drag was calculated for lini and lend in each of the fully vegetated runs given that lpatch h was constant across these runs the relationships of cdaalini and cdaalend to the other independent variable defined above ah were investigated and plotted in fig 4b both varied linearly with ah for ah 0 8 following 2 c da a l ini 7 13 a h 1 32 r2 0 87 n 10 p 0 001 and 3 c da a l end 12 24 a h 3 92 r2 0 97 n 10 p 0 001 respectively when ah 0 8 both were constant at cdaalini 7 1 0 2 and cdaalend 13 1 0 2 respectively 3 2 turbidity current evolution in finite length vegetation patch runs as noted above values of cdaalini and cdaalend from run 7 were used to determine the lengths of the vegetation patches in the finite length patch runs in run 7 ah 1 02 so cdaalini 7 and cdaalend 13 patch lengths were thus chosen for runs 16 25 such that cdaalpatch 6 8 10 12 and 14 using each in one run with h 12 cm and another with h 6 cm table 2 the cdaalpatch 6 patch runs 20 and 25 ended in the inertial regime of run 7 the cdaalpatch 8 10 and 12 patches runs 17 19 and 22 24 ended in the drag dominated regime of run 7 and the cdaalpatch 14 patch runs 16 and 21 ended in the viscous regime of run 7 in qualitative terms the evolution of the currents proceeded as expected in runs 16 and 21 both lini and lend occurred within the vegetation so the current underwent its full evolution and reached the viscous regime within the vegetation behaving as if in a continuous infinite length canopy fig 5 c in runs 17 19 and 22 24 lini occurred within the vegetation but the current emerged from the patch in a drag dominated state and subsequently transitioned to a viscous regime downstream of the patch apparently without changing to a self similar state in which xc t 2 3 would have been observed despite the absence of vegetative drag fig 5b here too therefore the current behaved as if in a fully vegetated continuous canopy transitioning to a drag dominated state rather than a self similar state in runs 20 and 25 the vegetation patch ended upstream of lini so the current was still in the inertial regime as it emerged from the patch and evolved as if it were flowing in a non vegetated flume passing through self similar xc t 2 3 and viscous regimes fig 5a quantitatively and surprisingly lini had a consistent relationship with ah and lpatch h regardless of whether the regime transitions occurred within the patch or downstream of it this is shown in fig 6 in which data from both the fully vegetated and finite patch runs all fall on a line with both axes in log form that means there is a power law relationship given by 4 l ini h 3 721 a h 0 64 l patch h 0 30 0 77 3 3 sediment deposition from turbidity currents in vegetation patches we focussed our analysis of sediment deposition on the drag dominated regime of the currents evolution df values were selected from the sediment trap that was positioned closest to the middle of the drag dominated region in each run these were taken to be representative of the sediment deposition across the whole drag dominated regime and because that regime occurred in between the inertial and viscous regimes to be also representative of the sediment deposition from the turbidity current as a whole as for the hydrodynamic data the df values were analysed in relation to ah and lpatch h the results of this analysis are shown in fig 7 in the form of plots of df ah against lpatch h across all runs for both fine and coarse particles df ah was approximately constant when lpatch h 20 2 and increased with increasing lpatch h following a power law relationship above this threshold value fig 7 the behaviour of df differed for coarse and fine particle fractions for lpatch h 20 2 5 df fine 0 758 a h n 24 95 confidence interval 0 631 0 885 for fine sediment and 6 df coarse 0 475 a h n 23 95 confidence interval 0 359 0 592 for coarse sediment this implies a fine to coarse flux ratio dffine dfcoarse of 0 767 0 489 1 60 for lpatch h 20 2 the value of df ah increases with increasing patch length for both fine and coarse fractions i e the rate of deposition was greater in these longer patches than it would have been in shorter patches of the same density but the rate of fine particle deposition continued to be greater than that of coarse particle deposition this difference reduced towards unity as patch length increased but only slowly such that when lpatch h 88 5 the maximum value used here it was approximately 1 34 4 discussion 4 1 agreement with previous studies the time evolution of turbidity currents flowing through different distributions of vegetation were studied in the non vegetated control case run 1 the particles settling out of the current caused a reduction of its density anomaly as it progressed forward causing a reduction of the current toe speed thus after the initial inertial regime xc t 1 the position of the current toe followed the time dependence xc t 2 3 found by bonnecaze et al 1993 for the same flow configuration in the runs in which the turbidity current flowed through continuous vegetation for all vegetation density and water height combinations tested the pattern of evolution of the current dynamics was found to be in agreement with previous studies hatcher et al 2000 tanino et al 2005 zhang and nepf 2008 that is the turbidity current developed initially in the inertial regime as in the non vegetated case but soon transitioned to a drag dominated regime where it was further slowed by the vegetation drag so that the position of the current toe followed xc t 1 2 and subsequently reached a viscous regime where xc t 1 5 soler et al 2020 found that turbidity currents in arthrocnemum fruticosum semi rigid and ruppia maritima flexible vegetation beds behave like in beds covered by rigid stems of pvc therefore the results here found are expected to apply in the development of turbidity currents through real patches of vegetation the flexibility of vegetation did not determine the fate of gravity currents within vegetation rather the frontal plant obstruction provided by the vegetation furthermore less dense turbidity currents co 1 g l 1 and co 3 g l 1 would not give different results either soler et al 2020 4 2 effects of water depth on regime transition positions unlike previous studies soler et al 2017 2020 the experiment reported here investigated the effect on turbidity currents of varying water depth as well as canopy density this revealed that there is a threshold value of the non dimensional parameter ah above which the non dimensionalized positions at which turbidity currents transition from being inertially dominated to drag dominated cdaalini and subsequently from being drag dominated to dominated by viscous forces cdaalend are constant this threshold value was found to be ah 0 8 above which cdaalini 7 1 0 2 and cdaalend 13 1 0 2 the former agrees with tanino et al 2005 and soler et al 2020 who found that cdaalini 7 remained the case up to ah 2 3 compared to a maximum value of 1 27 in this study when ah 0 8 both cdaalini and cdaalend decreased linearly with decreasing ah this is consistent with an explanation that considers the relative influence of drag forces due to the canopy elements compared to other drag forces including those due to bed shear stress and interfacial stresses between the turbidity current and its overflowing counter current note first that small values of ah imply vegetation canopies that are either sparse or in shallow water or both in shallow water sparse canopy cases the drag forces not due to the canopy will have relatively significant influence meaning that drag forces are greater than predicted by models that only consider the canopy drag such as that formulated by tanino et al 2005 who originally devised the normalised toe drag parameter and therefore regime transitions will happen earlier than predicted by those models as found here if either canopy density or water depth are increased the non canopy drag forces become less significant so the canopy drag based model fits the data better our findings as illustrated in fig 4b suggest that this effect is manifested in the change of relationship at ah 0 8 shown 4 3 patch length vs regime transition distances from the empirical relationship found in these data between lini h ah and lpatch h equation 4 setting l ini lpatch gives 7 l patch 5 51 a 0 636 h 0 364 this inequality gives the patch lengths for which the transition to the drag dominated regime will occur within a vegetated patch and thus the patch length required to have the same effect on the position of turbidity currents transition to the drag dominated regime as a continuous vegetation canopy from 7 this patch length is only weakly dependent on h and close to being directly proportional to the reciprocal of a if lpatch is shorter than this threshold the current will emerge from the patch still in its inertial regime and therefore transition to a self similar regime rather than a drag dominated one thus the results presented here corroborate previous findings that denser canopies cause turbidity currents to transition earlier into the drag dominated regime barcelona et al 2018 if the vegetated patch is denser increased a the turbidity current experiences higher vegetative drag and consequently a smaller patch length is required to cause this transition to give some indications of the threshold patch length scales that our results imply sparse patches say a 2 m 1 developing in shallow water with a characteristic depth of say 10 cm need to be at least 1 54 m in length to cause turbidity currents to transition to a drag dominated state in the same way as a continuous canopy would while in denser patches say a 10 m 1 in the same water depth a patch length of 0 55 m would be enough for this to occur in deeper water say h 1 m the same sparse patches would need to have a length of 3 54 m to cause the transition at the same point as a continuous canopy while in the same denser patches the required length would be 1 26 m for exemplar common saltmarsh species arthrocnemum fruticosum glasswort and juncus maritimus sea rush for which canopy densities of a 3 64 m 1 and 4 69 m 1 have been reported respectively soler et al 2020 in water of 0 5 m depth the threshold patch lengths would be 1 88 m and 1 60 m respectively these patch lengths are all of the same order of magnitude as the typical size of patches of vegetation found in salt marsh pioneer zones and seagrasses 4 4 sedimentation patterns from turbidity currents in degraded vegetation canopies soler et al 2020 found that when turbidity currents flow through fully vegetated canopies coarse particles initially settle faster than fine particles leaving the finer particles to be dominant in the material deposited in canopy interiors thus muddifying them in agreement with this here we find the rate of fine particle deposition is higher than the rate of coarse particle deposition once the current has entered significantly into the vegetation and transitioned to a drag dominated state fig 7 at patch lengths such that lpatch h 20 2 the ratio of fine to coarse deposition rates is constant with respect to lpatch h at dffine 1 60dfcoarse above this threshold the ratio changes but only slightly keeping in mind that the distribution of patches is often affected by geology and topography these fine sediments which are often enriched in nutrients vandenbruwaene et al 2011 will result in a positive feed back as evidenced by previous observations for example di carlo et al 2005 found that in shallow well lit waters seagrass establishment was densest in nutrient rich sediments zones and nardin et al 2016 found mangroves in mekong delta expanded as continuous coverage in areas of high sediment availability but as sparse patches in areas of low sediment supply thus this process will favour a shaping of the landscape scale canopy structure into patches growing on relatively nutrient rich fine sediment separated by gaps with relatively coarse nutrient poor sediment this is redolent of the structure observed in for example chalk streams occupied by patches of ranunculus cotton et al 2006 where the flow carrying the sediment is driven by the component of gravity forcing it down the longitudinal slope of the stream channel rather than the buoyancy forces driving the turbidity currents studied here studies on the role of patch size in the ecosystem engineering capacity of submerged plants have also found that patch size affects patterns of sedimentation within them schoelynck et al 2012 used mimic and transplantation experiments in a small river to show that the longer patches were the more effectively they slowed the current enhancing sedimentation licci et al 2019 showed that there is a threshold length that river vegetation patches need to attain in order to induce modifications to flow and sedimentation patterns and that this threshold value differs depending on environmental conditions such as flow velocity at low velocity sites 0 13 0 01 ms 1 they found that a patch with a length 0 3 m modified the flow while at high velocity sites 0 20 0 01 ms 1 the threshold patch length was 0 9 m they also found fine sediment accumulation within patches was dependent on the velocity of the ambient flow field which coincides with results of barcelona et al 2018 in longitudinal patches the threshold value for having the hydrodynamics and sedimentation affected by fragmentation is related to the fractional volume occupied by vegetation which has to be higher than 0 025 barcelona et al 2018 licci et al 2019 results contrast with laboratory flume experiments carried out by tinoco and coco 2014 who studied the effect of emergent vegetation on sediment resuspension under uni directional currents and waves showing that denser vegetated patches even at low speeds their lowest speed value was of 8 cm s generated turbulence that provoked sediment scour and suspension in our experiments the turbidity currents developed frontal velocities with maximum values of 5 cm s in high density vegetated canopies for which re 200 the threshold value required for vortices to shed from the dowel nepf et al 1997 which corroborates licci et al 2019 relationship between sediment patterns and patch length as deposited sediment increased as the length of the patches increased and extends it to turbidity currents as well as the river flow studied by schoelynck et al 2012 and licci et al 2019 our experiments also support the theory that normalized depositional flux rates of sediment are greater in dense patches than in sparse ones regardless of particle size zhang et al 2020 also found in field studies in the floodplain of dongting lake china that the presence of vegetation was more beneficial to the deposition of suspended sediment within vegetation where the reduction of mean velocity and tke compared with bare bed resulted in a decrease of 30 50 of suspended sediment concentration and an increase as high as 190 in sediment deposition compared to bare beds at the same region in the context of turbidity currents a threshold value has been found such that for patches smaller than 20 2 times the water depth dependency with patch length disappears and sediment deposition rates depend only on the vegetation density 5 conclusions laboratory flume experiments have been reported which for the first time investigate a the effects of varying water depth on the passage of turbidity currents through continuous arrays of obstacles and b the effects of finite length arrays of obstacles on the hydrodynamics and patterns of sediment deposition of turbidity currents compared to those of continuous quasi infinite obstacle arrays our interest lies primarily in contexts where the obstacle arrays are aquatic vegetation canopies but they can equally be taken to simulate other natural or built phenomena the patch lengths studied were of the same order of magnitude as the length scales over which the turbidity currents develop and decay allowing the influence of patches on these processes to be elucidated we varied patch length canopy density and water height but did not vary either the initial sediment concentration of the turbidity current fluid or the physical properties of the material used to simulate the canopy vegetation so the reported findings do not speak to the possible effects of these last two factors we found that the influence of the vegetation patches on turbidity currents is parameterised by two non dimensional variables the canopy s frontal area density ah and the patch s aspect ratio with respect to the water depth lpatch h we found strong relationships between these two parameters and i the downstream distances at which the currents transition from an inertial regime to a drag dominated regime and ii the rate of depositional sediment flux from the current to the bed and the ratio of values of this flux for fine and coarse sediment fractions the transition distances normalized by water depth are found to follow a power law relationship with ah and lpatch h which is independent of the dynamical state of the current at the point where it emerges from the patch the depositional flux rates for fine and coarse sediment fractions normalised by the canopy density df ah are both found to be constant for lpatch h 20 2 with the value for fine sediment greater than that for coarse sediment by a factor of 1 60 for lpatch h 20 2 the value of df ah increases with lpatch h i e the rate of deposition is greater for any given canopy density than it would be in patches shorter than 20 2h if we consider vegetation canopy density values typically found in nature and typical shallow water depths of order 0 1 1 m the patch sizes at which these thresholds in influence occur are of the order of tens of centimetres to a few metres which are typical sizes of vegetation patches found in many freshwater and coastal marine contexts thus the results presented here are highly relevant to understanding the interactions of turbidity currents with vegetation in natural environments and in turn to obtain insights into vegetation flow sediment interactions which are crucial for river and wetland management and ecological restoration credit authorship contribution statement marianna soler

4896,a flume experiment was carried out to improve understanding of interactions between turbidity currents and aquatic vegetation canopies and their landscape scale consequences it focussed on comparing hydrodynamics and sediment deposition in continuous canopies with those in vegetation patches and on the effects of varying water depth both of which are previously unreported the currents particulate load was characterised as a mix of fine and coarse fractions varying canopy frontal densities a and water depths h were used fifteen runs were carried out with the flume fully vegetated and a further ten with shorter vegetation patches in all runs the currents evolved as expected through inertial drag dominated and viscous regimes the positions at which transitions between the regimes occurred were measured and analysed in the fully vegetated runs both transition positions varied linearly with ah for ah 0 8 and were constant when ah 0 8 we argue that the variation at lower values of ah is caused by non canopy drag forces becoming non negligible compared to the canopy drag an equation is derived that models as a function of a and h the size a vegetation patch needs to be for its effect on turbidity currents to be the same as that of a continuous canopy the sediment depositional flux rate for fine particles from the currents within the vegetation was greater than that for coarse particles by a factor of 1 57 this suggests that bed sediment deposited within canopy patches by turbidity currents will be on average finer than that in gaps between patches as has been found previously for currents and waves thus this effect will contribute to the development of inter tidal and shallow sub tidal landscapes characterized by patches of dense vegetation and fine sediments surrounded by bare regions with coarser sediments our results imply that the distances over which the phenomena we document occur in typical inter tidal and shallow sub tidal contexts are of the same order of magnitude as sizes of patches of saltmarsh plants and seagrasses this indicates that the reported patch length effects are highly relevant to understanding eco hydrological

al 2007 colomer et al 2017 dwirea et al 2018 serra et al 2018 xiu et al 2019 for this reason research into their biophysical interactions has recently focussed on fragmented and finite sized canopies bouma et al 2007 zong and nepf 2010 el allaoui et al 2015 2016 zhang et al 2018 most studies of biophysical interactions of fragmented aquatic vegetation canopies have considered their interactions with uni directional flows in this context one of the main ways in which vegetation canopies engineer their physical environment is through reducing bed erosion madsen et al 2001 and increasing deposition of sediment agawin and duarte 2002 montakhab et al 2012 zong and nepf 2010 this triggers a positive feedback as retention of fine sediment which is rich in organic material and nutrients by the vegetation promotes the expansion of the vegetated region gurnell 2014 a minimum patch size and minimum stem density within a patch of vegetation is required for it to have the capability to engineer its physical environment in this way licci et al 2019 and to produce a positive feedback for the vegetation bouma et al 2009 deposition of sediment within vegetation canopies is dependent on the mean flow speed and the characteristics of the vegetation liu and nepf 2015 hence as well as completely fragmented canopies having sediment dynamics that are dependent on their spatial structure this is also the case in continuous canopies in which plant properties such as stem diameter flexibility and density are spatially heterogeneous e g schulze et al 2019 thus the hydrodynamics of heterogeneous canopies depend on variations of canopy characteristics at both the patch and meadow scale adhitya et al 2014 the interactions of vegetation canopies and uni directional flows may also produce negative feedbacks for example when the enhancement of flow speed adjacent to lateral patch edges produces scouring which inhibits plant growth and patch development schoelynck et al 2012 bouma et al 2013 differences in patch diameter inter patch distances and plant densities have been found to produce differences in velocity flow structures around patches for example both the amount of flow acceleration around patches and the lateral distance from the patch to the point where maximum flow acceleration occurs increase with increasing patch size vandenbruwaene et al 2011 the presence of scale dependent feedbacks such as these create self organised heterogeneity in landscapes and are key mechanisms responsible for shifts between unvegetated and vegetated landscape states bouma et al 2009 they have important implications for ecosystem functioning such as increased ecosystem productivity and increased resilience and resistance to environmental change rietkerk and van de koppel 2008 el allaoui et al 2015 el allaoui et al 2016 and colomer et al 2017 extended studies of hydrodynamic interactions with heterogeneous vegetation canopies in oscillating flows as with the work cited above they found that the spatial scale of variations patch and gap size and canopy characteristics stem density to be the most important factors determining wave transformations levels of turbulent kinetic energy and therefore sediment dynamics in particular el allaoui et al 2015 and colomer et al 2017 studied the hydrodynamics in gaps aligned with the direction of the wave and found that the lateral vegetation altered the gap for distances below 1 5 hv being hv the vegetation height el allaoui et al 2016 studied the hydrodynamics in gaps situated perpendicular to the direction of the wave they found a greater sheltering for gaps surrounded by denser canopies and for smaller gaps to date there has been little work on biophysical interactions between heterogeneous or fragmented vegetation canopies and a third hydrodynamic phenomenon beyond the uni directional currents and waves discussed above namely gravity currents in the context of considering canopies effects on sediment dynamics and thus the sort of feedbacks described the most pertinent forms of gravity currents are those driven by suspended particle concentration namely turbidity currents soler et al 2017 2020 considered the interactions of turbidity currents with continuous uniform vegetation canopies and the effects of varying turbidity current particulate concentration canopy density and vegetation type indicating that turbidity currents were able to retain sufficient sediment in suspension to maintain their flow until they became significantly influenced by the drag exerted by the obstacles furthermore they found that while turbidity current was flowing in the drag dominated regime the deposited material became increasingly dominated by fine sediment at a rate dependent on the vegetation type starting this transition at a distance equivalent to 5 1 7 6 times the total water depth barcelona et al 2018 considered the interaction of turbidity currents with longitudinal patches i e patches of vegetation aligned with the direction of the propagation of the turbidity current in order to find the effect of longitudinal gap size on gravity current evolution and on the sedimentary rates their studies indicated that a critical canopy volume lower than 0 025 was required to produce significant changes in hydrodynamics and sedimentation rates here we extend this work by investigating for the first time the effects of water depth on turbidity current vegetation patch interactions and the hydrodynamics and sediment deposition patterns of turbidity currents in finite length transversal patches of vegetation i e patches of vegetation oriented perpendicular to the direction of the turbidity current development 1 2 gravity current hydrodynamics gravity current hydrodynamics have been studied for many years both theoretically benjamin 1968 and experimentally simpson 1982 shin et al 2004 the most common approach used in experimental studies has been lock exchange flume experiments in which two fluids of different densities usually generated by salt dissolution are initially at rest in a flume and separated from each other by a lock gate when the gate is removed differences in the hydrostatic pressure cause the denser fluid to flow as a gravity current beneath the less dense fluid along the bottom boundary of the flume forcing the less dense fluid to flow in the opposite direction over the denser fluid as the gravity current flows along the flume it passes through three regimes e g huppert and simpson 1980 maxworthy et al 2002 see table 1 in the first known as the inertial regime the current proceeds as if released from an infinite reservoir and the position of the front of the current hereinafter referred to as the current toe following tanino et al 2005 xc varies in direct proportion to time t and depends on the reduced gravity g and water depth h tanino et al 2005 when the lock gate is removed it generates an interfacial wave that propagates in the opposite direction to the gravity current until it reflects off the back wall of the flume this reflected wave then flows in the same direction as the gravity current and at the point it catches up with the current toe the second regime begins in this self similar regime the current motion is determined by a balance between buoyancy and inertial forces and the flow slows over time such that the position of the toe varies as t 2 3 maxworthy et al 2002 however if the current is propagating through an array of obstacles for example simulated or natural vegetation it evolves instead from the inertial regime to a drag dominated regime e g tanino et al 2005 la rocca et al 2008 zhang and nepf 2008 2011 gonzalez juez et al 2010 nogueira et al 2013 2014 bhaganagar 2014 soler et al 2017 2020 here the gravity current is affected by the drag due to the obstacles which dominates over both inertial forces and the drag forces caused by the flume bed and sidewalls in this regime the speed of the current toe reduces more than in the self similar regime found in obstacle free cases varying from xc t 2 3 to xc t 1 2 hatcher et al 2000 in order to quantify the drag forces due to an array of obstacles it is necessary to calculate its drag coefficient cda for randomly distributed arrays of vertical cylinders often used to simulate plant stems ghisalberti and nepf 2004 found that 1 c da c d 1 16 1 16 9 31 a d 38 6 a d 2 59 8 a d 3 where a nd a is the frontal area of the cylinders per unit volume nepf 1999 n is the number of stems d is stem diameter and a is the bed area over which the n stems are distributed cd is the drag coefficient associated with the individual obstacles which are assumed to be cylinders and is a function of the cylinder reynolds number rec ud ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and u the speed of the current toe such that cd 1 10rec 2 3 white 1991 this expression for cd applies for rec values ranging from 1 to 105 and dimensionless array densities ad 0 03 nepf 1999 note that this implies that the drag coefficient of a randomly distributed array of obstacles in a flume will increase as a gravity current travels along the flume due to the reduction in the velocity of the gravity current the third and last regime through which gravity currents pass is called the viscous regime and occurs when the current has spread so far that it has become thin enough for viscous forces between the two fluids to become important and overcome the inertial forces in this regime the speed of the current toe reduces until its position varies as xc t 1 5 1 3 turbidity currents turbidity currents are gravity currents in which the density varying agent is the concentration of particles in suspension their dynamics can be more complicated than those of gravity currents in which the density varying agent is conservative on the timescale of the current s development for example heat or salt concentration this is because of sediment loss due to deposition and or sediment entrainment due to bed scouring which change the density difference that drives the current altering its temporal evolution francisco et al 2017 bonnecaze et al 1993 found that the position of the toe of a turbidity current of finite volume spreading over a rigid unobstructed horizontal surface in shallow water evolved following xc t 2 3 table 1 the spatial and temporal evolution of turbidity currents is dependent on their grain size distribution that is the ratio between the amounts of fine and coarse particle they carry felix 2002 currents dominated by fine particles travel over larger distances which results in sedimentation further downstream than in currents dominated by coarse particles harris et al 2002 moreover the runout distance to which coarse particles are transported by turbidity currents increases substantially when the proportion of fines in the turbidity current is increased gladstone et al 1998 in natural environments turbidity currents are often observed travelling or to have travelled through arrays of obstacles one example of this is turbidity currents flowing through aquatic vegetation canopies in experiments investigating this configuration soler et al 2017 found that the controlling factor in the temporal evolution of the current toe position was the canopy drag they also compared their results to experiments studying a salinity driven gravity current passing through an array of obstacles hatcher et al 2000 and found that although xc t 1 2 in both cases the effect of depositional loss of sediment particles from the turbidity current was a reduction of 70 in the constant of proportionality in this relationship coastal areas of aquatic vegetation which are subject to ever increasing anthropic pressures have become heavily degraded resulting in their fragmentation folkard 2019 creating a mosaic of vegetation and bare soil areas the presence of patches also produces wakes that can affect patches situated downstream folkard 2005 2019 taking into account the engineering capability of vegetation which modifies the hydrodynamics within its surroundings it is expected that the patch length scale plays a critical role in the development of the turbidity currents within vegetation patches and downstream as noted above studies of turbidity currents interactions with arrays of obstacles or vegetation canopies to date have focussed on cases where the array or canopy is continuous and uniform cases where the vegetation canopy is of finite extent have not previously been considered this leaves open the questions of how the size of finite patches affects their influence on turbidity current hydrodynamics and sediment transport processes and specifically how long vegetated patches need to be to provide dynamic effects equivalent to those of continuous vegetated canopies the equivalent question to that addressed by licci et al 2019 for vegetation patches in uni directional flows in rivers these questions are addressed in the present study by measuring the effects on current hydrodynamics and sediment deposition of vegetation patches that end at different points within the currents evolution through the three dynamic regimes described above and comparing them to the effects of continuous vegetation canopies 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental set up the experiment was conducted in a methacrylate flume 4 0 m long 0 3 m high and 0 3 m wide that was separated into two sections with a removable vertical lock gate fig 1 the shorter reservoir section was filled with a mixture of sediment and water that would create the turbidity current while the longer section was filled with water only the longer experimental section was populated with vertical pvc dowels with a diameter of 6 mm to mimic emergent rigid vegetation like that found in many salt marshes as juncus maritimus harvey et al 2009 leonard et al 1995 tanino et al 2005 to construct the model canopy a pvc base sheet was perforated at positions selected using a random number generator following pujol et al 2013 and a single dowel secured in each hole the density of vegetation canopies real or simulated can be quantified using various parameters commonly solid plant fraction spf is used this is defined as the percentage of the bed area occupied by vegetation stems spf 100nπ d 2 2 where n is the number of stems per unit bed area and d the stem diameter pujol et al 2010 here runs were carried out with canopy density values from spf 1 356 plants m 2 to 4 1424 plants m 2 as well as a control run without plants spf 0 canopy density is also quantified using a nd the canopy frontal area per unit bed area or simply frontal area density or the dimensionless array density ad spf 25p all these parameters for each experimental run are shown in table 2 note that the values of ad varied from 0 013 spf 1 to 0 051 spf 4 and all fall within the range observed in natural vegetation canopies with 0 01 ad 0 1 bouma et al 2007 2 2 preparation of the turbidity current fluid the flume was filled with water to a height h the day before each run to allow the water temperature to equilibrate the lock gate was then lowered into position separating the two sections to generate the turbidity current 3l of water was taken from the reservoir section fig 1 in which the mass of sediment needed to produce an initial concentration of c0 6 gl 1 was added throughout the whole of the reservoir the turbidity current concentration corresponded to 0 21 by volume falling within the range of 0 1 to 7 categorised as low particle concentration by volume by meiburg and kneller 2010 the sediment water mixture was stirred vigorously for five minutes to ensure a homogeneous sediment suspension and then returned to the reservoir section and mixed thoroughly the sediment was taken from the pletera ponds at the empordà marshes natural park in ne spain in order to provide natural sediment characteristics the collected sediment was first cleaned removing leaves and roots and then sieved to remove particles 0 5 mm the particle size distribution of the remaining sediment was measured with a lisst 100 particle size analyser sequoia scientific inc bellevue wa usa it was found to have a bimodal size distribution fig 2 79 0 of the mass was made up of particles with diameters ranging from 6 2 to 104 μm coarse fraction 17 9 was made up of particles with diameters ranging from 2 2 to 6 2 μm fine fraction the coarse fraction fell into the category of weakly cohesive particles fine to coarse silts and small sand particles and the fine particles into the category of very cohesive particles clays and very fine silts according to the classification of van rijn 2007 and blott and pye 2012 the remaining 3 1 of the sediment volume consisted of only a few particles with larger volumes which quickly settled out of the turbidity currents and therefore were not considered in the analysis 2 3 simulated vegetation patches and experimental run parameter values twenty five experimental runs all with an initial concentration c0 6 0 gl 1 were carried out parameter values for each run are shown in table 2 firstly in addition to a control run with no vegetation run 1 fourteen runs runs 2 15 were carried out with the whole 280 cm length of the flume s experimental section populated with simulated vegetation so that the patch length lpatch was in effect 280 cm these were designed to investigate the influence of varying water depth and canopy density on the downstream distances at which the turbidity currents underwent the dynamic regime transitions described above whilst they were within the vegetation canopy therefore water depth and canopy density were varied from run to run using values of h 3 6 9 12 and 15 cm and spf 1 2 2 5 3 3 5 and 4 respectively subsequently ten runs runs 16 25 were carried out in which the patches of simulated vegetation were shorter in these two water depths h 6 and 12 cm were used and the canopy density was held constant at spf 4 the shorter patch lengths were chosen such that they ended at different points in the dynamic evolution of the turbidity current in the run in which lpatch 280 cm spf 4 and h 12 cm run 7 table 2 the maximum value of each parameter five different patch lengths were chosen one which ended within the inertial regime three ending within the drag dominated regime and one extending into the viscous regime thus the experimental configuration was characterized by three parameters the vegetation canopy length lpatch m the water depth h m and the frontal area per unit volume a m 1 which quantified the canopy density with the turbidity current s characteristics held constant from these we constructed two non dimensional parameters which we used as the independent variables in our analyses lpatch h the aspect ratio of the vegetation canopy and ah ndh a the canopy frontal area per unit bed area the values of these for each run are shown in table 2 the ranges over which runs are distributed are 5 8 lpatch h 93 3 and 0 13 ah 1 27 and the control case for which lpatch h ah 0 2 4 development of the turbidity current once the sediment water mixture had settled in the reservoir section of the flume the lock gate was released allowing it to flow as a turbidity current into the experimental section in all runs the initial inertial regime speed of the current toe was two to three orders of magnitude greater than the settling velocity of the coarse particles and three to four orders of magnitude higher than settling velocities of the fine particles thus the current was considered to be conservative in this stage of its evolution i e the density anomaly driving the current remained constant a moving ccd video camera was situated at the top of the flume fig 1a to determine the position and speed of the current toe its position xc was located on the video images using edge detection parallax error was 3 and was not corrected for and measured on a scale with 0 1 cm gradations mounted on the flume bed in all runs the obscuration of the line of sight by the dowels was not enough to affect the view of the current toe the toe speed was calculated from the position and time data recorded on the video footage of its progression down the flume following previous studies tanino et al 2005 soler et al 2020 we converted the toe position into the non dimensional parameter cdaaxc and used this in our analyses of the current s hydrodynamic progression down the flume this parameter is a measure of the drag force due to the vegetation normalized by the inertial force of the current at its toe hence we refer to it hereafter as the normalized toe drag in order to analyse the pattern of sediment deposition from the turbidity current fourteen sediments traps st0 to st13 were located along the flume bed the first one st0 was located in the reservoir section 20 cm upstream of the lock gate the other thirteen st1 st13 were evenly distributed along the flume bed at intervals of 20 cm starting 20 cm to the right of the lock gate and finishing 10 cm from the far end of the flume each trap had a volume of 21 3 ml 1 and was inserted into the pvc base without extruding above the flume bed to avoid any interference with the passage of the turbidity current fig 1b when the turbidity current arrived at the end of the canopy all the traps were covered manually with lids to avoid collection of sediment that settled out of the current after it had been reflected by the end wall in order to avoid overestimation of the amount of sediment captured by the traps further upstream caused by the longer time of sedimentation the effective time that each st was collecting sediment was recorded in each run the sediment collected in each trap was analysed with the lisst 100 following serra et al 2002 2005 which gave the volume occupied by particles in each of 32 size classes logarithmically distributed in the range 2 5 500 µm because the major sediment constituent in all the traps was silt particles 79 the particle volume concentration μl l was transformed into deposited sediment mass by assuming that the density of the particles was 2 798 gcm 3 the standard value for silt particle density mandal and maiti 2015 no flocculation of fine sediment was observed so its potential effects were not taken into account in this conversion the deposited mass per unit bed area was then converted to a depositional flux at each sediment trap by dividing by the time over which the deposition occurred this value was divided by the initial horizontal flux of sediment carried by the current as it emerged from the reservoir giving a non dimensional depositional flux rate df for each trap 3 results 3 1 turbidity current evolution within fully vegetated canopies the temporal evolution of the current toe position xc in the fully vegetated runs was dependent on the canopy density in general as the canopy increased the toe speed reduced fig 3 initially in all runs until approximately t 30 s the turbidity current was in the inertial regime as xc varied linearly with time i e the flow speed was constant in the non vegetated case spf 0 after the inertial regime the flow slowed down taking on a time dependence xc t 2 3 while the deceleration was greater in the vegetated runs the evolution of xc in run 6 is shown in fig 4 a as an example of transition from the inertial regime xc t 1 to the drag dominated regime xc t 1 2 and finally to the viscous regime xc t 1 5 the positions at which these regime transitions occurred are referred to hereafter as xc lini the position at which the current transitions from the inertial regime and the drag dominated regime is initiated and xc lend the position at which the drag dominated regime ends and the viscous regime begins the normalized toe drag was calculated for lini and lend in each of the fully vegetated runs given that lpatch h was constant across these runs the relationships of cdaalini and cdaalend to the other independent variable defined above ah were investigated and plotted in fig 4b both varied linearly with ah for ah 0 8 following 2 c da a l ini 7 13 a h 1 32 r2 0 87 n 10 p 0 001 and 3 c da a l end 12 24 a h 3 92 r2 0 97 n 10 p 0 001 respectively when ah 0 8 both were constant at cdaalini 7 1 0 2 and cdaalend 13 1 0 2 respectively 3 2 turbidity current evolution in finite length vegetation patch runs as noted above values of cdaalini and cdaalend from run 7 were used to determine the lengths of the vegetation patches in the finite length patch runs in run 7 ah 1 02 so cdaalini 7 and cdaalend 13 patch lengths were thus chosen for runs 16 25 such that cdaalpatch 6 8 10 12 and 14 using each in one run with h 12 cm and another with h 6 cm table 2 the cdaalpatch 6 patch runs 20 and 25 ended in the inertial regime of run 7 the cdaalpatch 8 10 and 12 patches runs 17 19 and 22 24 ended in the drag dominated regime of run 7 and the cdaalpatch 14 patch runs 16 and 21 ended in the viscous regime of run 7 in qualitative terms the evolution of the currents proceeded as expected in runs 16 and 21 both lini and lend occurred within the vegetation so the current underwent its full evolution and reached the viscous regime within the vegetation behaving as if in a continuous infinite length canopy fig 5 c in runs 17 19 and 22 24 lini occurred within the vegetation but the current emerged from the patch in a drag dominated state and subsequently transitioned to a viscous regime downstream of the patch apparently without changing to a self similar state in which xc t 2 3 would have been observed despite the absence of vegetative drag fig 5b here too therefore the current behaved as if in a fully vegetated continuous canopy transitioning to a drag dominated state rather than a self similar state in runs 20 and 25 the vegetation patch ended upstream of lini so the current was still in the inertial regime as it emerged from the patch and evolved as if it were flowing in a non vegetated flume passing through self similar xc t 2 3 and viscous regimes fig 5a quantitatively and surprisingly lini had a consistent relationship with ah and lpatch h regardless of whether the regime transitions occurred within the patch or downstream of it this is shown in fig 6 in which data from both the fully vegetated and finite patch runs all fall on a line with both axes in log form that means there is a power law relationship given by 4 l ini h 3 721 a h 0 64 l patch h 0 30 0 77 3 3 sediment deposition from turbidity currents in vegetation patches we focussed our analysis of sediment deposition on the drag dominated regime of the currents evolution df values were selected from the sediment trap that was positioned closest to the middle of the drag dominated region in each run these were taken to be representative of the sediment deposition across the whole drag dominated regime and because that regime occurred in between the inertial and viscous regimes to be also representative of the sediment deposition from the turbidity current as a whole as for the hydrodynamic data the df values were analysed in relation to ah and lpatch h the results of this analysis are shown in fig 7 in the form of plots of df ah against lpatch h across all runs for both fine and coarse particles df ah was approximately constant when lpatch h 20 2 and increased with increasing lpatch h following a power law relationship above this threshold value fig 7 the behaviour of df differed for coarse and fine particle fractions for lpatch h 20 2 5 df fine 0 758 a h n 24 95 confidence interval 0 631 0 885 for fine sediment and 6 df coarse 0 475 a h n 23 95 confidence interval 0 359 0 592 for coarse sediment this implies a fine to coarse flux ratio dffine dfcoarse of 0 767 0 489 1 60 for lpatch h 20 2 the value of df ah increases with increasing patch length for both fine and coarse fractions i e the rate of deposition was greater in these longer patches than it would have been in shorter patches of the same density but the rate of fine particle deposition continued to be greater than that of coarse particle deposition this difference reduced towards unity as patch length increased but only slowly such that when lpatch h 88 5 the maximum value used here it was approximately 1 34 4 discussion 4 1 agreement with previous studies the time evolution of turbidity currents flowing through different distributions of vegetation were studied in the non vegetated control case run 1 the particles settling out of the current caused a reduction of its density anomaly as it progressed forward causing a reduction of the current toe speed thus after the initial inertial regime xc t 1 the position of the current toe followed the time dependence xc t 2 3 found by bonnecaze et al 1993 for the same flow configuration in the runs in which the turbidity current flowed through continuous vegetation for all vegetation density and water height combinations tested the pattern of evolution of the current dynamics was found to be in agreement with previous studies hatcher et al 2000 tanino et al 2005 zhang and nepf 2008 that is the turbidity current developed initially in the inertial regime as in the non vegetated case but soon transitioned to a drag dominated regime where it was further slowed by the vegetation drag so that the position of the current toe followed xc t 1 2 and subsequently reached a viscous regime where xc t 1 5 soler et al 2020 found that turbidity currents in arthrocnemum fruticosum semi rigid and ruppia maritima flexible vegetation beds behave like in beds covered by rigid stems of pvc therefore the results here found are expected to apply in the development of turbidity currents through real patches of vegetation the flexibility of vegetation did not determine the fate of gravity currents within vegetation rather the frontal plant obstruction provided by the vegetation furthermore less dense turbidity currents co 1 g l 1 and co 3 g l 1 would not give different results either soler et al 2020 4 2 effects of water depth on regime transition positions unlike previous studies soler et al 2017 2020 the experiment reported here investigated the effect on turbidity currents of varying water depth as well as canopy density this revealed that there is a threshold value of the non dimensional parameter ah above which the non dimensionalized positions at which turbidity currents transition from being inertially dominated to drag dominated cdaalini and subsequently from being drag dominated to dominated by viscous forces cdaalend are constant this threshold value was found to be ah 0 8 above which cdaalini 7 1 0 2 and cdaalend 13 1 0 2 the former agrees with tanino et al 2005 and soler et al 2020 who found that cdaalini 7 remained the case up to ah 2 3 compared to a maximum value of 1 27 in this study when ah 0 8 both cdaalini and cdaalend decreased linearly with decreasing ah this is consistent with an explanation that considers the relative influence of drag forces due to the canopy elements compared to other drag forces including those due to bed shear stress and interfacial stresses between the turbidity current and its overflowing counter current note first that small values of ah imply vegetation canopies that are either sparse or in shallow water or both in shallow water sparse canopy cases the drag forces not due to the canopy will have relatively significant influence meaning that drag forces are greater than predicted by models that only consider the canopy drag such as that formulated by tanino et al 2005 who originally devised the normalised toe drag parameter and therefore regime transitions will happen earlier than predicted by those models as found here if either canopy density or water depth are increased the non canopy drag forces become less significant so the canopy drag based model fits the data better our findings as illustrated in fig 4b suggest that this effect is manifested in the change of relationship at ah 0 8 shown 4 3 patch length vs regime transition distances from the empirical relationship found in these data between lini h ah and lpatch h equation 4 setting l ini lpatch gives 7 l patch 5 51 a 0 636 h 0 364 this inequality gives the patch lengths for which the transition to the drag dominated regime will occur within a vegetated patch and thus the patch length required to have the same effect on the position of turbidity currents transition to the drag dominated regime as a continuous vegetation canopy from 7 this patch length is only weakly dependent on h and close to being directly proportional to the reciprocal of a if lpatch is shorter than this threshold the current will emerge from the patch still in its inertial regime and therefore transition to a self similar regime rather than a drag dominated one thus the results presented here corroborate previous findings that denser canopies cause turbidity currents to transition earlier into the drag dominated regime barcelona et al 2018 if the vegetated patch is denser increased a the turbidity current experiences higher vegetative drag and consequently a smaller patch length is required to cause this transition to give some indications of the threshold patch length scales that our results imply sparse patches say a 2 m 1 developing in shallow water with a characteristic depth of say 10 cm need to be at least 1 54 m in length to cause turbidity currents to transition to a drag dominated state in the same way as a continuous canopy would while in denser patches say a 10 m 1 in the same water depth a patch length of 0 55 m would be enough for this to occur in deeper water say h 1 m the same sparse patches would need to have a length of 3 54 m to cause the transition at the same point as a continuous canopy while in the same denser patches the required length would be 1 26 m for exemplar common saltmarsh species arthrocnemum fruticosum glasswort and juncus maritimus sea rush for which canopy densities of a 3 64 m 1 and 4 69 m 1 have been reported respectively soler et al 2020 in water of 0 5 m depth the threshold patch lengths would be 1 88 m and 1 60 m respectively these patch lengths are all of the same order of magnitude as the typical size of patches of vegetation found in salt marsh pioneer zones and seagrasses 4 4 sedimentation patterns from turbidity currents in degraded vegetation canopies soler et al 2020 found that when turbidity currents flow through fully vegetated canopies coarse particles initially settle faster than fine particles leaving the finer particles to be dominant in the material deposited in canopy interiors thus muddifying them in agreement with this here we find the rate of fine particle deposition is higher than the rate of coarse particle deposition once the current has entered significantly into the vegetation and transitioned to a drag dominated state fig 7 at patch lengths such that lpatch h 20 2 the ratio of fine to coarse deposition rates is constant with respect to lpatch h at dffine 1 60dfcoarse above this threshold the ratio changes but only slightly keeping in mind that the distribution of patches is often affected by geology and topography these fine sediments which are often enriched in nutrients vandenbruwaene et al 2011 will result in a positive feed back as evidenced by previous observations for example di carlo et al 2005 found that in shallow well lit waters seagrass establishment was densest in nutrient rich sediments zones and nardin et al 2016 found mangroves in mekong delta expanded as continuous coverage in areas of high sediment availability but as sparse patches in areas of low sediment supply thus this process will favour a shaping of the landscape scale canopy structure into patches growing on relatively nutrient rich fine sediment separated by gaps with relatively coarse nutrient poor sediment this is redolent of the structure observed in for example chalk streams occupied by patches of ranunculus cotton et al 2006 where the flow carrying the sediment is driven by the component of gravity forcing it down the longitudinal slope of the stream channel rather than the buoyancy forces driving the turbidity currents studied here studies on the role of patch size in the ecosystem engineering capacity of submerged plants have also found that patch size affects patterns of sedimentation within them schoelynck et al 2012 used mimic and transplantation experiments in a small river to show that the longer patches were the more effectively they slowed the current enhancing sedimentation licci et al 2019 showed that there is a threshold length that river vegetation patches need to attain in order to induce modifications to flow and sedimentation patterns and that this threshold value differs depending on environmental conditions such as flow velocity at low velocity sites 0 13 0 01 ms 1 they found that a patch with a length 0 3 m modified the flow while at high velocity sites 0 20 0 01 ms 1 the threshold patch length was 0 9 m they also found fine sediment accumulation within patches was dependent on the velocity of the ambient flow field which coincides with results of barcelona et al 2018 in longitudinal patches the threshold value for having the hydrodynamics and sedimentation affected by fragmentation is related to the fractional volume occupied by vegetation which has to be higher than 0 025 barcelona et al 2018 licci et al 2019 results contrast with laboratory flume experiments carried out by tinoco and coco 2014 who studied the effect of emergent vegetation on sediment resuspension under uni directional currents and waves showing that denser vegetated patches even at low speeds their lowest speed value was of 8 cm s generated turbulence that provoked sediment scour and suspension in our experiments the turbidity currents developed frontal velocities with maximum values of 5 cm s in high density vegetated canopies for which re 200 the threshold value required for vortices to shed from the dowel nepf et al 1997 which corroborates licci et al 2019 relationship between sediment patterns and patch length as deposited sediment increased as the length of the patches increased and extends it to turbidity currents as well as the river flow studied by schoelynck et al 2012 and licci et al 2019 our experiments also support the theory that normalized depositional flux rates of sediment are greater in dense patches than in sparse ones regardless of particle size zhang et al 2020 also found in field studies in the floodplain of dongting lake china that the presence of vegetation was more beneficial to the deposition of suspended sediment within vegetation where the reduction of mean velocity and tke compared with bare bed resulted in a decrease of 30 50 of suspended sediment concentration and an increase as high as 190 in sediment deposition compared to bare beds at the same region in the context of turbidity currents a threshold value has been found such that for patches smaller than 20 2 times the water depth dependency with patch length disappears and sediment deposition rates depend only on the vegetation density 5 conclusions laboratory flume experiments have been reported which for the first time investigate a the effects of varying water depth on the passage of turbidity currents through continuous arrays of obstacles and b the effects of finite length arrays of obstacles on the hydrodynamics and patterns of sediment deposition of turbidity currents compared to those of continuous quasi infinite obstacle arrays our interest lies primarily in contexts where the obstacle arrays are aquatic vegetation canopies but they can equally be taken to simulate other natural or built phenomena the patch lengths studied were of the same order of magnitude as the length scales over which the turbidity currents develop and decay allowing the influence of patches on these processes to be elucidated we varied patch length canopy density and water height but did not vary either the initial sediment concentration of the turbidity current fluid or the physical properties of the material used to simulate the canopy vegetation so the reported findings do not speak to the possible effects of these last two factors we found that the influence of the vegetation patches on turbidity currents is parameterised by two non dimensional variables the canopy s frontal area density ah and the patch s aspect ratio with respect to the water depth lpatch h we found strong relationships between these two parameters and i the downstream distances at which the currents transition from an inertial regime to a drag dominated regime and ii the rate of depositional sediment flux from the current to the bed and the ratio of values of this flux for fine and coarse sediment fractions the transition distances normalized by water depth are found to follow a power law relationship with ah and lpatch h which is independent of the dynamical state of the current at the point where it emerges from the patch the depositional flux rates for fine and coarse sediment fractions normalised by the canopy density df ah are both found to be constant for lpatch h 20 2 with the value for fine sediment greater than that for coarse sediment by a factor of 1 60 for lpatch h 20 2 the value of df ah increases with lpatch h i e the rate of deposition is greater for any given canopy density than it would be in patches shorter than 20 2h if we consider vegetation canopy density values typically found in nature and typical shallow water depths of order 0 1 1 m the patch sizes at which these thresholds in influence occur are of the order of tens of centimetres to a few metres which are typical sizes of vegetation patches found in many freshwater and coastal marine contexts thus the results presented here are highly relevant to understanding the interactions of turbidity currents with vegetation in natural environments and in turn to obtain insights into vegetation flow sediment interactions which are crucial for river and wetland management and ecological restoration credit authorship contribution statement marianna soler

4897,assessing green and blue water evapotranspiration gwet and bwet is the key to water resources management and improving water productivity this study focuses on assessing evaluating and managing evapotranspiration in egyptian nile delta over 1997 2017 for thirteen regions the monthly data of minimum and maximum temperatures precipitation and solar radiation from november to may were derived from open access data for calculation of reference evapotranspiration and rainfall accounts wheat crop coefficient kc values were estimated using the air temperature and base temperature of crop gwet and bwet were calculated and mapped for each region in the arcgis environment land use land cover lulc was analyzed during 1997 2005 2011 and 2017 using landsat images the main findings of the research are as follows 1 average values of crop coefficients kc init kc mid and kc end were 0 72 1 13 and 0 41 through initial middle and end growing seasons respectively 2 the best regions for saving green and blue water were sidi salim bilqas ar riyad al hamul and biyala 3 the total water saved was 4 80 and 53 12 of blue and green water accounts 4 high coefficients of determination between precipitation gwet and bwet proportions were 0 99 for both furthermore relative irrigation supply is a good indicator for predicting gwet and bwet with determination coefficients of 0 99 and 0 76 respectively it can be concluded that the data integration of geographic information and lulc changes is the best way for water management and sustainable agro system development under limited water resources keywords green evapotranspiration blue evapotranspiration water saving water management land use land cover 1 introduction the continuously increasing world s population which is expected to 9 2 billion by 2050 requires an ever increasing demand of water and it s expected that climate change will increase the water demand by an average of 5 eid 1999 wwap united nations world water assessment programme 2015 the agricultural system is one of the largest consumers of the world s water which covers about 70 80 of water resources elbeltagi et al 2020a 2020b 2020c molden 2013 many regions in the world are facing the problem of water scarcity and increased competition for water among agriculture livestock fisheries forestry energy and other sectors due to the continuous decline in the water resources biswas et al 2009 deb and kiem 2020 in some cases the future projections of decreasing water availability reach 70 el quosy 2008 therefore integrated water management and planning for different water resources is the key to develop a sustainable agricultural system in the coming years recently two evapotranspiration colors namely green and blue are increasingly used in agricultural water management green water evapotranspiration etgreen is a fractionating process of rainwater stored in soil and obtainable for crop evapotranspiration during plant growth which is corresponding to the effective precipitation peff blue water evapotranspiration etblue is defined as the gross water added for irrigation that draws freshwater from underground reservoirs and surface supplies over growing periods from planting to harvesting madugundu et al 2018 in egypt 55 5 1 6 2 4 and 6 5 bcm yr are currently accessible water supplies from nile river peff non renewable groundwater western desert and groundwater respectively the difference between demands and existing water accounts is 13 5 bcm yr omar and moussa 2016 arab republic of egypt 2017 according to the food and agriculture organization fao on water and agriculture for 1997 2002 2007 2012 and 2014 total annual internal renewable water resources per capita were 27 8 25 4 23 2 21 and 19 7 m3 respectively fao aquastat 2017 moreover the water share per capita was 909 10 963 20 and 910 6 m3 during 1995 2000 and 2010 respectively the definition of water management sustainability refers to all practices which improve crop productivity and minimize water losses additionally the expansion of cultivated areas is steadily increasing and water sources are the limiting factor abdrabbo et al 2016 so this study focuses on water resources management in the agriculture sector because it is consuming on average 85 of limited water share elnmer et al 2015 the first parameter is actual crop evapotranspiration as an important role in environmental hydrological and agricultural practices and plays a key role in managing and designing irrigation systems under fully irrigated and rain fed farming djaman et al 2015 liu et al 2019 the second parameter is rainfall levels and how to exploit this source for beneficial purposes many existing approaches have been applied using crop water models based on meteorological data geographical information system gis and remote sensing to estimate reference and actual evapotranspiration borse et al 2017 ramírez cuesta et al 2017 velpuri and senay 2017 casella et al 2018 babel et al 2019 also adamala et al 2016 assessed crop coefficients based on the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi of bare soil and full cover dense vegetation of crops in this study we calculated the crop coefficient kc and evapotranspiration using the thermal unit and solar radiation and evaluated kc values with recommended fao data recent studies have applied several water saving methods for example karandish and šimůnek 2019 have used various strategies such as a comparison of saltmed and hydrus models to investigate the effect of water saving treatments on crop status in addition deligios et al 2018 concluded the combination of evaporative cooling practice can be optimized to save water 34 besides the assessment of irrigation performance represented a potential water saving of 34 to 39 miao et al 2015 while hu et al 2010 combined crop growth data with groundwater model and their finding exhibited that 29 2 or 135 7 mm reduction in water could prevent groundwater drawdown and grain yield loss is less than 10 as a result of water saving furthermore campos et al 2003 applied simulation model isareg and stated the adoption of new calendars and reducing the number of irrigations could save water more than 33 the objective of this study was to analyze dynamics of green and blue water resources in nile delta egypt using gis and remote sensing tools map and manage water evapotranspiration to optimize freshwater use and rainfall benefits generate valuable information for water users and planners towards freshwater and rainfall amounts to conserve agricultural water use and achieve sustainable growth under limited water supplies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the nile delta is the delta formed in northern egypt lower egypt where the nile river spreads out and flows into the mediterranean sea it is one of the world s largest river deltas from west alexandria to east port said it covers 240 km of coastline in the mediterranean and is a rich agricultural region the nile delta occupies only around 2 of egypt s total area but accounts for about 63 of its agricultural activities shalaby and tateishi 2007 most populated egyptian governorates whereas approximately 50 of the population lives in nile delta haars et al 2016 the research area covers thirteen rural regions within the three governorates ad dakahliya al gharbiya and kafr el sheikh in the nile delta egypt as shown in fig 1 we picked three regions from the governorate of ad dakahliya bilqas nabaruh and talkha three from the governorate of al gharbiya al mahalaha kubra qutur and samannud in addition seven were selected from the governorate of kafr ash shaykh biyala ar riyad al hamul disuq kafr ash shaykh sidi salim and qallin wheat crop as winter crop was selected in this study because its production does not meet the current demand planting and harvest dates for the wheat crop were from november to may according to the fao allen et al 1998 2 2 spatial and temporal climate data environmental systems research institute esri arc gis software was used as a tool to collect the monthly data of maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation and precipitation for 7 months from november to may with a spatial resolution of approximately 4 km2 over the period from 1997 to 2017 maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation data were collected from the climatic research unit cru ts 4 0 as netcdf format abatzoglou et al 2018 furthermore solar radiation data was collected from japanese reanalysis jra 55 as netcdf format kobayashi et al 2015 the cru ts 4 0 source provides average monthly data of minimum and maximum temperature and cumulative rainfall for the global land surface at a grid of 0 5 the jra 55 provides complete spatio temporal data covering the period from 1958 till today the methodological flowchart of determining the green and blue water evapotranspiration and crop water use is provided in fig 2 we selected this period from 1997 to 2017 precisely because all the necessary data are available 2 3 land use and land cover lulc analysis 2 3 1 data collection the following three landsat sensors were used landsat 5 tm landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli tirs path 177 row 38 30 m spatial resolution these images have been downloaded from the website of the usgs earth explorer https earthexplorer usgs gov two images of landsat 5 were used in which the image data consist of seven bands with wavelengths ranging from 450 nm to 2350 nm the image data of landsat 7 consist of eight bands with wavelengths from 450 nm to 2350 nm moreover landsat 8 image data is composed of 11 spectral bands four images with different dates i e 04 12 1997 24 11 2005 09 01 2011 and 26 02 2017 were used to investigate the impact of rising population growth on lulc changes particularly in cropland areas 2 3 2 image pre processing and classification the first pre processing operation for landsat images was the radiometric calibration using envi 5 3 software exelis visual information solutions boulder colorado after that the atmospheric correction was done for data of the four landsat images subtraction model was applied for atmospheric image correction and layer stacking was the final step through the selected bands and subsequently the area of study was a subset envi 5 3 software for unsupervised and supervised classifications was used for analyzing landsat images the iterative self organizing iso algorithm was selected for the identification of the classes in the study area in unsupervised classification the supervised classification was performed based on the maximum likelihood algorithm in envi 5 3 software chowdhury et al 2018 supervised classifications were implemented through the google earth engine platform as a high spatial resolution image six separate types of lulc were classified cropland built up area water body grass natural vegetation sand land and bare soil 2 3 3 accuracy assessment images classification accuracy assessment was performed during 1997 2005 2011 and 2017 to determine the accuracy of the improvements to the classified lulc if the classification data is to be useful in the study of the detection of changes and accuracy evaluation for individual classification is necessary owojori and xie 2003 the kappa analysis and overall accuracy were carried out to classify the accuracy level using the random points we randomly selected at least 100 points for every land use class based on visual interpretation and ground truth data then those points were checked on the developed lulc map the statistical comparison of the classified results and reference data was done using error matrix approach the post classification change detection technique performed in envi 5 3 software was chosen for use in this study to describe the area and percentage of lulc classes in the study area a confusion matrix was employed using ground truth 2 4 blue and green evapotranspiration and crop water use to calculate the evapotranspiration of blue water we estimated the reference evapotranspiration based on the fao s suggested hargreaves model eq 1 this method was used because the parameters necessary to calculate the penman monteith pm model are not available hargreaves and allen 2003 aguilar et al 2011 fooladmand and zandilak 2008 patel et al 2014 raziei and pereira 2013 the benefit of the hargreaves model hm over pm is that it requires only minimum and maximum temperatures and readily obtainable data on solar radiation from the gis raster datasets as seen in section 2 2 above 1 e t o 0 0023 r a t m e a n 17 8 t m a x t m i n where tmean is the average of temperature oc tmax is the maximum temperature tmin is the minimum temperature and ra is the solar radiation mm month the crop coefficient was determined using the thermal unit according to eq 2 given by sammis et al 1985 the equation established was equivalent to 0 12 for c value through the growing season particularly for maize crop however in this study values of c were modified to match the wheat crop c values were 0 05 for early stage 0 5 for the stem extension stage 0 63 for the heading stage and 0 38 for the late stage we calibrated this equation over the period 1997 2007 to evaluate the performance level for calculating crop coefficients and the validation was from 2008 to 2017 2 k c c 0 00168 t u 2 45 10 7 t u 2 4 37 10 10 t u 3 where c is constant depend on the growth stage tu is a thermal unit as shown in eq 3 calculated based on air temperature and base temperature threshold of crop 4 7 c according to agrometeorological centre of excellence 2018 baker and reddy 2001 bautista capetillo et al 2013 djaman et al 2018 grigorieva et al 2010 salama et al 2015 3 t u i 1 n t m a x t m i n 2 t b a s e then crop evapotranspiration was calculated by multiplying reference evapotranspiration through the growing season by the crop coefficient etc eto kc effective rainfall is also specified as the portion of the total amount of rainfall which was calculated according to kuo et al 2006 4 p e f f p t o t 125 0 2 p t o t 125 where peff is the effective precipitation mm and ptot is the total precipitation mm from the above all equations we calculated green and blue evapotranspiration as shown in the following equations velpuri and senay 2017 also green and blue crop water use were determined by multiplying green and blue water evapotranspiration through the growing season by 10 romaguera et al 2010 xinchun et al 2018 5 et total g w e t b w e t 6 bwet m a x 0 et c p eff 7 gwet m i n et c p eff where gwet et green is evapotranspiration of precipitation equal to the minimum differences between the total etc and peff and bwet et blue is evapotranspiration of actual water applied equal to the maximum differences between the total etc and peff water saving was calculated by selecting the regions containing high percentage of green water accounts in order to maximize the blue water use the water saving efficiency depends on lulc results of cropland areas and calculation of the gwet and bwet for study regions to estimate the viability of a strategy of replacing the regions to increase the crop production and save high amounts of water simultaneously furthermore the blue water saving accounts were calculated as the difference between the selected and non selected regions along with the green water saving accounts for the non selected regions for other activities finally we calculated the relative irrigation supply ris indicator for predicting green and blue water resources levine 1982 greaves 2007 this indicator is the ratio of the total volume of water and total hypothetical water requirements calculated per growing season this indicator has become a powerful tool in managing water rodríguez díaz et al 2008 8 r i s w a g 10 e t c p e f f where wag m3 ha 1 is the actual amount of irrigation water applied that is equal to the sum of blue evapotranspiration during the growing season and leaching requirements as 10 from crop water requirements according to fao 2000 the ris values below 1 indicate the water shortage whereas the values above 1 indicate that excess water under normal conditions the values close to 1 2 are sufficient to avoid the deficit in the water supply gonzález perea et al 2018 3 results 3 1 lulc change detection in egyptian nile delta the classified lulc map of the study area of years 1997 2005 2011 and 2012 are illustrated in fig 3 tables a1 a4 in appendix a also displays the change matrix for each lulc class per each hectare during 1997 2005 2005 2011 2011 2017 and 1997 2017 the overall classification accuracy was found to be 91 29 90 06 96 38 and 99 39 and overall kappa statistics were 0 833 0 830 0 934 and 0 991 for the classification of 1997 2005 2011 and 2017 images respectively the findings obtained agree with mitri and gitas 2004 and ghurah et al 2018 those reported that the overall accuracy of the classification varied from 81 15 to 98 85 the findings of the four year analysis are listed in table 1 area and percentage of classes based on these findings show the patterns of lulc changed over 20 years changes in lulc groups in the areas studied have been increased and decreased as a reaction to different events such as cropland built up and bare soil areas as comparing between construction and cropland activities the built up areas were gradually and substantially increased over 1997 to 2017 and the increase percentages ranged from 16 66 to 23 91 it was at the expense of the cropland areas the reduction in cropland changes ranged from 0 9 to 19 34 over 1997 2017 and contributed to a steady decrease in cropland areas such results are consistent with shalaby 2012 who estimated that between 1992 and 2006 the built up areas increased from 1593 69 to 3671 04 km2 in the nile delta nevertheless the construction of new settlements and the demolition of illegal buildings that constructed on cropland areas in the last periods of 2011 2017 resulted in decreasing the built up areas by 1 3 a highlight need be also given to water bodies that have been reduced 40 in six years 2011 to 2017 this decrease triggered a 2 15 increase in the cropland sector the population growth in egypt was 18 52 13 06 and 13 27 respectively over the periods 1996 2006 2006 2011 2011 2017 campas demographics of egypt however for the selected governorates ad dakahliya kafr el sheikh and al gharbiya in this study the rates of increase were 15 30 15 09 and 15 10 over 1996 2006 and 16 20 16 29 and 15 61 over 2006 2015 and 10 22 7 91 6 91 over 2015 2018 cent agency public mobilization stat 2019 world population prospects population division united nations 2018 campas population in censuses 2016 campas statistical yearbook and population 2015 in the same direction the built up area increased over 1997 2017 while the bare soil water bodies and grassland decreased slowly as shown in table 1 this table also provides full information on the supervised classification of lulc groups for 1997 2005 2011 and 2017 images furthermore the reference and classification of total ground points non correction points and procedures and user accuracy are listed from tables a5 a8 3 2 crop coefficient and daily evapotranspiration before estimating crop evapotranspiration we calculated the average of monthly data of climatic factors minimum and maximum temperature solar radiation and precipitation during the growing season over the period 1997 2017 as illustrated in fig 4 the minimum air temperature is verified between january february months when it is close to 5 c from that a considerable increase is verified until may where maximum value is observed a very similar pattern is checked to the solar radiation on the other hand rainfall decreased from that january february months as expected due to be a climatic variable with high spatio temporal variability the rainfall was that variable which present the major variation between periods specially 2007 2011 compared to the others from those results through the growing season we calculated reference evapotranspiration and crop coefficients the results showed that the reference evapotranspiration eto values varied from 1 26 to 3 08 mm day from november to may over the period 1997 to 2001 from 1 37 to 4 16 mm day over 2002 2006 from 1 25 to 4 08 mm day over 2007 2011 and from 1 36 to 4 21 mm day over the period 2012 to 2017 the obtained results are in agreement with those obtained by abdelkhalek et al 2015 and el shirbeny et al 2014 on the other hand for modified kc equation calibration with suggested fao kc values ten years of crop coefficient data 1997 2007 were used the data from 2008 to 2017 were also used for testing fig 5 the relationship between kc equation adjusted and recommended kc values from fao is presented in fig 6 the coefficient of determination the slope and the intercept were 0 970 0 975 and 0 019 respectively as shown in fig 6 then we calculated daily evapotranspiration for wheat through the growing season such findings showed that the average etc values ranged from 1 12 to 4 33 1 31 4 08 1 13 4 03 and 1 32 4 18 over 1997 2001 2002 2006 2007 2011 and 2012 2017 respectively as shown in fig 7 the findings obtained in this study are in agreement with the observation of el shirbeny et al 2014 3 3 spatio temporal distributions of green and blue water evapotranspiration the units of green water evapotranspiration gwet and blue water evapotranspiration bwet of wheat varies across regions as shown in fig 8 and fig 9 over the period 1997 2017 gwet ranges from 34 25 mm to 77 15 mm during 1997 2001 and from 44 49 mm to 102 02 mm during 2002 2006 for talkha and sidi salim regions while it ranges from 27 53 mm to 59 38 mm during 2007 2011 and from 44 54 mm to 98 31 mm during 2012 2017 for al mahallah al kubra and sidi salim regions from analysis data of bwet the spatial distribution over the period 1997 to 2017 showed that bwet values slowly rose from 337 mm to 589 mm because of rising temperatures moreover the minimum and maximum values of bwet were located on the regions of sidi salim and al mahallah al kubra the mean bwet values of the sidi salim region were 336 60 403 13 427 35 and 494 35 mm over the four periods 1997 2001 2002 2006 2007 2011 and 2012 2017 respectively whereas the mean bwet values of the al mahallah al kubra region were 400 92 481 64 507 60 and 588 88 mm over the four periods these results are in agreement for kafr el sheikh region data with those obtained by abdelkhalek et al 2015 in general terms the higher values of et green predominate in the north part of delta nile while the et blue occurring more frequently in the south part in addition is most notable the increase over the years of et bluer than et green where the last et green shows an alternated behavior over the year that is increase in 2002 2006 in comparison to previous periods in 2007 2011 decreased and in the last period increase again 3 4 crop water use and water saving green water accounts are an important factor for saving the accounts of blue water requirements in the egyptian nile delta it has a large proportion in sidi salim disuq al hamul and ar riyad regions by 20 27 17 23 17 20 and 16 11 respectively as shown in fig 10 the bilqas and biyala regions were also the best locations to save blue water needs although these regions had low green water account compared to the selected locations as above for saving green water accounts green and blue colors of et and crop water use were calculated as shown above in section 2 4 results obtained from cropland areas using lulc the studied geographical areas calculations of gwet and bwet for the studied regions fig 11 table 2 we replaced the qutur and al mahallah al kubra kafr ash shaykh nabaruh and qallin talkha and disuq and samannud regions with al hamul sidi salem biyala bilqas and ar riyad regions respectively table 2 this strategy has superior values in terms of agricultural water management for the cultivation of wheat with saving water resources and high crop water productivity as compared to the remote strategies among all water consuming sectors agriculture is the largest water using sector across the globe thus this is the need of the time to increase the water productivity by saving already available water aquifers to ensure sustainable agriculture system we can utilize the high green water reservoirs for the best regions and at the same time save green and blue water reserves with 53 12 and 4 797 per hectare respectively on the other side in the non selected areas we can conserve green water accounts for other crops table 2 3 5 correlation analysis between water evapotranspiration climate and water supply the objective of regulating for increasing or decreasing wheat et proportions was to analyze its influencing factors in the actual observations we did not adjust the agronomic measurements of the wheat parameters however we studied the changes in the components of blue and green water and their composition under different climatic conditions as shown in fig 12 results of analysis showed a strong relationship between the water proportion color and precipitation pr the proportion of each water color exhibited a significant linear relationship with pr with rising pr the proportion of blue water bwp slowly decreases and at the same time the proportion of green water gwp increases for instance when the pr value was 85 mm the proportions of blue and green water were 83 and 17 respectively and must be the total percentage of 100 for two colors the coefficients of association between pr bwp and gwp hit 0 99 also it is important the use of agricultural practices to increase the use of rainfall water increase effective precipitation as for example construction of water reservoirs such findings showed that the blue water bw requirements in high precipitation regions can be substantially reduced these results coincide with xinchun et al 2018 in addition fig 13 displays scatter graphs between the relative irrigation supply ris indicator and water evapotranspiration colors ris showed a linear correlation with green water et and the large determination coefficient reached 0 99 whereas the quadratic relationship calculated the coefficient of determination for blue water et and it was 0 76 by increasing the green water et the ris increased from data analysis in contrast this indicator increased when the blue water et decreased the reason for this can be caused by several factors the utilization method of water supply seepage and evaporation lastly pr and ris indicators are of great importance for the management of limited water resources in egypt and the achievement of sustainable agricultural sector development 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of crop coefficients and evapotranspiration values with other studies crop coefficients kc values of wheat calculated based on the followed method in this study were compared to fao kc recommendations fao 2000 during 1997 2017 as illustrated in the results presented in section 3 2 fao s suggested values for the early mid and late stages of the crop are 0 7 1 15 and 0 4 kc values are appropriate with fao which through the growing season were 0 72 1 13 and 0 41 with a determination coefficient of 0 97 these findings are similar to those of farg et al 2012 they indicated that the determination coefficients r2 between combination of soil adjusted vegetation index savi and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi as spectral vegetation indices for estimating kc were 0 827 0 903 and 0 976 through initial mid and last growth stages respectively in addition these findings were better than pôças et al 2015 they found the r2 between reflectance based vegetation indices and soil water balance simdual model was 0 72 our results have achieved high performance compared to anwer et al 2016 they reported that the average relative error values between the approximate values of kc and fao were 36 29 also the results obtained are in line with elbeltagi et al 2020d who modeled kc values using minimum and maximum temperatures and solar radiation and produced satisfactory output with high accuracy and less statistical error additionally the calculated values of eto and etc through the growing season were compared with abdelkhalek et al 2015 they found the eto values ranged from 0 97 to 3 29 furthermore these values of eto have coincided with el shirbeny et al 2014 they found the values of eto ranging from 2 1 to 5 1 in the nile delta also the etc values for wheat were compared with abdelkhalek et al 2015 they concluded that the actual monthly evapotranspiration values based on the hargreaves method varied from 1 13 to 4 24 mm day also these results coincide with bakhsh 2018 who computed the spatio temporal water demand of wheat using gis and remote sensing and reported that the values of kc were ranged from 0 35 to 1 13 etc varied from 0 30 to 2 49 mm day and water demand was an average of 245 mm the proposed method in this study is simple compared to the other studies kumari 2017 bakhsh 2018 which used crop water productivity models to calculate eto and etc of wheat and these models need additional data for climate factors such as wind speed sunshine hours and humidity 4 2 managing green and blue evapotranspiration within egyptian nile delta green water has a high proportion of water evapotranspiration we found the ratio of precipitation to water accounts high it means that in the best areas climate precipitation contributes with a high percentage of human activities water supply relative to the other places in the future attention should be paid to using green water accounts in water stressed locations which is an important way of alleviating the stress of water scarcity in egypt these findings are in accordance with xinchun et al 2018 who assessed the water footprint for crop production based on field measurements over the 2011 2014 period and found that the high relationships between precipitation and proportions of green and blue water footprints were 0 79 and 0 93 respectively also we calculated the blue water evapotranspiration and found that the results of kafr ash shaykh region are in agreement with the observations of abdelkhalek et al 2015 they found that total water applied values ranged from 477 8 to 564 8 mm and from 481 8 to 558 0 mm during two growing seasons of wheat crop 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 respectively 5 recommendations and conclusions 5 1 recommendations for saving water the best regions for high proportions of green water and a low proportion of blue water accounts were selected so it is necessary to construct water reservoirs for rainwater harvesting and recycling to facilitate the use of rainwater in addition the planting and harvesting dates for the selected regions should be carefully arranged for optimum use of green water accounts furthermore we can use green water accounts while at the same time saving the high proportion that blue water accounts for the other locations for growing crops that did not suffer from a shortage of requirements for blue water additionally after choosing the best regions water saving technologies should be established that can increase the efficiency of blue water usage for a long time like drip irrigation or using water absorption materials next to the plant s root considering that the cost of blue water was much higher than green water particularly in regions with water scarcity so government and policy makers should consider the degree of water deficit water prices economic criteria and the requirements of food security in future water management in the agricultural sector on the other hand increasing water supply weeding and preserving soil moisture developing a hybrid ecological system include agriculture forestry and animal husbandry and water saving technology such as engineering agronomy and management can save the water resources in the rainy seasons and relief the drought in the dry seasons mokhtar et al 2020 also the government and policy makers have to support the rain flood utilization seawater desalination improvements in water delivery systems alternative plants water conservation through efficient irrigation and effective drought management practices to face the future water resources shrinkages 5 2 conclusions this paper describes the use of gis and remote sensing tools for the management of water resources in the egyptian nile delta monthly precipitation minimum and maximum temperatures and solar radiation over the period 1997 to 2017 are the parameters involved in the proposed method the values of these parameters were extracted from gis raster for thirteen regions in the three governorates reference evapotranspiration was calculated based on only those values through the growing season on top of that the wheat crop coefficient was estimated using air temperature and crop base temperature the kc values obtained have been validated using the recommended fao kc data then green and blue water evapotranspiration of wheat were estimated and mapped for all regions furthermore land use land cover types and the changed detection were analyzed to study the effect of the increased population growth on land use especially on cropland areas then crop water use for both colors was estimated and crop water saved was calculated according to mapping crop water evapotranspiration for each region from the data analysis with the limited resources in egypt sidi salim bilqas ar riyad al hamul and biyala were the best regions for water conservation and sustainable development in the agricultural sector also precipitation is an important climatic factor in estimating the proportions of the green and blue water on the other hand relative irrigation supply is a good indicator to determine the green and blue water evapotranspiration this approach relies on spatial and temporal analysis for regions of study that have no weather stations and with the more reliable results we recommended it to be used for water resources management we will develop a model based on present proposed study for managing and scheduling evapotranspiration based on gis and remote sensing tools it will simulate and analyze the currently available historical data and predict future water evapotranspiration furthermore it will be available on the website for water policy planners and helped them in selecting the best regions as a precise model for making the right decisions for optimal use of water this point is an interesting approach to future water management especially in egypt to mitigate water scarcity credit authorship contribution

4897,assessing green and blue water evapotranspiration gwet and bwet is the key to water resources management and improving water productivity this study focuses on assessing evaluating and managing evapotranspiration in egyptian nile delta over 1997 2017 for thirteen regions the monthly data of minimum and maximum temperatures precipitation and solar radiation from november to may were derived from open access data for calculation of reference evapotranspiration and rainfall accounts wheat crop coefficient kc values were estimated using the air temperature and base temperature of crop gwet and bwet were calculated and mapped for each region in the arcgis environment land use land cover lulc was analyzed during 1997 2005 2011 and 2017 using landsat images the main findings of the research are as follows 1 average values of crop coefficients kc init kc mid and kc end were 0 72 1 13 and 0 41 through initial middle and end growing seasons respectively 2 the best regions for saving green and blue water were sidi salim bilqas ar riyad al hamul and biyala 3 the total water saved was 4 80 and 53 12 of blue and green water accounts 4 high coefficients of determination between precipitation gwet and bwet proportions were 0 99 for both furthermore relative irrigation supply is a good indicator for predicting gwet and bwet with determination coefficients of 0 99 and 0 76 respectively it can be concluded that the data integration of geographic information and lulc changes is the best way for water management and sustainable agro system development under limited water resources keywords green evapotranspiration blue evapotranspiration water saving water management land use land cover 1 introduction the continuously increasing world s population which is expected to 9 2 billion by 2050 requires an ever increasing demand of water and it s expected that climate change will increase the water demand by an average of 5 eid 1999 wwap united nations world water assessment programme 2015 the agricultural system is one of the largest consumers of the world s water which covers about 70 80 of water resources elbeltagi et al 2020a 2020b 2020c molden 2013 many regions in the world are facing the problem of water scarcity and increased competition for water among agriculture livestock fisheries forestry energy and other sectors due to the continuous decline in the water resources biswas et al 2009 deb and kiem 2020 in some cases the future projections of decreasing water availability reach 70 el quosy 2008 therefore integrated water management and planning for different water resources is the key to develop a sustainable agricultural system in the coming years recently two evapotranspiration colors namely green and blue are increasingly used in agricultural water management green water evapotranspiration etgreen is a fractionating process of rainwater stored in soil and obtainable for crop evapotranspiration during plant growth which is corresponding to the effective precipitation peff blue water evapotranspiration etblue is defined as the gross water added for irrigation that draws freshwater from underground reservoirs and surface supplies over growing periods from planting to harvesting madugundu et al 2018 in egypt 55 5 1 6 2 4 and 6 5 bcm yr are currently accessible water supplies from nile river peff non renewable groundwater western desert and groundwater respectively the difference between demands and existing water accounts is 13 5 bcm yr omar and moussa 2016 arab republic of egypt 2017 according to the food and agriculture organization fao on water and agriculture for 1997 2002 2007 2012 and 2014 total annual internal renewable water resources per capita were 27 8 25 4 23 2 21 and 19 7 m3 respectively fao aquastat 2017 moreover the water share per capita was 909 10 963 20 and 910 6 m3 during 1995 2000 and 2010 respectively the definition of water management sustainability refers to all practices which improve crop productivity and minimize water losses additionally the expansion of cultivated areas is steadily increasing and water sources are the limiting factor abdrabbo et al 2016 so this study focuses on water resources management in the agriculture sector because it is consuming on average 85 of limited water share elnmer et al 2015 the first parameter is actual crop evapotranspiration as an important role in environmental hydrological and agricultural practices and plays a key role in managing and designing irrigation systems under fully irrigated and rain fed farming djaman et al 2015 liu et al 2019 the second parameter is rainfall levels and how to exploit this source for beneficial purposes many existing approaches have been applied using crop water models based on meteorological data geographical information system gis and remote sensing to estimate reference and actual evapotranspiration borse et al 2017 ramírez cuesta et al 2017 velpuri and senay 2017 casella et al 2018 babel et al 2019 also adamala et al 2016 assessed crop coefficients based on the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi of bare soil and full cover dense vegetation of crops in this study we calculated the crop coefficient kc and evapotranspiration using the thermal unit and solar radiation and evaluated kc values with recommended fao data recent studies have applied several water saving methods for example karandish and šimůnek 2019 have used various strategies such as a comparison of saltmed and hydrus models to investigate the effect of water saving treatments on crop status in addition deligios et al 2018 concluded the combination of evaporative cooling practice can be optimized to save water 34 besides the assessment of irrigation performance represented a potential water saving of 34 to 39 miao et al 2015 while hu et al 2010 combined crop growth data with groundwater model and their finding exhibited that 29 2 or 135 7 mm reduction in water could prevent groundwater drawdown and grain yield loss is less than 10 as a result of water saving furthermore campos et al 2003 applied simulation model isareg and stated the adoption of new calendars and reducing the number of irrigations could save water more than 33 the objective of this study was to analyze dynamics of green and blue water resources in nile delta egypt using gis and remote sensing tools map and manage water evapotranspiration to optimize freshwater use and rainfall benefits generate valuable information for water users and planners towards freshwater and rainfall amounts to conserve agricultural water use and achieve sustainable growth under limited water supplies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the nile delta is the delta formed in northern egypt lower egypt where the nile river spreads out and flows into the mediterranean sea it is one of the world s largest river deltas from west alexandria to east port said it covers 240 km of coastline in the mediterranean and is a rich agricultural region the nile delta occupies only around 2 of egypt s total area but accounts for about 63 of its agricultural activities shalaby and tateishi 2007 most populated egyptian governorates whereas approximately 50 of the population lives in nile delta haars et al 2016 the research area covers thirteen rural regions within the three governorates ad dakahliya al gharbiya and kafr el sheikh in the nile delta egypt as shown in fig 1 we picked three regions from the governorate of ad dakahliya bilqas nabaruh and talkha three from the governorate of al gharbiya al mahalaha kubra qutur and samannud in addition seven were selected from the governorate of kafr ash shaykh biyala ar riyad al hamul disuq kafr ash shaykh sidi salim and qallin wheat crop as winter crop was selected in this study because its production does not meet the current demand planting and harvest dates for the wheat crop were from november to may according to the fao allen et al 1998 2 2 spatial and temporal climate data environmental systems research institute esri arc gis software was used as a tool to collect the monthly data of maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation and precipitation for 7 months from november to may with a spatial resolution of approximately 4 km2 over the period from 1997 to 2017 maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation data were collected from the climatic research unit cru ts 4 0 as netcdf format abatzoglou et al 2018 furthermore solar radiation data was collected from japanese reanalysis jra 55 as netcdf format kobayashi et al 2015 the cru ts 4 0 source provides average monthly data of minimum and maximum temperature and cumulative rainfall for the global land surface at a grid of 0 5 the jra 55 provides complete spatio temporal data covering the period from 1958 till today the methodological flowchart of determining the green and blue water evapotranspiration and crop water use is provided in fig 2 we selected this period from 1997 to 2017 precisely because all the necessary data are available 2 3 land use and land cover lulc analysis 2 3 1 data collection the following three landsat sensors were used landsat 5 tm landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli tirs path 177 row 38 30 m spatial resolution these images have been downloaded from the website of the usgs earth explorer https earthexplorer usgs gov two images of landsat 5 were used in which the image data consist of seven bands with wavelengths ranging from 450 nm to 2350 nm the image data of landsat 7 consist of eight bands with wavelengths from 450 nm to 2350 nm moreover landsat 8 image data is composed of 11 spectral bands four images with different dates i e 04 12 1997 24 11 2005 09 01 2011 and 26 02 2017 were used to investigate the impact of rising population growth on lulc changes particularly in cropland areas 2 3 2 image pre processing and classification the first pre processing operation for landsat images was the radiometric calibration using envi 5 3 software exelis visual information solutions boulder colorado after that the atmospheric correction was done for data of the four landsat images subtraction model was applied for atmospheric image correction and layer stacking was the final step through the selected bands and subsequently the area of study was a subset envi 5 3 software for unsupervised and supervised classifications was used for analyzing landsat images the iterative self organizing iso algorithm was selected for the identification of the classes in the study area in unsupervised classification the supervised classification was performed based on the maximum likelihood algorithm in envi 5 3 software chowdhury et al 2018 supervised classifications were implemented through the google earth engine platform as a high spatial resolution image six separate types of lulc were classified cropland built up area water body grass natural vegetation sand land and bare soil 2 3 3 accuracy assessment images classification accuracy assessment was performed during 1997 2005 2011 and 2017 to determine the accuracy of the improvements to the classified lulc if the classification data is to be useful in the study of the detection of changes and accuracy evaluation for individual classification is necessary owojori and xie 2003 the kappa analysis and overall accuracy were carried out to classify the accuracy level using the random points we randomly selected at least 100 points for every land use class based on visual interpretation and ground truth data then those points were checked on the developed lulc map the statistical comparison of the classified results and reference data was done using error matrix approach the post classification change detection technique performed in envi 5 3 software was chosen for use in this study to describe the area and percentage of lulc classes in the study area a confusion matrix was employed using ground truth 2 4 blue and green evapotranspiration and crop water use to calculate the evapotranspiration of blue water we estimated the reference evapotranspiration based on the fao s suggested hargreaves model eq 1 this method was used because the parameters necessary to calculate the penman monteith pm model are not available hargreaves and allen 2003 aguilar et al 2011 fooladmand and zandilak 2008 patel et al 2014 raziei and pereira 2013 the benefit of the hargreaves model hm over pm is that it requires only minimum and maximum temperatures and readily obtainable data on solar radiation from the gis raster datasets as seen in section 2 2 above 1 e t o 0 0023 r a t m e a n 17 8 t m a x t m i n where tmean is the average of temperature oc tmax is the maximum temperature tmin is the minimum temperature and ra is the solar radiation mm month the crop coefficient was determined using the thermal unit according to eq 2 given by sammis et al 1985 the equation established was equivalent to 0 12 for c value through the growing season particularly for maize crop however in this study values of c were modified to match the wheat crop c values were 0 05 for early stage 0 5 for the stem extension stage 0 63 for the heading stage and 0 38 for the late stage we calibrated this equation over the period 1997 2007 to evaluate the performance level for calculating crop coefficients and the validation was from 2008 to 2017 2 k c c 0 00168 t u 2 45 10 7 t u 2 4 37 10 10 t u 3 where c is constant depend on the growth stage tu is a thermal unit as shown in eq 3 calculated based on air temperature and base temperature threshold of crop 4 7 c according to agrometeorological centre of excellence 2018 baker and reddy 2001 bautista capetillo et al 2013 djaman et al 2018 grigorieva et al 2010 salama et al 2015 3 t u i 1 n t m a x t m i n 2 t b a s e then crop evapotranspiration was calculated by multiplying reference evapotranspiration through the growing season by the crop coefficient etc eto kc effective rainfall is also specified as the portion of the total amount of rainfall which was calculated according to kuo et al 2006 4 p e f f p t o t 125 0 2 p t o t 125 where peff is the effective precipitation mm and ptot is the total precipitation mm from the above all equations we calculated green and blue evapotranspiration as shown in the following equations velpuri and senay 2017 also green and blue crop water use were determined by multiplying green and blue water evapotranspiration through the growing season by 10 romaguera et al 2010 xinchun et al 2018 5 et total g w e t b w e t 6 bwet m a x 0 et c p eff 7 gwet m i n et c p eff where gwet et green is evapotranspiration of precipitation equal to the minimum differences between the total etc and peff and bwet et blue is evapotranspiration of actual water applied equal to the maximum differences between the total etc and peff water saving was calculated by selecting the regions containing high percentage of green water accounts in order to maximize the blue water use the water saving efficiency depends on lulc results of cropland areas and calculation of the gwet and bwet for study regions to estimate the viability of a strategy of replacing the regions to increase the crop production and save high amounts of water simultaneously furthermore the blue water saving accounts were calculated as the difference between the selected and non selected regions along with the green water saving accounts for the non selected regions for other activities finally we calculated the relative irrigation supply ris indicator for predicting green and blue water resources levine 1982 greaves 2007 this indicator is the ratio of the total volume of water and total hypothetical water requirements calculated per growing season this indicator has become a powerful tool in managing water rodríguez díaz et al 2008 8 r i s w a g 10 e t c p e f f where wag m3 ha 1 is the actual amount of irrigation water applied that is equal to the sum of blue evapotranspiration during the growing season and leaching requirements as 10 from crop water requirements according to fao 2000 the ris values below 1 indicate the water shortage whereas the values above 1 indicate that excess water under normal conditions the values close to 1 2 are sufficient to avoid the deficit in the water supply gonzález perea et al 2018 3 results 3 1 lulc change detection in egyptian nile delta the classified lulc map of the study area of years 1997 2005 2011 and 2012 are illustrated in fig 3 tables a1 a4 in appendix a also displays the change matrix for each lulc class per each hectare during 1997 2005 2005 2011 2011 2017 and 1997 2017 the overall classification accuracy was found to be 91 29 90 06 96 38 and 99 39 and overall kappa statistics were 0 833 0 830 0 934 and 0 991 for the classification of 1997 2005 2011 and 2017 images respectively the findings obtained agree with mitri and gitas 2004 and ghurah et al 2018 those reported that the overall accuracy of the classification varied from 81 15 to 98 85 the findings of the four year analysis are listed in table 1 area and percentage of classes based on these findings show the patterns of lulc changed over 20 years changes in lulc groups in the areas studied have been increased and decreased as a reaction to different events such as cropland built up and bare soil areas as comparing between construction and cropland activities the built up areas were gradually and substantially increased over 1997 to 2017 and the increase percentages ranged from 16 66 to 23 91 it was at the expense of the cropland areas the reduction in cropland changes ranged from 0 9 to 19 34 over 1997 2017 and contributed to a steady decrease in cropland areas such results are consistent with shalaby 2012 who estimated that between 1992 and 2006 the built up areas increased from 1593 69 to 3671 04 km2 in the nile delta nevertheless the construction of new settlements and the demolition of illegal buildings that constructed on cropland areas in the last periods of 2011 2017 resulted in decreasing the built up areas by 1 3 a highlight need be also given to water bodies that have been reduced 40 in six years 2011 to 2017 this decrease triggered a 2 15 increase in the cropland sector the population growth in egypt was 18 52 13 06 and 13 27 respectively over the periods 1996 2006 2006 2011 2011 2017 campas demographics of egypt however for the selected governorates ad dakahliya kafr el sheikh and al gharbiya in this study the rates of increase were 15 30 15 09 and 15 10 over 1996 2006 and 16 20 16 29 and 15 61 over 2006 2015 and 10 22 7 91 6 91 over 2015 2018 cent agency public mobilization stat 2019 world population prospects population division united nations 2018 campas population in censuses 2016 campas statistical yearbook and population 2015 in the same direction the built up area increased over 1997 2017 while the bare soil water bodies and grassland decreased slowly as shown in table 1 this table also provides full information on the supervised classification of lulc groups for 1997 2005 2011 and 2017 images furthermore the reference and classification of total ground points non correction points and procedures and user accuracy are listed from tables a5 a8 3 2 crop coefficient and daily evapotranspiration before estimating crop evapotranspiration we calculated the average of monthly data of climatic factors minimum and maximum temperature solar radiation and precipitation during the growing season over the period 1997 2017 as illustrated in fig 4 the minimum air temperature is verified between january february months when it is close to 5 c from that a considerable increase is verified until may where maximum value is observed a very similar pattern is checked to the solar radiation on the other hand rainfall decreased from that january february months as expected due to be a climatic variable with high spatio temporal variability the rainfall was that variable which present the major variation between periods specially 2007 2011 compared to the others from those results through the growing season we calculated reference evapotranspiration and crop coefficients the results showed that the reference evapotranspiration eto values varied from 1 26 to 3 08 mm day from november to may over the period 1997 to 2001 from 1 37 to 4 16 mm day over 2002 2006 from 1 25 to 4 08 mm day over 2007 2011 and from 1 36 to 4 21 mm day over the period 2012 to 2017 the obtained results are in agreement with those obtained by abdelkhalek et al 2015 and el shirbeny et al 2014 on the other hand for modified kc equation calibration with suggested fao kc values ten years of crop coefficient data 1997 2007 were used the data from 2008 to 2017 were also used for testing fig 5 the relationship between kc equation adjusted and recommended kc values from fao is presented in fig 6 the coefficient of determination the slope and the intercept were 0 970 0 975 and 0 019 respectively as shown in fig 6 then we calculated daily evapotranspiration for wheat through the growing season such findings showed that the average etc values ranged from 1 12 to 4 33 1 31 4 08 1 13 4 03 and 1 32 4 18 over 1997 2001 2002 2006 2007 2011 and 2012 2017 respectively as shown in fig 7 the findings obtained in this study are in agreement with the observation of el shirbeny et al 2014 3 3 spatio temporal distributions of green and blue water evapotranspiration the units of green water evapotranspiration gwet and blue water evapotranspiration bwet of wheat varies across regions as shown in fig 8 and fig 9 over the period 1997 2017 gwet ranges from 34 25 mm to 77 15 mm during 1997 2001 and from 44 49 mm to 102 02 mm during 2002 2006 for talkha and sidi salim regions while it ranges from 27 53 mm to 59 38 mm during 2007 2011 and from 44 54 mm to 98 31 mm during 2012 2017 for al mahallah al kubra and sidi salim regions from analysis data of bwet the spatial distribution over the period 1997 to 2017 showed that bwet values slowly rose from 337 mm to 589 mm because of rising temperatures moreover the minimum and maximum values of bwet were located on the regions of sidi salim and al mahallah al kubra the mean bwet values of the sidi salim region were 336 60 403 13 427 35 and 494 35 mm over the four periods 1997 2001 2002 2006 2007 2011 and 2012 2017 respectively whereas the mean bwet values of the al mahallah al kubra region were 400 92 481 64 507 60 and 588 88 mm over the four periods these results are in agreement for kafr el sheikh region data with those obtained by abdelkhalek et al 2015 in general terms the higher values of et green predominate in the north part of delta nile while the et blue occurring more frequently in the south part in addition is most notable the increase over the years of et bluer than et green where the last et green shows an alternated behavior over the year that is increase in 2002 2006 in comparison to previous periods in 2007 2011 decreased and in the last period increase again 3 4 crop water use and water saving green water accounts are an important factor for saving the accounts of blue water requirements in the egyptian nile delta it has a large proportion in sidi salim disuq al hamul and ar riyad regions by 20 27 17 23 17 20 and 16 11 respectively as shown in fig 10 the bilqas and biyala regions were also the best locations to save blue water needs although these regions had low green water account compared to the selected locations as above for saving green water accounts green and blue colors of et and crop water use were calculated as shown above in section 2 4 results obtained from cropland areas using lulc the studied geographical areas calculations of gwet and bwet for the studied regions fig 11 table 2 we replaced the qutur and al mahallah al kubra kafr ash shaykh nabaruh and qallin talkha and disuq and samannud regions with al hamul sidi salem biyala bilqas and ar riyad regions respectively table 2 this strategy has superior values in terms of agricultural water management for the cultivation of wheat with saving water resources and high crop water productivity as compared to the remote strategies among all water consuming sectors agriculture is the largest water using sector across the globe thus this is the need of the time to increase the water productivity by saving already available water aquifers to ensure sustainable agriculture system we can utilize the high green water reservoirs for the best regions and at the same time save green and blue water reserves with 53 12 and 4 797 per hectare respectively on the other side in the non selected areas we can conserve green water accounts for other crops table 2 3 5 correlation analysis between water evapotranspiration climate and water supply the objective of regulating for increasing or decreasing wheat et proportions was to analyze its influencing factors in the actual observations we did not adjust the agronomic measurements of the wheat parameters however we studied the changes in the components of blue and green water and their composition under different climatic conditions as shown in fig 12 results of analysis showed a strong relationship between the water proportion color and precipitation pr the proportion of each water color exhibited a significant linear relationship with pr with rising pr the proportion of blue water bwp slowly decreases and at the same time the proportion of green water gwp increases for instance when the pr value was 85 mm the proportions of blue and green water were 83 and 17 respectively and must be the total percentage of 100 for two colors the coefficients of association between pr bwp and gwp hit 0 99 also it is important the use of agricultural practices to increase the use of rainfall water increase effective precipitation as for example construction of water reservoirs such findings showed that the blue water bw requirements in high precipitation regions can be substantially reduced these results coincide with xinchun et al 2018 in addition fig 13 displays scatter graphs between the relative irrigation supply ris indicator and water evapotranspiration colors ris showed a linear correlation with green water et and the large determination coefficient reached 0 99 whereas the quadratic relationship calculated the coefficient of determination for blue water et and it was 0 76 by increasing the green water et the ris increased from data analysis in contrast this indicator increased when the blue water et decreased the reason for this can be caused by several factors the utilization method of water supply seepage and evaporation lastly pr and ris indicators are of great importance for the management of limited water resources in egypt and the achievement of sustainable agricultural sector development 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of crop coefficients and evapotranspiration values with other studies crop coefficients kc values of wheat calculated based on the followed method in this study were compared to fao kc recommendations fao 2000 during 1997 2017 as illustrated in the results presented in section 3 2 fao s suggested values for the early mid and late stages of the crop are 0 7 1 15 and 0 4 kc values are appropriate with fao which through the growing season were 0 72 1 13 and 0 41 with a determination coefficient of 0 97 these findings are similar to those of farg et al 2012 they indicated that the determination coefficients r2 between combination of soil adjusted vegetation index savi and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi as spectral vegetation indices for estimating kc were 0 827 0 903 and 0 976 through initial mid and last growth stages respectively in addition these findings were better than pôças et al 2015 they found the r2 between reflectance based vegetation indices and soil water balance simdual model was 0 72 our results have achieved high performance compared to anwer et al 2016 they reported that the average relative error values between the approximate values of kc and fao were 36 29 also the results obtained are in line with elbeltagi et al 2020d who modeled kc values using minimum and maximum temperatures and solar radiation and produced satisfactory output with high accuracy and less statistical error additionally the calculated values of eto and etc through the growing season were compared with abdelkhalek et al 2015 they found the eto values ranged from 0 97 to 3 29 furthermore these values of eto have coincided with el shirbeny et al 2014 they found the values of eto ranging from 2 1 to 5 1 in the nile delta also the etc values for wheat were compared with abdelkhalek et al 2015 they concluded that the actual monthly evapotranspiration values based on the hargreaves method varied from 1 13 to 4 24 mm day also these results coincide with bakhsh 2018 who computed the spatio temporal water demand of wheat using gis and remote sensing and reported that the values of kc were ranged from 0 35 to 1 13 etc varied from 0 30 to 2 49 mm day and water demand was an average of 245 mm the proposed method in this study is simple compared to the other studies kumari 2017 bakhsh 2018 which used crop water productivity models to calculate eto and etc of wheat and these models need additional data for climate factors such as wind speed sunshine hours and humidity 4 2 managing green and blue evapotranspiration within egyptian nile delta green water has a high proportion of water evapotranspiration we found the ratio of precipitation to water accounts high it means that in the best areas climate precipitation contributes with a high percentage of human activities water supply relative to the other places in the future attention should be paid to using green water accounts in water stressed locations which is an important way of alleviating the stress of water scarcity in egypt these findings are in accordance with xinchun et al 2018 who assessed the water footprint for crop production based on field measurements over the 2011 2014 period and found that the high relationships between precipitation and proportions of green and blue water footprints were 0 79 and 0 93 respectively also we calculated the blue water evapotranspiration and found that the results of kafr ash shaykh region are in agreement with the observations of abdelkhalek et al 2015 they found that total water applied values ranged from 477 8 to 564 8 mm and from 481 8 to 558 0 mm during two growing seasons of wheat crop 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 respectively 5 recommendations and conclusions 5 1 recommendations for saving water the best regions for high proportions of green water and a low proportion of blue water accounts were selected so it is necessary to construct water reservoirs for rainwater harvesting and recycling to facilitate the use of rainwater in addition the planting and harvesting dates for the selected regions should be carefully arranged for optimum use of green water accounts furthermore we can use green water accounts while at the same time saving the high proportion that blue water accounts for the other locations for growing crops that did not suffer from a shortage of requirements for blue water additionally after choosing the best regions water saving technologies should be established that can increase the efficiency of blue water usage for a long time like drip irrigation or using water absorption materials next to the plant s root considering that the cost of blue water was much higher than green water particularly in regions with water scarcity so government and policy makers should consider the degree of water deficit water prices economic criteria and the requirements of food security in future water management in the agricultural sector on the other hand increasing water supply weeding and preserving soil moisture developing a hybrid ecological system include agriculture forestry and animal husbandry and water saving technology such as engineering agronomy and management can save the water resources in the rainy seasons and relief the drought in the dry seasons mokhtar et al 2020 also the government and policy makers have to support the rain flood utilization seawater desalination improvements in water delivery systems alternative plants water conservation through efficient irrigation and effective drought management practices to face the future water resources shrinkages 5 2 conclusions this paper describes the use of gis and remote sensing tools for the management of water resources in the egyptian nile delta monthly precipitation minimum and maximum temperatures and solar radiation over the period 1997 to 2017 are the parameters involved in the proposed method the values of these parameters were extracted from gis raster for thirteen regions in the three governorates reference evapotranspiration was calculated based on only those values through the growing season on top of that the wheat crop coefficient was estimated using air temperature and crop base temperature the kc values obtained have been validated using the recommended fao kc data then green and blue water evapotranspiration of wheat were estimated and mapped for all regions furthermore land use land cover types and the changed detection were analyzed to study the effect of the increased population growth on land use especially on cropland areas then crop water use for both colors was estimated and crop water saved was calculated according to mapping crop water evapotranspiration for each region from the data analysis with the limited resources in egypt sidi salim bilqas ar riyad al hamul and biyala were the best regions for water conservation and sustainable development in the agricultural sector also precipitation is an important climatic factor in estimating the proportions of the green and blue water on the other hand relative irrigation supply is a good indicator to determine the green and blue water evapotranspiration this approach relies on spatial and temporal analysis for regions of study that have no weather stations and with the more reliable results we recommended it to be used for water resources management we will develop a model based on present proposed study for managing and scheduling evapotranspiration based on gis and remote sensing tools it will simulate and analyze the currently available historical data and predict future water evapotranspiration furthermore it will be available on the website for water policy planners and helped them in selecting the best regions as a precise model for making the right decisions for optimal use of water this point is an interesting approach to future water management especially in egypt to mitigate water scarcity credit authorship contribution

4898,result based management rbm has been used as a new management approach for groundwater resources planning based on this approach three levels of results including outputs aquifer stability outcomes positive balance and impacts aquifer restoration have been considered in this study to monitor these levels three indicators based on sustainability filling and restoration definitions are given to describe the associated rbm aquifer restoration problems in this study a combined simulation optimization model has been developed using a modflow based numerical simulation model and a parallel evolutionary algorithm of continuous ant colony optimization the model has been applied to a real case study of namdan aquifer located in fars province iran over a planning horizon of 10 years three levels of outputs outcomes and impacts have been achieved and the effectiveness of rbm approach in groundwater resources management has been assessed the important observations are 1 the planning based on the management problems of sustainability filling and restoration indicators leads to an increase in the groundwater elevation by 3 9 47 and 10 61 m at the end of management period in comparison with the beginning of the period 2 the planning based on the restoration indicator causes the highest level of rise in groundwater elevation and reaches the restoration target as highlighting the significance of a proper management setup to achieve the proposed target 3 the investigations based on reliability utility and vulnerability indicators show the improvement of aquifer restoration status over the results chain the methodology given in this study can be a novel approach to the realistic management of groundwater resources considering the proposed targets while it can be improved by the involvement of stakeholders and beneficiaries in rbm implementation keywords result based management groundwater parallel simulation optimization model iran nomenclature h i

introduction water supply for sustainable development is one of the essential concerns for many parts of the world especially in the middle east aquifers are accessible resource of water in all regions with different climates undp 2010 groundwater depletion due to excessive groundwater pumping is a significant problem poses many severe challenges to groundwater resources sustainability in iran moe 2014 frwo 2016 hosseini et al 2019 lack of management plans or mismanagement of aquifers could have the disastrous effects on groundwater resources the main causes of this problem include over exploitation from aquifers as an unlimited source making decisions based on the results obtained from the simulation of aquifers with incomplete or inappropriate conceptual models and improper setup of management problems mahmoodzadeh et al 2014 singh 2014 timani and peralta 2015 ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a 2015b therefore the protection of aquifers against over exploitation and ensuring their renewability require the establishment of proper management plans there is always a concern about the success of management plans based on proposed targets achievement hence this concern has attracted the attention of water resources planners and managers towards new methods such as result based management rbm approach to continually follow the targets of management plans undg 2011 lamhauge et al 2013 rbm approach is derived from the experiences of the united nations organizations for effective management and cost optimization in this approach all positive aspects are used to ensure that organizations not only achieve the proposed results but also manage their inputs and activities this approach is a developed paradigm of implementation based management approach which focuses on proper implementation and does not provide managers with timely and accurate data on the success and failure of program there are different issues in rbm approach such as focusing on the results at different levels of outputs outcomes and impacts following them by indicators providing an appropriate knowledge of the success and failure of the programs and improving the achievement of results rbm includes several steps such as planning management monitoring evaluation reporting learning and decision making also it consists of several concepts including results chain performance measurement and logical framework or results matrix of the program in this approach results chain is presented as a set of logically connected results and the results of each step are collected to produce the results of the next step this chain includes the outputs resulted from of activities the outcomes resulted from a collection of outputs and the impacts produced by outcomes performance measurement regular planning using performance data and needed judgment are usually conducted based on indicators in this approach the results matrix is used to provide a summary of the program in a standard format undg 2011 arif et al 2015 more information about rbm approach is available in undg 2011 a few studies have been conducted in this context lamhauge et al 2013 provided the frameworks of monitoring and evaluation for adaptation to climate change using the experiences of development agencies cooperation in the context of rbm approach adaptability activities were divided into five different groups and assessments were conducted at different levels of results for each activity i e outputs outcomes and impacts then a separate indicator was defined to follow the results throughout the program their results showed that rbm is an appropriate framework for monitoring and evaluation of adaptation programs and projects arif et al 2015 used a variety of traditional methods of public sector oversight with rbm approach in the school community in pakistan their results showed that the use of this approach could result in better findings compared to previous methods chang 2006 used the rbm programming with the aim of national development planning in the education sector and showed that this approach could improve the educational planning the results also showed that in the preliminary planning steps computer simulations could show improvement in medium to long term educational financial and physical consequences according to the reviewed literature rbm approach has not been considered for groundwater resources management decision models are one of the appropriate and efficient tools for managing groundwater resources and one of the best structures is the combined framework of simulation optimization models so evaluation on the results of managerial options using an appropriate simulator and selecting the best management strategy using an optimization tool concerning physical or managerial constraints are the primary purposes of so models singh and datta 2006 ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a 2015b such models have been widely used for different groundwater management problems such as aquifer restoration maskey et al 2002 pumping optimization ayvaz and karahan 2008 ataie ashtiani et al 2014 aquifer quality protection sreekanth and datta 2010 hussain et al 2015 benefit maximization ayvaz and elci 2013 ayvaz 2009 ghadimi and ketabchi 2019 and aquifer artificial recharge makkawi 2015 many studies with different objectives have used combined simulation optimization models as a necessary aquifer management tool see table 1 as a summary of some of them in the simulation component of so models mathematical equations governing groundwater system have been solved using various numerical methods such as modflow sedki and ouazar 2011 ayvaz and elci 2013 and sutra ataie ashtiani et al 2014 mostafaei avandari and ketabchi 2020 in the optimization component of so models a variety of evolutionary algorithms have been used such as genetic algorithm sedki and ouazar 2011 ataie ashtiani et al 2014 ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a 2015b and continuous ant colony optimization caco ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a 2015b ghadimi and ketabchi 2019 the values of groundwater extractions are the common decision variable in the literature which may be spatially and temporally varied zekri et al 2015 kawo et al 2018 yin et al 2020 while some studies have focused on the location or number of pumping wells ayvaz and elci 2013 yin et al 2020 review of studies on groundwater resources management using so models is shown that in defining the management problem the focus is more on the activities and how they are performed rather than the proposed targets decisions based on such management problems make the targets success and achievement to be unclear as seen in table 1 the application of rbm approach with the aim of groundwater resources management was not found in the reviewed literature as in rbm approach the focus on targets short term mid term and long term results and the monitoring indicator is taken into account while they are consistently linked together with results chain each step can be followed by success and failure indicators in this study rbm as a new managerial approach is used to describe the chain of problems on groundwater restoration problems a modflow based model of namdan aquifer located in fars province iran is prepared as a simulator and caco algorithm is used as an optimization tool in the computational platform of a decision model for the first time considering the proposed targets to overcome the large computational burden of the developed so a parallel processing technique is implemented based on a methodology presented in ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a b 2 methodology a flowchart of a decision model for the implementation of rbm approach is presented in fig 1 this figure schematically shows how the optimization algorithm executes the simulation model considering constraints and value of objective function and then updates decision variables in this framework the optimization algorithm calls the simulation model iteratively to numerically simulate the given condition then evaluate the objective function values and finally update decision variables this process is repeated until the stopping criteria are met and consequently best solution is obtained rbm approach is handled by objective function using associated indicators and is solved with so as described in the following the performance of this method is examined in a real case study located in iran and the efficiency of rbm approach is evaluated in groundwater restoration problems 2 1 rbm approach in this study results have been defined in the form of results chain and formulated by indicators for each level of results fig 2 the results chain represents how there is a connection between the inputs activities and the results which are generated in the form of outputs outcomes and impacts undg 2011 inputs and activities in groundwater management concept can include various resources such as reduction of pumping while the outputs sustainability of the aquifer will be achieved by implementing activities by the achievement of outputs the outcomes groundwater storage in the aquifer are obtained and finally impacts aquifer restoration are established 2 2 indicators quantitative indicators are usually used to assess the current status and the projected future status of groundwater resources they can also contribute to the development of proper sustainable management decisions sandoval solis et al 2010 hosseini et al 2019 therefore to cover the objectives of this study three indicators based on sustainability filling and restoration definitions are used to monitor the three levels of results i e outputs outcomes and impacts respectively sustainability indicator si is defined using the aquifer recharge and discharge values and given by unesco 2007 1 si i 1 n i 1 n r c h i d c h i where r c h is the aquifer recharge l3 t 1 and d c h is aquifer discharge l3 t 1 in a month i n is the total number of temporal intervals filling indicator fi indicates the fill rate of the aquifer and defined using the value of groundwater elevation camp et al 2010 2 fi i 1 n i 1 n h i h min h max h min where h i is the obtained groundwater elevation l under the managerial scenario in a month i h min is the minimum groundwater elevation l and h m a x is the maximum groundwater elevation l among the considered period restoration indicator ri determines the ability of the aquifer for restoration which is compared to a desirable elevation and given as unesco 2007 3 ri i 1 n i 1 n h i h i d e s h i d e s where h i d e s is the desired groundwater elevation in a month i l three other indicators are used to analyze the results including the reliability utility and vulnerability indicators reliability indicator rei is the ability of managerial scenario to return the original status which is defined as loucks 1997 4 rei ns n 0 rei 1 where ns is the total number of temporal intervals when the desired elevation is achieved utility indicator ui is the ratio of rise in groundwater elevation under the managerial scenario compared to the groundwater elevation after water table depletion and the desirable elevation which is obtained by eq 5 loucks 1997 5 ui 1 n i 1 n h i h i d p h i d e s h i d p where h i d p is the groundwater elevation after water table depletion without implementing the managerial scenario in a month i l the vulnerability indicator vi is the deficit in groundwater elevation according to eq 6 hashimoto et al 1982 6 vi i 1 t h i d e s h i i 1 t h i d e s h i d p where t is the number of periods when the groundwater elevation is lower than the desirable groundwater elevation 2 3 simulation approach modflow harbaugh 2005 is a physical based code in the aquifer scale which has been used for numerical simulation purposes this code combines the darcy law and the volumetric balance equation to simulate groundwater flow and employs finite difference method under steady and transient conditions this equation is given as follows 7 x k x x h x y k y y h y z k z z h z q s s h t where x y z l are the principle coordinate directions of the system k x x k y y and k z z l t 1 are the hydraulic conductivities along the x y and z directions respectively q t 1 is the volumetric inflow or outflow of water per unit volume which is positive for sources and negative for sinks s s t 1 is the specific storage l 1 h l represents the groundwater elevation hydraulic head and t t is the time the automated parameter estimation code pest doherty 2005 has been used for automatic calibration of numerical model parameters 2 4 optimization approach optimization is a fundamental component of a combined simulation optimization framework it refers to the process of finding the best solution making perfect and effective decision for a problem among a set of available alternatives nguyen et al 2014 in this study after calibrating the simulation model and determining the type of decision variables objective function and constraints of the management problem the combination of optimization algorithm to modflow is coded in the matlab platform in this method the simulation model re run for each change in the decision variables vector this combination is more accurate than other methods such as determining the linear or nonlinear behavior of the aquifer and then optimizing it in recent decades evolutionary algorithms have been considered with different degrees of complexity to solve optimization problems in groundwater resources management ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a 2015b 2015c based on ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015c the caco algorithm is one of the most successful methods for optimization in the field of groundwater management this algorithm is chosen as an optimization tool in the present study caco as a part of swarm intelligence has been inspired by the behavior of food searches in the ants community which want to find the shortest path between the nest and the food dorigo and stutzle 2004 the main concept in caco is the search based on the pheromone based probabilistic finding of solutions hence the probability density function to determine the pheromone information and update it according to the best answer for each generation is used τ x the normal distribution function for computing pheromone information is according to eq 8 8 τ x 1 2 σ π e x x best 2 2 σ 2 where x best is the best solution in the previous generation and σ is the weighted standard deviation of the normal probability density function ρ is used for the modification of the probability distribution at any generation toward the choices leading to optimal solutions and forgetting other ones the ρ is defined as follows ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2011 9 ρ i 1 pop 1 f i f opt x i x opt 2 i 1 pop 1 f i f opt where pop is the number of ants x i is the decision variable selected by ant i solution f i is the value of an objective function for a solution i x opt is the best decision variable and f opt is the best objective function value from the previous generation further details of the caco algorithm are available in ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a 2015b 2015c according to ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015b two stopping criteria are performed to caco 1 the convergence rate of objective function values should reach less than 0 01 for two consecutive generations and 2 the ratio of n no n tot should not be less than 10 which n no is the number of generations without any improvement in the objective function value and n tot is the number of total generations penalty function technique is used to handle the constraints of management problems in this study ataie ashtiani and ketabchi 2011 3 parallelization strategy the parallelization strategy is used to enhance the computational performance of so ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a 2015b mostafaei avandari and ketabchi 2020 time consuming tasks of the so model are grid based computation iterative solvers time stepping loop generation loops and population loops sayeed and mahinthakumar 2005 zhang et al 2014 this study has focused on population loops in parallelization algorithm and up to 10 shared memory cores are utilized in this study using a shared memory parallelism approach matlab platform is used to build the parallel optimization algorithm 4 application 4 1 case study the case study with a total area of 1217 km2 of namdan plain is located in the tashak bakhtegan basin fars province iran fig 3 this plain is one of the most important areas for the exploitation of groundwater resources which has experienced considerable groundwater elevation depletion in recent decades wri 2016 frwo 2016 ghadimi and ketabchi 2019 table 2 summarizes the characteristics of namdan plain in the study area the depth to the water table from ground surface in the margin of the altitudes is shallower due to inflow into the aquifer deeper groundwater depths are observed in the center and south parts of the plain the maximum and the minimum depths to groundwater are 80 m and 10 m respectively while they are observed in the southeast and the northwestern parts of the study area respectively the exploitation of groundwater in this area is mainly carried out through deep and semi deep pumping wells for agriculture activities from spring to autumn seasons the total amount of groundwater elevation depletion in 10 years period between 2006 and 2016 is 10 3 m and the annual average depletion in this aquifer is more than 1 m frwo 2016 ghadimi and ketabchi 2019 4 2 numerical model a numerical model based on hydrological conditions of the aquifer is created with grid dimensions of 500 500 m fig 4a the boundary conditions for the model are considered as specified time dependent head boundaries and no flow boundaries fig 4b a complete description of the simulation model specifications including the simulation setup spatial discretization temporal discretization boundary conditions and calibration are summarized in table 3 as can be recognized from table 3 the pest doherty 2005 code is utilized for automatic calibration of three numerical model parameters including the hydraulic conductivity recharge rate and specific yield only for transient calibration input parameters are given in table 4 4 3 management problems considering the land use map the study area is discretized into 70 management zones fig 4 c pumping from groundwater resources is occurred from 43 of these 70 management zones the detailed characteristics of these management zones are provided in supplementary material the evaluation of management problems is based on the obtained groundwater elevations over the 10 year management time horizon the chain of management problems is mathematically defined using the three indicators eqs 10 11 and 12 and the appropriate constraints eqs 13 and 14 upon optimizing pumping from 43 management zones therefore the pumping from management zones are considered as the 43 decision variables q i min q i max as monthly pumping lower and upper values of decision variables which have been determined based on permission of pumping wells and available historical data n is the total number of months and m is the number of years in the management period 10 years q k o is annual optimum pumping which is estimated by sum of determined annual pumping from 43 management zones for year k q k max and q k min refers to a maximum and minimum permissible annual pumping from the aquifer in year k minimum permissible pumping is estimated considering cultivating strategic products which is wheat in this study area including 60 to 65 of irrigated areas moa 2013 and their water demand 122 mcm year also the maximum permissible annual pumping is equal to the renewable groundwater volume 323 mcm year estimated based on unesco 2007 these pumping ranges are estimated based on the averages of data for the study area in the period 2006 2017 and assumed to have the fixed values over the management time

setting of caco to set the parameters of caco and achieve their optimal values the model has been run several times with different numbers of populations from 30 to 200 ants the population size and the number of iterations are the only parameters for caco which should be set ataie ashtiani and ketabchi 2011 the experiments of the caco parameter setting for problem fi as an example are presented in fig 5 a and the selected value of this parameter are shown also each problem is independently solved 30 times and the average optimal solutions are recorded for example 3 runs for problem fi in fig 5b is shown finally 50 ants and 150 iterations 7500 generations are considered as the optimal parameters of caco 5 results and discussion 5 1 results matrix of rbm the results matrix is an overview of the program table 5 as shown in table 5 at each level of results outputs outcomes and impacts baseline and target are determined to evaluate the status of a predefined indicator at the end of the program in the application of the model it is considered that the assumptions are valid the risks are managed and partners are resolute to play their roles undg 2011 5 2 parallelization strategy performance 10 threads have been used to call the population in the caco algorithm the computation load for 150 iterations 7500 generations is reduced from 47 3 h to 36 6 h an improvement by 23 of the running time on a computer with a cpu specification of 3 4 ghz core i7 and 16 gb of memory 5 3 results of the simulation model the calibrated hydraulic conductivity recharge rate and specific yield maps are presented in fig 4d f also model performance results in steady and transient conditions calibration and validation are presented in table 6 fig 6 shows the groundwater elevation changes based on observation and computation data as seen there is a good fit between observation and computation data in both calibration and validation periods according to observation data the average annual depletion in groundwater elevation is 1 5 m which is estimated at 1 35 m in the simulation model 5 4 effectiveness of rbm indicators evaluate the effectiveness of rbm therefore three indicators si fi and ri of the aquifer have been evaluated in the form of the optimization problems and the following results are obtained to provide the required data to compute the indicators the observed monthly groundwater elevations of the restoration target year 2006 2007 frwo 2016 are assumed to be the desired groundwater elevations h i d e s and the monthly groundwater elevation data after water table depletion without implementing the managerial scenario h i d p are computed by continuing the condition of the base year 2016 2017 over the planning horizon without any changes the results of the three optimization problems are illustrated in table 7 aquifer water balance the detailed values of decision variables are given in supplementary material in all three problems the inflow from boundaries into the aquifer is lower than the base year 2016 2017 data while the outflow from boundaries has been increased this means that implementing the decisions has caused an increase in groundwater elevation considering the specified heads of boundaries recharge rate into the aquifer is also lower than the base layer under all three problems recharge rate includes both the infiltrated portion of precipitation and the return flow from pumped groundwater decreasing the discharged volume of groundwater from wells causes to the reduction of return flow portion of recharge rate as seen in table 7 the annual pumping from wells has been decreased by implementing all problems in problem si it has been decreased from 322 6 to 198 2 mcm 38 reduction in discharge which causes an increase of groundwater storage in the aquifer despite the remaining of the negative trend in groundwater storage changes it has been increased by 97 7 mcm compared to the value of the base year in problem fi the annual discharge has decreased by 56 down to 140 7 mcm this reduction in discharge has led to an increase in the groundwater storage by 16 0 mcm and a positive change in the groundwater storage in the aquifer in problem ri the annual discharge has decreased by 62 percent down to 124 1 mcm almost for irrigation of wheat cultivated areas this reduction in the annual discharge has increased the groundwater storage and has positively up to 16 6 mcm changes in groundwater elevation have affected the inflow and outflow of the aquifer by decrease the groundwater elevation the inflow is increased and the outflow is decreased while increasing the groundwater elevation causes to decrease the inflow and increase the outflow comparison of inflow and outflow values table 6 shows that the inflow has reached its lowest and highest magnitudes under ri and si respectively while the outflow has reached the highest and lowest values on ri and si respectively therefore it can be concluded that the elevation of groundwater under ri has reached the highest level comparing to the other indicators it is also specified in the namdan groundwater elevation time series clearly fig 7 in fig 7 namdan groundwater elevations have been compared based on si fi and ri management problems along with the desired restoration level this comparison indicates that the groundwater elevation reaches the restoration level based on si also by implementing fi the groundwater elevation is nearer to the restoration level with an increase of 9 5 m at the end of the management period however by implementing the si despite a 3 m increase in the groundwater elevation the target will not be achieved on the other hand this objective is achievable by ri with a 10 6 m increase in groundwater elevation the groundwater elevation derived from simulation results for 10 years in problems si fi and ri are presented in fig 8 as fig 8 shows there is a slight increment in the groundwater elevation by comparing the groundwater elevation under a base year and three management problems fig 8a c it can be seen that a slight rise in the groundwater elevation has happened this lies in the fact that the lowest level of the groundwater elevation over the study area occurs in the southeast part the groundwater elevation has increased more than the northwest parts of the aquifer also the comparison of groundwater elevation results in three problems fig 8d indicates a higher increase in problems fi and ri than the increment in problem si the results defined based on the results matrix of rbm has been realized at all three levels of outputs outcomes and impacts so according to the results at the output level the aquifer reached stability at the outcome level the aquifer water balance was positive and at the impact level the groundwater elevation reached the elevation of restoration by realizing these results the expected target in the result matrix is achieved and the effectiveness of the rbm approach in groundwater resources management is well illustrated 5 5 evaluation of results three si fi and ri indicators have been used to analyze the results the results have been also reviewed with three indicators of reliability utility and vulnerability according to table 8 at the output level rei is zero as the groundwater elevation has not reached the desired value this level of results cannot restore the groundwater elevation and reach the desired level also ui is 0 50 and vi is 0 49 rei at the outcome level is also zero considering the desired level in this level the aquifer vulnerability has gotten better than before from 0 49 to 0 34 also ui has increased from 0 50 to 0 65 indicating an improvement in the status of the aquifer at the outcome level compared to the output level based on the results at the level of the impact the aquifer has been reached the desirable groundwater elevation so rei is 0 07 values of ui and vi have also improved and have been reached 0 74 and 0 27 respectively 6 conclusion this paper presents a new approach to rbm for the efficient planning of groundwater resources to implement this approach in the namdan aquifer three levels of results have been defined in a 10 year management horizon and for each level of results the relevant indicator has been formulated to evaluate the management problems based on these indicators the so model has been developed the so model includes the modflow based numerical simulation model and caco tool which utilizes a parallel processing approach and reduces the computation load since this managerial approach has not been used in groundwater studies therefore previous results are not available for comparison the results of this study so the validity of this approach has been evaluated through the so model according to the findings of this study the following points can be compiled in conclusion the defined results were realized based on rbm and its results matrix at all three levels of outputs outcomes and impacts so the aquifer reached sustainability according to the results at the outputs level based on the outcome the aquifer water balance was positive and according to impact groundwater elevation reached the level of restoration these achievements show the effectiveness of rbm to cover the aquifer restoration targets in groundwater resources management given the effectiveness of rbm it is suggested to use this management approach in the planning and management of water resources to make proper and efficient decisions the significance of proper management setup to achieve the proposed targets is highlighted the rbm based approach considered in this study can be improved by the involvement of stakeholders and considering the beneficiaries in

4898,result based management rbm has been used as a new management approach for groundwater resources planning based on this approach three levels of results including outputs aquifer stability outcomes positive balance and impacts aquifer restoration have been considered in this study to monitor these levels three indicators based on sustainability filling and restoration definitions are given to describe the associated rbm aquifer restoration problems in this study a combined simulation optimization model has been developed using a modflow based numerical simulation model and a parallel evolutionary algorithm of continuous ant colony optimization the model has been applied to a real case study of namdan aquifer located in fars province iran over a planning horizon of 10 years three levels of outputs outcomes and impacts have been achieved and the effectiveness of rbm approach in groundwater resources management has been assessed the important observations are 1 the planning based on the management problems of sustainability filling and restoration indicators leads to an increase in the groundwater elevation by 3 9 47 and 10 61 m at the end of management period in comparison with the beginning of the period 2 the planning based on the restoration indicator causes the highest level of rise in groundwater elevation and reaches the restoration target as highlighting the significance of a proper management setup to achieve the proposed target 3 the investigations based on reliability utility and vulnerability indicators show the improvement of aquifer restoration status over the results chain the methodology given in this study can be a novel approach to the realistic management of groundwater resources considering the proposed targets while it can

introduction water supply for sustainable development is one of the essential concerns for many parts of the world especially in the middle east aquifers are accessible resource of water in all regions with different climates undp 2010 groundwater depletion due to excessive groundwater pumping is a significant problem poses many severe challenges to groundwater resources sustainability in iran moe 2014 frwo 2016 hosseini et al 2019 lack of management plans or mismanagement of aquifers could have the disastrous effects on groundwater resources the main causes of this problem include over exploitation from aquifers as an unlimited source making decisions based on the results obtained from the simulation of aquifers with incomplete or inappropriate conceptual models and improper setup of management problems mahmoodzadeh et al 2014 singh 2014 timani and peralta 2015 ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a 2015b therefore the protection of aquifers against over exploitation and ensuring their renewability require the establishment of proper management plans there is always a concern about the success of management plans based on proposed targets achievement hence this concern has attracted the attention of water resources planners and managers towards new methods such as result based management rbm approach to continually follow the targets of management plans undg 2011 lamhauge et al 2013 rbm approach is derived from the experiences of the united nations organizations for effective management and cost optimization in this approach all positive aspects are used to ensure that organizations not only achieve the proposed results but also manage their inputs and activities this approach is a developed paradigm of implementation based management approach which focuses on proper implementation and does not provide managers with timely and accurate data on the success and failure of program there are different issues in rbm approach such as focusing on the results at different levels of outputs outcomes and impacts following them by indicators providing an appropriate knowledge of the success and failure of the programs and improving the achievement of results rbm includes several steps such as planning management monitoring evaluation reporting learning and decision making also it consists of several concepts including results chain performance measurement and logical framework or results matrix of the program in this approach results chain is presented as a set of logically connected results and the results of each step are collected to produce the results of the next step this chain includes the outputs resulted from of activities the outcomes resulted from a collection of outputs and the impacts produced by outcomes performance measurement regular planning using performance data and needed judgment are usually conducted based on indicators in this approach the results matrix is used to provide a summary of the program in a standard format undg 2011 arif et al 2015 more information about rbm approach is available in undg 2011 a few studies have been conducted in this context lamhauge et al 2013 provided the frameworks of monitoring and evaluation for adaptation to climate change using the experiences of development agencies cooperation in the context of rbm approach adaptability activities were divided into five different groups and assessments were conducted at different levels of results for each activity i e outputs outcomes and impacts then a separate indicator was defined to follow the results throughout the program their results showed that rbm is an appropriate framework for monitoring and evaluation of adaptation programs and projects arif et al 2015 used a variety of traditional methods of public sector oversight with rbm approach in the school community in pakistan their results showed that the use of this approach could result in better findings compared to previous methods chang 2006 used the rbm programming with the aim of national development planning in the education sector and showed that this approach could improve the educational planning the results also showed that in the preliminary planning steps computer simulations could show improvement in medium to long term educational financial and physical consequences according to the reviewed literature rbm approach has not been considered for groundwater resources management decision models are one of the appropriate and efficient tools for managing groundwater resources and one of the best structures is the combined framework of simulation optimization models so evaluation on the results of managerial options using an appropriate simulator and selecting the best management strategy using an optimization tool concerning physical or managerial constraints are the primary purposes of so models singh and datta 2006 ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a 2015b such models have been widely used for different groundwater management problems such as aquifer restoration maskey et al 2002 pumping optimization ayvaz and karahan 2008 ataie ashtiani et al 2014 aquifer quality protection sreekanth and datta 2010 hussain et al 2015 benefit maximization ayvaz and elci 2013 ayvaz 2009 ghadimi and ketabchi 2019 and aquifer artificial recharge makkawi 2015 many studies with different objectives have used combined simulation optimization models as a necessary aquifer management tool see table 1 as a summary of some of them in the simulation component of so models mathematical equations governing groundwater system have been solved using various numerical methods such as modflow sedki and ouazar 2011 ayvaz and elci 2013 and sutra ataie ashtiani et al 2014 mostafaei avandari and ketabchi 2020 in the optimization component of so models a variety of evolutionary algorithms have been used such as genetic algorithm sedki and ouazar 2011 ataie ashtiani et al 2014 ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a 2015b and continuous ant colony optimization caco ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a 2015b ghadimi and ketabchi 2019 the values of groundwater extractions are the common decision variable in the literature which may be spatially and temporally varied zekri et al 2015 kawo et al 2018 yin et al 2020 while some studies have focused on the location or number of pumping wells ayvaz and elci 2013 yin et al 2020 review of studies on groundwater resources management using so models is shown that in defining the management problem the focus is more on the activities and how they are performed rather than the proposed targets decisions based on such management problems make the targets success and achievement to be unclear as seen in table 1 the application of rbm approach with the aim of groundwater resources management was not found in the reviewed literature as in rbm approach the focus on targets short term mid term and long term results and the monitoring indicator is taken into account while they are consistently linked together with results chain each step can be followed by success and failure indicators in this study rbm as a new managerial approach is used to describe the chain of problems on groundwater restoration problems a modflow based model of namdan aquifer located in fars province iran is prepared as a simulator and caco algorithm is used as an optimization tool in the computational platform of a decision model for the first time considering the proposed targets to overcome the large computational burden of the developed so a parallel processing technique is implemented based on a methodology presented in ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a b 2 methodology a flowchart of a decision model for the implementation of rbm approach is presented in fig 1 this figure schematically shows how the optimization algorithm executes the simulation model considering constraints and value of objective function and then updates decision variables in this framework the optimization algorithm calls the simulation model iteratively to numerically simulate the given condition then evaluate the objective function values and finally update decision variables this process is repeated until the stopping criteria are met and consequently best solution is obtained rbm approach is handled by objective function using associated indicators and is solved with so as described in the following the performance of this method is examined in a real case study located in iran and the efficiency of rbm approach is evaluated in groundwater restoration problems 2 1 rbm approach in this study results have been defined in the form of results chain and formulated by indicators for each level of results fig 2 the results chain represents how there is a connection between the inputs activities and the results which are generated in the form of outputs outcomes and impacts undg 2011 inputs and activities in groundwater management concept can include various resources such as reduction of pumping while the outputs sustainability of the aquifer will be achieved by implementing activities by the achievement of outputs the outcomes groundwater storage in the aquifer are obtained and finally impacts aquifer restoration are established 2 2 indicators quantitative indicators are usually used to assess the current status and the projected future status of groundwater resources they can also contribute to the development of proper sustainable management decisions sandoval solis et al 2010 hosseini et al 2019 therefore to cover the objectives of this study three indicators based on sustainability filling and restoration definitions are used to monitor the three levels of results i e outputs outcomes and impacts respectively sustainability indicator si is defined using the aquifer recharge and discharge values and given by unesco 2007 1 si i 1 n i 1 n r c h i d c h i where r c h is the aquifer recharge l3 t 1 and d c h is aquifer discharge l3 t 1 in a month i n is the total number of temporal intervals filling indicator fi indicates the fill rate of the aquifer and defined using the value of groundwater elevation camp et al 2010 2 fi i 1 n i 1 n h i h min h max h min where h i is the obtained groundwater elevation l under the managerial scenario in a month i h min is the minimum groundwater elevation l and h m a x is the maximum groundwater elevation l among the considered period restoration indicator ri determines the ability of the aquifer for restoration which is compared to a desirable elevation and given as unesco 2007 3 ri i 1 n i 1 n h i h i d e s h i d e s where h i d e s is the desired groundwater elevation in a month i l three other indicators are used to analyze the results including the reliability utility and vulnerability indicators reliability indicator rei is the ability of managerial scenario to return the original status which is defined as loucks 1997 4 rei ns n 0 rei 1 where ns is the total number of temporal intervals when the desired elevation is achieved utility indicator ui is the ratio of rise in groundwater elevation under the managerial scenario compared to the groundwater elevation after water table depletion and the desirable elevation which is obtained by eq 5 loucks 1997 5 ui 1 n i 1 n h i h i d p h i d e s h i d p where h i d p is the groundwater elevation after water table depletion without implementing the managerial scenario in a month i l the vulnerability indicator vi is the deficit in groundwater elevation according to eq 6 hashimoto et al 1982 6 vi i 1 t h i d e s h i i 1 t h i d e s h i d p where t is the number of periods when the groundwater elevation is lower than the desirable groundwater elevation 2 3 simulation approach modflow harbaugh 2005 is a physical based code in the aquifer scale which has been used for numerical simulation purposes this code combines the darcy law and the volumetric balance equation to simulate groundwater flow and employs finite difference method under steady and transient conditions this equation is given as follows 7 x k x x h x y k y y h y z k z z h z q s s h t where x y z l are the principle coordinate directions of the system k x x k y y and k z z l t 1 are the hydraulic conductivities along the x y and z directions respectively q t 1 is the volumetric inflow or outflow of water per unit volume which is positive for sources and negative for sinks s s t 1 is the specific storage l 1 h l represents the groundwater elevation hydraulic head and t t is the time the automated parameter estimation code pest doherty 2005 has been used for automatic calibration of numerical model parameters 2 4 optimization approach optimization is a fundamental component of a combined simulation optimization framework it refers to the process of finding the best solution making perfect and effective decision for a problem among a set of available alternatives nguyen et al 2014 in this study after calibrating the simulation model and determining the type of decision variables objective function and constraints of the management problem the combination of optimization algorithm to modflow is coded in the matlab platform in this method the simulation model re run for each change in the decision variables vector this combination is more accurate than other methods such as determining the linear or nonlinear behavior of the aquifer and then optimizing it in recent decades evolutionary algorithms have been considered with different degrees of complexity to solve optimization problems in groundwater resources management ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a 2015b 2015c based on ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015c the caco algorithm is one of the most successful methods for optimization in the field of groundwater management this algorithm is chosen as an optimization tool in the present study caco as a part of swarm intelligence has been inspired by the behavior of food searches in the ants community which want to find the shortest path between the nest and the food dorigo and stutzle 2004 the main concept in caco is the search based on the pheromone based probabilistic finding of solutions hence the probability density function to determine the pheromone information and update it according to the best answer for each generation is used τ x the normal distribution function for computing pheromone information is according to eq 8 8 τ x 1 2 σ π e x x best 2 2 σ 2 where x best is the best solution in the previous generation and σ is the weighted standard deviation of the normal probability density function ρ is used for the modification of the probability distribution at any generation toward the choices leading to optimal solutions and forgetting other ones the ρ is defined as follows ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2011 9 ρ i 1 pop 1 f i f opt x i x opt 2 i 1 pop 1 f i f opt where pop is the number of ants x i is the decision variable selected by ant i solution f i is the value of an objective function for a solution i x opt is the best decision variable and f opt is the best objective function value from the previous generation further details of the caco algorithm are available in ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a 2015b 2015c according to ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015b two stopping criteria are performed to caco 1 the convergence rate of objective function values should reach less than 0 01 for two consecutive generations and 2 the ratio of n no n tot should not be less than 10 which n no is the number of generations without any improvement in the objective function value and n tot is the number of total generations penalty function technique is used to handle the constraints of management problems in this study ataie ashtiani and ketabchi 2011 3 parallelization strategy the parallelization strategy is used to enhance the computational performance of so ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a 2015b mostafaei avandari and ketabchi 2020 time consuming tasks of the so model are grid based computation iterative solvers time stepping loop generation loops and population loops sayeed and mahinthakumar 2005 zhang et al 2014 this study has focused on population loops in parallelization algorithm and up to 10 shared memory cores are utilized in this study using a shared memory parallelism approach matlab platform is used to build the parallel optimization algorithm 4 application 4 1 case study the case study with a total area of 1217 km2 of namdan plain is located in the tashak bakhtegan basin fars province iran fig 3 this plain is one of the most important areas for the exploitation of groundwater resources which has experienced considerable groundwater elevation depletion in recent decades wri 2016 frwo 2016 ghadimi and ketabchi 2019 table 2 summarizes the characteristics of namdan plain in the study area the depth to the water table from ground surface in the margin of the altitudes is shallower due to inflow into the aquifer deeper groundwater depths are observed in the center and south parts of the plain the maximum and the minimum depths to groundwater are 80 m and 10 m respectively while they are observed in the southeast and the northwestern parts of the study area respectively the exploitation of groundwater in this area is mainly carried out through deep and semi deep pumping wells for agriculture activities from spring to autumn seasons the total amount of groundwater elevation depletion in 10 years period between 2006 and 2016 is 10 3 m and the annual average depletion in this aquifer is more than 1 m frwo 2016 ghadimi and ketabchi 2019 4 2 numerical model a numerical model based on hydrological conditions of the aquifer is created with grid dimensions of 500 500 m fig 4a the boundary conditions for the model are considered as specified time dependent head boundaries and no flow boundaries fig 4b a complete description of the simulation model specifications including the simulation setup spatial discretization temporal discretization boundary conditions and calibration are summarized in table 3 as can be recognized from table 3 the pest doherty 2005 code is utilized for automatic calibration of three numerical model parameters including the hydraulic conductivity recharge rate and specific yield only for transient calibration input parameters are given in table 4 4 3 management problems considering the land use map the study area is discretized into 70 management zones fig 4 c pumping from groundwater resources is occurred from 43 of these 70 management zones the detailed characteristics of these management zones are provided in supplementary material the evaluation of management problems is based on the obtained groundwater elevations over the 10 year management time horizon the chain of management problems is mathematically defined using the three indicators eqs 10 11 and 12 and the appropriate constraints eqs 13 and 14 upon optimizing pumping from 43 management zones therefore the pumping from management zones are considered as the 43 decision variables q i min q i max as monthly pumping lower and upper values of decision variables which have been determined based on permission of pumping wells and available historical data n is the total number of months and m is the number of years in the management period 10 years q k o is annual optimum pumping which is estimated by sum of determined annual pumping from 43 management zones for year k q k max and q k min refers to a maximum and minimum permissible annual pumping from the aquifer in year k minimum permissible pumping is estimated considering cultivating strategic products which is wheat in this study area including 60 to 65 of irrigated areas moa 2013 and their water demand 122 mcm year also the maximum permissible annual pumping is equal to the renewable groundwater volume 323 mcm year estimated based on unesco 2007 these pumping ranges are estimated based on the averages of data for the study area in the period 2006 2017 and assumed to have the fixed values over the management time

setting of caco to set the parameters of caco and achieve their optimal values the model has been run several times with different numbers of populations from 30 to 200 ants the population size and the number of iterations are the only parameters for caco which should be set ataie ashtiani and ketabchi 2011 the experiments of the caco parameter setting for problem fi as an example are presented in fig 5 a and the selected value of this parameter are shown also each problem is independently solved 30 times and the average optimal solutions are recorded for example 3 runs for problem fi in fig 5b is shown finally 50 ants and 150 iterations 7500 generations are considered as the optimal parameters of caco 5 results and discussion 5 1 results matrix of rbm the results matrix is an overview of the program table 5 as shown in table 5 at each level of results outputs outcomes and impacts baseline and target are determined to evaluate the status of a predefined indicator at the end of the program in the application of the model it is considered that the assumptions are valid the risks are managed and partners are resolute to play their roles undg 2011 5 2 parallelization strategy performance 10 threads have been used to call the population in the caco algorithm the computation load for 150 iterations 7500 generations is reduced from 47 3 h to 36 6 h an improvement by 23 of the running time on a computer with a cpu specification of 3 4 ghz core i7 and 16 gb of memory 5 3 results of the simulation model the calibrated hydraulic conductivity recharge rate and specific yield maps are presented in fig 4d f also model performance results in steady and transient conditions calibration and validation are presented in table 6 fig 6 shows the groundwater elevation changes based on observation and computation data as seen there is a good fit between observation and computation data in both calibration and validation periods according to observation data the average annual depletion in groundwater elevation is 1 5 m which is estimated at 1 35 m in the simulation model 5 4 effectiveness of rbm indicators evaluate the effectiveness of rbm therefore three indicators si fi and ri of the aquifer have been evaluated in the form of the optimization problems and the following results are obtained to provide the required data to compute the indicators the observed monthly groundwater elevations of the restoration target year 2006 2007 frwo 2016 are assumed to be the desired groundwater elevations h i d e s and the monthly groundwater elevation data after water table depletion without implementing the managerial scenario h i d p are computed by continuing the condition of the base year 2016 2017 over the planning horizon without any changes the results of the three optimization problems are illustrated in table 7 aquifer water balance the detailed values of decision variables are given in supplementary material in all three problems the inflow from boundaries into the aquifer is lower than the base year 2016 2017 data while the outflow from boundaries has been increased this means that implementing the decisions has caused an increase in groundwater elevation considering the specified heads of boundaries recharge rate into the aquifer is also lower than the base layer under all three problems recharge rate includes both the infiltrated portion of precipitation and the return flow from pumped groundwater decreasing the discharged volume of groundwater from wells causes to the reduction of return flow portion of recharge rate as seen in table 7 the annual pumping from wells has been decreased by implementing all problems in problem si it has been decreased from 322 6 to 198 2 mcm 38 reduction in discharge which causes an increase of groundwater storage in the aquifer despite the remaining of the negative trend in groundwater storage changes it has been increased by 97 7 mcm compared to the value of the base year in problem fi the annual discharge has decreased by 56 down to 140 7 mcm this reduction in discharge has led to an increase in the groundwater storage by 16 0 mcm and a positive change in the groundwater storage in the aquifer in problem ri the annual discharge has decreased by 62 percent down to 124 1 mcm almost for irrigation of wheat cultivated areas this reduction in the annual discharge has increased the groundwater storage and has positively up to 16 6 mcm changes in groundwater elevation have affected the inflow and outflow of the aquifer by decrease the groundwater elevation the inflow is increased and the outflow is decreased while increasing the groundwater elevation causes to decrease the inflow and increase the outflow comparison of inflow and outflow values table 6 shows that the inflow has reached its lowest and highest magnitudes under ri and si respectively while the outflow has reached the highest and lowest values on ri and si respectively therefore it can be concluded that the elevation of groundwater under ri has reached the highest level comparing to the other indicators it is also specified in the namdan groundwater elevation time series clearly fig 7 in fig 7 namdan groundwater elevations have been compared based on si fi and ri management problems along with the desired restoration level this comparison indicates that the groundwater elevation reaches the restoration level based on si also by implementing fi the groundwater elevation is nearer to the restoration level with an increase of 9 5 m at the end of the management period however by implementing the si despite a 3 m increase in the groundwater elevation the target will not be achieved on the other hand this objective is achievable by ri with a 10 6 m increase in groundwater elevation the groundwater elevation derived from simulation results for 10 years in problems si fi and ri are presented in fig 8 as fig 8 shows there is a slight increment in the groundwater elevation by comparing the groundwater elevation under a base year and three management problems fig 8a c it can be seen that a slight rise in the groundwater elevation has happened this lies in the fact that the lowest level of the groundwater elevation over the study area occurs in the southeast part the groundwater elevation has increased more than the northwest parts of the aquifer also the comparison of groundwater elevation results in three problems fig 8d indicates a higher increase in problems fi and ri than the increment in problem si the results defined based on the results matrix of rbm has been realized at all three levels of outputs outcomes and impacts so according to the results at the output level the aquifer reached stability at the outcome level the aquifer water balance was positive and at the impact level the groundwater elevation reached the elevation of restoration by realizing these results the expected target in the result matrix is achieved and the effectiveness of the rbm approach in groundwater resources management is well illustrated 5 5 evaluation of results three si fi and ri indicators have been used to analyze the results the results have been also reviewed with three indicators of reliability utility and vulnerability according to table 8 at the output level rei is zero as the groundwater elevation has not reached the desired value this level of results cannot restore the groundwater elevation and reach the desired level also ui is 0 50 and vi is 0 49 rei at the outcome level is also zero considering the desired level in this level the aquifer vulnerability has gotten better than before from 0 49 to 0 34 also ui has increased from 0 50 to 0 65 indicating an improvement in the status of the aquifer at the outcome level compared to the output level based on the results at the level of the impact the aquifer has been reached the desirable groundwater elevation so rei is 0 07 values of ui and vi have also improved and have been reached 0 74 and 0 27 respectively 6 conclusion this paper presents a new approach to rbm for the efficient planning of groundwater resources to implement this approach in the namdan aquifer three levels of results have been defined in a 10 year management horizon and for each level of results the relevant indicator has been formulated to evaluate the management problems based on these indicators the so model has been developed the so model includes the modflow based numerical simulation model and caco tool which utilizes a parallel processing approach and reduces the computation load since this managerial approach has not been used in groundwater studies therefore previous results are not available for comparison the results of this study so the validity of this approach has been evaluated through the so model according to the findings of this study the following points can be compiled in conclusion the defined results were realized based on rbm and its results matrix at all three levels of outputs outcomes and impacts so the aquifer reached sustainability according to the results at the outputs level based on the outcome the aquifer water balance was positive and according to impact groundwater elevation reached the level of restoration these achievements show the effectiveness of rbm to cover the aquifer restoration targets in groundwater resources management given the effectiveness of rbm it is suggested to use this management approach in the planning and management of water resources to make proper and efficient decisions the significance of proper management setup to achieve the proposed targets is highlighted the rbm based approach considered in this study can be improved by the involvement of stakeholders and considering the beneficiaries in

4899,the hydraulic properties of the soil top layer may change during the growth period due to various factors such as wetting and drying cycles tillage practices and crop root growth in this study the potential of the assimilation method to estimate time varying soil hydraulic parameters is explored four assimilation schemes including the simultaneous update state augmentation method the partitioned update state augmentation method the simultaneous update parameter correction method and the partitioned update parameter correction method are compared the performance of four assimilation schemes on parameter estimations and soil moisture simulations is tested first using the synthetic case the influence of initial parameter values and a parameter update order on assimilation is also analyzed finally the partitioned update parameter correction method is applied to a real case involving a field drip irrigation experiment the results show that when the analyzed parameter has either a periodical or a linear variation there is a time lag between the assimilation value and the true value the assimilation method can respond immediately to an abrupt change of the parameter value using the simultaneous update method leads to an obvious parameter correlation problem in contrast the partitioned update method can relieve the parameter correlation problems thereby improving the accuracy of parameter estimations and pressure head simulations however when the initial values of the parameters deviate from their true values to a certain extent the partitioned update method cannot obtain accurate parameter estimations compared with the partitioned update state augmentation method the partitioned update parameter correction method is not sensitive to the parameter update order the partitioned update parameter correction method has higher computational efficiency and assimilation stability and it can obtain more accurate parameter estimations and soil moisture predictions in comparison with the traditional state augmentation method the partitioned update parameter correction method provides an assimilation tool for improving the predictions of soil moisture by considering the time varying parameters keywords data assimilation parameter estimation partitioned update parameter correction 1 introduction influenced by wetting and drying cycles mubarak et al 2009 tillage practices mohanty et al 1994 cameira et al 2003 and crop root growth rasse et al 2000 iqbal et al 2005 the hydraulic properties of the soil top layer can change during the growth period using time varying soil hydraulic parameters can improve the accuracy of soil moisture simulations schwen et al 2011 however only a small number of studies have focused on soil moisture modeling for time varying parameters or et al 2000 xu and mermoud 2003 schwen et al 2011 in order to obtain time varying soil hydraulic parameters the common practice is to conduct field infiltration experiments or take measurements on soil samples in the laboratory at intervals during the simulating period xu and mermoud 2003 mubarak et al 2009 schwen et al 2011 which is labor intensive and time consuming also the parameters obtained in the laboratory may not be suitable for field applications due to the scale effect inverse modeling provides an alternative method and has been widely used to estimate soil hydraulic parameters pan and wu 1998 abbaspour et al 2001 lambot et al 2002 li and ren 2011 brandhorst et al 2017 there are mainly three kinds of inverse methods for estimating time varying parameters the first approach considers a functional form of the time varying parameter westra et al 2014 jeremiah et al 2013 the second approach divides observation data into several consecutive time intervals and calibrates the model parameters for each interval separately thirel et al 2015 merz et al 2011 gharari et al 2013 however artificially selecting the functional form or dividing the time intervals still requires scientific judgment which is often difficult pathiraja et al 2016 finally the third approach i e assimilation method updates parameters automatically when observation data is available several studies have investigated the potential of data assimilation methods to estimate time varying parameters pathiraja et al 2016 proposed a multi layer ensemble kalman filter enkf method and a local linearization method to estimate the parameters of a conceptual hydrological model pdm moore 2007 however the multi layer enkf method requires estimation of the hyperparameter in addition to the model parameters thus increasing the number of parameters to be estimated the local linearization method assumes that there is a linear relationship between the parameters at the current time and the previous time hence it cannot deal with the situation when the parameter value has abrupt changes deng et al 2016 and xiong et al 2019 used the constrained enkf method to estimate the parameters of the water balance model twbm xiong and guo 1999 the results show that the constrained enkf method can obtain accurate parameter estimations but there are time lags between the estimated value and its true value when the parameter has a periodical variation smith et al 2008 proposed a technique based on a particle filter to evaluate the model s structural inadequacy in this method the parameters were treated as evolving in time vrugt et al 2013 and salamon and feyen 2009 also tested the temporal evolution of model parameters based on the particle filter method however the particle filter method is computationally very intensive most of the existing studies estimating time varying parameters using the assimilation method involve the conceptual hydrological model since soil hydrodynamic models usually have strong nonlinear behavior the assimilation method s potential to estimate time varying soil hydraulic parameters needs further testing in addition the state augmentation technique is usually used to estimate soil hydraulic properties within the enkf method li and ren 2011 shi et al 2015 bauser et al 2016 brandhorst et al 2017 wu and margulis 2011 in which parameters and state variables are included in a state vector and updated simultaneously however this technique s disadvantage is that when the number of unknown model states and parameters is large the degree of freedom for high dimensional vectors increases making the estimation unstable especially in nonlinear dynamic models moradkhani et al 2005 xie and zhang 2013 xie and zhang 2013 proposed a partitioned update scheme for state parameter estimation based on the enkf method in which the parameter set is partitioned into several types according to their sensitivities and each parameter type is updated in an individual loop of assimilation lei et al 2019 proposed a parameter correction method based on the enkf framework in which the state vector consists of parameters to be estimated to the best of our knowledge there exists no research on estimating time varying parameters of a soil hydrodynamic model using the data assimilation method the purpose of this study is to explore the potential of the assimilation method to estimate time varying soil hydraulic parameters we compare four assimilation schemes the simultaneous update state augmentation method the partitioned update state augmentation method the simultaneous update parameter correction method and the partitioned update parameter correction method the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the soil hydrodynamic model and the assimilation algorithm are introduced section 3 illustrates a synthetic case and a real case involving a drip irrigation experiment results and discussion are presented in section 4 finally conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 soil hydrodynamic model the soil moisture dynamics can be described using the richards equation 1 θ t x i k k ij a h x j k iz a s where θ is the volumetric moisture content l3 l 3 h is the pressure head l k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 k ij a are components of a dimensionless anisotropy tensor k a xi and xj are the spatial coordinates l and s is the sink term accounting for root water uptake the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function is

distribution index in this study unsaturated water flow was simulated using the chain 2d code a dos predecessor of the hydrus model šimůnek et al 2008 2 2 parameter estimation based on the assimilation method the assimilation method for parameter estimation consists of a model operator an observation operator and an ensemble kalman filter algorithm the model operator is used to pass the state vector to the next moment which can be expressed as follows 5 x i 1 m i x i η i 1 where x i and x i 1 are state vectors at current and next time respectively i and i 1 denote time indicators m i is the model operator η i 1 is the model error vector that is independent white noise for the model operator which is drawn from a multinormal distribution with zero mean and specified covariance q i 1 the observation operator constructs the mapping between the state vector and the observation vector which can be written as 6 y i 1 h i 1 x i 1 ε i 1 in which y i 1 is the observation vector h i 1 is the observation operator ε i 1 is the observation error vector which is also assumed to be independent while noise is drawn from a multinormal distribution with zero mean and specified covariance o i 1 the enkf algorithm is a monte carlo method in which the initial ensemble member can be generated by adding a random disturbance to the initial state vector which can be expressed as follows 7 x j 0 x 0 ξ j where j indicates the jth member in the state vector ξ j is independent white noise which follows a multi normal distribution with zero mean and specified covariance r in the implementation of enkf two steps namely forecast and analysis steps are included evensen 2003 first the forecast state vector at the i 1 moment is generated using the model operator and the analysis state vector at the i moment which can be written as 8 x j i 1 f m i x j i a in which x i 1 f is the forecast state vector and x i 1 a is the analysis state vector when the observation data is available the analysis state vector is updated using the analysis equation which can be written as 9 x j i 1 a x j i 1 f k i 1 y i 1 ε i 1 h i 1 x j i 1 f where k i 1 is the kalman gain which is defined as 10 k i 1 p i 1 h i 1 t h i 1 p i 1 h i 1 t o i 1 1 where p i 1 is the predictive error covariance matrix which can be expressed as follows 11 p i 1 1 j 1 j 1 j x j i 1 f x i 1 f x j i 1 f x i 1 f in which x i 1 f is the mean of x j i 1 f the damping factor hendricks franssen and kinzelbach 2008 was used to reduce the inbreeding problem hence the eq 9 is revised as 12 x j i 1 a x j i 1 f β k i 1 y i 1 ε i 1 h i 1 x j i 1 f where β is the damping factor with values between 0 and 1 in this study β is considered with a value of 0 1 in this study two assimilation strategies are considered the main difference between the two strategies is the selection of the model operator and the observation operator in strategy 1 s1 the soil hydrodynamic model is used as the model operator because the observation data includes soil moisture or pressure head the observation operator is a unit matrix i the state variables and model parameters are updated using the state augmentation technique in strategy 2 s2 the state vector consists of soil hydraulic parameters and the model operator is a unit matrix i since parameters are treated as state variables s2 is called the parameter correction method the soil hydrodynamic model provides a direct link between parameters and observation elements soil moisture or pressure head and hence the richards equation is the nonlinear observation operator in each assimilation strategy two parameter update methods are further analyzed in method 1 m1 parameters are updated simultaneously in method 2 m2 parameters are updated separately i e the partitioned update method xie and zhang 2013 therefore a total of four assimilation schemes namely the simultaneous update state augmentation method s1m1 the partitioned update state augmentation method s1m2 the simultaneous update parameter correction method s2m1 and the partitioned update parameter correction method s2m2 are compared in this study 3 case study 3 1 synthetic case in the synthetic case water infiltration from a single ring infiltrometer into a layered soil was simulated the soil profile consists of two layers 40 cm thick a horizon and an underlying b c horizon the hydraulic parameters of two soil layers are shown in table 1 císlerová 1987 hopmans and stricker 1989 fig 1 presents the axisymmetric computational domain the computational domain was discretized into 684 finite elements all sides of the computational domain are impervious except for a small portion around the origin at the soil surface where a constant pressure head was imposed and the lower right corner where the groundwater level was kept constant the initial pressure head profile and locations of observation points are shown in fig 1b the ensemble size was set to 300 which has been tested to be large enough to meet the accuracy requirements i e the relative errors of estimated parameters are less than 5 shi et al 2015 reported that the type of observation data might affect assimilation results to better test the ability of the assimilation methods to identify time varying parameters pressure heads were chosen as the observation data in this case the total simulation time was 10 days and pressure heads at observation points were recorded every 2 h the measurements were obtained by adding an observation error to the pressure heads simulated using the true parameters the standard deviation of the observation error is 0 01 m the parameters to be estimated are ks and α of the first soil layer because they are the most variable parameters carsel and parrish 1988 estimated parameters were log transformed because their probability distributions are known to approximate lognormal distributions carsel and parrish 1988 the standard deviation of the initial parameter ensemble is 0 1 for both log10 ks and log10 α to test the ability of assimilation methods on identifying the dynamics of parameters multiple scenarios in which parameters have different time variation trends were designed first only a single time varying parameter was considered i e ks changed with time and α was constant different variation trends of ks were developed i e a periodic variation a linear variation and an abrupt change similar assumptions of parameter variations were also used by deng et al 2016 and xiong et al 2019 second to check the parameter correlation issue that may arise during the assimilation both ks and α were considered to change with time two scenarios were designed in this case 1 ks with a periodic variation and α with a linear trend the effect of the initial parameter value and the order of parameter updates on the assimilation results was also analyzed in this case 2 ks has a periodic variation and α has an abrupt change the results of four assimilation schemes were compared with each other 3 2 real case a field drip irrigation experiment with processing tomatoes was conducted at the upper reaches of the yellow river basin china latitude 40 41 n longitude 107 18 e and 1041 m altitude the soil profile 60 cm deep can be divided into three layers the physical properties of the three soil layers are given in table 2 the growth period started from 6 2 2015 and lasted till 9 1 2015 i e 104 days in total according to fao 56 allen et al 1998 the growth period of processing tomatoes can be divided into four growth stages see table 3 meteorological data was measured by an automatic weather station hobo campbell scientific inc usa daily reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated using the modified penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 soil water contents at two horizontal locations and three depths fig 2 were monitored using hydraprobe sensors the computational domain boundary conditions and the position of observation points are shown in fig 2 the computational domain was discretized into 2527 finite elements a time variable flux boundary condition determined from irrigation rates was specified on the bc boundary fig 2 the drip flux during the growth period is given in table 4 a no flux boundary condition was specified on the cd side because of a plastic mulch cover and an atmospheric boundary condition was specified on the de side the lower boundary was treated as a free drainage boundary because the groundwater table was relatively deep due to symmetry of flow a no flux boundary condition was specified on both vertical sides water uptake was simulated using the model of feddes et al 1978 with default values of parameters of the stress response function provided by hydrus 2d šimůnek et al 2012 the initial water content was 0 4 cm3 cm 3 0 37 cm3 cm 3 and 0 45 cm3 cm 3 in depths of 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm respectively an ensemble size of 300 and a 1 day interval were used in the assimilation a value of 0 01 was used as the standard deviation for the soil water content observation error shi et al 2015 according to haverkamp et al 1996 the parameters θs ks and α depend on the soil structure and hence these three parameters of the soil top layer were estimated initial values of soil hydraulic parameters of the three soil layers shown in table 5 were obtained using the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm moré 1978 the standard deviation of the initial parameter ensemble was 0 1 for log10 ks and log10 α and 0 02 for θs the parameter estimations and water content simulations obtained using the partitioned update parameter correction method are compared with those of the traditional state augmentation method 3 3 evaluation index the root mean square error rmse is used to evaluate parameter estimations for the synthetic case and simulated soil water contents for the real case the absolute error ae is used to evaluate the simulated pressure head distribution 13 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 14 ae s i o i where n is the total number of observations si and oi are the ith model simulated and observed values respectively the pearson correlation coefficient r is used to analyze the linear relationship between estimated parameters 15 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where x and y denote different model parameters and x and y are the mean values of these parameters 4 result and discussion 4 1 single time varying parameter fig 3 presents the evolutions of the estimated parameters when ks has a periodic variation estimated ks values show significant time lags compared with the true value variation this is consistent with the results of clark et al 2008 samuel et al 2014 deng et al 2016 and xiong et al 2019 this is due to the defect in the enkf method the states and parameters are updated based on current observations and previous predictions and hence there is a time lag between the assimilation value estimated using the enkf method and the true value especially when a peak value occurs clark et al 2008 the estimated ks peak value is lower compared to its true value especially for the simultaneous update method m1 this may be attributed to the mutual influence between estimated parameters as can be seen from fig 3 a the parameter α estimated using the simultaneous update method m1 has a large deviation from its true value which in turn affects the estimation of ks the parameter α estimated using the partitioned update method m2 can eventually converge to its true value when ks has a linear variation values of ks estimated by the four assimilation schemes are lower than the true value this can also be regarded as a time lag for the parameter estimation values of parameter α estimated using the simultaneous update method m1 show large deviations from its true value on the other hand the parameter α estimated using the partitioned update method m2 can converge to its true value when ks has an abrupt change all four assimilation schemes could respond to the abrupt change of the parameter value immediately however multiple assimilation operations about 50 assimilations in this case are required for the parameter to converge to its true value the parameter α was overestimated using the simultaneous update method m1 the partitioned update method m2 could obtain accurate α estimation table 6 gives the rmse values for the estimated parameter for four assimilation schemes it can be found that the partitioned update method m2 obtains more accurate results except for the case of a periodically varying ks low rmse values for the case of a periodic varying ks may be attributed to the time lags of parameter estimation standard deviations of the parameters are similar for four assimilation schemes see fig 3 standard deviations have dropped to a very low level after 50 assimilations as can be seen from fig 3 there is an obvious parameter correlation issue i e the evolutions of α display similar trends as ks when the parameters are updated simultaneously which results in low estimation accuracy of α compared with the simultaneous update method parameter correlation coefficients decrease significantly for the partitioned update method especially when the parameter correction method is used see table 7 this indicates that the partitioned update method can effectively resolve parameter correlation issues thereby improving the accuracy of parameter estimations simulated pressure head error distributions for four assimilation schemes are shown in fig 4 simulation errors in the 30 70 cm soil depth are large which is caused by the parameter estimation error except for a periodically varying ks simulated pressure head distributions using parameters obtained by the partitioned update method are more accurate than those using parameters obtained by the simultaneous update method because of better parameter estimations this is consistent with the results of xie and zhang 2013 for the case with a periodically varying ks due to the time lags of parameter estimations the accuracy of simulated pressure head distributions is similar for four assimilation schemes 4 2 multiple time varying parameters fig 5 presents the parameter evolutions for different parameter variation scenarios i e for scenario 1 with a periodic variation of ks and a linear trend in α and scenario 2 with a periodic variation of ks and an abrupt change in α it can be found that there are obvious parameter correlations in the parameter estimations using the simultaneous update method the estimated ks has the same increasing trend as the α parameter in scenario 1 the evolution of ks showed a significant inflection point with an abrupt change of α in scenario 2 the correlation coefficients of the estimated parameters are given in table 8 the r values for the partitioned update method are smaller resulting in a higher accuracy of parameter estimation see table 9 deng et al 2016 and xiong et al 2019 successfully estimated time varying parameters of a two parameter water balance model xiong and guo 1999 using the simultaneous update state augmentation method however four assimilation schemes cannot obtain the ideal estimation of time varying soil hydraulic parameters in our study this may be attributed to the fact that the richards equation has stronger nonlinear properties compared to a two parameter water balance model since simulated pressure head error distributions for scenarios 1 and 2 are similar fig 6 only presents the results for scenario 2 the accuracy of pressure head simulations using parameters obtained by the partitioned update parameter correction method is the highest among the four schemes because of good parameter estimations 4 3 effect of the initial parameter value since there is uncertainty in the selection of initial values of estimated parameters in practical applications the effects of the initial parameter value on assimilation are analyzed next fig 7 presents the parameter evolutions for different initial parameter values it can be found that the time lags of the estimated parameter cannot be avoided regardless of the initial parameter value when the parameters initial values are greater than their true values the trends in parameter estimation are similar to when the initial parameter values are equal to their true values however when the parameters initial values are smaller than their true values the parameter estimation accuracy is significantly reduced table 10 which leads to inaccurate simulations of pressure head distributions see fig 8 this can be attributed to the fact that smaller saturated hydraulic conductivity results in slower reactions to forcing if soil water dynamics is slow parameters cannot be estimated well and if the van genuchten α is low the pressure entry head is high and the soil is wet and forcing will not have a strong effect this makes parameter estimation more difficult the results indicate that when the initial value of the optimized parameter deviates from the true value to a certain extent even the partitioned update method cannot obtain accurate parameter estimations and soil moisture simulations 4 4 effect of the parameter update order for the partitioned update method the parameter update order may influence the parameter estimations xie and zhang 2013 therefore the effect of the parameter update order is further investigated fig 9 presents the parameter evolutions for different parameter update orders for the partitioned update state augmentation method updating ks first can result in better estimation accuracy of α conversely updating α first can improve the estimation accuracy of ks table 11 this may be because the accuracy of simulated pressure heads is improved when the first parameter is updated which is beneficial for updating the second parameter on the other hand the parameter update order has only a small influence on the estimations for the partitioned update parameter correction method table 11 because the parameters and state variables are not updated simultaneously in the parameter correction method simulated pressure head error distributions are shown in fig 10 for the partitioned update state augmentation method updating α first can improve the simulation accuracy which indicates that in this example the simulation is more sensitive to the parameter ks hence the parameter update order needs to be carefully selected when the partitioned update state augmentation method is used xie and zhang 2013 recommended that the parameter updating order should be performed in the order of increasing sensitivity in contrast the partitioned update parameter correction method can obtain good results of parameter estimations and simulations regardless of the parameter update order 4 5 application to the drip irrigation experiment fig 11 presents the parameter evolutions for the drip irrigation experiment when the partitioned update parameter correction method and the traditional state augmentation method are used for comparison constant parameter values obtained using the marquardt levenberg optimization method are also shown fig 11 shows that θs did not change much during the growth period and estimated θs values using the partitioned update parameter correction method were similar to those obtained using the traditional state augmentation method there are also significant differences in the parameter evolutions of ks and α for the two methods the parameters estimated using the traditional state augmentation method showed larger fluctuations the parameter values changed significantly after each rainfall or irrigation this is because the parameters and soil water contents are updated simultaneously in the state augmentation technique when the soil water content changed dramatically because of rainfall or irrigation the model parameters also changed significantly the parameters estimated using the partitioned update parameter correction method varied around values estimated by the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm the parameters showed significant trend changes on days 5 23 27 and 68 the values of ks and α decreased after days 5 23 and 68 which may be attributed to soil compaction due to rainfall or irrigation the parameter values showed an increasing trend after day 27 likely because of rapid cop growth see table 3 the ks value may increase due to the root growth which would be consistent with the results of rasse et al 2000 and mubarak et al 2009 rasse et al 2000 found out that crop rooting systems tend to increase water flow resulting in a higher ks the soil water content predicted using parameters obtained by the two assimilation methods and the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm are shown in fig 12 soil water contents for the 0 20 cm depth predicted using parameters obtained by the two assimilation methods and the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm were similar this may be attributed to the fact that variations in the water content of the topsoil layer were mainly controlled by changing boundary conditions however for deeper soils 20 60 cm the accuracy of the predictions of the partitioned update parameter correction method and the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm was higher than that of the traditional state augmentation method see table 12 after day 50 the soil water content predicted using the traditional state augmentation method showed a significant deviation from observations which may result from inaccurate estimations of the parameters compared with the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm the partitioned update parameter correction method could obtain more accurate soil water content simulations which indicates that using time varying soil hydraulic parameters during the growth period can improve soil moisture prediction this is consistent with the results of mubarak et al 2009 to prove that the parameter variations estimated using the assimilation methods were caused by the soil structure change rather than assimilation errors the assimilation methods were further used to estimate constant parameters the observations were generated by adding an observation error to the soil water content simulated using the parameters estimated by the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm the parameter evolutions of two assimilation methods are shown in fig 13 the parameter values estimated using the partitioned update parameter correction method were very close to the values estimated by the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm there were no obvious value changes during the growth period this indicates that the parameter variations were caused by the soil structure change rather than the assimilation errors in the previous simulations in contrast the parameters estimated using the traditional state augmentation method deviated from their true values which could be attributed to unstable assimilation resulting from an increasing degree of freedom in the system moradkhani et al 2005 due to a large number of state variables in the simulations of multi dimensional soil water flow the size of the matrix to be updated in the traditional state augmentation method is larger than in the partitioned update parameter correction method leading to much more computational time the state augmentation method is prone to an inconsistency problem during assimilations resulting in non convergence of the iterative solution of the richards equation which makes the assimilation unstable this is because the unsaturated water flow is a highly nonlinear problem and the assimilation of state variables and parameters using the linear equation may not follow the nonlinearity of the richards equation song et al 2014 since only parameters are assimilated in the partitioned update parameter correction method the inconsistency problem may be avoided therefore in multi dimensional unsaturated water flow problems using the partitioned update parameter correction method can improve the calculation efficiency and the assimilation stability while obtaining more accurate parameter estimations and soil moisture predictions it should be noted that the sequential data assimilation requires consecutive data to achieve statistical convergence of parameter estimation if the observation data is not enough the parameter may not converge to its true value especially for parameters with specific such as linear trend hence a small assimilation time interval or a long time series of data are required to improve the convergence of parameter estimates for short period simulation for example tillage practice may result in the temporal variation of soil parameters in this study tillage practice s temporal variation of soil parameters was not considered since the tillage occurred before crop transplanting and the soil structure had stabilized when crop growth began however the proposed assimilation method can also be applied to soil disturbed by tillage practice if sufficient observation data can be obtained in the real test case on the one hand the change of boundary conditions e g time varying irrigation flux and evapotranspiration and root growth might cause the change of soil structures leading to time varying parameters compared with the traditional methods the partitioned update parameter correction method can improve soil moisture predictions on the other hand soils are heterogeneous which cannot be well captured by available models this will result in the predictions deviating from the observations the partitioned update parameter correction method provides an efficient tool for assimilating multi dimensional soil water flow by considering the time varying parameters representing the influence of all relevant factors e g soil heterogeneity change of boundary conditions root growth and model errors etc however it should be mentioned that the temporal change of parameters is inherent in the assimilation method and that there can be other reasons why parameters change during the updates most of these reasons are related to experimental and modeling errors for example the measurement errors simplifications of initial and boundary conditions inadequacy of governing transport equations to describe observed processes fully e g the presence of preferential flow during rainfalls etc can also result in assimilation methods predicting temporal variations of optimized parameters 5 summary and conclusions in this study we explored the potential of the assimilation method to estimate time varying soil hydraulic parameters four assimilation schemes were compared including the simultaneous update state augmentation method the partitioned update state augmentation method the simultaneous update parameter correction method and the partitioned update parameter correction method the four assimilation schemes performance on parameter estimation and soil moisture simulations were first tested using the synthetic case the influence of the initial parameter value and the parameter update order on assimilation was also analyzed the partitioned update parameter correction method was then applied to a real case involving a field drip irrigation experiment the results showed that when the parameter had a periodical or a linear variation there were time lags between the assimilation value and the true value the assimilation method could respond to an abrupt change of the parameter value immediately there were obvious parameter correlation issues when the simultaneous update method was used the partitioned update method could effectively resolve the parameter correlation issue thereby improving the accuracy of parameter estimations and pressure head simulations however when the initial values of the parameters deviated from their true values to a certain extent the partitioned update method could not obtain accurate parameter estimations the partitioned update parameter correction method was not sensitive to the parameter update order since only parameters are updated in the assimilations the inconsistency of the assimilation could be avoided compared with the traditional state augmentation method the partitioned update parameter correction method has high computational efficiency and assimilation stability it provides an efficient tool for the assimilation of multi dimensional unsaturated water flow problems by considering the time varying parameters

mubarak et al 2009 tillage practices mohanty et al 1994 cameira et al 2003 and crop root growth rasse et al 2000 iqbal et al 2005 the hydraulic properties of the soil top layer can change during the growth period using time varying soil hydraulic parameters can improve the accuracy of soil moisture simulations schwen et al 2011 however only a small number of studies have focused on soil moisture modeling for time varying parameters or et al 2000 xu and mermoud 2003 schwen et al 2011 in order to obtain time varying soil hydraulic parameters the common practice is to conduct field infiltration experiments or take measurements on soil samples in the laboratory at intervals during the simulating period xu and mermoud 2003 mubarak et al 2009 schwen et al 2011 which is labor intensive and time consuming also the parameters obtained in the laboratory may not be suitable for field applications due to the scale effect inverse modeling provides an alternative method and has been widely used to estimate soil hydraulic parameters pan and wu 1998 abbaspour et al 2001 lambot et al 2002 li and ren 2011 brandhorst et al 2017 there are mainly three kinds of inverse methods for estimating time varying parameters the first approach considers a functional form of the time varying parameter westra et al 2014 jeremiah et al 2013 the second approach divides observation data into several consecutive time intervals and calibrates the model parameters for each interval separately thirel et al 2015 merz et al 2011 gharari et al 2013 however artificially selecting the functional form or dividing the time intervals still requires scientific judgment which is often difficult pathiraja et al 2016 finally the third approach i e assimilation method updates parameters automatically when observation data is available several studies have investigated the potential of data assimilation methods to estimate time varying parameters pathiraja et al 2016 proposed a multi layer ensemble kalman filter enkf method and a local linearization method to estimate the parameters of a conceptual hydrological model pdm moore 2007 however the multi layer enkf method requires estimation of the hyperparameter in addition to the model parameters thus increasing the number of parameters to be estimated the local linearization method assumes that there is a linear relationship between the parameters at the current time and the previous time hence it cannot deal with the situation when the parameter value has abrupt changes deng et al 2016 and xiong et al 2019 used the constrained enkf method to estimate the parameters of the water balance model twbm xiong and guo 1999 the results show that the constrained enkf method can obtain accurate parameter estimations but there are time lags between the estimated value and its true value when the parameter has a periodical variation smith et al 2008 proposed a technique based on a particle filter to evaluate the model s structural inadequacy in this method the parameters were treated as evolving in time vrugt et al 2013 and salamon and feyen 2009 also tested the temporal evolution of model parameters based on the particle filter method however the particle filter method is computationally very intensive most of the existing studies estimating time varying parameters using the assimilation method involve the conceptual hydrological model since soil hydrodynamic models usually have strong nonlinear behavior the assimilation method s potential to estimate time varying soil hydraulic parameters needs further testing in addition the state augmentation technique is usually used to estimate soil hydraulic properties within the enkf method li and ren 2011 shi et al 2015 bauser et al 2016 brandhorst et al 2017 wu and margulis 2011 in which parameters and state variables are included in a state vector and updated simultaneously however this technique s disadvantage is that when the number of unknown model states and parameters is large the degree of freedom for high dimensional vectors increases making the estimation unstable especially in nonlinear dynamic models moradkhani et al 2005 xie and zhang 2013 xie and zhang 2013 proposed a partitioned update scheme for state parameter estimation based on the enkf method in which the parameter set is partitioned into several types according to their sensitivities and each parameter type is updated in an individual loop of assimilation lei et al 2019 proposed a parameter correction method based on the enkf framework in which the state vector consists of parameters to be estimated to the best of our knowledge there exists no research on estimating time varying parameters of a soil hydrodynamic model using the data assimilation method the purpose of this study is to explore the potential of the assimilation method to estimate time varying soil hydraulic parameters we compare four assimilation schemes the simultaneous update state augmentation method the partitioned update state augmentation method the simultaneous update parameter correction method and the partitioned update parameter correction method the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the soil hydrodynamic model and the assimilation algorithm are introduced section 3 illustrates a synthetic case and a real case involving a drip irrigation experiment results and discussion are presented in section 4 finally conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 soil hydrodynamic model the soil moisture dynamics can be described using

distribution index in this study unsaturated water flow was simulated using the chain 2d code a dos predecessor of the hydrus model šimůnek et al 2008 2 2 parameter estimation based on the assimilation method the assimilation method for parameter estimation consists of a model operator an observation operator and an ensemble kalman filter algorithm the model operator is used to pass the state vector to the next moment which can be expressed as follows 5 x i 1 m i x i η i 1 where x i and x i 1 are state vectors at current and next time respectively i and i 1 denote time indicators m i is the model operator η i 1 is the model error vector that is independent white noise for the model operator which is drawn from a multinormal distribution with zero mean and specified covariance q i 1 the observation operator constructs the mapping between the state vector and the observation vector which can be written as 6 y i 1 h i 1 x i 1 ε i 1 in which y i 1 is the observation vector h i 1 is the observation operator ε i 1 is the observation error vector which is also assumed to be independent while noise is drawn from a multinormal distribution with zero mean and specified covariance o i 1 the enkf algorithm is a monte carlo method in which the initial ensemble member can be generated by adding a random disturbance to the initial state vector which can be expressed as follows 7 x j 0 x 0 ξ j where j indicates the jth member in the state vector ξ j is independent white noise which follows a multi normal distribution with zero mean and specified covariance r in the implementation of enkf two steps namely forecast and analysis steps are included evensen 2003 first the forecast state vector at the i 1 moment is generated using the model operator and the analysis state vector at the i moment which can be written as 8 x j i 1 f m i x j i a in which x i 1 f is the forecast state vector and x i 1 a is the analysis state vector when the observation data is available the analysis state vector is updated using the analysis equation which can be written as 9 x j i 1 a x j i 1 f k i 1 y i 1 ε i 1 h i 1 x j i 1 f where k i 1 is the kalman gain which is defined as 10 k i 1 p i 1 h i 1 t h i 1 p i 1 h i 1 t o i 1 1 where p i 1 is the predictive error covariance matrix which can be expressed as follows 11 p i 1 1 j 1 j 1 j x j i 1 f x i 1 f x j i 1 f x i 1 f in which x i 1 f is the mean of x j i 1 f the damping factor hendricks franssen and kinzelbach 2008 was used to reduce the inbreeding problem hence the eq 9 is revised as 12 x j i 1 a x j i 1 f β k i 1 y i 1 ε i 1 h i 1 x j i 1 f where β is the damping factor with values between 0 and 1 in this study β is considered with a value of 0 1 in this study two assimilation strategies are considered the main difference between the two strategies is the selection of the model operator and the observation operator in strategy 1 s1 the soil hydrodynamic model is used as the model operator because the observation data includes soil moisture or pressure head the observation operator is a unit matrix i the state variables and model parameters are updated using the state augmentation technique in strategy 2 s2 the state vector consists of soil hydraulic parameters and the model operator is a unit matrix i since parameters are treated as state variables s2 is called the parameter correction method the soil hydrodynamic model provides a direct link between parameters and observation elements soil moisture or pressure head and hence the richards equation is the nonlinear observation operator in each assimilation strategy two parameter update methods are further analyzed in method 1 m1 parameters are updated simultaneously in method 2 m2 parameters are updated separately i e the partitioned update method xie and zhang 2013 therefore a total of four assimilation schemes namely the simultaneous update state augmentation method s1m1 the partitioned update state augmentation method s1m2 the simultaneous update parameter correction method s2m1 and the partitioned update parameter correction method s2m2 are compared in this study 3 case study 3 1 synthetic case in the synthetic case water infiltration from a single ring infiltrometer into a layered soil was simulated the soil profile consists of two layers 40 cm thick a horizon and an underlying b c horizon the hydraulic parameters of two soil layers are shown in table 1 císlerová 1987 hopmans and stricker 1989 fig 1 presents the axisymmetric computational domain the computational domain was discretized into 684 finite elements all sides of the computational domain are impervious except for a small portion around the origin at the soil surface where a constant pressure head was imposed and the lower right corner where the groundwater level was kept constant the initial pressure head profile and locations of observation points are shown in fig 1b the ensemble size was set to 300 which has been tested to be large enough to meet the accuracy requirements i e the relative errors of estimated parameters are less than 5 shi et al 2015 reported that the type of observation data might affect assimilation results to better test the ability of the assimilation methods to identify time varying parameters pressure heads were chosen as the observation data in this case the total simulation time was 10 days and pressure heads at observation points were recorded every 2 h the measurements were obtained by adding an observation error to the pressure heads simulated using the true parameters the standard deviation of the observation error is 0 01 m the parameters to be estimated are ks and α of the first soil layer because they are the most variable parameters carsel and parrish 1988 estimated parameters were log transformed because their probability distributions are known to approximate lognormal distributions carsel and parrish 1988 the standard deviation of the initial parameter ensemble is 0 1 for both log10 ks and log10 α to test the ability of assimilation methods on identifying the dynamics of parameters multiple scenarios in which parameters have different time variation trends were designed first only a single time varying parameter was considered i e ks changed with time and α was constant different variation trends of ks were developed i e a periodic variation a linear variation and an abrupt change similar assumptions of parameter variations were also used by deng et al 2016 and xiong et al 2019 second to check the parameter correlation issue that may arise during the assimilation both ks and α were considered to change with time two scenarios were designed in this case 1 ks with a periodic variation and α with a linear trend the effect of the initial parameter value and the order of parameter updates on the assimilation results was also analyzed in this case 2 ks has a periodic variation and α has an abrupt change the results of four assimilation schemes were compared with each other 3 2 real case a field drip irrigation experiment with processing tomatoes was conducted at the upper reaches of the yellow river basin china latitude 40 41 n longitude 107 18 e and 1041 m altitude the soil profile 60 cm deep can be divided into three layers the physical properties of the three soil layers are given in table 2 the growth period started from 6 2 2015 and lasted till 9 1 2015 i e 104 days in total according to fao 56 allen et al 1998 the growth period of processing tomatoes can be divided into four growth stages see table 3 meteorological data was measured by an automatic weather station hobo campbell scientific inc usa daily reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated using the modified penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 soil water contents at two horizontal locations and three depths fig 2 were monitored using hydraprobe sensors the computational domain boundary conditions and the position of observation points are shown in fig 2 the computational domain was discretized into 2527 finite elements a time variable flux boundary condition determined from irrigation rates was specified on the bc boundary fig 2 the drip flux during the growth period is given in table 4 a no flux boundary condition was specified on the cd side because of a plastic mulch cover and an atmospheric boundary condition was specified on the de side the lower boundary was treated as a free drainage boundary because the groundwater table was relatively deep due to symmetry of flow a no flux boundary condition was specified on both vertical sides water uptake was simulated using the model of feddes et al 1978 with default values of parameters of the stress response function provided by hydrus 2d šimůnek et al 2012 the initial water content was 0 4 cm3 cm 3 0 37 cm3 cm 3 and 0 45 cm3 cm 3 in depths of 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm respectively an ensemble size of 300 and a 1 day interval were used in the assimilation a value of 0 01 was used as the standard deviation for the soil water content observation error shi et al 2015 according to haverkamp et al 1996 the parameters θs ks and α depend on the soil structure and hence these three parameters of the soil top layer were estimated initial values of soil hydraulic parameters of the three soil layers shown in table 5 were obtained using the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm moré 1978 the standard deviation of the initial parameter ensemble was 0 1 for log10 ks and log10 α and 0 02 for θs the parameter estimations and water content simulations obtained using the partitioned update parameter correction method are compared with those of the traditional state augmentation method 3 3 evaluation index the root mean square error rmse is used to evaluate parameter estimations for the synthetic case and simulated soil water contents for the real case the absolute error ae is used to evaluate the simulated pressure head distribution 13 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 14 ae s i o i where n is the total number of observations si and oi are the ith model simulated and observed values respectively the pearson correlation coefficient r is used to analyze the linear relationship between estimated parameters 15 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where x and y denote different model parameters and x and y are the mean values of these parameters 4 result and discussion 4 1 single time varying parameter fig 3 presents the evolutions of the estimated parameters when ks has a periodic variation estimated ks values show significant time lags compared with the true value variation this is consistent with the results of clark et al 2008 samuel et al 2014 deng et al 2016 and xiong et al 2019 this is due to the defect in the enkf method the states and parameters are updated based on current observations and previous predictions and hence there is a time lag between the assimilation value estimated using the enkf method and the true value especially when a peak value occurs clark et al 2008 the estimated ks peak value is lower compared to its true value especially for the simultaneous update method m1 this may be attributed to the mutual influence between estimated parameters as can be seen from fig 3 a the parameter α estimated using the simultaneous update method m1 has a large deviation from its true value which in turn affects the estimation of ks the parameter α estimated using the partitioned update method m2 can eventually converge to its true value when ks has a linear variation values of ks estimated by the four assimilation schemes are lower than the true value this can also be regarded as a time lag for the parameter estimation values of parameter α estimated using the simultaneous update method m1 show large deviations from its true value on the other hand the parameter α estimated using the partitioned update method m2 can converge to its true value when ks has an abrupt change all four assimilation schemes could respond to the abrupt change of the parameter value immediately however multiple assimilation operations about 50 assimilations in this case are required for the parameter to converge to its true value the parameter α was overestimated using the simultaneous update method m1 the partitioned update method m2 could obtain accurate α estimation table 6 gives the rmse values for the estimated parameter for four assimilation schemes it can be found that the partitioned update method m2 obtains more accurate results except for the case of a periodically varying ks low rmse values for the case of a periodic varying ks may be attributed to the time lags of parameter estimation standard deviations of the parameters are similar for four assimilation schemes see fig 3 standard deviations have dropped to a very low level after 50 assimilations as can be seen from fig 3 there is an obvious parameter correlation issue i e the evolutions of α display similar trends as ks when the parameters are updated simultaneously which results in low estimation accuracy of α compared with the simultaneous update method parameter correlation coefficients decrease significantly for the partitioned update method especially when the parameter correction method is used see table 7 this indicates that the partitioned update method can effectively resolve parameter correlation issues thereby improving the accuracy of parameter estimations simulated pressure head error distributions for four assimilation schemes are shown in fig 4 simulation errors in the 30 70 cm soil depth are large which is caused by the parameter estimation error except for a periodically varying ks simulated pressure head distributions using parameters obtained by the partitioned update method are more accurate than those using parameters obtained by the simultaneous update method because of better parameter estimations this is consistent with the results of xie and zhang 2013 for the case with a periodically varying ks due to the time lags of parameter estimations the accuracy of simulated pressure head distributions is similar for four assimilation schemes 4 2 multiple time varying parameters fig 5 presents the parameter evolutions for different parameter variation scenarios i e for scenario 1 with a periodic variation of ks and a linear trend in α and scenario 2 with a periodic variation of ks and an abrupt change in α it can be found that there are obvious parameter correlations in the parameter estimations using the simultaneous update method the estimated ks has the same increasing trend as the α parameter in scenario 1 the evolution of ks showed a significant inflection point with an abrupt change of α in scenario 2 the correlation coefficients of the estimated parameters are given in table 8 the r values for the partitioned update method are smaller resulting in a higher accuracy of parameter estimation see table 9 deng et al 2016 and xiong et al 2019 successfully estimated time varying parameters of a two parameter water balance model xiong and guo 1999 using the simultaneous update state augmentation method however four assimilation schemes cannot obtain the ideal estimation of time varying soil hydraulic parameters in our study this may be attributed to the fact that the richards equation has stronger nonlinear properties compared to a two parameter water balance model since simulated pressure head error distributions for scenarios 1 and 2 are similar fig 6 only presents the results for scenario 2 the accuracy of pressure head simulations using parameters obtained by the partitioned update parameter correction method is the highest among the four schemes because of good parameter estimations 4 3 effect of the initial parameter value since there is uncertainty in the selection of initial values of estimated parameters in practical applications the effects of the initial parameter value on assimilation are analyzed next fig 7 presents the parameter evolutions for different initial parameter values it can be found that the time lags of the estimated parameter cannot be avoided regardless of the initial parameter value when the parameters initial values are greater than their true values the trends in parameter estimation are similar to when the initial parameter values are equal to their true values however when the parameters initial values are smaller than their true values the parameter estimation accuracy is significantly reduced table 10 which leads to inaccurate simulations of pressure head distributions see fig 8 this can be attributed to the fact that smaller saturated hydraulic conductivity results in slower reactions to forcing if soil water dynamics is slow parameters cannot be estimated well and if the van genuchten α is low the pressure entry head is high and the soil is wet and forcing will not have a strong effect this makes parameter estimation more difficult the results indicate that when the initial value of the optimized parameter deviates from the true value to a certain extent even the partitioned update method cannot obtain accurate parameter estimations and soil moisture simulations 4 4 effect of the parameter update order for the partitioned update method the parameter update order may influence the parameter estimations xie and zhang 2013 therefore the effect of the parameter update order is further investigated fig 9 presents the parameter evolutions for different parameter update orders for the partitioned update state augmentation method updating ks first can result in better estimation accuracy of α conversely updating α first can improve the estimation accuracy of ks table 11 this may be because the accuracy of simulated pressure heads is improved when the first parameter is updated which is beneficial for updating the second parameter on the other hand the parameter update order has only a small influence on the estimations for the partitioned update parameter correction method table 11 because the parameters and state variables are not updated simultaneously in the parameter correction method simulated pressure head error distributions are shown in fig 10 for the partitioned update state augmentation method updating α first can improve the simulation accuracy which indicates that in this example the simulation is more sensitive to the parameter ks hence the parameter update order needs to be carefully selected when the partitioned update state augmentation method is used xie and zhang 2013 recommended that the parameter updating order should be performed in the order of increasing sensitivity in contrast the partitioned update parameter correction method can obtain good results of parameter estimations and simulations regardless of the parameter update order 4 5 application to the drip irrigation experiment fig 11 presents the parameter evolutions for the drip irrigation experiment when the partitioned update parameter correction method and the traditional state augmentation method are used for comparison constant parameter values obtained using the marquardt levenberg optimization method are also shown fig 11 shows that θs did not change much during the growth period and estimated θs values using the partitioned update parameter correction method were similar to those obtained using the traditional state augmentation method there are also significant differences in the parameter evolutions of ks and α for the two methods the parameters estimated using the traditional state augmentation method showed larger fluctuations the parameter values changed significantly after each rainfall or irrigation this is because the parameters and soil water contents are updated simultaneously in the state augmentation technique when the soil water content changed dramatically because of rainfall or irrigation the model parameters also changed significantly the parameters estimated using the partitioned update parameter correction method varied around values estimated by the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm the parameters showed significant trend changes on days 5 23 27 and 68 the values of ks and α decreased after days 5 23 and 68 which may be attributed to soil compaction due to rainfall or irrigation the parameter values showed an increasing trend after day 27 likely because of rapid cop growth see table 3 the ks value may increase due to the root growth which would be consistent with the results of rasse et al 2000 and mubarak et al 2009 rasse et al 2000 found out that crop rooting systems tend to increase water flow resulting in a higher ks the soil water content predicted using parameters obtained by the two assimilation methods and the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm are shown in fig 12 soil water contents for the 0 20 cm depth predicted using parameters obtained by the two assimilation methods and the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm were similar this may be attributed to the fact that variations in the water content of the topsoil layer were mainly controlled by changing boundary conditions however for deeper soils 20 60 cm the accuracy of the predictions of the partitioned update parameter correction method and the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm was higher than that of the traditional state augmentation method see table 12 after day 50 the soil water content predicted using the traditional state augmentation method showed a significant deviation from observations which may result from inaccurate estimations of the parameters compared with the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm the partitioned update parameter correction method could obtain more accurate soil water content simulations which indicates that using time varying soil hydraulic parameters during the growth period can improve soil moisture prediction this is consistent with the results of mubarak et al 2009 to prove that the parameter variations estimated using the assimilation methods were caused by the soil structure change rather than assimilation errors the assimilation methods were further used to estimate constant parameters the observations were generated by adding an observation error to the soil water content simulated using the parameters estimated by the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm the parameter evolutions of two assimilation methods are shown in fig 13 the parameter values estimated using the partitioned update parameter correction method were very close to the values estimated by the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm there were no obvious value changes during the growth period this indicates that the parameter variations were caused by the soil structure change rather than the assimilation errors in the previous simulations in contrast the parameters estimated using the traditional state augmentation method deviated from their true values which could be attributed to unstable assimilation resulting from an increasing degree of freedom in the system moradkhani et al 2005 due to a large number of state variables in the simulations of multi dimensional soil water flow the size of the matrix to be updated in the traditional state augmentation method is larger than in the partitioned update parameter correction method leading to much more computational time the state augmentation method is prone to an inconsistency problem during assimilations resulting in non convergence of the iterative solution of the richards equation which makes the assimilation unstable this is because the unsaturated water flow is a highly nonlinear problem and the assimilation of state variables and parameters using the linear equation may not follow the nonlinearity of the richards equation song et al 2014 since only parameters are assimilated in the partitioned update parameter correction method the inconsistency problem may be avoided therefore in multi dimensional unsaturated water flow problems using the partitioned update parameter correction method can improve the calculation efficiency and the assimilation stability while obtaining more accurate parameter estimations and soil moisture predictions it should be noted that the sequential data assimilation requires consecutive data to achieve statistical convergence of parameter estimation if the observation data is not enough the parameter may not converge to its true value especially for parameters with specific such as linear trend hence a small assimilation time interval or a long time series of data are required to improve the convergence of parameter estimates for short period simulation for example tillage practice may result in the temporal variation of soil parameters in this study tillage practice s temporal variation of soil parameters was not considered since the tillage occurred before crop transplanting and the soil structure had stabilized when crop growth began however the proposed assimilation method can also be applied to soil disturbed by tillage practice if sufficient observation data can be obtained in the real test case on the one hand the change of boundary conditions e g time varying irrigation flux and evapotranspiration and root growth might cause the change of soil structures leading to time varying parameters compared with the traditional methods the partitioned update parameter correction method can improve soil moisture predictions on the other hand soils are heterogeneous which cannot be well captured by available models this will result in the predictions deviating from the observations the partitioned update parameter correction method provides an efficient tool for assimilating multi dimensional soil water flow by considering the time varying parameters representing the influence of all relevant factors e g soil heterogeneity change of boundary conditions root growth and model errors etc however it should be mentioned that the temporal change of parameters is inherent in the assimilation method and that there can be other reasons why parameters change during the updates most of these reasons are related to experimental and modeling errors for example the measurement errors simplifications of initial and boundary conditions inadequacy of governing transport equations to describe observed processes fully e g the presence of preferential flow during rainfalls etc can also result in assimilation methods predicting temporal variations of optimized parameters 5 summary and conclusions in this study we explored the potential of the assimilation method to estimate time varying soil hydraulic parameters four assimilation schemes were compared including the simultaneous update state augmentation method the partitioned update state augmentation method the simultaneous update parameter correction method and the partitioned update parameter correction method the four assimilation schemes performance on parameter estimation and soil moisture simulations were first tested using the synthetic case the influence of the initial parameter value and the parameter update order on assimilation was also analyzed the partitioned update parameter correction method was then applied to a real case involving a field drip irrigation experiment the results showed that when the parameter had a periodical or a linear variation there were time lags between the assimilation value and the true value the assimilation method could respond to an abrupt change of the parameter value immediately there were obvious parameter correlation issues when the simultaneous update method was used the partitioned update method could effectively resolve the parameter correlation issue thereby improving the accuracy of parameter estimations and pressure head simulations however when the initial values of the parameters deviated from their true values to a certain extent the partitioned update method could not obtain accurate parameter estimations the partitioned update parameter correction method was not sensitive to the parameter update order since only parameters are updated in the assimilations the inconsistency of the assimilation could be avoided compared with the traditional state augmentation method the partitioned update parameter correction method has high computational efficiency and assimilation stability it provides an efficient tool for the assimilation of multi dimensional unsaturated water flow problems by considering the time varying parameters
