23035,the behavior of ventilated supercavities under continuous and discrete gust flows was tested in a medium sized high speed cavitation tunnel at the korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering to investigate the influences of experimental facilities on supercavitation observations the experimental results were compared with experiments at the saint anthony falls laboratory under similar flow conditions we suggested a new threshold criterion at which the total cavity length is shortened which predicts that the total cavity length shrinks when the vertical velocity of an incident flow reaches approximately 4 5 of the horizontal flow velocity additionally we found that discrete gust flows resulted in changes in the cavity shape that were smaller than those in continuous gust flows keywords gust flow supercavitation ventilation shape change cavitation tunnel 1 introduction the phenomenon of cavitation was first recognized in 1885 during the sea trials of a british high speed warship hms daring due to the previously unmatched propeller speeds brennen 2015 in engineering applications such as pumps turbine blades and marine propellers cavitation can not only cause efficiency breakdown but also generate other unfavorable phenomena such as noise and vibration a number of comprehensive reviews on this subject are available e g arndt 1981 2002 brennen 1995 ji et al 2015a 2015b peng et al 2016 cavitation is considered as an undesirable phenomenon in most engineering applications in some cases however controlled cavitation can be useful for instance in reducing skin friction drag on high speed vehicles ceccio 2010 or for inducing locally high pressures temperatures for certain chemical reactions in liquid mixtures suslick 1990 the efforts to reduce viscous friction between submerged body and water have been carried out since world war ii and supercavitation torpedo was successfully developed by the soviets in the late years of 1970s the supercavitation technique has received renewed interest in the past several years a supercavity that covers a submerged vehicle s overall dimensions drastically reduces skin friction drag with an underwater medium arndt et al 2009 ceccio 2010 therefore supercavitating vehicles can achieve higher speeds and reduced power consumption when compared with traditional underwater vehicles adding gas from a compressed reservoir into a low pressure region behind the cavitator can enlarge the cavity sufficiently in order to surround the vehicle entirely ventilated supercavities typically form at low speeds relative to natural supercavitation which is caused by vaporization over the past few decades multiple experimental and numerical studies have investigated ventilated supercavities may 1975 thoroughly reviewed a wide range of supercavitation research as of the mid 1970s various aspects of cavities have been studied such as approximation of cavity dimensions various types of cavity closure and different designs for ventilating cavities much of this work has considered steady state incoming flows semenenko 2001 schauer 2003 arndt et al 2009 wang et al 2015 when a supercavitating vehicle travels considerably quickly over relatively short distances in a stable medium supercavities can be regarded as a quasi steady state phenomenon however at sea supercavitating vehicles can encounter unsteady flows during maneuvers and long distance transits as pointed out by lee et al 2013 a vehicle experiences periodic unsteady flows caused by waves particularly when traveling near the ocean surface recently several researchers have studied the characteristics of ventilated supercavities in unsteady flows karn et al 2015 investigated the closure modes of ventilated supercavities in both the steady and unsteady flows in their tests the gust amplitude was maintained constant at 10 and the gust frequencies were varied between 1 and 10 hz their results indicated that the unsteadiness of incoming flows affected the supercavity shape and altered the mode of supercavity closure lee et al 2013 2016 experimentally studied the changes in cavity dimensions under periodic flow conditions that duplicated wave conditions at sea periodic flows were produced using a gust flow generator which periodically oscillated between angles of attack of 2 4 and 6 at frequencies from 1 to 20 hz based on the cavity dimensions measured using an image processing technique these tests showed that periodic flows above a certain vertical velocity considerably decreased the overall length of the supercavity with only a minimal effect on the maximum cavity diameter several studies have investigated the hydrodynamic forces induced by partial wetting due to the oscillatory motions of a supercavitating body often termed as tail slap kulkarni and pratap 2000 lee et al 2008 yu et al 2012 pan et al 2010 numerically simulated ventilated cavitating flows when a vehicle body takes periodically motion they reported that both the cavity shape and pressure remain nearly constant during pitching motion at a frequency of 5 hz zou and liu 2015 simulated the hydrodynamic forces caused by tail slaps and their numerical results show that a 3 hz pitching motion has a little effect on the cavity shape although these numerical and experimental results show some differences in the frequency of the drag coefficients the calculations appear to be fairly reasonable researchers have also studied methods for controlling the trajectory of supercavitating vehicles mao 2010 zou et al 2013 zou and liu 2015 escobar et al 2015 proposed mathematical models and control systems for maneuvering a supercavitating vehicle and their experimental results showed that these control systems can adjust to changes in cavity shape caused by periodic inflows escobar 2015 provides more detailed information about planing avoidance control the experiments conducted at the saint anthony falls laboratory safl lee et al 2013 suggested that the gust flows above a certain vertical velocity shorten the supercavity length the length of the supercavity is crucial to the design of a supercavitating vehicle and the specification of the operating conditions to which it is suited such as depth and weather conditions since body planing due to the changes in cavity dimensions can result in increased drag and can cause a supercavity to disintegrate the vehicle should be controlled to maintain its position within a supercavity during propulsion lee et al 2013 attempted to duplicate the wave conditions at sea and their results provided some useful information on the behavior of supercavities in periodic gust flows however the criterion for the shortening of cavity length suggested by lee et al 2013 which is based on the maximum vertical velocity of a gust generator is difficult to use in practice as the gust generator is nonexistent in the field therefore this study develops a new criterion based on the measurements of the flow conditions additionally this research investigates the morphological responses of ventilated supercavities that experience external flow disturbances due to both continuous and discrete gusts the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the experimental setup and define several terms that describe the cavity geometry section 3 presents our results and the concluding remarks are presented in section 4 2 description of experimental configuration experimental measurements were performed in the medium sized high speed cavitation tunnel hct at the korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso the hct includes an air collector dome to remove the large amount of air injected this configuration allows us to conduct reliable ventilated supercavity experiments without recirculating the air the hct s rectangular test section which provides visual access from four sides has cross sectional dimensions of 0 30 m 0 30 m and is 3 m long this test section allows a flow velocity up to 20 4 m s the spatial non uniformity of the flow is less than 1 at the inlet of the test section and the averaged turbulence intensity is approximately 0 4 at 15 m s further details regarding the hct are available in a study by paik et al 2017 2 1 model configuration the test model used in this study incorporates a flat disc cavitator a hydrofoil shaped mounting strut and a circular pipe that connects the cavitator and the mounting strut tubes for blowing air and measuring the pressure inside the supercavity were placed inside the 0 6 m long and 15 mm diameter hollow pipe the cavitator was mounted to the upstream end of this pipe this configuration is referred to as a forward facing model kawakami and arndt 2011 the cavitator has a diameter of d c 23 7 mm which produces a blockage ratio of d c d 7 where d is the area equivalent diameter of the test section holes for pressure measurements and air ventilation were placed 0 75 d c and 1 0 d c downstream from the cavitator respectively the test model comprises six ventilation holes to avoid cavity instabilities caused by the introduction of ventilation gas the compressed air from a constant pressure air supply system was regulated by a mass flow rate controller which can deliver up to a flow rate of 300 l min with 2 accuracy all measurements in this study were performed with a constant entrainment coefficient of c q 0 15 at a free stream velocity of 8 50 m s which approximately corresponds to a froude number of 17 6 2 2 gust flow models to simulate the conditions of gust flows two hydrofoils were placed 200 mm upstream of the cavitator and oscillated with pitch amplitudes of 4 6 and 8 the hydrofoils chord length 45 mm maximum thickness 10 8 mm were oriented perpendicular to the mounting strut the pitching motions for both hydrofoils were driven by a single stepper motor to ensure that the hydrofoils oscillated in phase the distance between the center of rotation of the pitching motion and the trailing edge of the hydrofoil was l 28 5 mm fig 1 shows a labeled photograph of the gust generating system used in this study the twin hydrofoils were pitched up and down by a heaving mechanism linked to a lever arm which translates the rotational motion supplied by a stepper motor the pitch amplitude a g was set by varying the offset of the lever arm from the center of the flywheel to generate both continuous and discrete gusts the motor was controlled using a programmable pulse generator and the fluctuation of rotational speed was maintained within 0 5 of the mean speed we only considered gust flows with a single frequency component for the sake of simplicity 2 3 measurement of cavity dimensions the outlines of the ventilated supercavities were measured using a shadow imaging technique with backlight illumination a light shaping diffuser placed at a sufficient distance from the light sources provided uniform illumination thereby reducing errors in the outline measurements the supercavity images were obtained at 1000 frames per second with a resolution of 1024 248 pixels and the resulting scale was approximately 0 66 mm per pixel a custom matlab code was used to consistently trace the outlines of the ventilated supercavities in the images unwanted noise in the images was corrected by subtracting cavity images from a background image as well as by applying a wiener filter the edges were detected by employing a sobel edge detection operator the upper and lower outlines of the supercavity were individually smoothed using a cubic spline technique with least squares curve fitting the uncertainty in the measured cavity outlines was less than approximately 6 of the cavitator diameter the measurements were averaged from individual images taken during 10 cycles of a gust flow to determine the statistical trends 2 4 definition of the supercavity geometry the cavity dimensions were defined on a rectangular coordinate system which has its origin at the center of the cavitator to enable ready comparisons with data from the published literature we used two different measurements to describe the cavity length the total length of the supercavity l t indicates the straight line distance between the cavitator and cavity closure point as shown in fig 2 the position of the cavity closure is not clearly distinct from the cavity wake and thus not detected by the edge detection algorithm herein the cavity closure in the images was determined semi automatically i e the point that is expected to be the intersection between the upper and lower outlines was first selected followed by the extrapolation of the upper and lower outlines to the approximated point this process was repeated until the extrapolated outlines matched the visually apparent closure of the cavity note that l t differs from the cavity length l which is defined as twice the straight line distance from the cavitator to the location with the maximum cavity diameter the maximum cavity diameter d m a x can be directly measured from the traced outlines definition a however our previous study lee et al 2018 suggested that the cavity diameter measured at the first peak on the lower outline definition b must be considered as d m a x if the experiments are performed in an experimental facility of finite size lee et al 2018 demonstrated that supercavities were found to be elongated due to blockage effects as an example d m a x and its position x m a x y m a x based on definition b are shown in fig 2 along with the values produced by the conventional definition definition a d m a x differs somewhat between the two definitions while x m a x differs substantially the cavity dimensions i e d m a x and l 2 x m a x agree well with the literature data obtained through calculations and experiments without considering the blockage effects 3 results and discussion 3 1 flow conditions the vertical velocities of the periodic flows produced by the gust generator were measured upstream of the cavitator using laser doppler velocimetry ldv to enable comparison with the previously published data the relative distance between the measurement point and the cavitator was set same as that set in a study by lee et al 2013 so that the vertical velocity was measured approximately 1 0 d c upstream from the cavitator fig 3 a shows the relation between the frequency of the gust generator f g and the maximum vertical velocity of the gust flow v f l o w the flow frequencies obtained from ldv measurements were equivalent to f g for each condition as shown in fig 3 a v f l o w is determined as a function mainly of f g and a g and increases linearly with f g for each a g the periodic flow conditions in these experiments were characterized by two dimensionless parameters frequency f g d c u and amplitude a f l o w v f l o w 2 π f g d c fig 3 b shows that the vertical flows generated by the gust generator were considerably similar to those produced in safl s experiments lee et al 2013 3 2 appearance of supercavities fig 4 shows instantaneous cavity images obtained under the flow conditions shown in fig 3 b i e d c 10 mm and a g 8 at safl and d c 23 7 mm and a g 6 at kriso although clear similarity was achieved in terms of vertical flow conditions the shapes of the supercavities from the two facilities were substantially different the cavity slenderness l t d m a x is approximately 13 2 and 7 8 at the lowest gust frequency at safl and kriso respectively this difference might be attributed to the differences in flow conditions characterized by the froude number ventilated cavitation number and blockage ratio d c d 4 7 at safl and d c d 7 0 at krsio for experiments conducted in closed wall tunnels the ventilated cavitation number approaches its minimum value as the froude number increases at the lower limit of the attainable cavitation numbers where the supercavity becomes transparent and stable blockage is the main influence on cavity dimensions kawakami and arndt 2011 however shao et al 2017 described that despite the blockage ratio being the same a larger cross section cavitation tunnel leads to a smaller pressure loss across the span of a supercavity and consequently shortens the total cavity length and strengthens the re entrant jet at the closure they experimentally investigated the geometry of natural supercavities with the same cavitation number froude number and blockage ratio across two different cavitation tunnels as pointed out by shao et al 2017 the slenderness of a supercavity appears to be mainly affected by the dimensions of the tunnel test sections the cavity dimensions approximated for unbounded flows will be discussed in section 3 3 another main difference in cavity shapes at the two facilities is that the supercavities formed in our experiments feature ripples on their surfaces such a rippled surface has often been observed in backward facing models in which the cavitator is mounted downstream of a hydrofoil shaped strut kawakami and arndt 2011 lee et al 2016 kawakami and arndt 2011 explained that the cavity surface was directly disturbed by the wake of the upstream mounting strut however with forward facing models that have the mounting strut placed downstream karn et al 2015 experimentally observed that supercavities include visible disturbances as in kuklinski et al 2001 the surface disturbance was explained as a kelvin helmholtz instability caused by the relative velocity across the interface between air and water our experimental observations provide another explanation for the surface instability appearing in supercavities experiencing periodic gust flows as shown in fig 5 the cavity surface disturbance depends on the incident angle of the flow a vertical upward flow leads to visible wrinkling of the lower cavity surface while a downward flow acts on the upper surface these disturbances appear to be initiated by von kármán vortices shed from the cavitator consequently the rippled cavity surface observed in our experiments was strongly dominated by the leading edge vortices which depend on the reynolds number of the flow rather than kelvin helmholtz instabilities the reynolds number based on the cavitator diameter was approximately 0 8 105 for safl and 2 105 for kriso 3 3 cavity dimensions fig 6 shows the averaged total cavity length plotted against the maximum velocity of the gust generator v g l 4 δ θ f g lee et al 2013 where the angular displacements δ θ 0 070 0 105 and 0 140 radians correspond to a g 4 6 and 8 respectively lee et al 2013 suggested that v g u 0 006 leads to a significant decrease in l t and lee et al 2016 reported a slightly lesser v g u 0 005 with a backward facing model in this study the threshold of v g u at which l t is shortened yielded was nearly the same as shown in fig 6 although lee et al 2013 successfully established a criterion for the shortening of l t their criterion cannot be easily used in practice because gust generators are employed only in model scale experiments hence we introduce a criterion based on the relative vertical velocity of the flows fig 7 plots averaged l t against the maximum vertical velocity of a gust flow v f l o w a significant shortening of l t occurs when v f l o w u 0 045 based on our suggested criterion the results from kriso and safl s experiments are analyzed and plotted in fig 8 the horizontal axis represents the normalized frequency of the gust flows and the vertical axis represents the normalized amplitude the frequency and amplitude of the experimental data were obtained from ldv measurements and the data points for safl were reprinted from lee et al 2013 the flow amplitude of the criterion corresponding to f g was calculated assuming v f l o w 0 045 u solid symbols indicate that the total cavity length is shortened in periodic gust flows the fitted curve divides the experimental data into two groups based on l t the flow conditions above the criterion curve indicate that l t decreases significantly although the suggested criterion is not supported by all the experimental data we found that the suggested criterion provides reasonable predictions of whether l t will decrease under periodic flows the suggested criterion must be practically useful for an example the dimensionless flow amplitude at a given depth y and d c can be expressed by a f l o w f 0 5 h f e x p 2 π y λ w d c where h f 2 2 s f δ f and a wave length λ w g t w 2 2 π the ocean wave field is widely modeled with s f c 1 exp c 2 f 4 f 5 where c 1 5 h w 2 16 t w 4 and c 2 5 4 t w 4 and significant wave height h w and model wave period t w can be obtained from available datasets such as bales 1982 as a consequence y and d c is adjusted at the initial design stage of a supercavitating vehicle to ensure that a f l o w over all frequencies is below the suggested criterion fig 9 shows the averaged length and maximum diameter of supercavities for which the total cavity length is not significantly shortened i e v f l o w u 0 045 note that l is defined as twice the distance from the cavitator to the location of the maximum cavity diameter l 2 x m a x our experimental results are fitted to a theoretical model to relate the cavitation numbers for the bounded and unbounded flows as follows σ 2 σ c 2 σ m i n 2 2 σ c where σ and σ c indicate the ventilated cavitation number for the unbounded open water and bounded experimental facility flows respectively σ m i n denotes the minimum value of the ventilated cavitation number which is determined by blockage effects since σ m i n σ c for transparent supercavities our calculations assume that σ 0 5 σ c as shown in fig 9 both l d c and d m a x d c at σ agree considerably well with the garabedian s formula garabedian 1956 for steady flows the garabedian s formula is expressed as follows d m a x d c c d o 1 σ σ 0 132 σ 8 7 1 2 l d c σ 0 008 σ 0 066 1 7 σ d m a x d c where c d o indicates c d at σ 0 i e c d o 0 815 may 1975 this indicates that vertical flow velocities at v f l o w u 0 045 minimally affect the cavity dimensions the experimental results provide additional support for the constraint suggested by our previous study on the measurements of cavity dimensions in closed wall tunnel experiments although periodic gust flows at v f l o w u 0 045 do not cause significant changes in the cavity shape the supercavities did oscillate up and down the variations in d m a x x m a x and y m a x values gradually increased with increasing gust frequency their standard deviations were less than approximately 0 18 1 08 and 0 08 of d c respectively the deviations in d m a x and y m a x have important influences on the designed body diameter of a supercavitating vehicle because a smaller marginal distance between the body and cavity surface increases the probability of body planing 3 4 cavity behavior in discrete gust flows herein the cavity behaviors in incident discrete gust flows were studied as shown in fig 10 the procedure to produce a discrete vertical gust is as follows the gust generator is initially held at zero angle of attack region i completes one cycle of oscillation region ii and returns to its original position region iii the time history of y m a x makes clear that the cavity responds well to the discrete gust flow and the detected period matches the frequency of the gust generator we found a remarkable difference in cavity behaviors under the continuous and discrete incident gust flows as shown in fig 11 a continuous gust flow with v f l o w u 0 0558 leads to a significant change in cavity shape and the cavity outlines become sinusoidal due to the periodic disturbance in contrast discrete gust flows do not cause distinct changes in the cavity shape even if they have the same frequency and amplitude as a continuous gust flow this implies that the momentum of a discrete gust flow is insufficient to change the cavity shape while continuous flows build up sufficient momentum to alter the cavity shape 4 concluding remarks we experimentally investigated the morphological features of ventilated supercavities undergoing both continuous and discrete gust flows our experiments were conducted in the medium sized high speed cavitation tunnel at kriso measurements were repeated several times over different days to obtain a representative sample and the uncertainties of maximum cavity diameter and its position in repeated measurements was typically less than 4 of each value we compared these results with those measured at safl under similar flow conditions although the observations at each facility indicate different cavity shapes the threshold at which the total cavity length shortens was similar for data obtained from kriso and safl to predict the shortening of supercavities we suggested a new criterion based on the relative vertical velocity of incident flows i e the total cavity length decreases once the vertical flow velocity reaches approximately 4 5 of the horizontal flow velocity herein we also observed that discrete gust flows lead to smaller changes in the cavity shape relative to continuous gust flows these findings have important implications for approximating the gust flow conditions that permit a vehicle to maintain a robust and stable supercavity our suggested criterion can be used in practice to define limits on the main dimensions and necessary submerged depth for a supercavitating vehicle operating under a given set of sea conditions acknowledgment this research was supported by grants from national r d projects funded by civil

the cavity dimensions were defined on a rectangular coordinate system which has its origin at the center of the cavitator to enable ready comparisons with data from the published literature we used two different measurements to describe the cavity length the total length of the supercavity l t indicates the straight line distance between the cavitator and cavity closure point as shown in fig 2 the position of the cavity closure is not clearly distinct from the cavity wake and thus not detected by the edge detection algorithm herein the cavity closure in the images was determined semi automatically i e the point that is expected to be the intersection between the upper and lower outlines was first selected followed by the extrapolation of the upper and lower outlines to the approximated point this process was repeated until the extrapolated outlines matched the visually apparent closure of the cavity note that l t differs from the cavity length l which is defined as twice the straight line distance from the cavitator to the location with the maximum cavity diameter the maximum cavity diameter d m a x can be directly measured from the traced outlines definition a however our previous study lee et al 2018 suggested that the cavity diameter measured at the first peak on the lower outline definition b must be considered as d m a x if the experiments are performed in an experimental facility of finite size lee et al 2018 demonstrated that supercavities were found to be elongated due to blockage effects as an example d m a x and its position x m a x y m a x based on definition b are shown in fig 2 along with the values produced by the conventional definition definition a d m a x differs somewhat between the two definitions while x m a x differs substantially the cavity dimensions i e d m a x and l 2 x m a x agree well with the literature data obtained through calculations and experiments without considering the blockage effects 3 results and discussion 3 1 flow conditions the vertical velocities of the periodic flows produced by the gust generator were measured upstream of the cavitator using laser doppler velocimetry ldv to enable comparison with the previously published data the relative distance between the measurement point and the cavitator was set same as that set in a study by lee et al 2013 so that the vertical velocity was measured approximately 1 0 d c upstream from the cavitator fig 3 a shows the relation between the frequency of the gust generator f g and the maximum vertical velocity of the gust flow v f l o w the flow frequencies obtained from ldv measurements were equivalent to f g for each condition as shown in fig 3 a v f l o w is determined as a function mainly of f g and a g and increases linearly with f g for each a g the periodic flow conditions in these experiments were characterized by two dimensionless parameters frequency f g d c u and amplitude a f l o w v f l o w 2 π f g d c fig 3 b shows that the vertical flows generated by the gust generator were considerably similar to those produced in safl s experiments lee et al 2013 3 2 appearance of supercavities fig 4 shows instantaneous cavity images obtained under the flow conditions shown in fig 3 b i e d c 10 mm and a g 8 at safl and d c 23 7 mm and a g 6 at kriso although clear similarity was achieved in terms of vertical flow conditions the shapes of the supercavities from the two facilities were substantially different the cavity slenderness l t d m a x is approximately 13 2 and 7 8 at the lowest gust frequency at safl and kriso respectively this difference might be attributed to the differences in flow conditions characterized by the froude number ventilated cavitation number and blockage ratio d c d 4 7 at safl and d c d 7 0 at krsio for experiments conducted in closed wall tunnels the ventilated cavitation number approaches its minimum value as the froude number increases at the lower limit of the attainable cavitation numbers where the supercavity becomes transparent and stable blockage is the main influence on cavity dimensions kawakami and arndt 2011 however shao et al 2017 described that despite the blockage ratio being the same a larger cross section cavitation tunnel leads to a smaller pressure loss across the span of a supercavity and consequently shortens the total cavity length and strengthens the re entrant jet at the closure they experimentally investigated the geometry of natural supercavities with the same cavitation number froude number and blockage ratio across two different cavitation tunnels as pointed out by shao et al 2017 the slenderness of a supercavity appears to be mainly affected by the dimensions of the tunnel test sections the cavity dimensions approximated for unbounded flows will be discussed in section 3 3 another main difference in cavity shapes at the two facilities is that the supercavities formed in our experiments feature ripples on their surfaces such a rippled surface has often been observed in backward facing models in which the cavitator is mounted downstream of a hydrofoil shaped strut kawakami and arndt 2011 lee et al 2016 kawakami and arndt 2011 explained that the cavity surface was directly disturbed by the wake of the upstream mounting strut however with forward facing models that have the mounting strut placed downstream karn et al 2015 experimentally observed that supercavities include visible disturbances as in kuklinski et al 2001 the surface disturbance was explained as a kelvin helmholtz instability caused by the relative velocity across the interface between air and water our experimental observations provide another explanation for the surface instability appearing in supercavities experiencing periodic gust flows as shown in fig 5 the cavity surface disturbance depends on the incident angle of the flow a vertical upward flow leads to visible wrinkling of the lower cavity surface while a downward flow acts on the upper surface these disturbances appear to be initiated by von kármán vortices shed from the cavitator consequently the rippled cavity surface observed in our experiments was strongly dominated by the leading edge vortices which depend on the reynolds number of the flow rather than kelvin helmholtz instabilities the reynolds number based on the cavitator diameter was approximately 0 8 105 for safl and 2 105 for kriso 3 3 cavity dimensions fig 6 shows the averaged total cavity length plotted against the maximum velocity of the gust generator v g l 4 δ θ f g lee et al 2013 where the angular displacements δ θ 0 070 0 105 and 0 140 radians correspond to a g 4 6 and 8 respectively lee et al 2013 suggested that v g u 0 006 leads to a significant decrease in l t and lee et al 2016 reported a slightly lesser v g u 0 005 with a backward facing model in this study the threshold of v g u at which l t is shortened yielded was nearly the same as shown in fig 6 although lee et al 2013 successfully established a criterion for the shortening of l t their criterion cannot be easily used in practice because gust generators are employed only in model scale experiments hence we introduce a criterion based on the relative vertical velocity of the flows fig 7 plots averaged l t against the maximum vertical velocity of a gust flow v f l o w a significant shortening of l t occurs when v f l o w u 0 045 based on our suggested criterion the results from kriso and safl s experiments are analyzed and plotted in fig 8 the horizontal axis represents the normalized frequency of the gust flows and the vertical axis represents the normalized amplitude the frequency and amplitude of the experimental data were obtained from ldv measurements and the data points for safl were reprinted from lee et al 2013 the flow amplitude of the criterion corresponding to f g was calculated assuming v f l o w 0 045 u solid symbols indicate that the total cavity length is shortened in periodic gust flows the fitted curve divides the experimental data into two groups based on l t the flow conditions above the criterion curve indicate that l t decreases significantly although the suggested criterion is not supported by all the experimental data we found that the suggested criterion provides reasonable predictions of whether l t will decrease under periodic flows the suggested criterion must be practically useful for an example the dimensionless flow amplitude at a given depth y and d c can be expressed by a f l o w f 0 5 h f e x p 2 π y λ w d c where h f 2 2 s f δ f and a wave length λ w g t w 2 2 π the ocean wave field is widely modeled with s f c 1 exp c 2 f 4 f 5 where c 1 5 h w 2 16 t w 4 and c 2 5 4 t w 4 and significant wave height h w and model wave period t w can be obtained from available datasets such as bales 1982 as a consequence y and d c is adjusted at the initial design stage of a supercavitating vehicle to ensure that a f l o w over all frequencies is below the suggested criterion fig 9 shows the averaged length and maximum diameter of supercavities for which the total cavity length is not significantly shortened i e v f l o w u 0 045 note that l is defined as twice the distance from the cavitator to the location of the maximum cavity diameter l 2 x m a x our experimental results are fitted to a theoretical model to relate the cavitation numbers for the bounded and unbounded flows as follows σ 2 σ c 2 σ m i n 2 2 σ c where σ and σ c indicate the ventilated cavitation number for the unbounded open water and bounded experimental facility flows respectively σ m i n denotes the minimum value of the ventilated cavitation number which is determined by blockage effects since σ m i n σ c for transparent supercavities our calculations assume that σ 0 5 σ c as shown in fig 9 both l d c and d m a x d c at σ agree considerably well with the garabedian s formula garabedian 1956 for steady flows the garabedian s formula is expressed as follows d m a x d c c d o 1 σ σ 0 132 σ 8 7 1 2 l d c σ 0 008 σ 0 066 1 7 σ d m a x d c where c d o indicates c d at σ 0 i e c d o 0 815 may 1975 this indicates that vertical flow velocities at v f l o w u 0 045 minimally affect the cavity dimensions the experimental results provide additional support for the constraint suggested by our previous study on the measurements of cavity dimensions in closed wall tunnel experiments although periodic gust flows at v f l o w u 0 045 do not cause significant changes in the cavity shape the supercavities did oscillate up and down the variations in d m a x x m a x and y m a x values gradually increased with increasing gust frequency their standard deviations were less than approximately 0 18 1 08 and 0 08 of d c respectively the deviations in d m a x and y m a x have important influences on the designed body diameter of a supercavitating vehicle because a smaller marginal distance between the body and cavity surface increases the probability of body planing 3 4 cavity behavior in discrete gust flows herein the cavity behaviors in incident discrete gust flows were studied as shown in fig 10 the procedure to produce a discrete vertical gust is as follows the gust generator is initially held at zero angle of attack region i completes one cycle of oscillation region ii and returns to its original position region iii the time history of y m a x makes clear that the cavity responds well to the discrete gust flow and the detected period matches the frequency of the gust generator we found a remarkable difference in cavity behaviors under the continuous and discrete incident gust flows as shown in fig 11 a continuous gust flow with v f l o w u 0 0558 leads to a significant change in cavity shape and the cavity outlines become sinusoidal due to the periodic disturbance in contrast discrete gust flows do not cause distinct changes in the cavity shape even if they have the same frequency and amplitude as a continuous gust flow this implies that the momentum of a discrete gust flow is insufficient to change the cavity shape while continuous flows build up sufficient momentum to alter the cavity shape 4 concluding remarks we experimentally investigated the morphological features of ventilated supercavities undergoing both continuous and discrete gust flows our experiments were conducted in the medium sized high speed cavitation tunnel at kriso measurements were repeated several times over different days to obtain a representative sample and the uncertainties of maximum cavity diameter and its position in repeated measurements was typically less than 4 of each value we compared these results with those measured at safl under similar flow conditions although the observations at each facility indicate different cavity shapes the threshold at which the total cavity length shortens was similar for data obtained from kriso and safl to predict the shortening of supercavities we suggested a new criterion based on the relative vertical velocity of incident flows i e the total cavity length decreases once the vertical flow velocity reaches approximately 4 5 of the horizontal flow velocity herein we also observed that discrete gust flows lead to smaller changes in the cavity shape relative to continuous gust flows these findings have important implications for approximating the gust flow conditions that permit a vehicle to maintain a robust and stable supercavity our suggested criterion can be used in practice to define limits on the main dimensions and necessary submerged depth for a supercavitating vehicle operating under a given set of sea conditions acknowledgment this research was supported by grants from national r d projects funded by civil

23036,operational modal analysis based on the ambient vibration data has drawn great attention however measured responses are inevitably contaminated with noise and may not be clean enough for estimating the modal parameters with proper accuracy this study develops an operational modal analysis procedure named next slra ce based on noise removal from measured ambient vibration responses including three steps 1 using natural excitation technique next to get free decay responses auto and cross correlation functions from measured noisy ambient vibration data 2 implementing iterative cadzow s algorithm for the structured low rank approximation slra to remove noise from the noisy correlation functions and 3 applying the complex exponential ce method to extract modal parameters from the filtered correlation functions the validity of the proposed operational modal analysis procedure is verified by using a numerical simulation of a four story shear building subjected to white noise excitation with considering the effects of noise record length and different reference channel furthermore the proposed procedure is applied to a field test of a jacket type offshore platform results indicate that the next slra ce method can remove noise from measured signals and improve the efficiency and accuracy of the modal frequencies and damping ratios estimation keywords operational modal analysis noise removal structured low rank approximation natural excitation technique jacket type offshore platform 1 introduction modal parameters identification of offshore structures has long been an interesting research topic li et al 2012 liu et al 2014 chen et al 2016 minette et al 2016 there has been at least a hundred different modal parameter estimation algorithms developed in the past four decades ewins 2000 basically the experimental modal analysis procedure is carried out based on the measured data being the frequency response function frf or impulse response function irf however for large and complex engineering structures such as offshore platforms these approaches have been seriously restricted because of the difficulties in measuring the input forces extracting modal parameters from output data has been a subject of constant improvement and enhancements operational modal analysis is such a kind of output data only identification technique that utilizes the dynamic responses of a structure due to ambient excitation e g wind waves and traffic loading nagarajaiah and chen 2016 su et al 2014 it represents a real operational condition of the structure and no additional excitation equipment is required during the modal testing numerous operational modal analysis algorithms have been developed to identify modal parameters of a structure from its ambient vibrations these algorithms mainly work in either the frequency or time domains one of the most widely used methods in the frequency domain is the peak picking method bendat and piersol 1993 however the peak picking technique relies heavily on the frequency resolution and closely spaced modes are hard to be identified to overcome this drawback the frequency domain decomposition method was developed using the singular value decomposition to detect mode multiplicity brinker et al 2001 a method named polymax based on the least squares complex frequency domain was also proposed which can yield clear stabilization diagrams and make an automation of the parameter identification process rather straightforward peeters et al 2004 recently the power spectrum density transmissibility was developed to extract the operational modal parameters of a structure with different transferring outputs yan and ren 2012 although generally simple the methods in the frequency domain do not work well for structural systems with heavy damping and strong modal interference lardies and ta 2011 in the time domain the random decrement technique vandiver et al 1982 and natural excitation technique next james et al 1995 are the two typical methods to convert ambient vibration responses into free decay responses based on the free decay responses the time domain modal analysis methods are then applied to extract the modal parameters generally speaking the random decrement technique is with either the ibrahim time domain scheme ibrahim and mikulcik 1973 or the least squares complex exponential method brown et al 1976 and the next is with either the eigensystem realization algorithm juang and pappa 1985 caicedo 2011 or the polyreference complex exponential method void and rocklin 1982 there are also some methods using directly the ambient vibration responses to identify the modal parameters such as autoregressive moving average method loh and wu 1996 stochastic subspace identification method peeters and de roeck 2000 and blind source separation method zhou and chelidze 2007 mcneill 2011 most of the time domain methods are based on an assumption that the input forces of structures are white noise except the autoregressive moving average method and blind source separation method this assumption is quite acceptable in civil or offshore engineering applications su et al 2014 this work focuses on operational modal parameters identification using next with complex exponential ce method as the basis of the least squares complex exponential method and the polyreference complex exponential method the ce algorithm has historically been derived from prony s method ewins 2000 this method simply takes an irf which is composed of a summation of damped exponentials and estimates the amplitude frequency and damping of the individual terms in the summation the ce method has become one of the most popular methods used by modern commercial software for experimental modal analysis however in comparison with other modern modal identification methods such as eigensystem realization algorithm and stochastic subspace identification method a major drawback of the traditional ce method is that it does not have a noise rejection mechanism in the identification process and thus it is sensitive to the noise embedded in the signals braun and ram 1987 as measured signals are inevitably contaminated with noise during an experimental measurement it has been a challenging task to accurately estimate the modal parameters the traditional methods to improve the accuracy of parameters identification in noisy situations are based on over determined system and the distinguishing procedure such as stability diagrams could be used to get the true system modes allemang and brown 1988 however the distinguishing procedure relies on the user s experience and judgment and it is still difficult to sort out noise modes especially when the signal noise ratio of measured data is low therefore it is of great importance to develop a method that can overcome this problem to estimate the modal parameters with high accuracy currently several works have been done towards the noise elimination algorithm for modal analysis jiang et al 2007 developed a bayesian discrete wavelet packet transform denoising approach from measured data for accurate structural system identification hu et al 2010 2012 and bao et al 2015 treated the noise elimination algorithm as an optimization problem and cadzow s algorithm cadzow 1988 for structured low rank approximation slra for the hankel matrix constructed from measured irf was carried out then the time domain modal analysis method is used to extract accurate modal parameters from the filtered irf recently an l2 norm optimized mathematical algorithm based on solving the partially described inverse singular value problem pdisvp hu and li 2008 has been developed and extended to noise removal in simple structure experiments by bao et al 2016 compared with the pdisvp method the cadzow s algorithm is time saving although cadzow s algorithm has been criticized being suboptimal in l2 norm criterion de moor 1994 tufts and shah 1993 it is not a critical flaw for engineering applications the validity of the cadzow s method for noise elimination has been verified by free decay responses or irfs of a simple structure hu et al 2010 2012 bao et al 2015 and needs to be further checked by using ambient vibration responses from complex structure models and even real offshore or civil structures this study develops a novel operational modal analysis procedure next slra ce including three steps 1 free decay responses auto and cross correlation functions converted from measured ambient vibration responses by using next 2 signal de noising from the measured correlation functions by implementing iterative cadzow s algorithm for the slra 3 modal parameters estimation from the filtered correlation functions by using ce method in what follows the essential of next and ce methods are briefly introduced and the slra method is formulated the validity of the proposed operational modal analysis procedure is verified by using a numerical simulation of a four story shear building subjected to white noise input with considering the effects of noise record length and different reference channel furthermore the proposed procedure next slra ce is applied to process the ambient acceleration responses of a jacket type offshore platform which has closely spaced modes 2 theoretical background 2 1 next the basic principle of next states that a dynamic system excited by random inputs produces autocorrelation and cross correlation functions that are sums of decaying sinusoids furthermore these decaying sinusoids must have the same damped frequencies and damping ratios as the modes of the system consequently the correlation functions will have the same form as irfs and can be used in time domain modal parameter estimation schemes in order to understand this concept a brief explanation will be provided readers are advised to refer to the work by james et al 1995 for full derivation of the method an n degree of freedom dof dynamic system can be represented by a linear second order differential equation as 1 m x t c x t k x t f t where m c and k are the n n mass matrix damping matrix and stiffness matrix respectively x x and x are n 1 acceleration vector velocity vector and displacement vector respectively f is a vector of random forcing functions the cross correlation function of two responses x i k and x j k under a white noise input at a particular input point k is defined as the expected value of the product of two responses evaluated at a time separation of t 2 r i j k t e x i k t t x j k t where e is the expectation operator and then after derivation and simplification the cross correlation function can be expressed as 3 r i j t r 1 n φ i r g j r m r ω d r exp ξ r ω n r t sin ω d r t θ r where φ i r is the i th component of mode shape φ r m r ξ r ω n r and ω d r are the r th modal mass modal damping ratio modal frequency and damped modal frequency respectively g j r is a new constant multiplier θ r is a phase angle it shows that the cross correlation function is a sum of decaying sinusoids each decaying sinusoid has a damped natural frequency and damping ratio that is identical to that of a corresponding structural mode the irf between input k and output i can be written as 4 x i k t r 1 n φ i r φ k r m r ω d r exp ξ r ω n r t sin ω d r t it shows that the cross correlation function eq 3 is of the same form as the irf of the original system in eq 4 this similarity allows the use of time domain modal parameter identification schemes such as ce method polyreference complex exponential method and eigensystem realization algorithm 2 2 ce algorithm the basic principle of the ce method is that any free vibration response function including irf can be expressed as a series of complex exponential components and each of them contains the eigenvalue and eigenvector properties of one mode ewins 2000 for facilitating our later presentation a brief description of the essential of ce method is given as below the irf of an n dof system in eq 4 can also be expressed as 5 h t r 1 n a r e s r t a r e s r t where a r is the complex amplitude and the superscript denotes the complex conjugate operator s r is the system pole s r ω n r ξ r i ω d r and ω d r ω n r 1 ξ r 2 introducing ω n r n ω d r a r n a r for r 1 n we can rewrite eq 5 as 6 h t r 1 2 n a r e s r t if the original irf has been obtained in a discrete form it can be expressed as 7 h l h l δ t l 0 1 2 where δ t is the time interval from eqs 6 and 7 we have 8 h l r 1 2 n a r v r l where v r e s r δ t the above equation is a non linear function of the unknown modal parameters however once v r i e modal frequencies and damping ratios are known eq 8 becomes linear with respect to the remaining unknown modal parameters a r for this reason the numerical approach in many algorithms involves identifying first the modal frequencies and damping ratios which are global properties of the system and share the same values in different irfs regardless of the input and output locations because an n dof dynamic system with n simultaneous second order linear differential equations is mathematically equivalent to a linear differential equation of order 2 n the irf sequence h l must satisfy a linear difference equation 9 h 2 n n m 0 2 n 1 β m h m n 0 n 0 1 where β m m 0 2 n 1 are real constant coefficients inserting eq 8 into eq 9 leads to 10 m 0 2 n β m v r m 0 where β 2 n has been set equal to 1 and the roots of the polynomial are v 1 v 2 v 2 n thus the values of β m determine the values of v r and hence the system natural frequencies and damping ratios the original ce method is solving β m from the irf data based on the successive applications of eq 9 for 2 n times taking n 0 2 n 1 with eq 9 results in a full set of 2 n equations 11 h 0 h 1 h 2 h 2 n 1 h 1 h 2 h 3 h 2 n h 2 n 1 h 2 n h 2 n 1 h 4 n 2 β 0 β 1 β 2 n 1 h 2 n h 2 n 1 h 4 n 1 or 12 h β h where h r 2 n 2 n is a square matrix with hankel structured which is referred to as a matrix with constant positive sloping skew diagonals from eq 12 we can obtain the unknown polynomial coefficients 13 β h 1 h if more than 2 n equations have been included in eq 11 then a least squares solution of β for an over determined case could be obtained 2 3 slra measured signals are inevitably contaminated with noise when a data acquisition system is used for an experimental measurement a measured irf sequence h l of an n dof system which is contaminated by random noise can be written as 14 h l h l e l r 1 2 m a r v r l e l l 0 1 2 where h l and e l represent the true signal and noise respectively m is the number of modes embedded in the measured data since some modes of the system might not contribute to this particular irf m is possible less than n the number of dofs of the system h l can be sequentially filled to form a rectangular hankel matrix h m n r m n with m n 2 n as 15 h m n h 0 h 1 h n 1 h 1 h 2 h n h m 1 h m h s where s m n 2 theoretically the hankel matrix h corresponding to the noisy signal h l can be partitioned into two parts 16 h m n h m n e m n where h and e represent hankel structured matrices associated with the uncontaminated signal and noise parts respectively because the signal h l is contributed by m modes its corresponding hankel matrix h must be with a rank 2 m hu et al 2010 a noise removal method for estimating h l from h l is thus by estimating h based on h where the estimate of h denoted h ˆ must be a hankel matrix with rank 2 m while approximating h to its nearest matrix h ˆ an often used criterion is based on minimizing the frobenius norm l 2 norm of the difference between h and h ˆ denoted h h ˆ 2 chu et al 2003 in mathematical terms the noise reduction problem here is a slra problem which concerns the construction of the nearest approximation to a given matrix by a matrix with a specific rank and a specific linear structure chu et al 2003 in the current case the resulting matrix must maintain the same hankel structure and be lowered in rank as well the data matrix being hankel structured is equivalent to the existence of a linear time invariant system that fits the data and the rank constraint is related to a bound on the model order markovsky and huffel 2007 a simple engineering algorithm for solving the slra problem is the iterative cadzow s algorithm which has been also called the anti diagonal averaging method cadzow 1988 tufts and shah 1993 it can be summarized by the following steps 1 use the truncated singular value decomposition tsvd technique with rank 2 m estimated from the hankel data matrix h to obtain a low rank approximation matrix a ˆ note that the resulting matrix a ˆ will not be a hankel matrix 2 rebuild a hankel matrix h ˆ from a ˆ by replacing all elements of each anti subdiagonal by the arithmetic average of the elements along the anti subdiagonal note that the resulting hankel matrix h ˆ will not be rank 2 m in cadzow s algorithm the step 1 low rank approximation and step 2 anti subdiagonal averaging are alternated iteratively until a convergence test has been met it has been proven that such iterative usage always converges de moor 1994 2 4 procedure of next slra ce for operational modal analysis based on the above theoretical derivation of the three methods the procedure to combine next slra and ce to identify the operational modal parameters from measured ambient vibration data can be summarized into the following steps 1 acquire ambient vibration responses from the operating structure 2 calculate the auto and cross correlation functions from these time histories 3 solve the slra problem using the iterative cadzow s algorithm for noise reduction from the measured noisy correlation functions 4 apply ce modal identification scheme to estimate the modal parameters from the filtered correlation functions 3 numerical simulation in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed next slra ce operational modal estimation procedure before an application to real engineering a numerical simulation of a four story shear building was studied the four uniform mass and damping coefficients are taken to be 50 kg and 1000 ns m respectively and the first three stiffness coefficients are 2 0 107 n m and the fourth stiffness coefficient is 2 0 106 n m the 1st floor is at the fixed end and the 4th floor is at the free end the theoretical natural frequencies of the shear building are 26 457 53 135 127 05 and 181 68 hz respectively and the corresponding modal damping ratios are 1 324 1 817 1 238 and 1 476 respectively the shear building is excited under white noise on the 1st floor using lsim function in matlab mathworks r2014a the displacement responses of the shear building for 3 s are simulated with a sampling frequency of 500 hz there are 4 responses corresponding to 4 floors respectively see fig 1 the auto spectral density functions of the four output signals are shown in fig 2 it is seen that the auto spectral density function of the output m1 contains 4 clear peaks with relatively comparable magnitude however the auto spectral density function of the output m4 has its third and fourth peaks being very small relative to its first and second peaks next requires a reference channel to calculate the cross correlation function the modal identification may be different using the cross correlation function obtained from different reference channel the output m1 is firstly chosen to be the reference to perform next procedure in this section and the cross correlation function of the output m1 and m2 is shown in fig 3 the form of the cross correlation function is same as the free decay response the effectiveness of the proposed method for the cross correlation function m1 and m2 is validated below 3 1 record length parameters such as record length and sampling frequency affect the performance of next when calculating the cross correlation function caicedo 2011 in this section the modal estimation from different lengths of record is discussed the cpsd function in matlab is used to calculate the cross spectral density function mathworks r2014a in this function the welch s averaged modified periodogram method is applied the hamming window and number of overlapping to obtain 50 overlap are also used note that the number of points for the fft varies with the record length i e the next power of 2 greater than the length of record length fig 4 shows the cross spectral density function with four record lengths 1500 1000 500 and 100 time steps it is seen that the cross spectral density function calculated with the shorter record is smoother than that with the longer record it is difficult to estimate the modal parameters using peak picking method when the record length is long the ce method is applied to identify the modal frequencies and damping ratios from two record lengths 1000 and 100 time steps respectively during the modal analysis the stability diagram is plotted to eliminate spurious numerical poles modes when producing a stability diagram the poles corresponding to a certain model order are compared to the poles of a one order lower model if the modal frequency and the damping ratio differences are within preset limits the pole is labeled as a stable one adopting the preset limits with 1 difference for frequencies 5 for damping ratios and 2 for the modal vector among two consecutive model orders namely 17 f n f n 1 f n 1 18 ξ n ξ n 1 ξ n 5 and 19 1 ϕ n ϕ n 1 2 ϕ n ϕ n ϕ n 1 ϕ n 1 2 where f n ξ n and ϕ n denote an estimated frequency damping ratio and modal vector with model order n respectively and is the inner product operation throughout this study the same stability criteria are applied to all stability diagrams figs 5 and 6 are the stability diagrams based on the records of 1000 time steps and 100 time steps respectively the symbols o and in the stability diagrams represent non stable and stable frequency damping and modal vector respectively the stability diagram associated with the records of 100 time steps has more consistent frequency estimates near the 4 system frequencies than that of the records of 1000 time steps extending from higher order to lower order models although the signals are not contaminated with noise many poles are labeled unstable because they do not meet the preset stability standard listed in table 1 are the estimated modal frequencies and damping ratios from two record lengths respectively with the model order 4 it is found that the relative differences rd of the theoretical values and identified values from records of 100 time steps are all less than that from 1000 time steps this numerical observation basically agrees with caicedo s conclusion that relatively short records are preferred for relatively clean data caicedo 2011 it is also found that the record length has less influence on identification of frequencies than damping ratios 3 2 noise simulation and elimination because the cross spectral density function calculated with the shorter record is smoother than that with the longer record see fig 4 the shorter record 100 time steps is applied in this section to conduct noise simulation and elimination the noisy signal is generated by adding a gaussian white noise to the original clean output m1 and m2 the level of the additive white noise is quantified by a stated percentage defined as the ratio of the standard deviation of the white noise to that of the original output in order to unify the noise added into different outputs the noise level is defined as the ratio of standard deviation of the white noise to that of the output m1 after performing next procedure the cross correlation function of the noisy output m1 and m2 is obtained shown in fig 7 is a comparison of cross spectral density functions associated with original and 40 noise signals it is seen that the first and fourth modes are the weak modes which are easily influenced by noise an important aspect of the proposed noise reduction scheme is related to the chosen size of a hankel matrix produced from the noisy cross correlation function for implementing the slra for the hankel matrix a more convenient and efficient choice for the size of the hankel matrix is supposed to be square or nearly square hu et al 2010 in this case with 100 time steps the corresponding largest nearly square hankel matrix h m n is a 51 50 or 50 51 matrix noting that m n 1 is equal to 100 time step number of the cross correlation function without losing the generality we assume m n and h 51 50 is constructed carrying out the noise elimination is to conduct the cadzow s algorithm for hankel matrix h 51 50 in cadzow s method the first step is to apply singular value decomposition together with an observed noise threshold to determine the rank of the hankel matrix this rank in theory is equal to two times the number of modes embedded in the noisy cross correlation function the rank of a matrix could be easily estimated if the singular values have been ordered sequentially from the largest to the smallest for theoretical data without noise the singular values should go to zero when the rank of the matrix is exceeded for noisy data however due to random errors and small inconsistencies in the data the singular values cannot be zeros but very small numbers hu et al 2010 the ordered singular values associated with the hankel matrix h 51 50 for the noisy cross correlation function is plotted in fig 8 where each singular value was normalized by the first largest singular value it is found that the curve drop to an asymptote at the 8th singular value thus the rank should be taken equal to 8 that means all the 4 modes of the four story shear building are identifiable from the noisy cross correlation function although the accuracy of the estimation might be affected by noise the noise reduction is implemented by applying cadzow s algorithm based on the rank of hankel matrix h 51 50 being 8 the comparison of the filtered and the original cross spectral density functions are shown in fig 9 where the matching of the curves is good that means the visible level of noise has been successfully removed 3 3 modal parameters estimation after carrying out the noise elimination to obtain the filtered cross correlation function the ce method is then applied for estimating modal frequencies and damping ratios in order to show the performance of the proposed method the stability diagrams of the noisy and filtered cross correlation functions are both presented here see fig 10 it is seen that there are less stable poles estimated from the noisy cross correlation function accordingly it is difficult to accurately identify the modal parameters directly from the noisy cross correlation functions note that the stability diagram associated with the noisy cross correlation function has only 2 and unstable poles when the model order is 4 in contrast the stability diagram associated with the filtered cross correlation function has 4 consistent and stable poles from model order 4 to higher model order that indicate we can identify the modal parameters just using the model order 4 and need not repeat the identification process with model order increasing the identified modal frequencies from the filtered cross correlation function with model order 4 are 26 817 52 556 125 85 and 180 76 hz respectively and damping ratios are 5 239 2 794 1 132 and 0 744 respectively compared with the theoretical values the relative differences of the frequencies are 1 361 1 09 0 945 and 0 506 respectively and that of the damping ratios are 295 695 53 770 8 724 and 49 593 respectively the estimated frequencies are in accord with the true values all being with less than 2 relative error the relative differences of the damping ratios are relatively big especially for the first damping ratio however that is not bad recognizing that the relative error of the first damping ratio estimated from the original cross correlation function 100 time steps see table 1 is also big and the third damping ratio estimated from the filtered cross correlation function is closer to the true value than that from the original signal furthermore the first and fourth modes could not be identified if the noisy cross correlation function is used with the model order 4 see fig 10 a in brief the proposed procedure can improve the efficiency and accuracy of the modal parameters estimation 3 4 different reference channel reference channel choosing is important for performing next procedure and modal identification the output m4 is chosen to be the reference and the cross correlation function of the output m4 and m2 is calculated in this section note that the third and fourth peaks of the auto spectral density function of the output m4 are very small see fig 2 which means the contribution of the third and fourth modes is very small the simulation procedures are conducted below to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for the cross correlation function m4m2 1 the original cross correlation function with 100 time steps is applied and 40 noise signal is simulated fig 11 shows the cross spectral density functions associated with original and noisy signals it is found that the third and fourth peaks are embedded by noise in the noisy signal 2 the noise reduction is implemented by applying cadzow s algorithm based on the rank of hankel matrix being 4 see fig 12 the comparison of the filtered and the original cross spectral density functions is shown in fig 13 as expected the matching of the curves related to the first two modes is good that means the weak modes the third and fourth modes are regarded as noise and have been removed 3 modal estimation using the stability diagrams for the noisy and filtered cross correlation functions are presented see fig 14 it is seen that there are less stable poles estimated from model order 2 to 13 using the noisy cross correlation function if the model order is more than 13 some false modes will also tend to be stable that brings difficulties in modal identification using the noisy signal however the stability diagram associated with the filtered cross correlation function has 2 consistent and stable poles beginning with model order 2 the identified first two modal frequencies from the filtered cross correlation function with model order 2 are 26 441 and 53 517 hz respectively and the corresponding damping ratios are 2 507 and 2 263 respectively compared with the theoretical values the relative differences of the frequencies are 0 605 and 0 719 respectively and that of the damping ratios are 89 350 and 24 546 respectively results show that the different reference channel has effect on modal estimation in order to identify more modes the auto spectral density function of the reference channel is better to have more clear peaks an alternative method is to conduct the modal estimation several times using different reference channel each time and create identification diagram caicedo 2011 no matter which reference channel is chosen the proposed next slra ce procedure can improve the efficiency and accuracy of the modal identification 4 field test of a jacket type offshore platform in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in real engineering applications a four leg jacket type offshore platform in bohai bay china is studied in this section the structure is about 48 m high and the water depth at the site is about 19 5 m the four legs are cylindrical piles with a uniform outer diameter 1 34 m and a wall thickness 0 026 m an illustration of the steel frame is shown in fig 15 4 1 data acquirement in this test eight accelerometers were assembled at four legs of the structure at the elevation of 5 m with reference to the still water level respectively to measure the ambient vibration signals in the x and y directions for each position see fig 15 the excitation is random wave force which can be assumed as white noise input even though the excitation cannot be directly measured the acceleration responses for about 15 s with a sampling frequency of 200 hz were taken for analysis see fig 16 for x3 x1 and y3 fig 17 shows the auto spectral density functions of the three acquired signals as can be seen the auto spectral density function of x3 has more clear peaks with relatively high magnitude therefore x3 is chosen to be the output reference channel to perform next procedure according to the conclusion obtained in section 3 4 fig 18 shows the cross correlation functions of x3x1 and x3y3 respectively without loss of generality the performances of the proposed method for the two cross correlation functions are presented here the performances of the proposed method for other cross correlation functions calculated from different reference channels and different response channels are not provided in detail here due to length limitations 4 2 noise removal for a cross correlation function for about 15 s with 3001 time steps the corresponding largest square hankel matrix h 1501 1501 is constructed to determine the rank of each hankel matrix the normalized singular values are presented in fig 19 from which we conclude a reasonable noise threshold can be set at a rank equal to 8 and 4 for cross correlation functions x3x1 and x3y3 respectively which means there are 4 and 2 modes embedded in the two cross correlation functions respectively the noise reduction is carried out through the cadzow s method for the two hankel matrices respectively the comparison of the measured and the corresponding filtered cross spectral density functions curves are shown in fig 20 a and fig 20 b respectively the filtered signals become smoother and they have 4 and 2 peaks as expected respectively similar results can be obtained from other 6 correlation functions 4 3 modal analysis the ce method is then applied for estimating modal frequencies and damping ratios using the filtered correlation functions the stability diagrams are plotted based on the measured and filtered correlation functions x3x1 and x3y3 respectively see figs 21 and 22 it is seen that there are even no stable poles estimated from the two measured correlation functions as a result it is difficult to accurately identify the modal parameters directly from the measured correlation functions in contrast the stability diagram associated with the filtered correlation function x3x1 has 4 consistent and stable poles from lower to higher model order similarly the stability diagram associated with the filtered correlation function x3y3 has 2 stable poles even when the model order is 2 the identified modal frequencies and damping ratios from all the eight filtered correlation functions are listed in table 2 and table 3 respectively due to the noise and the difference of the response locations the weak modes may be regarded as noise modes and eliminated from the correlation functions we find that only the second modal frequencies and damping ratios can be estimated from all the 8 filtered correlation functions modal frequencies and damping ratios are considered to be global properties of the system and theoretically they should remain the same when they are estimated from different correlation functions although the true values of the modal parameters of the test jacket platform are not known we could still judge the performance of the proposed scheme based on examining the consistency among the modal parameters estimated from these different correlation functions the mean value and the coefficient of variation cov of the estimated frequencies and damping ratios from the eight filtered correlation functions are also listed in tables 2 and 3 respectively it is shown that the estimated modal frequencies and damping ratios are consistent among the filtered correlation functions the covs of the estimated modal frequencies are between 0 09 and 0 54 and the covs of the estimated damping ratios are between 2 73 and 13 39 that means the modal parameter estimations using the next slra ce method are highly consistent and reliable note that the frequencies of the first three modes as well as the fourth and fifth modes of the structure are closely spaced but the proposed method is successful in identifying them 4 4 shorter records the shorter records of cross correlation function x3x1 for 0 5 s with 1000 time steps are also analyzed in this section the hankel matrix h 501 500 is constructed and the reasonable noise threshold can be set at a rank equal to 6 see fig 23 which means there are 3 modes embedded in this segment of cross correlation function x3x1 after conducting the noise removal procedure the filtered signal becomes smoother and has 3 peaks as expected see fig 24 the ce method is then applied to estimate the modal frequencies and damping ratios the stability diagrams are plotted based on the measured and filtered correlation function x3x1 with 1000 time steps respectively see fig 25 it is still difficult to accurately identify the modal parameters from the measured correlation function in contrast the stability diagram associated with the filtered correlation function x3x1 has 3 consistent and stable poles the identified modal frequencies from the filtered correlation function are 1 995 3 290 and 3 557 hz respectively and damping ratios are 3 356 0 818 and 0 843 respectively compared with the longer records 3001 time steps the second mode cannot be estimated from the shorter records the relative differences of the frequencies identified from shorter and longer records are 0 25 0 12 and 0 11 respectively the relative differences of the damping ratios identified from shorter and longer records are 97 64 28 25 and 23 07 respectively that means the length of data has a higher effect on estimation of damping ratios than that of frequencies 5 conclusions the modal estimation procedure next slra ce is proposed to extract the operational modal frequencies and damping ratios of a structure the proposed procedure includes three steps 1 using next to get auto and cross correlation functions from noisy ambient vibration data 2 noise elimination from the noisy correlation functions by implementing cadzow s algorithm for the slra on the hankel matrix to obtain filtered correlation functions and 3 modal parameters identification from the filtered correlation functions using ce method a numerical simulation of a four story shear building is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed procedure in the next procedure selecting proper record length is important it is shown that the cross spectral density function calculated with the shorter record is smoother than that with the longer record the relative differences of the theoretical values and identified values from records of 100 time steps with model order 4 are all less than that from 1000 time steps with model order 4 it is also found that the record length has a higher effect on estimation of damping ratios than that of frequencies although the original signals are not contaminated with noise many poles are labeled unstable in the stability diagrams and the identified damping ratios have big errors when the noisy cross correlation function is directly used in modal analysis there are less stable poles in the stability diagram and accordingly it is difficult to accurately identify the modal parameters in contrast the stability diagram associated with the filtered cross correlation function has 4 consistent and stable poles from model order 4 to higher model order that means the proposed procedure can improve the efficiency and accuracy of the modal parameters estimation the reference channel choosing is another important parameter in next procedure which affects the performance of the modal estimation results indicate that the auto spectral density function of the reference channel is better to have more clear peaks in order to identify more modes furthermore the proposed procedure is applied to a field test of a jacket type offshore platform the performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by examining the consistency among the modal parameters estimated from these different correlation functions the covs of the estimated modal frequencies and damping ratios from the eight filtered correlation functions are all small that means the operational modal parameter estimations using the next slra ce method are highly consistent and reliable note that the platform has closely spaced frequencies but the proposed method is successful in identifying them acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the national key r d program of china china

23036,operational modal analysis based on the ambient vibration data has drawn great attention however measured responses are inevitably contaminated with noise and may not be clean enough for estimating the modal parameters with proper accuracy this study develops an operational modal analysis procedure named next slra ce based on noise removal from measured ambient vibration responses including three steps 1 using natural excitation technique next to get free decay responses auto and cross correlation functions from measured noisy ambient vibration data 2 implementing iterative cadzow s algorithm for the structured low rank approximation slra to remove noise from the noisy correlation functions and 3 applying the complex exponential ce method to extract modal parameters from the filtered correlation functions the validity of the proposed operational modal analysis procedure is verified by using a numerical simulation of a four story shear building subjected to white noise excitation with considering the effects of noise record length and different reference channel furthermore the proposed procedure is applied to a field test of a jacket type offshore platform results indicate that the next slra ce method can remove noise from measured signals and improve the efficiency and accuracy of the modal frequencies and damping ratios estimation keywords operational modal analysis noise removal structured low rank approximation natural excitation technique jacket type offshore platform 1 introduction modal parameters identification of offshore structures has long been an interesting research topic li et al 2012 liu et al 2014 chen et al 2016 minette et al 2016 there has been at least a hundred different modal parameter estimation algorithms developed in the past four decades ewins 2000 basically the experimental modal analysis procedure is carried out based on the measured data being the frequency response function frf or impulse response function irf however for large and complex engineering structures such as offshore platforms these approaches have been seriously restricted because of the difficulties in measuring the input forces extracting modal parameters from output data has been a subject of constant improvement and enhancements operational modal analysis is such a kind of output data only identification technique that utilizes the dynamic responses of a structure due to ambient excitation e g wind waves and traffic loading nagarajaiah and chen 2016 su et al 2014 it represents a real operational condition of the structure and no additional excitation equipment is required during the modal testing numerous operational modal analysis algorithms have been developed to identify modal parameters of a structure from its ambient vibrations these algorithms mainly work in either the frequency or time domains one of the most widely used methods in the frequency domain is the peak picking method bendat and piersol 1993 however the peak picking technique relies heavily on the frequency resolution and closely spaced modes are hard to be identified to overcome this drawback the frequency domain decomposition method was developed using the singular value decomposition to detect mode multiplicity brinker et al 2001 a method named polymax based on the least squares complex frequency domain was also proposed which can yield clear stabilization diagrams and make an automation of the parameter identification process rather straightforward peeters et al 2004 recently the power spectrum density transmissibility was developed to extract the operational modal parameters of a structure with different transferring outputs yan and ren 2012 although generally simple the methods in the frequency domain do not work well for structural systems with heavy damping and strong modal interference lardies and ta 2011 in the time domain the random decrement technique vandiver et al 1982 and natural excitation technique next james et al 1995 are the two typical methods to convert ambient vibration responses into free decay responses based on the free decay responses the time domain modal analysis methods are then applied to extract the modal parameters generally speaking the random decrement technique is with either the ibrahim time domain scheme ibrahim and mikulcik 1973 or the least squares complex exponential method brown et al 1976 and the next is with either the eigensystem realization algorithm juang and pappa 1985 caicedo 2011 or the polyreference complex exponential method void and rocklin 1982 there are also some methods using directly the ambient vibration responses to identify the modal parameters such as autoregressive moving average method loh and wu 1996 stochastic subspace identification method peeters and de roeck 2000 and blind source separation method zhou and chelidze 2007 mcneill 2011 most of the time domain methods are based on an assumption that the input forces of structures are white noise except the autoregressive moving average method and blind source separation method this assumption is quite acceptable in civil or offshore engineering applications su et al 2014 this work focuses on operational modal parameters identification using next with complex exponential ce method as the basis of the least squares complex exponential method and the polyreference complex exponential method the ce algorithm has historically been derived from prony s method ewins 2000 this method simply takes an irf which is composed of a summation of damped exponentials and estimates the amplitude frequency and damping of the individual terms in the summation the ce method has become one of the most popular methods used by modern commercial software for experimental modal analysis however in comparison with other modern modal identification methods such as eigensystem realization algorithm and stochastic subspace identification method a major drawback of the traditional ce method is that it does not have a noise rejection mechanism in the identification process and thus it is sensitive to the noise embedded in the signals braun and ram 1987 as measured signals are inevitably contaminated with noise during an experimental measurement it has been a challenging task to accurately estimate the modal parameters the traditional methods to improve the accuracy of parameters identification in noisy situations are based on over determined system and the distinguishing procedure such as stability diagrams could be used to get the true system modes allemang and brown 1988 however the distinguishing procedure relies on the user s experience and judgment and it is still difficult to sort out noise modes especially when the signal noise ratio of measured data is low therefore it is of great importance to develop a method that can overcome this problem to estimate the modal parameters with high accuracy currently several works have been done towards the noise elimination algorithm for modal analysis jiang et al 2007 developed a bayesian discrete wavelet packet transform denoising approach from measured data for accurate structural system identification hu et al 2010 2012 and bao et al 2015 treated the noise elimination algorithm as an optimization problem and cadzow s algorithm cadzow 1988 for structured low rank approximation slra for the hankel matrix constructed from measured irf was carried out then the time domain modal analysis method is used to extract accurate modal parameters from the filtered irf recently an l2 norm optimized mathematical algorithm based on solving the partially described inverse singular value problem pdisvp hu and li 2008 has been developed and extended to noise removal in simple structure experiments by bao et al 2016 compared with the pdisvp method the cadzow s algorithm is time saving although cadzow s algorithm has been criticized being suboptimal in l2 norm criterion de moor 1994 tufts and shah 1993 it is not a critical flaw for engineering applications the validity of the cadzow s method for noise elimination has been verified by free decay responses or irfs of a simple structure hu et al 2010 2012 bao et al 2015 and needs to be further checked by using ambient vibration responses from complex structure models and even real offshore or civil structures this study develops a novel operational modal analysis procedure next slra ce including three steps 1 free decay responses auto and cross correlation functions converted from measured ambient vibration responses by using next 2 signal de noising from the measured correlation functions by implementing iterative cadzow s algorithm for the slra 3 modal parameters estimation from the filtered correlation functions by using ce method in what follows the essential of next and ce methods are briefly introduced and the slra method is formulated the validity of the proposed operational modal analysis procedure is verified by using a numerical simulation of a four story shear building subjected to white noise input with considering the effects of noise record length and different reference channel furthermore the proposed procedure next slra ce is applied to process the ambient acceleration responses of a jacket type offshore platform which has closely spaced modes 2 theoretical background 2 1 next the basic principle of next states that a dynamic system excited by random inputs produces autocorrelation and cross correlation functions that are sums of decaying sinusoids furthermore these decaying sinusoids must have the same damped frequencies and damping ratios as the modes of the system consequently the correlation functions will have the same form as irfs and can be used in time domain modal parameter estimation schemes in order to understand this concept a brief explanation will be provided readers are advised to refer to the work by james et al 1995 for full derivation of the method an n degree of freedom dof dynamic system can be represented by a linear second order differential equation as 1 m x t c x t k x t f t where m c and k are the n n mass matrix damping matrix and stiffness matrix respectively x x and x are n 1 acceleration vector velocity vector and displacement vector respectively f is a vector of random forcing functions the cross correlation function of two responses x i k and x j k under a white noise input at a particular input point k is defined as the expected value of the product of two responses evaluated at a time separation of t 2 r i j k t e x i k t t x j k t where e is the expectation operator and then after derivation and simplification the cross correlation function can be expressed as 3 r i j t r 1 n φ i r g j r m r ω d r exp ξ r ω n r t sin ω d r t θ r where φ i r is the i th component of mode shape φ r m r ξ r ω n r and ω d r are the r th modal mass modal damping ratio modal frequency and damped modal frequency respectively g j r is a new constant multiplier θ r is a phase angle it shows that the cross correlation function is a sum of decaying sinusoids each decaying sinusoid has a damped natural frequency and damping ratio that is identical to that of a corresponding structural mode the irf between input k and output i can be written as 4 x i k t r 1 n φ i r φ k r m r ω d r exp ξ r ω n r t sin ω d r t it shows that the cross correlation function eq 3 is of the same form as the irf of the original system in eq 4 this similarity allows the use of time domain modal parameter identification schemes such as ce method polyreference complex exponential method and eigensystem realization algorithm 2 2 ce algorithm the basic principle of the ce method is that any free vibration response function including irf can be expressed as a series of complex exponential components and each of them contains the eigenvalue and eigenvector properties of one mode ewins 2000 for facilitating our later presentation a brief description of the essential of ce method is given as below the irf of an n dof system in eq 4 can also be expressed as 5 h t r 1 n a r e s r t a r e s r t where a r is the complex amplitude and the superscript denotes the complex conjugate operator s r is the system pole s r ω n r ξ r i ω d r and ω d r ω n r 1 ξ r 2 introducing ω n r n ω d r a r n a r for r 1 n we can rewrite eq 5 as 6 h t r 1 2 n a r e s r t if the original irf has been obtained in a discrete form it can be expressed as 7 h l h l δ t l 0 1 2 where δ t is the time interval from eqs 6 and 7 we have 8 h l r 1 2 n a r v r l where v r e s r δ t the above equation is a non linear function of the unknown modal parameters however once v r i e modal frequencies and damping ratios are known eq 8 becomes linear with respect to the remaining unknown modal parameters a r for this reason the numerical approach in many algorithms involves identifying first the modal frequencies and damping ratios which are global properties of the system and share the same values in different irfs regardless of the input and output locations because an n dof dynamic system with n simultaneous second order linear differential equations is mathematically equivalent to a linear differential equation of order 2 n the irf sequence h l must satisfy a linear difference equation 9 h 2 n n m 0 2 n 1 β m h m n 0 n 0 1 where β m m 0 2 n 1 are real constant coefficients inserting eq 8 into eq 9 leads to 10 m 0 2 n β m v r m 0 where β 2 n has been set equal to 1 and the roots of the polynomial are v 1 v 2 v 2 n thus the values of β m determine the values of v r and hence the system natural frequencies and damping ratios the original ce method is solving β m from the irf data based on the successive applications of eq 9 for 2 n times taking n 0 2 n 1 with eq 9 results in a full set of 2 n equations 11 h 0 h 1 h 2 h 2 n 1 h 1 h 2 h 3 h 2 n h 2 n 1 h 2 n h 2 n 1 h 4 n 2 β 0 β 1 β 2 n 1 h 2 n h 2 n 1 h 4 n 1 or 12 h β h where h r 2 n 2 n is a square matrix with hankel structured which is referred to as a matrix with constant positive sloping skew diagonals from eq 12 we can obtain the unknown polynomial coefficients 13 β h 1 h if more than 2 n equations have been included in eq 11 then a least squares solution of β for an over determined case could be obtained 2 3 slra measured signals are inevitably contaminated with noise when a data acquisition system is used for an experimental measurement a measured irf sequence h l of an n dof system which is contaminated by random noise can be written as 14 h l h l e l r 1 2 m a r v r l e l l 0 1 2 where h l and e l represent the true signal and noise respectively m is the number of modes embedded in the measured data since some modes of the system might not contribute to this particular irf m is possible less than n the number of dofs of the system h l can be sequentially filled to form a rectangular hankel matrix h m n r m n with m n 2 n as 15 h m n h 0 h 1 h n 1 h 1 h 2 h n h m 1 h m h s where s m n 2 theoretically the hankel matrix h corresponding to the noisy signal h l can be partitioned into two parts 16 h m n h m n e m n where h and e represent hankel structured matrices associated with the uncontaminated signal and noise parts respectively because the signal h l is contributed by m modes its corresponding hankel matrix h must be with a rank 2 m hu et al 2010 a noise removal method for estimating h l from h l is thus by estimating h based on h where the estimate of h denoted h ˆ must be a hankel matrix with rank 2 m while approximating h to its nearest matrix h ˆ an often used criterion is based on minimizing the frobenius norm l 2 norm of the difference between h and h ˆ denoted h h ˆ 2 chu et al 2003 in mathematical terms the noise reduction problem here is a slra problem which concerns the construction of the nearest approximation to a given matrix by a matrix with a specific rank and a specific linear structure chu et al 2003 in the current case the resulting matrix must maintain the same hankel structure and be lowered in rank as well the data matrix being hankel structured is equivalent to the existence of a linear time invariant system that fits the data and the rank constraint is related to a bound on the model order markovsky and huffel 2007 a simple engineering algorithm for solving the slra problem is the iterative cadzow s algorithm which has been also called the anti diagonal averaging method cadzow 1988 tufts and shah 1993 it can be summarized by the following steps 1 use the truncated singular value decomposition tsvd technique with rank 2 m estimated from the hankel data matrix h to obtain a low rank approximation matrix a ˆ note that the resulting matrix a ˆ will not be a hankel matrix 2 rebuild a hankel matrix h ˆ from a ˆ by replacing all elements of each anti subdiagonal by the arithmetic average of the elements along the anti subdiagonal note that the resulting hankel matrix h ˆ will not be rank 2 m in cadzow s algorithm the step 1 low rank approximation and step 2 anti subdiagonal averaging are alternated iteratively until a convergence test has been met it has been proven that such iterative usage always converges de moor 1994 2 4 procedure of next slra ce for operational modal analysis based on the above theoretical derivation of the three methods the procedure to combine next slra and ce to identify the operational modal parameters from measured ambient vibration data can be summarized into the following steps 1 acquire ambient vibration responses from the operating structure 2 calculate the auto and cross correlation functions from these time histories 3 solve the slra problem using the iterative cadzow s algorithm for noise reduction from the measured noisy correlation functions 4 apply ce modal identification scheme to estimate the modal parameters from the filtered correlation functions 3 numerical simulation in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed next slra ce operational modal estimation procedure before an application to real engineering a numerical simulation of a four story shear building was studied the four uniform mass and damping coefficients are taken to be 50 kg and 1000 ns m respectively and the first three stiffness coefficients are 2 0 107 n m and the fourth stiffness coefficient is 2 0 106 n m the 1st floor is at the fixed end and the 4th floor is at the free end the theoretical natural frequencies of the shear building are 26 457 53 135 127 05 and 181 68 hz respectively and the corresponding modal damping ratios are 1 324 1 817 1 238 and 1 476 respectively the shear building is excited under white noise on the 1st floor using lsim function in matlab mathworks r2014a the displacement responses of the shear building for 3 s are simulated with a sampling frequency of 500 hz there are 4 responses corresponding to 4 floors respectively see fig 1 the auto spectral density functions of the four output signals are shown in fig 2 it is seen that the auto spectral density function of the output m1 contains 4 clear peaks with relatively comparable magnitude however the auto spectral density function of the output m4 has its third and fourth peaks being very small relative to its first and second peaks next requires a reference channel to calculate the cross correlation function the modal identification may be different using the cross correlation function obtained from different reference channel the output m1 is firstly chosen to be the reference to perform next procedure in this section and the cross correlation function of the output m1 and m2 is shown in fig 3 the form of the cross correlation function is same as the free decay response the effectiveness of the proposed method for the cross correlation function m1 and m2 is validated below 3 1 record length parameters such as record length and sampling frequency affect the performance of next when calculating the cross correlation function caicedo 2011 in this section the modal estimation from different lengths of record is discussed the cpsd function in matlab is used to calculate the cross spectral density function mathworks r2014a in this function the welch s averaged modified periodogram method is applied the hamming window and number of overlapping to obtain 50 overlap are also used note that the number of points for the fft varies with the record length i e the next power of 2 greater than the length of record length fig 4 shows the cross spectral density function with four record lengths 1500 1000 500 and 100 time steps it is seen that the cross spectral density function calculated with the shorter record is smoother than that with the longer record it is difficult to estimate the modal parameters using peak picking method when the record length is long the ce method is applied to identify the modal frequencies and damping ratios from two record lengths 1000 and 100 time steps respectively during the modal analysis the stability diagram is plotted to eliminate spurious numerical poles modes when producing a stability diagram the poles corresponding to a certain model order are compared to the poles of a one order lower model if the modal frequency and the damping ratio differences are within preset limits the pole is labeled as a stable one adopting the preset limits with 1 difference for frequencies 5 for damping ratios and 2 for the modal vector among two consecutive model orders namely 17 f n f n 1 f n 1 18 ξ n ξ n 1 ξ n 5 and 19 1 ϕ n ϕ n 1 2 ϕ n ϕ n ϕ n 1 ϕ n 1 2 where f n ξ n and ϕ n denote an estimated frequency damping ratio and modal vector with model order n respectively and is the inner product operation throughout this study the same stability criteria are applied to all stability diagrams figs 5 and 6 are the stability diagrams based on the records of 1000 time steps and 100 time steps respectively the symbols o and in the stability diagrams represent non stable and stable frequency damping and modal vector respectively the stability diagram associated with the records of 100 time steps has more consistent frequency estimates near the 4 system frequencies than that of the records of 1000 time steps extending from higher order to lower order models although the signals are not contaminated with noise many poles are labeled unstable because they do not meet the preset stability standard listed in table 1 are the estimated modal frequencies and damping ratios from two record lengths respectively with the model order 4 it is found that the relative differences rd of the theoretical values and identified values from records of 100 time steps are all less than that from 1000 time steps this numerical observation basically agrees with caicedo s conclusion that relatively short records are preferred for relatively clean data caicedo 2011 it is also found that the record length has less influence on identification of frequencies than damping ratios 3 2 noise simulation and elimination because the cross spectral density function calculated with the shorter record is smoother than that with the longer record see fig 4 the shorter record 100 time steps is applied in this section to conduct noise simulation and elimination the noisy signal is generated by adding a gaussian white noise to the original clean output m1 and m2 the level of the additive white noise is quantified by a stated percentage defined as the ratio of the standard deviation of the white noise to that of the original output in order to unify the noise added into different outputs the noise level is defined as the ratio of standard deviation of the white noise to that of the output m1 after performing next procedure the cross correlation function of the noisy output m1 and m2 is obtained shown in fig 7 is a comparison of cross spectral density functions associated with original and 40 noise signals it is seen that the first and fourth modes are the weak modes which are easily influenced by noise an important aspect of the proposed noise reduction scheme is related to the chosen size of a hankel matrix produced from the noisy cross correlation function for implementing the slra for the hankel matrix a more convenient and efficient choice for the size of the hankel matrix is supposed to be square or nearly square hu et al 2010 in this case with 100 time steps the corresponding largest nearly square hankel matrix h m n is a 51 50 or 50 51 matrix noting that m n 1 is equal to 100 time step number of the cross correlation function without losing the generality we assume m n and h 51 50 is constructed carrying out the noise elimination is to conduct the cadzow s algorithm for hankel matrix h 51 50 in cadzow s method the first step is to apply singular value decomposition together with an observed noise threshold to determine the rank of the hankel matrix this rank in theory is equal to two times the number of modes embedded in the noisy cross correlation function the rank of a matrix could be easily estimated if the singular values have been ordered sequentially from the largest to the smallest for theoretical data without noise the singular values should go to zero when the rank of the matrix is exceeded for noisy data however due to random errors and small inconsistencies in the data the singular values cannot be zeros but very small numbers hu et al 2010 the ordered singular values associated with the hankel matrix h 51 50 for the noisy cross correlation function is plotted in fig 8 where each singular value was normalized by the first largest singular value it is found that the curve drop to an asymptote at the 8th singular value thus the rank should be taken equal to 8 that means all the 4 modes of the four story shear building are identifiable from the noisy cross correlation function although the accuracy of the estimation might be affected by noise the noise reduction is implemented by applying cadzow s algorithm based on the rank of hankel matrix h 51 50 being 8 the comparison of the filtered and the original cross spectral density functions are shown in fig 9 where the matching of the curves is good that means the visible level of noise has been successfully removed 3 3 modal parameters estimation after carrying out the noise elimination to obtain the filtered cross correlation function the ce method is then applied for estimating modal frequencies and damping ratios in order to show the performance of the proposed method the stability diagrams of the noisy and filtered cross correlation functions are both presented here see fig 10 it is seen that there are less stable poles estimated from the noisy cross correlation function accordingly it is difficult to accurately identify the modal parameters directly from the noisy cross correlation functions note that the stability diagram associated with the noisy cross correlation function has only 2 and unstable poles when the model order is 4 in contrast the stability diagram associated with the filtered cross correlation function has 4 consistent and stable poles from model order 4 to higher model order that indicate we can identify the modal parameters just using the model order 4 and need not repeat the identification process with model order increasing the identified modal frequencies from the filtered cross correlation function with model order 4 are 26 817 52 556 125 85 and 180 76 hz respectively and damping ratios are 5 239 2 794 1 132 and 0 744 respectively compared with the theoretical values the relative differences of the frequencies are 1 361 1 09 0 945 and 0 506 respectively and that of the damping ratios are 295 695 53 770 8 724 and 49 593 respectively the estimated frequencies are in accord with the true values all being with less than 2 relative error the relative differences of the damping ratios are relatively big especially for the first damping ratio however that is not bad recognizing that the relative error of the first damping ratio estimated from the original cross correlation function 100 time steps see table 1 is also big and the third damping ratio estimated from the filtered cross correlation function is closer to the true value than that from the original signal furthermore the first and fourth modes could not be identified if the noisy cross correlation function is used with the model order 4 see fig 10 a in brief the proposed procedure can improve the efficiency and accuracy of the modal parameters estimation 3 4 different reference channel reference channel choosing is important for performing next procedure and modal identification the output m4 is chosen to be the reference and the cross correlation function of the output m4 and m2 is calculated in this section note that the third and fourth peaks of the auto spectral density function of the output m4 are very small see fig 2 which means the contribution of the third and fourth modes is very small the simulation procedures are conducted below to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for the cross correlation function m4m2 1 the original cross correlation function with 100 time steps is applied and 40 noise signal is simulated fig 11 shows the cross spectral density functions associated with original and noisy signals it is found that the third and fourth peaks are embedded by noise in the noisy signal 2 the noise reduction is implemented by applying cadzow s algorithm based on the rank of hankel matrix being 4 see fig 12 the comparison of the filtered and the original cross spectral density functions is shown in fig 13 as expected the matching of the curves related to the first two modes is good that means the weak modes the third and fourth modes are regarded as noise and have been removed 3 modal estimation using the stability diagrams for the noisy and filtered cross correlation functions are presented see fig 14 it is seen that there are less stable poles estimated from model order 2 to 13 using the noisy cross correlation function if the model order is more than 13 some false modes will also tend to be stable that brings difficulties in modal identification using the noisy signal however the stability diagram associated with the filtered cross correlation function has 2 consistent and stable poles beginning with model order 2 the identified first two modal frequencies from the filtered cross correlation function with model order 2 are 26 441 and 53 517 hz respectively and the corresponding damping ratios are 2 507 and 2 263 respectively compared with the theoretical values the relative differences of the frequencies are 0 605 and 0 719 respectively and that of the damping ratios are 89 350 and 24 546 respectively results show that the different reference channel has effect on modal estimation in order to identify more modes the auto spectral density function of the reference channel is better to have more clear peaks an alternative method is to conduct the modal estimation several times using different reference channel each time and create identification diagram caicedo 2011 no matter which reference channel is chosen the proposed next slra ce procedure can improve the efficiency and accuracy of the modal identification 4 field test of a jacket type offshore platform in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in real engineering applications a four leg jacket type offshore platform in bohai bay china is studied in this section the structure is about 48 m high and the water depth at the site is about 19 5 m the four legs are cylindrical piles with a uniform outer diameter 1 34 m and a wall thickness 0 026 m an illustration of the steel frame is shown in fig 15 4 1 data acquirement in this test eight accelerometers were assembled at four legs of the structure at the elevation of 5 m with reference to the still water level respectively to measure the ambient vibration signals in the x and y directions for each position see fig 15 the excitation is random wave force which can be assumed as white noise input even though the excitation cannot be directly measured the acceleration responses for about 15 s with a sampling frequency of 200 hz were taken for analysis see fig 16 for x3 x1 and y3 fig 17 shows the auto spectral density functions of the three acquired signals as can be seen the auto spectral density function of x3 has more clear peaks with relatively high magnitude therefore x3 is chosen to be the output reference channel to perform next procedure according to the conclusion obtained in section 3 4 fig 18 shows the cross correlation functions of x3x1 and x3y3 respectively without loss of generality the performances of the proposed method for the two cross correlation functions are presented here the performances of the proposed method for other cross correlation functions calculated from different reference channels and different response channels are not provided in detail here due to length limitations 4 2 noise removal for a cross correlation function for about 15 s with 3001 time steps the corresponding largest square hankel matrix h 1501 1501 is constructed to determine the rank of each hankel matrix the normalized singular values are presented in fig 19 from which we conclude a reasonable noise threshold can be set at a rank equal to 8 and 4 for cross correlation functions x3x1 and x3y3 respectively which means there are 4 and 2 modes embedded in the two cross correlation functions respectively the noise reduction is carried out through the cadzow s method for the two hankel matrices respectively the comparison of the measured and the corresponding filtered cross spectral density functions curves are shown in fig 20 a and fig 20 b respectively the filtered signals become smoother and they have 4 and 2 peaks as expected respectively similar results can be obtained from other 6 correlation functions 4 3 modal analysis the ce method is then applied for estimating modal frequencies and damping ratios using the filtered correlation functions the stability diagrams are plotted based on the measured and filtered correlation functions x3x1 and x3y3 respectively see figs 21 and 22 it is seen that there are even no stable poles estimated from the two measured correlation functions as a result it is difficult to accurately identify the modal parameters directly from the measured correlation functions in contrast the stability diagram associated with the filtered correlation function x3x1 has 4 consistent and stable poles from lower to higher model order similarly the stability diagram associated with the filtered correlation function x3y3 has 2 stable poles even when the model order is 2 the identified modal frequencies and damping ratios from all the eight filtered correlation functions are listed in table 2 and table 3 respectively due to the noise and the difference of the response locations the weak modes may be regarded as noise modes and eliminated from the correlation functions we find that only the second modal frequencies and damping ratios can be estimated from all the 8 filtered correlation functions modal frequencies and damping ratios are considered to be global properties of the system and theoretically they should remain the same when they are estimated from different correlation functions although the true values of the modal parameters of the test jacket platform are not known we could still judge the performance of the proposed scheme based on examining the consistency among the modal parameters estimated from these different correlation functions the mean value and the coefficient of variation cov of the estimated frequencies and damping ratios from the eight filtered correlation functions are also listed in tables 2 and 3 respectively it is shown that the estimated modal frequencies and damping ratios are consistent among the filtered correlation functions the covs of the estimated modal frequencies are between 0 09 and 0 54 and the covs of the estimated damping ratios are between 2 73 and 13 39 that means the modal parameter estimations using the next slra ce method are highly consistent and reliable note that the frequencies of the first three modes as well as the fourth and fifth modes of the structure are closely spaced but the proposed method is successful in identifying them 4 4 shorter records the shorter records of cross correlation function x3x1 for 0 5 s with 1000 time steps are also analyzed in this section the hankel matrix h 501 500 is constructed and the reasonable noise threshold can be set at a rank equal to 6 see fig 23 which means there are 3 modes embedded in this segment of cross correlation function x3x1 after conducting the noise removal procedure the filtered signal becomes smoother and has 3 peaks as expected see fig 24 the ce method is then applied to estimate the modal frequencies and damping ratios the stability diagrams are plotted based on the measured and filtered correlation function x3x1 with 1000 time steps respectively see fig 25 it is still difficult to accurately identify the modal parameters from the measured correlation function in contrast the stability diagram associated with the filtered correlation function x3x1 has 3 consistent and stable poles the identified modal frequencies from the filtered correlation function are 1 995 3 290 and 3 557 hz respectively and damping ratios are 3 356 0 818 and 0 843 respectively compared with the longer records 3001 time steps the second mode cannot be estimated from the shorter records the relative differences of the frequencies identified from shorter and longer records are 0 25 0 12 and 0 11 respectively the relative differences of the damping ratios identified from shorter and longer records are 97 64 28 25 and 23 07 respectively that means the length of data has a higher effect on estimation of damping ratios than that of frequencies 5 conclusions the modal estimation procedure next slra ce is proposed to extract the operational modal frequencies and damping ratios of a structure the proposed procedure includes three steps 1 using next to get auto and cross correlation functions from noisy ambient vibration data 2 noise elimination from the noisy correlation functions by implementing cadzow s algorithm for the slra on the hankel matrix to obtain filtered correlation functions and 3 modal parameters identification from the filtered correlation functions using ce method a numerical simulation of a four story shear building is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed procedure in the next procedure selecting proper record length is important it is shown that the cross spectral density function calculated with the shorter record is smoother than that with the longer record the relative differences of the theoretical values and identified values from records of 100 time steps with model order 4 are all less than that from 1000 time steps with model order 4 it is also found that the record length has a higher effect on estimation of damping ratios than that of frequencies although the original signals are not contaminated with noise many poles are labeled unstable in the stability diagrams and the identified damping ratios have big errors when the noisy cross correlation function is directly used in modal analysis there are less stable poles in the stability diagram and accordingly it is difficult to accurately identify the modal parameters in contrast the stability diagram associated with the filtered cross correlation function has 4 consistent and stable poles from model order 4 to higher model order that means the proposed procedure can improve the efficiency and accuracy of the modal parameters estimation the reference channel choosing is another important parameter in next procedure which affects the performance of the modal estimation results indicate that the auto spectral density function of the reference channel is better to have more clear peaks in order to identify more modes furthermore the proposed procedure is applied to a field test of a jacket type offshore platform the performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by examining the consistency among the modal parameters estimated from these different correlation functions the covs of the estimated modal frequencies and damping ratios from the eight filtered correlation functions are all small that means the operational modal parameter estimations using the next slra ce method are highly consistent and reliable note that the platform has closely spaced frequencies but the proposed method is successful in identifying them acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the national key r d program of china china

23037,the effects of the unsteady change of the wind direction on the airwake over the helicopter platform of a canadian coast guard polar icebreaker were studied experimentally by application of particle image velocimetry on a scaled model of the icebreaker quantitative flow field data were obtained for several rates of change in the wind direction this study was conducted in a water channel that featured a simulated atmospheric boundary layer as inflow condition the rate of change in the incidence angle α varied in the range 0 25 α l u 0 25 where l and u are the characteristic length and velocity respectively in addition to the time averaged velocity fields the turbulence intensity was evaluated to investigate the unsteadiness of the flow increasing the rate of change of the incidence angle of the incoming flow resulted in an increase of the turbulent intensity for all considered nominal incidence angles of the inflow a notable exception to this trend was observed at α 60 where the direction of the inflow change had a pronounced effect on the structure of the flow over the helicopter deck thus negative values of α l u resulted in the wake of the superstructure not affecting the flow over the helicopter platform keywords ship airwake unsteady wind direction particle image velocimetry phase averaging turbulence metrics 1 introduction wind buffeting of the helicopter platforms of ships is an important issue for designers and operators of vessels and helicopters which promoted early studies on the ship airwake rhoades 1983 healey 1987 1992 johns and healey 2009 when a helicopter experiences unsteady aerodynamic loads in the range of frequencies of 0 2 hz f 2 hz the pilots are subjected to substantially higher workload relative to routine flying conditions due to the need to continually compensate for the effects of the wind czerwiec and polsky 2004 lee and zan 2004 therefore a number of studies to date focused on the air flow dynamics in the wake of the ships counihan 1975 polsky 2003 czerwiec and polsky 2004 syms 2004 2008 sezer uzol et al 2005 woodson and ghee 2005 findlay and ghee 2006 forrest and owen 2010 thornber et al 2010 snyder et al 2011 van muijden et al 2013 bardera mora 2014b dobrucali and ergin 2017 among these investigations field studies involving actual ships are particularly valuable because they provide data representative of the realistic scale of the flow phenomena snyder et al 2011 brownell et al 2012 bardera mora 2014b however the testing conditions during field experiments are not repeatable and are therefore difficult to generalize for design and operation guidelines of other ships operating under slightly different wind conditions the issues of repeatability of the conditions are commonly addressed by conducting model scale experiments in laboratory in order to establish a common basis for describing the vessel geometry and allow generalization of the results standard frigate shape sfs models have been developed for scaled experimental testing as well as validation of computational models wilkinson et al 1998 zan et al 1999 cheney and zan 1999 reddy et al 2000 zan 2001 toffoletto et al 2003 polsky 2003 yesilel and edis 2007 tinney and ukeiley 2009 bardera mora 2014a bardera mora and meseguer 2014 forrest et al 2016 this model features a simplified superstructure that retains the significant characteristic features of frigate class vessels while ignoring ship specific elements that would add variance to the experimental results several studies examined the effects of the inflow conditions on the resulting airwake of a ship it has been shown by polsky 2003 forrest and owen 2010 and rahimpour and oshkai 2016 among others that uniform inflow leads to significant differences in the spatial structure of the wake as well as in the peak levels of the turbulent intensity compared to the case of a simulated atmospheric boundary layer abl as the inflow condition in addition to examining the interaction of wind and superstructure and the resulted airwake several studies investigated the unsteady forces and moments exerted on a helicopter approaching the vessel and operating in the wake kääriä et al 2012 2013 it was found that in addition to the modification of aerodynamic design of superstructure the incidence angle of the incoming flow could significantly influence the unsteady loading on the helicopter in particular it was observed that pilots would experience greater workload levels through the lateral translation phase of the helicopter while the previous investigations significantly contributed to the understanding of the fluid mechanics of ship airwakes several issues remain unresolved in particular to the best of our knowledge none of the prior studies considered the effects of transient changes of the inflow direction on the wake of the superstructure the transient changes in the inflow can occur both naturally and due to maneuvering of the vessel while the vessel operation can be controlled natural wind fluctuations in the azimuthal direction can interfere with helicopter operation in the present study we considered the effects of the transient changes of the inflow direction by rotating the scaled model of the ship with respect to the oncoming flow for several incidence angles both the rate of rotation and the direction of rotation were varied and the resulting wake was analyzed the considered rates of change of the inflow direction corresponded to full scale azimuthal velocities up to 105 5 deg hr this range of velocities is representative of temporal changes in wind direction which is reported to fluctuate from 1 6 deg hr van doorn et al 2000 to approximately 100 deg hr ezraty 1990 2 experimental system and techniques 2 1 inflow conditions the experiments were conducted in a flow visualization water tunnel that had a test section with 45 cm 45 cm cross section and 2 5 m length the 1 522 model of the canadian coast guard ccg polar icebreaker included aerodynamically relevant features of the full scale vessel the model was placed on a turntable which was rotated with respect to the oncoming flow using a computer controlled positioning system as shown in fig 1 the blockage ratio of the scaled model was evaluated at different angles of incidence and ranged between 1 and 5 5 and following west and apelt 1982 mcruer 1994 okajima et al 1997 asce 1996 and blocken et al 2013 the blockage effects were neglected at the entrance to the test section the flow passed over a series of vertical spires and surface roughness elements which resulted in a boundary layer profile with the time averaged and fluctuating velocity distributions corresponding to those of a typical atmospheric boundary layer counihan 1975 zhou and kareem 2002 the details of the flow conditioning system are provided in rahimpour and oshkai 2016 the desired boundary layer conditions were achieved 125 cm downstream of the entrance of the test section the distribution of streamwise velocity component and turbulence intensity in the simulated abl are shown in comparison to the size of the scaled model of the ship in fig 2 in fig 2 a the velocity distribution is compared with a power law velocity profile associate with open sea conditions counihan 1975 1 u u δ z δ 0 13 here z is the vertical coordinate originating at the wall of the water tunnel δ is the boundary layer thickness u δ is the horizontal velocity component at the edge of the boundary layer and h 45 cm is the height of the test section furthermore in fig 2 b the streamwise turbulence intensity i u distribution is compared with a modified profile zhou and kareem 2002 which could be written as 2 i u i u δ z δ 0 13 where i u δ is the streamwise turbulence intensity at edge of boundary layer in the present study following rahimpour and oshkai 2016 the characteristic flow velocity u corresponds to the freestream velocity value at the entrance of the test section of the water tunnel moreover the characteristic length l is the beam of the ship in our earlier work rahimpour and oshkai 2016 we concluded that the flow patterns in the wake of the superstructure were characterized by massively separated flow regions and were independent of the reynolds number r e u l v where v is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid in the present investigation the inflow velocity condition resulted in the reynolds number of re 61 000 which is shown to be sufficiently large to ensure the fluid dynamic similarity between the scaled model and the full scale vessel rahimpour and oshkai 2016 2 2 scaled model the schematics of the scaled model are showed in fig 3 the inset schematic of fig 3 d also shows an arbitrary incidence angle of the inflow α here we define the angle of incidence as the angle between the inflow velocity vector and the centerline of the scaled model furthermore in the present study the rate of change in the inflow direction with respect the ccg icebreaker α is represented by the rotation of the scaled model hence the clockwise and counter clockwise rotation of the scaled model in the laboratory reference frame corresponded to the positive and the negative rates of change in the inflow direction respectively for an arbitrary incidence angle α fig 3 d shows the inflow velocity the coordinate system as well as α 2 3 quantitative flow imaging and phase averaging in the present study the global instantaneous velocity fields were obtained in several vertical data acquisition planes using high speed particle image velocimetry piv the piv system included a nd ylf dual diode pulsed laser with the power output of 25 mj pulse using a series of optical lenses the laser beam was transformed into a planar light sheet which had the thickness of 1 5 mm at the location of piv field of view fig 1 the flow in the water channel was seeded with the tracer particles silver coated hollow spheres with the average diameter of 13 μm and the density of 1 6 g cc the generated laser sheet illuminated the tracer particles which were then photographed using a digital camera with a complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos sensor that contained 1024 1024 pixels the camera was equipped with a lens with a focal length of 60 mm and a numerical aperture of f 2 8 the process of laser pulsing and image capture was synchronized using a computer equipped with a software for controlling the data acquisition lavision davis 7 2 the instantaneous velocity fields were then obtained by processing the piv images which included cross correlating the patterns of tracer particles in consecutive images using lavision davis 8 2 software rahimpour and oshkai 2016 raffel et al 2007 the multi pass algorithm involved interrogation windows with the initial size of 64 64 pixels which were progressively refined to the final size of 16 16 pixels with 50 overlap between the adjacent windows in both vertical and horizontal directions ultimately in the present study the acquired piv data had the resolution of 0 604 vector mm which corresponded to 30 data points per characteristic length l the piv system is shown in fig 1 which also shows a piv data acquisition coordinate system xpiv ypiv zpiv located at the center of the helicopter platform the piv coordinate system was fixed in the laboratory frame and did not rotate with the scaled model for different rates of change in the incidence angle the obtained velocity fields were phase averaged for incidence angles of 0 α 330 with the increment of 30 the model of the ship was continuously rotated in the uniform inflow instantaneous velocity fields acquired at a specific orientation phase of the ship were ensemble averaged to calculate the phase averaged flow representations for each considered incidence angle phase a minimum of 200 image pairs were acquired in the current investigation following benedict and gould 1996 the uncertainty associated with the sampling of a random process was evaluated the maximum uncertainty for the phase averaged velocity field and the associated turbulence intensity were less than 3 and 6 respectively hence the statistical convergence of the phase averaged parameters was verified 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of the rate of change of the incidence angle quantitative time averaged flow patterns above the helicopter platform were acquired for the range of the inflow incidence angles 0 α 330 at the interval of δα 30 the lowest turbulence levels were found at α 180 this observation is expected as the helicopter platform was directly exposed to the oncoming flow at that incidence angle and the influence of the superstructure was minimal this observation is in agreement with the results of rahimpour and oshkai 2016 where the lowest turbulence intensity was observed at α 180 the highest values of the turbulent intensity above the helicopter platform were observed at the inflow incidence angles α 0 and α 60 for which the flow patterns are shown in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively different rates of change of the inflow direction corresponding to clockwise and counter clockwise rotation of the scaled model with respect to the centerline of the ship when viewed from the top were considered and compared to the cases presented herein at the inflow incidence angle α 0 the direction on the changing angle of incidence of the incoming flow did not have a significant effect on the time averaged flow structure over the helicopter platform so only the data corresponding to the positive rate of change in the inflow i e clockwise rotation of the scaled model is presented herein on the other hand different rates of change of the incident flow direction had a pronounced effect on the wake of the superstructure fig 4 shows patterns of the non dimensionalized time averaged out of plane vorticity ω y l u and time averaged streamlines at α 0 corresponding to four different dimensionless rates of change of the inflow incidence angle α l u the mean inflow direction in these plots and throughout the paper is from right to left unless indicated otherwise the reference case of α l u 0 shown in fig 4 a which corresponded to the constant incidence angle resulted in the airwake structure that was characterized by three recirculation zones corresponding to flow separation from the top of the superstructure the edge of the superstructure immediately upstream of the helicopter platform and the downstream edge of the helicopter platform these recirculation regions are labeled a b and c respectively in fig 4 a these flow separation zones correspond to elevated levels of the out of plane vorticity in the shear layers that formed downstream of the points of flow separation the peak vorticity was observed in the upper shear layer immediately downstream of the top of the superstructure at z l 0 7 the upper shear layer was inclined downward as the flow was deflected towards the lower pressure wake downstream of the superstructure this flows direction is indicated by the pattern of time averaged streamlines which were inclined downward the vortices a b and c were relatively small scale and they were confined to the immediate vicinity of the flow separation points the shear layer corresponding to vortex b reattached to the helicopter platform at x l 0 35 in the case when the inflow direction was changing with the rate of α l u 0 083 shown in fig 4 b the flow structure was qualitatively similar to the case of α l u 0 the flow separated from the top of the superstructure was still deflected downward and the vortices a b and c were still small scale and confined to the vicinity of the separation points however the vorticity pattern shows higher levels of negative vorticity distributed throughout the wake compared to the reference case of α l u 0 this increased unsteadiness of the wake is expected because of the added transient change in the inflow also in the case of the changing inflow the separated flow region extended over the entire helicopter platform this change in the flow pattern occurred because the side edge of the helicopter platform was exposed to the oncoming flow as the inflow was undergoing the change in direction the increase of the rate of change of the inflow direction to α l u 0 167 resulted in a significant change in the flow structure as shown in fig 4 c vortex a was no longer visible in the vicinity of the top downstream corner of the superstructure the wake was dominated by a large scale flow recirculation zone b located over the helicopter platform the streamline pattern shown in fig 4 c shows that the flow which separated from the superstructure at z l 0 40 did not reattach to the helicopter platform instead the flow reattached to the vertical surface downstream of the platform this massive flow recirculation zone resulted in the local flow in the negative x direction in the immediate vicinity of the surface of the helicopter platform the presence of the massive flow recirculation zone b also resulted in an upward injection of the fluid into the freestream downstream of the separation point x l 0 35 which caused an upward deflection of the flow that separated from the top of the superstructure moreover the peak positive vorticity was located farther upstream at x l 0 75 and directly over the top of the superstructure as the rate of change of the inflow direction increased to α l u 0 25 the strength of the vortex b increased as indicated by the higher levels of positive out of plane vorticity distributed over the helicopter platform in fig 4 d the recirculation zone c located immediately downstream of the helicopter platform also increased both in the spatial extent and in the levels of the associated positive vorticity vortex a was not visible but the shear layer that separated from the top of the superstructure exhibited higher levels of vorticity which extended farther downstream compared to the case of α l u 0 167 fig 5 shows patterns of the non dimensionalized time averaged out of plane vorticity ω y l u and the time averaged streamlines at the inflow incidence angle α 60 corresponding to different dimensionless rates of change of the inflow incidence angle α l u in addition to the reference case of α l u 0 three different rates of change were considered in both clockwise and counter clockwise directions α l u 0 083 α l u 0 167 and α l u 0 25 the sequence of the plots in fig 5 a 5 d illustrates the effect of the increased rate of change of the inflow direction from α l u 0 to α l u 0 25 when the ship rotated in the clockwise direction relative to the inflow when viewed from above the flow patterns corresponding to α l u 0 083 were substantially similar to those corresponding to α l u 0 083 therefore only the latter case is presented herein in contrast for the higher rates of change α l u 0 167 and α l u 0 25 the direction of change had a pronounced effect on the flow structure above the helicopter platform in particular comparison of the vorticity plots of fig 5 c α l u 0 167 and fig 5 e α l u 0 167 reveals that in the former case corresponding to the clockwise rotation of the ship the elevated levels of vorticity were observed over larger area in y 0 plane moreover two distinct concentrations of positive vorticity were located immediately above the helicopter platform in the case of the counter clockwise ship rotation shown in fig 5 e a single positive vortex was confined to the right hand side of the flow field above the platform this trend was even more pronounced as the rate of change was increased to α l u 0 25 fig 5 d and e this pronounced difference in the flow patterns was due to the asymmetry of the ship superstructure encountered by the oncoming flow specifically as the ship was rotated clockwise with respect to the inflow coming nominally at α 60 the helicopter platform became progressively enclosed in the wake of the superstructure in contrast when the ship model was rotated in the counter clockwise direction negative α l u the helicopter platform was directly exposed to the oncoming flow and relatively unaffected by the superstructure in addition to considering the streamline patterns and the distributions of vorticity we calculated the turbulence intensity of the flow by dividing the standard deviation of the velocity components σ u and σ w respectively for the streamwise and the vertical components of velocity by the characteristic velocity i u σ u u i w σ w u the standard deviation of velocity was defined as follows 3 σ i 1 n u i u i 2 n 1 where n is the total number of acquired piv image pairs for each incidence angle i e phase increasing the magnitude of rates of change of the inflow direction α l u at α 0 resulted in an increase of the maximum values of the turbulent intensity over the helicopter platform as shown in fig 6 a both the clockwise and the counterclockwise change in the inflow direction produced an increase of the maximum turbulent intensity values for all values of α l u the maximum turbulent intensities associated with the x component of the velocity field i u max were higher than the corresponding values associated with the vertical z direction component of the velocity i w max this trend is expected as the contributions to i u max included the turbulence associated with the transient change of the inflow which was imposed in the horizontal plane moreover the horizontal rotation of the ship relative to the inflow at the nominal incidence angle of α 0 exposed the sides of the superstructure to oblique inflow which in turn resulted in vortex shedding from the sides of the superstructure these additional vortices in the wake contributed primarily to the velocity fluctuations in the horizontal plane parallel to the helicopter platform variation of the maximum values of the turbulent intensity as the inflow direction was dynamically changed from the nominal value of α 60 is shown in fig 6 b similar to the case of α 0 fig 6 a the maximum turbulent intensity values i u max and i w max exhibited a similar trend while the values of i u max were substantially higher than those of i w max for all considered rates of change of the inflow direction in contrast to the case of α 0 in the case of α 60 fig 6 b the values of the maximum turbulent intensity showed strong dependence on the direction of the ship rotation relative to the inflow this observation is consistent with the change in the flow patterns as the function of the rate of change of the inflow direction that is illustrated in fig 5 specifically due to the asymmetry of the ship s superstructure at negative values of α l u corresponding to clockwise rotation of the ship model the area above the helicopter platform was less affected by wake of the superstructure the plots of fig 7 show variation of the turbulent intensity at the center of the helicopter platform as the function of the rate of change of the inflow direction from α 0 at two elevations above the platform z l 0 25 and z l 0 40 the turbulent intensity i u increased for both directions of the ship rotation with respect to the inflow as shown in fig 7 a the turbulent fluctuations in the z direction i w initially decreased and then grew more rapidly at the ship model was rotated clockwise with respect to the inflow which corresponds to positive values of α l u in fig 7 b moreover the turbulent intensities at the higher elevation above the platform were generally higher than those at the lower elevations because the point z l 0 40 was located close to the centroid of the dominant vortical structure b shown in fig 4 when the inflow was approaching from α 60 the measured turbulent intensities depended on the direction of the ship rotation as shown in fig 8 the trends of the turbulent intensities at the center of the helicopter platform were qualitatively similar to those of the maximum turbulent intensities over the entire platform which are shown in fig 6 the exception to this trend was observed at the highest considered positive rate of rotation α l u 0 25 which resulted in the shift of the dominant recirculation cell away from the center of the helicopter platform the turbulent velocity fluctuations in the case of α 60 were primarily associated with the vorticity concentration d which is shown in fig 5 which was located immediately above the surface of the platform thus the measured turbulent intensities plotted in fig 8 decreased with the elevation above the platform 4 conclusions we applied piv in scaled model experiments to investigate the effects of transient changes in the inflow direction on the structure of the unsteady flow over the helicopter landing platform of a polar icebreaker the flow above the landing platform contained recirculating vortical cells that resulted from flow separation from the top and the sides of the superstructure the spatial extent of the separated flow regions and the associated vorticity levels increased as the rates of transient change in direction increased it should be noted that the flow in the wake of the superstructure was highly three dimensional as detailed in our earlier study rahimpour and oshkai 2016 therefore the present data acquired in a 2d plane needs to be interpreted with taking the 3d effects into account in general increasing the rate of change of the inflow direction resulted in an increase of the turbulent intensity however as the flow over the helicopter landing platform was dominated by the wake of the asymmetric superstructure the effect depended on the nominal direction of the inflow in particular when the inflow was coming from α 60 clockwise rotation of the ship model with respect to the inflow exposed the helicopter platform to increased turbulent velocity fluctuations while counterclockwise rotation diminished the flow unsteadiness over the helicopter platform acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge support of vard group and the natural

23037,the effects of the unsteady change of the wind direction on the airwake over the helicopter platform of a canadian coast guard polar icebreaker were studied experimentally by application of particle image velocimetry on a scaled model of the icebreaker quantitative flow field data were obtained for several rates of change in the wind direction this study was conducted in a water channel that featured a simulated atmospheric boundary layer as inflow condition the rate of change in the incidence angle α varied in the range 0 25 α l u 0 25 where l and u are the characteristic length and velocity respectively in addition to the time averaged velocity fields the turbulence intensity was evaluated to investigate the unsteadiness of the flow increasing the rate of change of the incidence angle of the incoming flow resulted in an increase of the turbulent intensity for all considered nominal incidence angles of the inflow a notable exception to this trend was observed at α 60 where the direction of the inflow change had a pronounced effect on the structure of the flow over the helicopter deck thus negative values of α l u resulted in the wake of the superstructure not affecting the flow over the helicopter platform keywords ship airwake unsteady wind direction particle image velocimetry phase averaging turbulence metrics 1 introduction wind buffeting of the helicopter platforms of ships is an important issue for designers and operators of vessels and helicopters which promoted early studies on the ship airwake rhoades 1983 healey 1987 1992 johns and healey 2009 when a helicopter experiences unsteady aerodynamic loads in the range of frequencies of 0 2 hz f 2 hz the pilots are subjected to substantially higher workload relative to routine flying conditions due to the need to continually compensate for the effects of the wind czerwiec and polsky 2004 lee and zan 2004 therefore a number of studies to date focused on the air flow dynamics in the wake of the ships counihan 1975 polsky 2003 czerwiec and polsky 2004 syms 2004 2008 sezer uzol et al 2005 woodson and ghee 2005 findlay and ghee 2006 forrest and owen 2010 thornber et al 2010 snyder et al 2011 van muijden et al 2013 bardera mora 2014b dobrucali and ergin 2017 among these investigations field studies involving actual ships are particularly valuable because they provide data representative of the realistic scale of the flow phenomena snyder et al 2011 brownell et al 2012 bardera mora 2014b however the testing conditions during field experiments are not repeatable and are therefore difficult to generalize for design and operation guidelines of other ships operating under slightly different wind conditions the issues of repeatability of the conditions are commonly addressed by conducting model scale experiments in laboratory in order to establish a common basis for describing the vessel geometry and allow generalization of the results standard frigate shape sfs models have been developed for scaled experimental testing as well as validation of computational models wilkinson et al 1998 zan et al 1999 cheney and zan 1999 reddy et al 2000 zan 2001 toffoletto et al 2003 polsky 2003 yesilel and edis 2007 tinney and ukeiley 2009 bardera mora 2014a bardera mora and meseguer 2014 forrest et al 2016 this model features a simplified superstructure that retains the significant characteristic features of frigate class vessels while ignoring ship specific elements that would add variance to the experimental results several studies examined the effects of the inflow conditions on the resulting airwake of a ship it has been shown by polsky 2003 forrest and owen 2010 and rahimpour and oshkai 2016 among others that uniform inflow leads to significant differences in the spatial structure of the wake as well as in the peak levels of the turbulent intensity compared to the case of a simulated atmospheric boundary layer abl as the inflow condition in addition to examining the interaction of wind and superstructure and the resulted airwake several studies investigated the unsteady forces and moments exerted on a helicopter approaching the vessel and operating in the wake kääriä et al 2012 2013 it was found that in addition to the modification of aerodynamic design of superstructure the incidence angle of the incoming flow could significantly influence the unsteady loading on the helicopter in particular it was observed that pilots would experience greater workload levels through the lateral translation phase of the helicopter while the previous investigations significantly contributed to the understanding of the fluid mechanics of ship airwakes several issues remain unresolved in particular to the best of our knowledge none of the prior studies considered the effects of transient changes of the inflow direction on the wake of the superstructure the transient changes in the inflow can occur both naturally and due to maneuvering of the vessel while the vessel operation can be controlled natural wind fluctuations in the azimuthal direction can interfere with helicopter operation in the present study we considered the effects of the transient changes of the inflow direction by rotating the scaled model of the ship with respect to the oncoming flow for several incidence angles both the rate of rotation and the direction of rotation were varied and the resulting wake was analyzed the considered rates of change of the inflow direction corresponded to full scale azimuthal velocities up to 105 5 deg hr this range of velocities is representative of temporal changes in wind direction which is reported to fluctuate from 1 6 deg hr van doorn et al 2000 to approximately 100 deg hr ezraty 1990 2 experimental system and techniques 2 1 inflow conditions the experiments were conducted in a flow visualization water tunnel that had a test section with 45 cm 45 cm cross section and 2 5 m length the 1 522 model of the canadian coast guard ccg polar icebreaker included aerodynamically relevant features of the full scale vessel the model was placed on a turntable which was rotated with respect to the oncoming flow using a computer controlled positioning system as shown in fig 1 the blockage ratio of the scaled model was evaluated at different angles of incidence and ranged between 1 and 5 5 and following west and apelt 1982 mcruer 1994 okajima et al 1997 asce 1996 and blocken et al 2013 the blockage effects were neglected at the entrance to the test section the flow passed over a series of vertical spires and surface roughness elements which resulted in a boundary layer profile with the time averaged and fluctuating velocity distributions corresponding to those of a typical atmospheric boundary layer counihan 1975 zhou and kareem 2002 the details of the flow conditioning system are provided in rahimpour and oshkai 2016 the desired boundary layer conditions were achieved 125 cm downstream of the entrance of the test section the distribution of streamwise velocity component and turbulence intensity in the simulated abl are shown in comparison to the size of the scaled model of the ship in fig 2 in fig 2 a the velocity distribution is compared with a power law velocity profile associate with open sea conditions counihan 1975 1 u u δ z δ 0 13 here z is the vertical coordinate originating at the wall of the water tunnel δ is the boundary layer thickness u δ is the horizontal velocity component at the edge of the boundary layer and h 45 cm is the height of the test section furthermore in fig 2 b the streamwise turbulence intensity i u distribution is compared with a modified profile zhou and kareem 2002 which could be written as 2 i u i u δ z δ 0 13 where i u δ is the streamwise turbulence intensity at edge of boundary layer in the present study following rahimpour and oshkai 2016 the characteristic flow velocity u corresponds to the freestream velocity value at the entrance of the test section of the water tunnel moreover the characteristic length l is the beam of the ship in our earlier work rahimpour and oshkai 2016 we concluded that the flow patterns in the wake of the superstructure were characterized by massively separated flow regions and were independent of the reynolds number r e u l v where v is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid in the present investigation the inflow velocity condition resulted in the reynolds number of re 61 000 which is shown to be sufficiently large to ensure the fluid dynamic similarity between the scaled model and the full scale vessel rahimpour and oshkai 2016 2 2 scaled model the schematics of the scaled model are showed in fig 3 the inset schematic of fig 3 d also shows an arbitrary incidence angle of the inflow α here we define the angle of incidence as the angle between the inflow velocity vector and the centerline of the scaled model furthermore in the present study the rate of change in the inflow direction with respect the ccg icebreaker α is represented by the rotation of the scaled model hence the clockwise and counter clockwise rotation of the scaled model in the laboratory reference frame corresponded to the positive and the negative rates of change in the inflow direction respectively for an arbitrary incidence angle α fig 3 d shows the inflow velocity the coordinate system as well as α 2 3 quantitative flow imaging and phase averaging in the present study the global instantaneous velocity fields were obtained in several vertical data acquisition planes using high speed particle image velocimetry piv the piv system included a nd ylf dual diode pulsed laser with the power output of 25 mj pulse using a series of optical lenses the laser beam was transformed into a planar light sheet which had the thickness of 1 5 mm at the location of piv field of view fig 1 the flow in the water channel was seeded with the tracer particles silver coated hollow spheres with the average diameter of 13 μm and the density of 1 6 g cc the generated laser sheet illuminated the tracer particles which were then photographed using a digital camera with a complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos sensor that contained 1024 1024 pixels the camera was equipped with a lens with a focal length of 60 mm and a numerical aperture of f 2 8 the process of laser pulsing and image capture was synchronized using a computer equipped with a software for controlling the data acquisition lavision davis 7 2 the instantaneous velocity fields were then obtained by processing the piv images which included cross correlating the patterns of tracer particles in consecutive images using lavision davis 8 2 software rahimpour and oshkai 2016 raffel et al 2007 the multi pass algorithm involved interrogation windows with the initial size of 64 64 pixels which were progressively refined to the final size of 16 16 pixels with 50 overlap between the adjacent windows in both vertical and horizontal directions ultimately in the present study the acquired piv data had the resolution of 0 604 vector mm which corresponded to 30 data points per characteristic length l the piv system is shown in fig 1 which also shows a piv data acquisition coordinate system xpiv ypiv zpiv located at the center of the helicopter platform the piv coordinate system was fixed in the laboratory frame and did not rotate with the scaled model for different rates of change in the incidence angle the obtained velocity fields were phase averaged for incidence angles of 0 α 330 with the increment of 30 the model of the ship was continuously rotated in the uniform inflow instantaneous velocity fields acquired at a specific orientation phase of the ship were ensemble averaged to calculate the phase averaged flow representations for each considered incidence angle phase a minimum of 200 image pairs were acquired in the current investigation following benedict and gould 1996 the uncertainty associated with the sampling of a random process was evaluated the maximum uncertainty for the phase averaged velocity field and the associated turbulence intensity were less than 3 and 6 respectively hence the statistical convergence of the phase averaged parameters was verified 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of the rate of change of the incidence angle quantitative time averaged flow patterns above the helicopter platform were acquired for the range of the inflow incidence angles 0 α 330 at the interval of δα 30 the lowest turbulence levels were found at α 180 this observation is expected as the helicopter platform was directly exposed to the oncoming flow at that incidence angle and the influence of the superstructure was minimal this observation is in agreement with the results of rahimpour and oshkai 2016 where the lowest turbulence intensity was observed at α 180 the highest values of the turbulent intensity above the helicopter platform were observed at the inflow incidence angles α 0 and α 60 for which the flow patterns are shown in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively different rates of change of the inflow direction corresponding to clockwise and counter clockwise rotation of the scaled model with respect to the centerline of the ship when viewed from the top were considered and compared to the cases presented herein at the inflow incidence angle α 0 the direction on the changing angle of incidence of the incoming flow did not have a significant effect on the time averaged flow structure over the helicopter platform so only the data corresponding to the positive rate of change in the inflow i e clockwise rotation of the scaled model is presented herein on the other hand different rates of change of the incident flow direction had a pronounced effect on the wake of the superstructure fig 4 shows patterns of the non dimensionalized time averaged out of plane vorticity ω y l u and time averaged streamlines at α 0 corresponding to four different dimensionless rates of change of the inflow incidence angle α l u the mean inflow direction in these plots and throughout the paper is from right to left unless indicated otherwise the reference case of α l u 0 shown in fig 4 a which corresponded to the constant incidence angle resulted in the airwake structure that was characterized by three recirculation zones corresponding to flow separation from the top of the superstructure the edge of the superstructure immediately upstream of the helicopter platform and the downstream edge of the helicopter platform these recirculation regions are labeled a b and c respectively in fig 4 a these flow separation zones correspond to elevated levels of the out of plane vorticity in the shear layers that formed downstream of the points of flow separation the peak vorticity was observed in the upper shear layer immediately downstream of the top of the superstructure at z l 0 7 the upper shear layer was inclined downward as the flow was deflected towards the lower pressure wake downstream of the superstructure this flows direction is indicated by the pattern of time averaged streamlines which were inclined downward the vortices a b and c were relatively small scale and they were confined to the immediate vicinity of the flow separation points the shear layer corresponding to vortex b reattached to the helicopter platform at x l 0 35 in the case when the inflow direction was changing with the rate of α l u 0 083 shown in fig 4 b the flow structure was qualitatively similar to the case of α l u 0 the flow separated from the top of the superstructure was still deflected downward and the vortices a b and c were still small scale and confined to the vicinity of the separation points however the vorticity pattern shows higher levels of negative vorticity distributed throughout the wake compared to the reference case of α l u 0 this increased unsteadiness of the wake is expected because of the added transient change in the inflow also in the case of the changing inflow the separated flow region extended over the entire helicopter platform this change in the flow pattern occurred because the side edge of the helicopter platform was exposed to the oncoming flow as the inflow was undergoing the change in direction the increase of the rate of change of the inflow direction to α l u 0 167 resulted in a significant change in the flow structure as shown in fig 4 c vortex a was no longer visible in the vicinity of the top downstream corner of the superstructure the wake was dominated by a large scale flow recirculation zone b located over the helicopter platform the streamline pattern shown in fig 4 c shows that the flow which separated from the superstructure at z l 0 40 did not reattach to the helicopter platform instead the flow reattached to the vertical surface downstream of the platform this massive flow recirculation zone resulted in the local flow in the negative x direction in the

spatial extent and in the levels of the associated positive vorticity vortex a was not visible but the shear layer that separated from the top of the superstructure exhibited higher levels of vorticity which extended farther downstream compared to the case of α l u 0 167 fig 5 shows patterns of the non dimensionalized time averaged out of plane vorticity ω y l u and the time averaged streamlines at the inflow incidence angle α 60 corresponding to different dimensionless rates of change of the inflow incidence angle α l u in addition to the reference case of α l u 0 three different rates of change were considered in both clockwise and counter clockwise directions α l u 0 083 α l u 0 167 and α l u 0 25 the sequence of the plots in fig 5 a 5 d illustrates the effect of the increased rate of change of the inflow direction from α l u 0 to α l u 0 25 when the ship rotated in the clockwise direction relative to the inflow when viewed from above the flow patterns corresponding to α l u 0 083 were substantially similar to those corresponding to α l u 0 083 therefore only the latter case is presented herein in contrast for the higher rates of change α l u 0 167 and α l u 0 25 the direction of change had a pronounced effect on the flow structure above the helicopter platform in particular comparison of the vorticity plots of fig 5 c α l u 0 167 and fig 5 e α l u 0 167 reveals that in the former case corresponding to the clockwise rotation of the ship the elevated levels of vorticity were observed over larger area in y 0 plane moreover two distinct

the wave energy or alternatively wave action balance equation komen et al 1994 the wam and ww3 models have been developed particularly to simulate wave generation and evolution at ocean scales because of their explicit time integration they are less suited for smaller coastal scales the swan model is especially suited for coastal scales because of its implicit way of solving the action balance equation but it is also able to run on large scales reguero et al 2012 atan et al 2017 for that reason we chose the swan model for the transformation of wave conditions from regional to local scales information from global wave hindcasts is generally very accurate in the open ocean however a finer resolution is required in coastal areas to ensure a more precise representation of the coastline and the bathymetry over continental shelf areas and thus it provides a better calculation of shallow water processes like bottom friction and depth induced breaking in addition it allows for a more accurate definition of the fetch length perez et al 2017 with this in mind this research focuses on the development of a downscaling methodology using nesting from regional to local scales in the interest of area previous studies for the black sea cherneva et al 2008 akpınar et al 2012 2016 akpınar and kömürcü 2013 aydoğan et al 2013 arkhipkin et al 2014 rusu et al 2014a van vledder and akpınar 2015 divinsky and kosyan 2017 focused mostly on the entire black sea for different purposes whereas a limited number of studies focused on western or north western shelf region of the black sea using a grid nesting procedure examples are studies for the prediction of extreme wave conditions rusu et al 2006 2014b wave energy assessment rusu 2009 influence of spatial wind resolution rusu

2012 and storm waves myslenkov et al 2016 as seen from here some of these studies were conducted for different purposes and covering the whole black sea use a regular model grid structure while aydoğan et al 2013 and myslenkov et al 2016 have used an unstructured grid system in the remaining studies rusu et al 2006 rusu 2009 2010 valchev et al 2010 2012 trifonova et al 2012 a higher resolution model was developed for the coastal areas of romania and bulgaria based on a telescoping nested grid system the primary aim of the present study is to develop calibrate and validate a high resolution nested wave prediction model focusing on the south western coasts of the black sea which are considered as hotspot areas for harvesting wave energy to our knowledge such detailed wave predictions have not been done before in this region in addition by performing a 31 year hindcast an accurate normal and extreme wave climate could be established in the hot spot areas from this point the paper is organized in six sections following the introduction section 2 presents the application of the swan model to the black sea where the materials and methods used in this study are introduced and section 3 shows the development setup and calibration of the wave hindcast model with a telescoping nested grid system in section 4 the verification of the developed nested model system

recommendations in section 7 2 application of swan model to the black sea in this study the state of the art third generation numerical wave prediction model swan version 41 01ab booij et al 1999 is used to produce long term wave data the bathymetry data used is the general bathymetric charts of the ocean abbreviated as gebco gebco 2014 with the same resolution 30 s in latitude and longitude produced by the british oceanographic data center bodc this data is open for use in scientific studies and was downloaded from the bodc website for the wind input fields we used the recent atmospheric reanalysis product cfsr wind fields saha et al 2010 these were found to have presently the highest quality for wave modelling in the black sea van vledder and akpınar 2015 the u and v wind components at a height of 10 m for a long term period of 31 years 1979 2009 were obtained from the noaa website at a spatial resolution of 0 3125 in both directions and with a 1 h temporal resolution contrary to modelling studies in literature akpınar and kömürcü 2013 aydoğan et al 2013 which used a single domain including the entire black sea in this study multi nested grids are preferred to obtain a high resolution and accurate wave hindcasts in the areas of interest as shown in fig 1 the position of the measurement locations are also shown in fig 1 their locations water depths and distance to the coast are summarized in table 1 as can be seen in fig 1 the nested grid system consists of a coarse grid with a spatial resolution of about 0 06977 approximately 7 8 km in latitude and longitude including the entire black sea a finer grid with a spatial resolution of 0 02 about 2 2 km focusing on the western part of the black sea and within this fine grid and three sub grids with spatial resolutions of 0 004 0 006 approximately 0 4 0 7 km each focusing on an area around the measurement locations sinop sd1 filyos sd2 and karaburun sd3 each nested grid obtains its boundary conditions from its host grid in the form of 2d spectra a key element in the downscaling approach was to calibrate each nested grid separately regarding its physical and numerical settings this holds for example to the domain size computational resolutions the physical formulations and their adjustable coefficients for deep water source terms time step of non stationary calculation calibration of the coarse grid is performed based on the one year measurements 1996 at the hopa gelendzhik and sinop locations measurements from other years at these locations and the measurements at gloria karaburun and filyos are used in the model validation of the coarse grid domain wave measurements were collected from the three directional wave buoys at gelendzhik hopa and sinop within the nato tu waves project özhan and abdalla 1998 the first measurement location was located in deep water 85 m in front of the russian coast near gelendzhik the second and the third locations were off the turkish shore near hopa and close to sinop at depths of about 100 m the buoys are able to measure individual wave heights up to the highest encountered in the black sea of about 15 m with a resolution of 1 cm and periods between 1 6 s and 30 s çevik et al 2006 deployed an ultrasonic dl2 acoustic wave sensor near karaburun village the sampling interval observation time and continuous observation intervals used in the measurements of the waves observer were provided as 0 5 s 10 min and 2 h respectively unfortunately we could only get wave height information for this station another wave measurement campaign by the general directorate of railways ports and airports construction of the turkish ministry of transport dlh 1999 was carried out for a new port planned near the filyos stream located in the western black sea wave data was collected every 2 h with a sample length of 20 min and a sampling interval of 0 5 s i e a sampling frequency of 2 hz a long term measurement campaign has been performed at the gloria drilling platform which operates in the western sector of the black sea at a measurements at gloria have been obtained a 6 h resolution in water depth of about 50 m the more detailed information on the measurement locations characteristics of the measurements and statistical values of measured data can be found in our previous studies van vledder and akpınar 2015 akpınar et al 2014 2016 the swan model for the fine grid domain is calibrated using the one year measurements 2006 at gloria boundary conditions for this grid are based on the calibrated swan model for the coarse grid domain akpınar et al 2016 validation of the calibrated swan model for the fine grid domain is carried out using the gloria s measurements unused in the model calibration of the fine grid domain the innermost grid domains are calibrated individually using the measured data for 1996 at sinop 2004 at karaburun and 1996 at filyos the boundary conditions for each sub grid are obtained from the calibrated swan model for the fine grid domain ultimately a calibrated swan model for each grid was determined using these models the gebco bathymetry and the cfsr wind fields a 31 year long wind wave simulation was realized all integral parameters hm0 tm 10 and etc needed to determine the wave characteristics wave energy generation extreme waves storms and etc are collected at a temporal resolution of 2 h at all computational grid points for the three sub grid domains besides for selected points in each grid wave data are collected at a 10 min intervals in the sinop sd1 sub grid 30 min in the filyos sd2 sub grid and 20 min in the karaburun sd3 sub grid the swan model was run in the third generation and non stationary mode with different time steps and different spatial regular spherical resolutions for each grid as outlined in chapter 3 the directional wave variance density spectrum was discretized using 36 directional bins and 30 frequency bins logarithmically distributed between 0 04 hz and 1 0 hz the numerical scheme was the bsbt first order upwind backward in space backward in time scheme for calibrating our wave model we used different source term formulations for wind growth and whitecapping as discussed in chapter 3 all other source terms are kept equal in our wave model computations quadruplet interactions are estimated using the discrete interaction approximation dia by hasselmann et al 1985 using λ 0 25 and c nl4 3 107 the jonswap bottom friction formulation hasselmann et al 1973 is used with c fjon 0 038 m2s 3 following zijlema et al 2012 depth limited wave breaking is modelled according to the bore model of battjes and janssen 1978 using α 1 and γ 0 73 the triad wave wave interactions modelled using the lumped triad approximation lta of eldeberky 1996 3 calibration method the calibration of the nested grid system is done by determining the best physical setting for each grid separately using the available measurement data within each grid following moeini and etemad shahidi 2007 siadatmousavi et al 2011 akpınar and ponce de leon 2016 and akpınar et al 2016 we chose the whitecapping coefficient as the most effective parameter for model calibration this choice was confirmed by testing the effects of the other processes triads bottom friction and depth induced wave breaking and their tunable parameters on model performance based on these tests it was found that these shallow water processes did not affect our results at the buoy locations due to its complexity we did not consider the quadruplet source term in our calibration instead we applied it unchanged with its default setting in addition the numerical settings of each grid domain spatial resolutions frequency resolutions directional resolutions frequency ranges sensitivity to choice of wind fields etc were also individually tested for each grid domain these tests showed that only the choice of a certain time step leads to improved model performance lower error and higher correlation therefore we present only the results of test runs regarding the time step and whitecapping in the following sections since the swan model contains different formulations for wind input and whitecapping five different combinations of formulations describing these two physical processes are considered the calibration was done pragmatically by varying the coefficients of the whitecapping source terms around their default values error statistics for each test run were calculated based on collocated simulated and measured data the statistical error parameters are presented in appendix a the model setting with the lowest error and the highest correlation the best setting is considered as the calibration result the following combinations were considered komen et al 1994 komen et al 1994 komen et al 1994 janssen 1989 1991 janssen 1989 1991 janssen 1989 1991 janssen 1989 1991 komen et al 1994 yan 1987 van der westhuysen et al 2007 for wind input and whitecapping in the following these combinations are referred to respectively with the following abbreviations k k k j j j j k and y w it is noted that the komen and janssen wind input formulation are different the default settings in the swan model whitecapping formulations of janssen and komen differ in the choice of the coefficient cds1 and the delta parameter in practice however they also differ in the power of the parametric spectral tail being 4 for the janssen formulation and 5 for the komen formulation this will lead to different results in case the same wind input and whitecapping parameters are used details of these formulations can be found in above mentioned references but also the swan technical manual swan team 2016 for the default values of the whitecapping coefficient we used 2 36 10 5 for the komen formulation 4 5 for the janssen formulation and 0 5 for the westhuysen formulation after the calibration of the source terms we determined the optimal time step of the non stationary calculations for each grid by considering model performance in the comparison of measured and hindcasted data were ensured that all relevant wave parameters were based on the same frequency interval 0 04 1 hz 3 1 coarse grid domain the calibration of the coarse grid was done in our previous study akpınar et al 2016 where detailed information was given on the calibration results however we also give here some results to show the model performance of previous model a comparison of the si bias and rmse values of both wave parameters hm0 and tm02 at the three buoy locations of gelendzhik hopa and sinop is presented in the fig 2 a and b this kind of figure shows error measures for each test run such that the best performing combination can easily be identified as can be seen the lowest bias 0 01 m rmse 0 28 m mae 0 20 m and si 49 are achieved in the swan model with the komen formulation for the wind input and janssen formulation for whitecapping having a whitecapping coefficient cds of 1 5 this test run has also the nearest mean hm0 0 57 m to that of the measurements 0 58 m correlations in most of the test runs are between 0 83 and 0 85 in our previous study akpınar et al 2012 the sensitivity of the time step of non stationary computation was examined during test runs performed for steps of 6 h 3 h 1 h 30 min and 15 min and it was determined that a 30 min time step produced optimal results therefore in this study the time step for the coarse domain is chosen as 30 min ultimately the best model configuration for the coarse grid domain is found as follows komen et al 1994 janssen 1989 1991 formulations for wind input whitecapping processes with cds 1 5 and delta 1 0 where the time interval for non stationary computation is 30 min and other all physical processes are active in default mode 3 2 fine grid domain the calibration of the intermediate fine grid domain is done against the measurements from the gloria station boundary conditions for this nest are from the calibrated coarse grid model a comparison of the si bias and rmse values of all swan model test runs at gloria is presented in fig 3 based on the results presented here the best swan setting are the janssen formulae 1989 1991 for both wind input and whitecapping using cds 3 0 this model setting has the lowest error in comparison with the others in terms of si 39 and 32 for hm0 and tm02 respectively mae 0 37 m and 1 09 s for hm0 and tm02 respectively and rmse 0 53 m and 1 44 s for hm0 and tm02 respectively etc the optimal time interval for non stationary computation is found to be 20 min these results show that nested grid system causes an improvement about 14 for hm0 and 4 for tp for 2006 in wave hindcasts in comparison with those of the calibrated swan model including all the black sea in akpınar et al 2016 the percentage improvement was computed based on the scatter index values it can be expressed as a percentage and thus the improvement is determined as the percentage by taking the differences of the scatter values obtained 3 3 sub grid domains the performances of the five combinations described above are examined in the individual calibrations of each sub grid numbered sd1 sd2 and sd3 a comparison of the si bias and rmse values of all swan model test runs obtained for the three sub grid domains is presented in the fig 4 a and b according to the results of the calibration process the best swan model performances were obtaining using the komen formulation for wind and the janssen formulation for whitecapping at with cds 3 0 for sd1 cds 9 0 for sd2 and cds 2 0 for sd3 the effect of the time step on the model results is also investigated for all three sub grid domains model runs for all three sub grids were performed using time steps of 30 min 20 min 15 min 10 min and 5 min the results of the model runs in terms of wave parameter error statistics show that the most accurate results lowest error can be achieved by running the swan model with a time interval of 10 min in the sd1 sub grid a 30 min time interval in sd2 and a 20 min time interval in sd3 although reducing the time step generally leads to more accurate results we found different optimal time steps for each sub grid as we included the time step as a calibration parameter these results suggest that errors in physical settings are compensated by errors of opposite sign in the numerical settings an overview of the calibration for all grids is given in table 2 the results in this table show that the nested grid system causes an improvement about 1 for both hm0 and tp in wave hindcasts in comparison with those of the calibrated swan model for the entire black sea in akpınar et al 2016 besides the area where the filyos measuring station is located is physically different from the other sub grid areas at filyos station the waves suddenly enter a shallow water from very deep water which leads to a sudden increase in wave steepness affecting the dissipation behavior while in other regions the waves slowly enter from deep water to shallow water it is estimated that due to this effect a higher whitecapping coefficient is required to be used in the sub grid sd2 containing the filyos station it has been finally determined that whitecapping processes its coefficient and the computational time step are the most effective modelling choices to improve swan model performance at all domains of the nested grid system we note however that no statements can be made of the role of shallow water processes as our measurement location are located in deep water from a wave point of view 4 verification of wave hindcast model with a nested grid system following the calibration of the nested swan models a verification analysis in each grid domain is conducted against measured for a time period that is not used in the calibration to check whether any lasting improvement is achieved this was done by examining the performance of the calibrated model in each grid domain based on the statistical error indicators bias rmse si etc presented in appendix a 4 1 coarse grid domain the performance of the calibrated swan model for the coarse grid domain is determined using the measured hm0 and tm02 or tp data at gelendzhik and hopa and also at the locations filyos gloria and karaburun the data of 1995 and 1996 are used in the filyos location the 2006 2009 data for gloria the 2003 and 2004 data for karaburun 1997 1998 and the 2000 2003 data for gelendzhik and the 1997 1999 data for the hopa location the error statistics for the simulated hm0 and tm02 or tp data with the calibrated and the default setting swan models as compared against the measurements at these locations are presented in table 3 from this table it is observed that the calibrated swan model for the coarse grid domain has a poor performance only at the gloria location in the peak wave period prediction based on most error parameters except for the correlation coefficient while the calibrated model has better results for both wave parameters at all other locations this mismatch may be due to the different sets of locations used in the calibration and validation of swan model respectively in this coarse domain the calibration of the swan model is based on the measurement locations in the eastern black sea viz gelendzhik sinop and hopa whereas the validation of this domain is based on measurements obtained in the western part of the black sea at the gloria location therefore the model for the coarse grid domain is tuned especially for the eastern part of the black sea we speculate that the calibrated nested swan model will solve this problem and that the calibrated swan model with the nested grid system focusing on the western part of the black sea will have an improved performance this notion is discussed in the following parts of the present study a comparison of the coarse grid calibrated and default setting swan model results against the measurements is shown in the fig 5 a and b for all locations and for the wave parameters hm0 and tm02 or tp the color scheme in scatter diagrams represents the log10 of the number of entries in a square box of 0 2 m in figs 5a and 0 3 s in fig 5b normalized with the log10 of the maximum number of entries in a box in this way the clustering of data points is highlighted each figure contains two lines the red line is according to the regression model y cx and the line of perfect agreement is the dashed line the number of samples n and the names of the buoy locations are shown in the title and in the plot these graphs also show that the calibrated model which has only poor performance at the gloria location in comparison with the other locations is much more agreeable with the measurements than the default setting model this illustrates the added value of model calibration for separate grids 4 2 fine grid domain the verification of the calibrated model in this grid domain is performed using the measurements from 2007 to 2009 at station gloria which are not used in calibration the reason why the results are not verified in another location is that only one measurement location is available within this grid domain error statistics of the estimated hm0 and tp data with calibrated and default setting swan models against the measured data are presented in table 4 the results in this table show that for the intermediate grid improvements based on the calibrated in comparison with the default setting models results are found of about 11 for hm0 and 2 for tp for 2007 22 for hm0 for 2008 and 17 for hm0 for 2009 in comparison with those of the calibrated swan model including the entire black sea in akpınar et al 2016 improvements are found of 2 for both hm0 and tp for 2007 12 and 8 for hm0 for 2008 and 2009 respectively scatter plots for hm0 hindcasts from the calibrated and default setting swan models against the measurements at gloria are presented in fig 6 the color scheme is as in fig 5a and here a square box of 0 3 m is used in fig 6 from the above error statistics and scatter plots a significant improvement lower error and higher correlation is witnessed at the gloria location which had poor performance in the calibrated swan model developed for coarse grid domain this results confirm our expectation noted previously 4 3 sub grid domains the performances of the calibrated models for the three sub grid domains are examined using the 1995 measurements of filyos for sd2 and the 2003 measurements of the karaburun location for the sd3 sub grid no verification is done for sd1 sub grid since all existing data are already used in the calibration the error statistics of the simulated hm0 and tp data from the calibrated and default setting swan models against the measurements for the sd2 and sd3 sub grid domains are presented in table 5 scatter plots for hm0 and tp for both sub grid domains are also given in fig 7 a and b from these graphs and error statistics there has been significant improvements in the model calibrations in the sub grids but a significant improvement has not been achieved in karaburun sd3 sub grid domain for hm0 it is observed however that the wave estimates realized with the calibrated nested grid system attained significant improvements finally the results show that the calibration for each grid provides more accurate wave hindcast results compared to choosing one setting for whole domain the different physical and numerical settings also indicate that there is still no overall model setting that provides the best results in all domains 5 wave characteristics along the south western coasts of the black sea the calibrated nested grid swan models were run separately for all three sub grids and simulations for a period of 31 years 1979 2009 wind and wave parameters wind speed components significant wave height peak period tp energy period tm 10 average period tm02 average wave direction etc are accumulated with a time resolution of 2 h at all computational grid points for each sub grid the computational requirements of this wave climate reconstruction are as follows all the swan output data collected for the three sub grid domains requires about 3 tb storage space the calibrated swan model for the coarse and the fine grids need about 4 h and 40 h runtime for a 1 year simulation respectively the models are run over an 8 cores i7 processor at 3 4 ghz for the detailed grids a 1 year simulation takes about 140 h 90 h and 110 h for the sd1 sd2 and sd3 grids respectively based on the results of the 31 year simulation for all sub grids the following characteristics are presented annual seasonal and monthly average variations of significant wave height mean wave direction and wave energy period spatial variations of 99 and 95 probability of non exceedance of significant wave heights the significant wave height being greater than 0 5 m and 4 m and maximum values of significant wave heights during 31 years over the entire black sea in addition extreme waves with different recurrence intervals at two locations in each sub grid domain were determined and the results are compared with those presented in the wind and deep water wave atlas of özhan and abdalla 2002 which are nowadays still the main source used in the design of coastal structures in turkey 5 1 mean significant wave height hm0 and mean wave direction the spatial variations of long term averaged annual seasonal and monthly mean hm0 and mean wave direction which is a vectorial mean weighted with variance density kuik et al 1988 are firstly presented in figs 8 12 as can be seen from these figures the highest average significant wave height is approximately 1 m among all the three sub grids is inside the karaburun sd3 sub grid this includes the coast from şile istanbul to the coasts of bulgaria from hisarköy bartin coast to i̇nebolu coast in sd2 sub grid domain and the coastline between the capes of i̇nce burun and sinop in sd1 sub grid domain have also high mean significant wave heights of about 1 m fig 8 waves generally come from a north eastern direction in the karaburun and filyos domains and from northerly directions near sinop according to the spatial maps for the seasonal average significant wave height and mean wave direction represented in fig 9 winter is the season with the highest average significant wave heights followed by autumn summer and spring show very close values within the karaburun sd3 sub grid domain the average hm0 of 0 6 m is simulated in the western region of the domain during the spring season the average value decreases to 0 4 m on the eastern side during the summer season karaburun monitoring location is exposed to significant waves of about 0 8 m in height this value decreases towards the western and eastern sides around this location in the autumn and winter seasons waves at 0 8 m and 1 m height are formed on the western side and 0 4 m and 0 6 m height on the eastern side respectively waves of 0 6 m height form in spring within the filyos sd2 sub grid domain along a large part of the shoreline 0 4 m and below in summer and 0 8 m in winter in the autumn waves of 0 6 m in the west of the filyos monitoring location and 0 8 m in the east are observed from baba burnu cape to the coast of karasu in this domain the region is exposed to the lowest wave height in all seasons it is also be seen that in the summer there are higher waves towards the eastern corner of the domain within the sinop sd1 sub grid domain in the spring and summer seasons 0 6 m waves along the entire coast line dominate and decrease in the bay east of sinop with waves having an average height of less than 0 4 m in the autumn and winter seasons there are waves of 0 6 m and 0 8 m in the eastern part of the sinop cape and in the western coast of i̇nce burun cape respectively the rest of the coastal areas have mean significant wave heights of 1 m and 1 1 m at karaburun and filyos north easterly waves are dominant and waves originating from the north at sinop are dominant in all seasons fig 10 shows the spatial distributions of monthly averaged mean significant wave height and mean wave direction for karaburun sd3 sub grid domain although these spatial distribution maps are similar with that of the averaged mean annual and seasonal spatial distribution map of the entire data in fig 8 they differ in magnitude the monthly maps also show more temporal variations further information on the monthly variations of the wave climates is presented in the figs 11 and 12 for filyos sd2 and sinop sd1 sub grid domains respectively 5 2 wave energy period tm 10 spatial variations of long term averaged mean annual seasonal and monthly wave energy periods tm 10 values are also determined in the following this wave period measure is denoted as the wave period the annual variations are presented in fig 13 for each of the sub grids according to fig 13 a large part of the karaburun sd3 grid domain from pazarbaşı cape to the boarder of bulgaria is exposed to an average wave period of 4 s while the filyos sd2 and sinop sd1 sub grid domains mostly have averages of about 5 s periods in the eastern part of the karaburun domain 3 5 s periods are observed in a small section and 4 s periods are seen in the bay area east of sinop cape and in the region between baba burnu cape and alaplı beach according to the spatial maps not included here to reduce the number of figures of the seasonally averaged mean wave period determined for each sub grid the area from the coast of şile to the border of bulgaria in the spring season and the region from akpınar coast to i̇ğneada cape in summer has 4s wave periods the value decreases to 3 s towards the eastern region of sd3 sub grid domain in the autumn season 4 5 s period waves dominate in the area between akpınar and kıyıköy coastal areas and there are areas exposed to wave periods of 3 5 s and lower toward the east during the winter season around the karaburun monitoring location there are waves with 4 5 s wave periods whereas in the other regions of the domain 4 s wave periods are observed in the filyos sd2 sub grid domain during the summer autumn and winter seasons there are waves having 4 5 s 5 s and 5 5 s wave energy periods along the entire coastline respectively in the spring season waves with 4 5 s periods in the west of filyos monitoring location and 5 s in the east are observed the wave period value decreases toward the far eastern part of the domain to 4 5 s in the case of sinop sd1 sub grid domain most of the coastline periods of 4 s in the spring and summer 4 5 s in autumn and 5 s in winter seasons are dominant in the region east of the sinop cape there are waves having 3 5 s periods in the spring and summer seasons 4 s in the autumn and 4 5 s in the winter season in addition in all sub grid domains waves with the highest wave periods occur in the winter season followed by the autumn season and the minimum conditions are in the summer season 5 3 spatial variations for significant wave heights with different percentiles from a coastal engineering point of view information on the most severe sea states is relevant for the design and reliability of coastal structures accordingly in addition to the first analyzed average wave conditions yearly 95 and 99 percentile significant wave heights based on the 31 year hindcast have been calculated and the long term yearly averaged spatial distributions are presented in fig 14 for each sub grid domain from this figure it is seen that hm0 with the 95 and 99 percentiles in the western region of the karaburun sd3 sub grid domain is around 2 6 m and 4 m respectively the values decrease toward the east to 1 3 m and 2 m in the most eastern part of the domain in the filyos sd2 sub grid domain the 95 percentile hm0 is 1 6 m along the coast and increases to 2 m toward the nearshore while at open sea this value reaches 2 5 m the 99 percentile hm0 increases along the coast from 2 5 m at a small area to 3 m 3 5 and 4 m towards the open sea in addition the values of 95 and 99 probability of non exceedance of significant wave heights in the sheltered area on the western side of the cape of baba burnu are 1 m and 2 m respectively in the sinop sd1 sub grid domain a very narrow area along the coast towards the west of the i̇nce burun cape and east of sinop cape areas has a value of about 1 5 m and a lower 95 percentile for hm0 it is also found that there are 2 m waves in the nearshore and 2 5 m waves toward the open sea area of the domain with a 95 non exceedance probability in this domain the 99 percentile hm0 increased from 3 m 3 5 m and 4 m along the coast toward the open sea on the east side of sinop cape in the bay region 99 percentile hm0 of 2 5 m in the open sea area decreases towards the shoreline to 1 m in all sub grid domains the spatial distributions for 99 percentile hm0 values show resemblance to those of 95 percentile hm0 5 4 spatial variations of the probability of exceeding a critical hm0 value the probabilities of the significant wave height values being greater than a critical value 0 5 m and 4 m for each year have been determined and the long term yearly averaged spatial distributions are presented in fig 15 for each sub grid domain the probability of the significant wave height being higher than 0 5 m is between 60 and 65 in the karaburun sd3 sub grid domain from the şile coast to the bulgarian boarder this value is first between 65 and 70 then 80 toward the offshore and it decreases to 20 toward the east the probability of hm0 being over 4 m increases from 1 along the coast of şile to the bulgarian boarder to 4 towards the open sea in the same region within the filyos sd2 sub grid domain the probability of a significant wave height exceeding 0 5 m over the coast in the western region of the filyos monitoring location is 50 55 while it is 55 60 on the eastern side the probability of the significant wave height being greater than 4 m in this domain is less than 0 5 along the entire coast in the sinop sd1 sub grid domain the probability of the significant wave height is less than 0 5 m along the shoreline from the west of i̇nce burun cape to i̇nebolu and in the east of sinop cape this probability is between 50 and 55 this value decreases in the eastern part of sinop in the bay area toward the shoreline to 30 the probability of the significant wave height being over 0 5 m is 60 over the whole coastal area despite being present along a narrow coastal strip in the western part of the kerempe cape this value is 70 toward the open sea the probability of the significant wave height being over 4 m is less than 0 5 along the western coast of kerempe cape despite being available on a narrow area the value is 1 5 toward the offshore in all sub grid domains the spatial distributions of the probabilities of hm0 values being greater than 4 m and 0 5 m are almost similar however they vary in value 5 5 spatial variation of maximum hm0 spatial distribution graphs of the maximum hm0 values obtained with the maximum values of the significant wave heights at each grid point are separately determined for each sub grid domains and presented in fig 16 from these maps the largest estimated significant wave heights over 31 years are around 10 5 m along almost the entire coastline of karaburun sub grid domain sd3 at filyos monitoring station the maximum hm0 along the coastal strip was about 8 5 m in the west and 6 5 m in the east a maximum hm0 value of 6 5 m was estimated over almost the entire coastline of the sinop sub grid domain sd1 a maximum hm0 value of less than 5 m was however formed in the bay area to the east of sinop the value of max hm0 decreases towards the shore in all the grids due to shallow water effects 5 6 extreme wave heights lastly extreme value analysis for the selected 2 stations in each sub grid domain was carried out using the estimated annual maximum values for 31 years at the stations based on the gumbel distribution based on this method extreme wave heights with different recurrence intervals were estimated fig 17 in this figure the fitted trend lines of extreme wave estimates at the selected stations east of filyos sd2 and in the sinop sd1 sub grid domains almost coincide the trend lines of the extreme wave heights also show an increase from the west of filyos to the western end of the karaburun sd3 sub grid domain and thus waves with recurrence intervals increase from east to west in addition the 25 50 and 100 year recurrence interval extreme waves determined for the stations considered in this study are compared to the values presented in the turkish coasts wind and deep sea wave atlas özhan and abdalla 2002 this atlas is currently the only source used in the design of any coastal structure in turkey table 6 the results show that in the present study the values produced in karaburun sd3 sub grid domain are higher and the extreme wave heights determined for the locations in the other two sub grid domains are lower than the values presented in this atlas 100 year recurrence interval extreme waves by özhan and abdalla 2002 are up to about 2 2 m lower in karaburun sd3 domain and up to about 1 2 m higher in the other two sub grid domains 6 discussion this study focused on the development of a wave hindcast model using a calibrated nested grid system along the south west coasts of the black sea with the aim to obtain accurate long term wave climatology the results show that in our nested grid setup improved results were found by calibrating the whitecapping source term in connection with choosing the most appropriate wind input source term and time step for each grid system separately leading to different values per domain the different calibration results are a consequence of our initial choice in model setup by only considering wind input and whitecapping table 7 demonstrates whether there are improvements in model performance for the same years not used in the calibration in the same stations among the layers of the developed nested model it appears that there is a significant improvement in the estimation of the hm0 especially at the gloria station as it passes from the coarse grid to the fine grid at the coarse grid the bias nmb and hh error indicators are equal to 0 37 m 0 29 and 0 51 while they are 0 04 m 0 03 and 0 37 in the fine grid in this case we see that a slightly better performance was obtained for all of the error parameters at filyos location and for some of the error parameters at karaburun while at sinop fine grid presents a slightly worse performance however it should be noted that we focused on gloria location in the model calibration therefore it can be expected that an unimproved performance occurs in the south western part of the black sea although an improved performance was obtained for some of the error indicators at some locations table 7 also shows that as it passes from the fine grid to the sub grids an improved performance in the estimates of hm0 was obtained at all locations in terms of all error indicators scatter indices were determined as 58 53 and 47 in the fine grid while they are 55 47 and 34 in the sub grids at filyos karaburun and sinop respectively these results show that the nested swan model presents an improved performance on the one hand the most simple approach for a modeler engineer is to apply one model for the entire black sea to obtain fast and practical solution regarding wave hindcasts on the other hand developing an applying a nested swan model requires more time to run but it produces more accurate results in the comparison with the results of using a single model as our focus was on accuracy without time constraints we chose to develop the nested model approach a more generic approach would be to consider also other source terms like the one for estimating the non linear four wave interactions this approach however is not viable as long as these interactions are crudely estimated using the dia method in that way deficiencies in this term are compensated by tuning of other sources cf van vledder et al 2000 of which this study is a good example another interesting results of our calibration approach is that the time step was included as a calibration parameter leading to different optimal time steps per sub grid domain although it is generally expected that smaller time steps lead to smaller numerical errors we speculate that numerical errors are partly compensated by errors in the chosen physical processes in that respect one can also consider using recently developed source term like the so called st4 and st6 cf stopa et al 2016 rogers et al 2014 source term packages note the acronym st refers to source term package in the ww3 model of these new source terms the st6 source term package was included in the 2017 release of swan version 41 20 it would be interesting to investigate the effect of using st6 on model performance unstructured grids have become popular in recent years as they provide more flexibility in grid design and savings in computer requirements in view of the previous discussion it may not be effective as such a grid requires one physical and numerical setting for the entire domain a limitation of the present study is the scarcity of wave measurements in the black sea both in time and space to further improve any model setup for the black sea more buoy measurements are required not only along the coast but also further offshore to minimize orographic effects in wind forcing another option is to use satellite data for calibration and validation purposes but these are expected to be only applicable for the coarse grid with limited added value for the coastal grids another limitation of the present study is the coarseness of the coastal zone schematization which does not allow for a proper assessment of shallow water processes because the buoy location are effectively in deep water only applying high resolution grids can correctly represent the effects of these processes further nesting or further local refinement of an unstructured grid may solve that problem on the one hand a repeated nesting approach requires more computational requirements than using a single grid whereas on the other hand more accurate results can now be obtained this implies that any user should make a careful assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches 7 summary and conclusions the development of nested grid system for the south western part of the black sea consisted of the following steps firstly the swan model was calibrated per grid based on available measurements by finding the optimal settings of the wind input and whitecapping source terms their adjustable parameters and time step of the non stationary simulations secondly the accuracy of the calibrated swan model was verified based on measurement data not used in the calibration thirdly a 31 year long term simulation was performed providing a long term data set containing normal and extreme climate conditions results obtained during model development are as follows the swan model covering the entire black sea using the komen formulation for wind input and the janssen formulation for whitecapping cds 1 5 is the best model configuration with the lowest error and highest correlation the fine grid model set to cds 3 using the janssen formulae for both wind input and whitecapping processes operating with boundary conditions from the main domain has the best performance the swan model using komen for wind and janssen formulations for whitecapping as cds 3 for sd1 sinop cds 9 for sd2 filyos and cds 2 for sd3 karaburun is found to have the best performance for the three sub grids operated by taking the boundary conditions from the fine grid the most accurate results are achieved by operating the non stationary computation determined to have an effect on the model performance as 10 min in the sd1 sub grid 30 min in the sd2 sub grid and 20 min in the sd3 sub grid the calibrated nested swan model causes an improvement of about 14 for hm0 and 4 for tp for 2006 in wave hindcasts at gloria in comparison with those of the calibrated swan model including all the black sea in akpınar et al 2016 it also provides an improvement of 4 in the estimated wave heights at filyos against the calibrated swan model ran for all the black sea in akpınar et al 2016 results regarding wave climatology are as follows sub grid domains have a long term average of 1 m waves in the areas between şile shore of istanbul province and bulgarian border bartın province hisarköy shore to i̇nebolu shore and between capes of i̇nce and sinop between 1979 and 2009 the season with the highest average significant wave height is winter followed by autumn slightly lower values are observed in summer and spring a large part of the karaburun grid from pazarbaşı cape up to the bulgarian border is exposed to a long term annual average of 4 s wave energy period while most parts of filyos and sinop grids have energy periods of 5 s the values of 95 and 99 probability of non exceedance of significant wave height are 2 6 m and 4 m respectively in the western region of the karaburun grid and decrease towards the east in the filyos and sinop grids the values of both parameters are the lowest along the coast and increase towards the offshore the probability of the significant wave height being less than 0 5 m in the karaburun grid is around 60 65 along the coast from the şile coast to the bulgarian border while it has lower values along the coast in the other grid the probability of the significant wave height being greater than 4 m is around 1 along the shore from şile coast up to the border of bulgaria but less than 0 5 in other grids the largest estimated maximum significant wave height is about 10 5 m along almost the entire coastline of karaburun sub grid domain sd3 and it decreases to about 6 5 m towards to east in other two sub grids different re current periodic extreme waves produced in the present study are higher in the western part of karaburun sd3 sub grid in comparison with the results of the present wind and deep water wave atlas özhan and abdalla 2002 but they are lower in the other sub grids based on the results of this study the following conclusions are formulated the most effective calibration knob is the whitecapping coefficient the use of nested grids in combination with tuning per grid provides more accurate wave hindcast results in comparison with the results of a single wave model covering the entire black sea the time interval of non stationary computations has also shown to be effective in model tuning in general a finer temporal resolution improves model performance but for some sub grids this does not always lead to an optimal wave model setting the results of the calibration show that different settings were obtained per grid this indicates that no generic physical wave model setting yet exists the present wind and deep water wave atlas under estimates extremes in the south west coast of the black sea this study produced a huge wind and wave dataset for three sub grids focused on the south western part of the black sea this can be used for a variety of different purposes like guidelines for the

western part of our area of interest and lower extremes in the eastern part in comparison with those of the presently used wind and deep water wave atlas keywords waves swan nesting procedure hindcast wave modelling south western black sea 1 introduction information on wind wave climate provided by wave hindcasts assists in the understanding of wave behavior that include its short term variability long term trends as well as extremes the information which can directly be used is very valuable when it comes to coastal design and management studies especially in regions where measured in situ data is unavailable hindcast studies can provide the information required for coastal applications such as the evaluation of wave power stopa et al 2011 reguero et al 2012 2015 and the design of marine structures e g gouldby et al 2014 weisse et al 2015 despite their limited coverage instrumental data are important for the validation of model simulated wave fields as they provide sea state parameters directly in specific coastal locations altimetry data obtained by satellites e g izaguirre et al 2011 young et al 2011 give information about significant wave height sea state parameter for over 20 years still satellite data are not reliable in coastal regions and altimeter products do not give spectral and or wave period information the use of numerically generated wave hindcasts is therefore an important alternative for obtaining long term and mostly homogeneous descriptions of the wave climate perez et al 2017 the wam wamdi group 1988 wavewatch iii denoted as ww3 tolman 1999 and swan booij et al 1999 are some of the most widely used third generation wave models these models apply full wave variance spectra and their evolution in time and space obtained by integration of the wave energy or alternatively wave action balance equation komen et al 1994 the wam and ww3 models have been developed particularly to simulate wave generation and evolution at ocean scales because of their explicit time integration they are less suited for smaller coastal scales the swan model is especially suited for coastal scales because of its implicit way of solving the action balance equation but it is also able to run on large scales reguero et al 2012 atan et al 2017 for that reason we chose the swan model for the transformation of wave conditions from regional to local scales information from global wave hindcasts is generally very accurate in the open ocean however a finer resolution is required in coastal areas to ensure a more precise representation of the coastline and the bathymetry over continental shelf areas and thus it provides a better calculation of shallow water processes like bottom friction and depth induced breaking in addition it allows for a more accurate definition of the fetch length perez et al 2017 with this in mind this research focuses on the development of a downscaling methodology using nesting from regional to local scales in the interest of area previous studies for the black sea cherneva et al 2008 akpınar et al 2012 2016 akpınar and kömürcü 2013 aydoğan et al 2013 arkhipkin et al 2014 rusu et al 2014a van vledder and akpınar 2015 divinsky and kosyan 2017 focused mostly on the entire black sea for different purposes whereas a limited number of studies focused on western or north western shelf region of the black sea using a grid nesting procedure examples are studies for the prediction of extreme wave conditions rusu et al 2006 2014b wave energy assessment rusu 2009 influence of spatial wind resolution rusu

2012 and storm waves myslenkov et al 2016 as seen from here some of these studies were conducted for different purposes and covering the whole black sea use a regular model grid structure while aydoğan et al 2013 and myslenkov et al 2016 have used an unstructured grid system in the remaining studies rusu et al 2006 rusu 2009 2010 valchev et al 2010 2012 trifonova et al 2012 a higher resolution model was developed for the coastal areas of romania and bulgaria based on a telescoping nested grid system the primary aim of the present study is to develop calibrate and validate a high resolution nested wave prediction model focusing on the south western coasts of the black sea which are considered as hotspot areas for harvesting wave energy to our knowledge such detailed wave predictions have not been done before in this region in addition by performing a 31 year hindcast an accurate normal and extreme wave climate could be established in the hot spot areas from this point the paper is organized in six sections following the introduction section 2 presents the application of the swan model to the black sea where the materials and methods used in this study are introduced and section 3 shows the development setup and calibration of the wave hindcast model with a telescoping nested grid system in section 4 the verification of the developed nested model system against buoy measurements is presented wave characteristics along the south western coasts of the black sea are presented in section 5 in terms of normal mean hm0 mean tm 10 different percentile hm0 probability of exceeding a critical hm0 and maximum hm0 and extreme different return period hm0 wave conditions the study is completed with a discussion in section 6 and some conclusions and recommendations in section 7 2 application of swan model to the black sea in this study the state of the art third generation numerical wave prediction model swan version 41 01ab booij et al 1999 is used to produce long term wave data the bathymetry data used is the general bathymetric charts of the ocean abbreviated as gebco gebco 2014 with the same resolution 30 s in latitude and longitude produced by the british oceanographic data center bodc this data is open for use in scientific studies and was downloaded from the bodc website for the wind input fields we used the recent atmospheric reanalysis product cfsr wind fields saha et al 2010 these were found to have presently the highest quality for wave modelling in the black sea van vledder and akpınar 2015 the u and v wind components at a height of 10 m for a long term period of 31 years 1979 2009 were obtained from the noaa website at a spatial resolution of 0 3125 in both directions and with a 1 h temporal resolution contrary to modelling studies in literature akpınar and kömürcü 2013 aydoğan et al 2013 which used a single domain including the entire black sea in this study multi nested grids are preferred to obtain a high resolution and accurate wave hindcasts in the areas of interest as shown in fig 1 the position of the measurement locations are also shown in fig 1 their locations water depths and distance to the coast are summarized in table 1 as can be seen in fig 1 the nested grid system consists of a coarse grid with a spatial resolution of about 0 06977 approximately 7 8 km in latitude and longitude including the entire black sea a finer grid with a spatial resolution of 0 02 about 2 2 km focusing on the western part of the black sea and within this fine grid and three sub grids with spatial resolutions of 0 004 0 006 approximately 0 4 0 7 km each focusing on an area around the measurement locations sinop sd1 filyos sd2 and karaburun sd3 each nested grid obtains its boundary conditions from its host grid in the form of 2d spectra a key element in the downscaling approach was to calibrate each nested grid separately regarding its physical and numerical settings this holds for example to the domain size computational resolutions the physical formulations and their adjustable coefficients for deep water source terms time step of non stationary calculation calibration of the coarse grid is performed based on the one year measurements 1996 at the hopa gelendzhik and sinop locations measurements from other years at these locations and the measurements at gloria karaburun and filyos are used in the model validation of the coarse grid domain wave measurements were collected from the three directional wave buoys at gelendzhik hopa and sinop within the nato tu waves project özhan and abdalla 1998 the first measurement location was located in deep water 85 m in front of the russian coast near gelendzhik the second and the third locations were off the turkish shore near hopa and close to sinop at depths of about 100 m the buoys are able to measure individual wave heights up to the highest encountered in the black sea of about 15 m with a resolution of 1 cm and periods between 1 6 s and 30 s çevik et al 2006 deployed an ultrasonic dl2 acoustic wave sensor near karaburun village the sampling interval observation time and continuous observation intervals used in the measurements of the waves observer were provided as 0 5 s 10 min and 2 h respectively unfortunately we could only get wave height information for this station another wave measurement campaign by the general directorate of railways ports and airports construction of the turkish ministry of transport dlh 1999 was carried out for a new port planned near the filyos stream located in the western black sea wave data was collected every 2 h with a sample length of 20 min and a sampling interval of 0 5 s i e a sampling frequency of 2 hz a long term measurement campaign has been performed at the gloria drilling platform which operates in the western sector of the black sea at a measurements at gloria have been obtained a 6 h resolution in water depth of about 50 m the more detailed information on the measurement locations characteristics of the measurements and statistical values of measured data can be found in our previous studies van vledder and akpınar 2015 akpınar et al 2014 2016 the swan model for the fine grid domain is calibrated using the one year measurements 2006 at gloria boundary conditions for this grid are based on the calibrated swan model for the coarse grid domain akpınar et al 2016 validation of the calibrated swan model for the fine grid domain is carried out using the gloria s measurements unused in the model calibration of the fine grid domain the innermost grid domains are calibrated individually using the measured data for 1996 at sinop 2004 at karaburun and 1996 at filyos the boundary conditions for each sub grid are obtained from the calibrated swan model for the fine grid domain ultimately a calibrated swan model for each grid was determined using these models the gebco bathymetry and the cfsr wind fields a 31 year long wind wave simulation was realized all integral parameters hm0 tm 10 and etc needed to determine the wave characteristics wave energy generation extreme waves storms and etc are collected at a temporal resolution of 2 h at all computational grid points for the three sub grid domains besides for selected points in each grid wave data are collected at a 10 min intervals in the sinop sd1 sub grid 30 min in the filyos sd2 sub grid and 20 min in the karaburun sd3 sub grid the swan model was run in the third generation and non stationary mode with different time steps and different spatial regular spherical resolutions for each grid as outlined in chapter 3 the directional wave variance density spectrum was discretized using 36 directional bins and 30 frequency bins logarithmically distributed between 0 04 hz and 1 0 hz the numerical scheme was the bsbt first order upwind backward in space backward in time scheme for calibrating our wave model we used different source term formulations for wind growth and whitecapping as discussed in chapter 3 all other source terms are kept equal in our wave model computations quadruplet interactions are estimated using the discrete interaction approximation dia by hasselmann et al 1985 using λ 0 25 and c nl4 3 107 the jonswap bottom friction formulation hasselmann et al 1973 is used with c fjon 0 038 m2s 3 following zijlema et al 2012 depth limited wave breaking is modelled according to the bore model of battjes and janssen 1978 using α 1 and γ 0 73 the triad wave wave interactions modelled using the lumped triad approximation lta of eldeberky 1996 3 calibration method the calibration of the nested grid system is done by determining the best physical setting for each grid separately using the available measurement data within each grid following moeini and etemad shahidi 2007 siadatmousavi et al 2011 akpınar and ponce de leon 2016 and akpınar et al 2016 we chose the whitecapping coefficient as the most effective parameter for model calibration this choice was confirmed by testing the effects of the other processes triads bottom friction and depth induced wave breaking and their tunable parameters on model performance based on these tests it was found that these shallow water processes did not affect our results at the buoy locations due to its complexity we did not consider the quadruplet source term in our calibration instead we applied it unchanged with its default setting in addition the numerical settings of each grid domain spatial resolutions frequency resolutions directional resolutions frequency ranges sensitivity to choice of wind fields etc were also individually tested for each grid domain these tests showed that only the choice of a certain time step leads to improved model performance lower error and higher correlation therefore we present only the results of test runs regarding the time step and whitecapping in the following sections since the swan model contains different formulations for wind input and whitecapping five different combinations of formulations describing these two physical processes are considered the calibration was done pragmatically by varying the coefficients of the whitecapping source terms around their default values error statistics for each test run were calculated based on collocated simulated and measured data the statistical error parameters are presented in appendix a the model setting with the lowest error and the highest correlation the best setting is considered as the calibration result the following combinations were considered komen et al 1994 komen et al 1994 komen et al 1994 janssen 1989 1991 janssen 1989 1991 janssen 1989 1991 janssen 1989 1991 komen et al 1994 yan 1987 van der westhuysen et al 2007 for wind input and whitecapping in the following these combinations are referred to respectively with the following abbreviations k k k j j j j k and y w it is noted that the komen and janssen wind input formulation are different the default settings in the swan model whitecapping formulations of janssen and komen differ in the choice of the coefficient cds1 and the delta parameter in practice however they also differ in the power of the parametric spectral tail being 4 for the janssen formulation and 5 for the komen formulation this will lead to different results in case the same wind input and whitecapping parameters are used details of these formulations can be found in above mentioned references but also the swan technical manual swan team 2016 for the default values of the whitecapping coefficient we used 2 36 10 5 for the komen formulation 4 5 for the janssen formulation and 0 5 for the westhuysen formulation after the calibration of the source terms we determined the optimal time step of the non stationary calculations for each grid by considering model performance in the comparison of measured and hindcasted data were ensured that all relevant wave parameters were based on the same frequency interval 0 04 1 hz 3 1 coarse grid domain the calibration of the coarse grid was done in our previous study akpınar et al 2016 where detailed information was given on the calibration results however we also give here some results to show the model performance of previous model a comparison of the si bias and rmse values of both wave parameters hm0 and tm02 at the three buoy locations of gelendzhik hopa and sinop is presented in the fig 2 a and b this kind of figure shows error measures for each test run such that the best performing combination can easily be identified as can be seen the lowest bias 0 01 m rmse 0 28 m mae 0 20 m and si 49 are achieved in the swan model with the komen formulation for the wind input and janssen formulation for whitecapping having a whitecapping coefficient cds of 1 5 this test run has also the nearest mean hm0 0 57 m to that of the measurements 0 58 m correlations in most of the test runs are between 0 83 and 0 85 in our previous study akpınar et al 2012 the sensitivity of the time step of non stationary computation was examined during test runs performed for steps of 6 h 3 h 1 h 30 min and 15 min and it was determined that a 30 min time step produced optimal results therefore in this study the time step for the coarse domain is chosen as 30 min ultimately the best model configuration for the coarse grid domain is found as follows komen et al 1994 janssen 1989 1991 formulations for wind input whitecapping processes with cds 1 5 and delta 1 0 where the time interval for non stationary computation is 30 min and other all physical processes are active in default mode 3 2 fine grid domain the calibration of the intermediate fine grid domain is done against the measurements from the gloria station boundary conditions for this nest are from the calibrated coarse grid model a comparison of the si bias and rmse values of all swan model test runs at gloria is presented in fig 3 based on the results presented here the best swan setting are the janssen formulae 1989 1991 for both wind input and whitecapping using cds 3 0 this model setting has the lowest error in comparison with the others in terms of si 39 and 32 for hm0 and tm02 respectively mae 0 37 m and 1 09 s for hm0 and tm02 respectively and rmse 0 53 m and 1 44 s for hm0 and tm02 respectively etc the optimal time interval for non stationary computation is found to be 20 min these results show that nested grid system causes an improvement about 14 for hm0 and 4 for tp for 2006 in wave hindcasts in comparison with those of the calibrated swan model including all the black sea in akpınar et al 2016 the percentage improvement was computed based on the scatter index values it can be expressed as a percentage and thus the improvement is determined as the percentage by taking the differences of the scatter values obtained 3 3 sub grid domains the performances of the five combinations described above are examined in the individual calibrations of each sub grid numbered sd1 sd2 and sd3 a comparison of the si bias and rmse values of all swan model test runs obtained for the three sub grid domains is presented in the fig 4 a and b according to the results of the calibration process the best swan model performances were obtaining using the komen formulation for wind and the janssen formulation for whitecapping at with cds 3 0 for sd1 cds 9 0 for sd2 and cds 2 0 for sd3 the effect of the time step on the model results is also investigated for all three sub grid domains model runs for all three sub grids were performed using time steps of 30 min 20 min 15 min 10 min and 5 min the results of the model runs in terms of wave parameter error statistics show that the most accurate results lowest error can be achieved by running the swan model with a time interval of 10 min in the sd1 sub grid a 30 min time interval in sd2 and a 20 min time interval in sd3 although reducing the time step generally leads to more accurate results we found different optimal time steps for each sub grid as we included the time step as a calibration parameter these results suggest that errors in physical settings are compensated by errors of opposite sign in the numerical settings an overview of the calibration for all grids is given in table 2 the results in this table show that the nested grid system causes an improvement about 1 for both hm0 and tp in wave hindcasts in comparison with those of the calibrated swan model for the entire black sea in akpınar et al 2016 besides the area where the filyos measuring station is located is physically different from the other sub grid areas at filyos station the waves suddenly enter a shallow water from very deep water which leads to a sudden increase in wave steepness affecting the dissipation behavior while in other regions the waves slowly enter from deep water to shallow water it is estimated that due to this effect a higher whitecapping coefficient is required to be used in the sub grid sd2 containing the filyos station it has been finally determined that whitecapping processes its coefficient and the computational time step are the most effective modelling choices to improve swan model performance at all domains of the nested grid system we note however that no statements can be made of the role of shallow water processes as our measurement location are located in deep water from a wave point of view 4 verification of wave hindcast model with a nested grid system following the calibration of the nested swan models a verification analysis in each grid domain is conducted against measured for a time period that is not used in the calibration to check whether any lasting improvement is achieved this was done by examining the performance of the calibrated model in each grid domain based on the statistical error indicators bias rmse si etc presented in appendix a 4 1 coarse grid domain the performance of the calibrated swan model for the coarse grid domain is determined using the measured hm0 and tm02 or tp data at gelendzhik and hopa and also at the locations filyos gloria and karaburun the data of 1995 and 1996 are used in the filyos location the 2006 2009 data for gloria the 2003 and 2004 data for karaburun 1997 1998 and the 2000 2003 data for gelendzhik and the 1997 1999 data for the hopa location the error statistics for the simulated hm0 and tm02 or tp data with the calibrated and the default setting swan models as compared against the measurements at these locations are presented in table 3 from this table it is observed that the calibrated swan model for the coarse grid domain has a poor performance only at the gloria location in the peak wave period prediction based on most error parameters except for the correlation coefficient while the calibrated model has better results for both wave parameters at all other locations this mismatch may be due to the different sets of locations used in the calibration and validation of swan model respectively in this coarse domain the calibration of the swan model is based on the measurement locations in the eastern black sea viz gelendzhik sinop and hopa whereas the validation of this domain is based on measurements obtained in the western part of the black sea at the gloria location therefore the model for the coarse grid domain is tuned especially for the eastern part of the black sea we speculate that the calibrated nested swan model will solve this problem and that the calibrated swan model with the nested grid system focusing on the western part of the black sea will have an improved performance this notion is discussed in the following parts of the present study a comparison of the coarse grid calibrated and default setting swan model results against the measurements is shown in the fig 5 a and b for all locations and for the wave parameters hm0 and tm02 or tp the color scheme in scatter diagrams represents the log10 of the number of entries in a square box of 0 2 m in figs 5a and 0 3 s in fig 5b normalized with the log10 of the maximum number of entries in a box in this way the clustering of data points is highlighted each figure contains two lines the red line is according to the regression model y cx and the line of perfect agreement is the dashed line the number of samples n and the names of the buoy locations are shown in the title and in the plot these graphs also show that the calibrated model which has only poor performance at the gloria location in comparison with the other locations is much more agreeable with the measurements than the default setting model this illustrates the added value of model calibration for separate grids 4 2 fine grid domain the verification of the calibrated model in this grid domain is performed using the measurements from 2007 to 2009 at station gloria which are not used in calibration the reason why the results are not verified in another location is that only one measurement location is available within this grid domain error statistics of the estimated hm0 and tp data with calibrated and default setting swan models against the measured data are presented in table 4 the results in this table show that for the intermediate grid improvements based on the calibrated in comparison with the default setting models results are found of about 11 for hm0 and 2 for tp for 2007 22 for hm0 for 2008 and 17 for hm0 for 2009 in comparison with those of the calibrated swan model including the entire black sea in akpınar et al 2016 improvements are found of 2 for both hm0 and tp for 2007 12 and 8 for hm0 for 2008 and 2009 respectively scatter plots for hm0 hindcasts from the calibrated and default setting swan models against the measurements at gloria are presented in fig 6 the color scheme is as in fig 5a and here a square box of 0 3 m is used in fig 6 from the above error statistics and scatter plots a significant improvement lower error and higher correlation is witnessed at the gloria location which had poor performance in the calibrated swan model developed for coarse grid domain this results confirm our expectation noted previously 4 3 sub grid domains the performances of the calibrated models for the three sub grid domains are examined using the 1995 measurements of filyos for sd2 and the 2003 measurements of the karaburun location for the sd3 sub grid no verification is done for sd1 sub grid since all existing data are already used in the calibration the error statistics of the simulated hm0 and tp data from the calibrated and default setting swan models against the measurements for the sd2 and sd3 sub grid domains are presented in table 5 scatter plots for hm0 and tp for both sub grid domains are also given in fig 7 a and b from these graphs and error statistics there has been significant improvements in the model calibrations in the sub grids but a significant improvement has not been achieved in karaburun sd3 sub grid domain for hm0 it is observed however that the wave estimates realized with the calibrated nested grid system attained significant improvements finally the results show that the calibration for each grid provides more accurate wave hindcast results compared to choosing one setting for whole domain the different physical and numerical settings also indicate that there is still no overall model setting that provides the best results in all domains 5 wave characteristics along the south western coasts of the black sea the calibrated nested grid swan models were run separately for all three sub grids and simulations for a period of 31 years 1979 2009 wind and wave parameters wind speed components significant wave height peak period tp energy period tm 10 average period tm02 average wave direction etc are accumulated with a time resolution of 2 h at all computational grid points for each sub grid the computational requirements of this wave climate reconstruction are as follows all the swan output data collected for the three sub grid domains requires about 3 tb storage space the calibrated swan model for the coarse and the fine grids need about 4 h and 40 h runtime for a 1 year simulation respectively the models are run over an 8 cores i7 processor at 3 4 ghz for the detailed grids a 1 year simulation takes about 140 h 90 h and 110 h for the sd1 sd2 and sd3 grids respectively based on the results of the 31 year simulation for all sub grids the following characteristics are presented annual seasonal and monthly average variations of significant wave height mean wave direction and wave energy period spatial variations of 99 and 95 probability of non exceedance of significant wave heights the significant wave height being greater than 0 5 m and 4 m and maximum values of significant wave heights during 31 years over the entire black sea in addition extreme waves with different recurrence intervals at two locations in each sub grid domain were determined and the results are compared with those presented in the wind and deep water wave atlas of özhan and abdalla 2002 which are nowadays still the main source used in the design of coastal structures in turkey 5 1 mean significant wave height hm0 and mean wave direction the spatial variations of long term averaged annual seasonal and monthly mean hm0 and mean wave direction which is a vectorial mean weighted with variance density kuik et al 1988 are firstly presented in figs 8 12 as can be seen from these figures the highest average significant wave height is approximately 1 m among all the three sub grids is inside the karaburun sd3 sub grid this includes the coast from şile istanbul to the coasts of bulgaria from hisarköy bartin coast to i̇nebolu coast in sd2 sub grid domain and the coastline between the capes of i̇nce burun and sinop in sd1 sub grid domain have also high mean significant wave heights of about 1 m fig 8 waves generally come from a north eastern direction in the karaburun and filyos domains and from northerly directions near sinop according to the spatial maps for the seasonal average significant wave height and mean wave direction represented in fig 9 winter is the season with the highest average significant wave heights followed by autumn summer and spring show very close values within the karaburun sd3 sub grid domain the average hm0 of 0 6 m is simulated in the western region of the domain during the spring season the average value decreases to 0 4 m on the eastern side during the summer season karaburun monitoring location is exposed to significant waves of about 0 8 m in height this value decreases towards the western and eastern sides around this location in the autumn and winter seasons waves at 0 8 m and 1 m height are formed on the western side and 0 4 m and 0 6 m height on the eastern side respectively waves of 0 6 m height form in spring within the filyos sd2 sub grid domain along a large part of the shoreline 0 4 m and below in summer and 0 8 m in winter in the autumn waves of 0 6 m in the west of the filyos monitoring location and 0 8 m in the east are observed from baba burnu cape to the coast of karasu in this domain the region is exposed to the lowest wave height in all seasons it is also be seen that in the summer there are higher waves towards the eastern corner of the domain within the sinop sd1 sub grid domain in the spring and summer seasons 0 6 m waves along the entire coast line dominate and decrease in the bay east of sinop with waves having an average height of less than 0 4 m in the autumn and winter seasons there are waves of 0 6 m and 0 8 m in the eastern part of the sinop cape and in the western coast of i̇nce burun cape respectively the rest of the coastal areas have mean significant wave heights of 1 m and 1 1 m at karaburun and filyos north easterly waves are dominant and waves originating from the north at sinop are dominant in all seasons fig 10 shows the spatial distributions of monthly averaged mean significant wave height and mean wave direction for karaburun sd3 sub grid domain although these spatial distribution maps are similar with that of the averaged mean annual and seasonal spatial distribution map of the entire data in fig 8 they differ in magnitude the monthly maps also show more temporal variations further information on the monthly variations of the wave climates is presented in the figs 11 and 12 for filyos sd2 and sinop sd1 sub grid domains respectively 5 2 wave energy period tm 10 spatial variations of long term averaged mean annual seasonal and monthly wave energy periods tm 10 values are also determined in the following this wave period measure is denoted as the wave period the annual variations are presented in fig 13 for each of the sub grids according to fig 13 a large part of the karaburun sd3 grid domain from pazarbaşı cape to the boarder of bulgaria is exposed to an average wave period of 4 s while the filyos sd2 and sinop sd1 sub grid domains mostly have averages of about 5 s periods in the eastern part of the karaburun domain 3 5 s periods are observed in a small section and 4 s periods are seen in the bay area east of sinop cape and in the region between baba burnu cape and alaplı beach according to the spatial maps not included here to reduce the number of figures of the seasonally averaged mean wave period determined for each sub grid the area from the coast of şile to the border of bulgaria in the spring season and the region from akpınar coast to i̇ğneada cape in summer has 4s wave periods the value decreases to 3 s towards the eastern region of sd3 sub grid domain in the autumn season 4 5 s period waves dominate in the area between akpınar and kıyıköy coastal areas and there are areas exposed to wave periods of 3 5 s and lower toward the east during the winter season around the karaburun monitoring location there are waves with 4 5 s wave periods whereas in the other regions of the domain 4 s wave periods are observed in the filyos sd2 sub grid domain during the summer autumn and winter seasons there are waves having 4 5 s 5 s and 5 5 s wave energy periods along the entire coastline respectively in the spring season waves with 4 5 s periods in the west of filyos monitoring location and 5 s in the east are observed the wave period value decreases toward the far eastern part of the domain to 4 5 s in the case of sinop sd1 sub grid domain most of the coastline periods of 4 s in the spring and summer 4 5 s in autumn and 5 s in winter seasons are dominant in the region east of the sinop cape there are waves having 3 5 s periods in the spring and summer seasons 4 s in the autumn and 4 5 s in the winter season in addition in all sub grid domains waves with the highest wave periods occur in the winter season followed by the autumn season and the minimum conditions are in the summer season 5 3 spatial variations for significant wave heights with different percentiles from a coastal engineering point of view information on the most severe sea states is relevant for the design and reliability of coastal structures accordingly in addition to the first analyzed average wave conditions yearly 95 and 99 percentile significant wave heights based on the 31 year hindcast have been calculated and the long term yearly averaged spatial distributions are presented in fig 14 for each sub grid domain from this figure it is seen that hm0 with the 95 and 99 percentiles in the western region of the karaburun sd3 sub grid domain is around 2 6 m and 4 m respectively the values decrease toward the east to 1 3 m and 2 m in the most eastern part of the domain in the filyos sd2 sub grid domain the 95 percentile hm0 is 1 6 m along the coast and increases to 2 m toward the nearshore while at open sea this value reaches 2 5 m the 99 percentile hm0 increases along the coast from 2 5 m at a small area to 3 m 3 5 and 4 m towards the open sea in addition the values of 95 and 99 probability of non exceedance of significant wave heights in the sheltered area on the western side of the cape of baba burnu are 1 m and 2 m respectively in the sinop sd1 sub grid domain a very narrow area along the coast towards the west of the i̇nce burun cape and east of sinop cape areas has a value of about 1 5 m and a lower 95 percentile for hm0 it is also found that there are 2 m waves in the nearshore and 2 5 m waves toward the open sea area of the domain with a 95 non exceedance probability in this domain the 99 percentile hm0 increased from 3 m 3 5 m and 4 m along the coast toward the open sea on the east side of sinop cape in the bay region 99 percentile hm0 of 2 5 m in the open sea area decreases towards the shoreline to 1 m in all sub grid domains the spatial distributions for 99 percentile hm0 values show resemblance to those of 95 percentile hm0 5 4 spatial variations of the probability of exceeding a critical hm0 value the probabilities of the significant wave height values being greater than a critical value 0 5 m and 4 m for each year have been determined and the long term yearly averaged spatial distributions are presented in fig 15 for each sub grid domain the probability of the significant wave height being higher than 0 5 m is between 60 and 65 in the karaburun sd3 sub grid domain from the şile coast to the bulgarian boarder this value is first between 65 and 70 then 80 toward the offshore and it decreases to 20 toward the east the probability of hm0 being over 4 m increases from 1 along the coast of şile to the bulgarian boarder to 4 towards the open sea in the same region within the filyos sd2 sub grid domain the probability of a significant wave height exceeding 0 5 m over the coast in the western region of the filyos monitoring location is 50 55 while it is 55 60 on the eastern side the probability of the significant wave height being greater than 4 m in this domain is less than 0 5 along the entire coast in the sinop sd1 sub grid domain the probability of the significant wave height is less than 0 5 m along the shoreline from the west of i̇nce burun cape to i̇nebolu and in the east of sinop cape this probability is between 50 and 55 this value decreases in the eastern part of sinop in the bay area toward the shoreline to 30 the probability of the significant wave height being over 0 5 m is 60 over the whole coastal area despite being present along a narrow coastal strip in the western part of the kerempe cape this value is 70 toward the open sea the probability of the significant wave height being over 4 m is less than 0 5 along the western coast of kerempe cape despite being available on a narrow area the value is 1 5 toward the offshore in all sub grid domains the spatial distributions of the probabilities of hm0 values being greater than 4 m and 0 5 m are almost similar however they vary in value 5 5 spatial variation of maximum hm0 spatial distribution graphs of the maximum hm0 values obtained with the maximum values of the significant wave heights at each grid point are separately determined for each sub grid domains and presented in fig 16 from these maps the largest estimated significant wave heights over 31 years are around 10 5 m along almost the entire coastline of karaburun sub grid domain sd3 at filyos monitoring station the maximum hm0 along the coastal strip was about 8 5 m in the west and 6 5 m in the east a maximum hm0 value of 6 5 m was estimated over almost the entire coastline of the sinop sub grid domain sd1 a maximum hm0 value of less than 5 m was however formed in the bay area to the east of sinop the value of max hm0 decreases towards the shore in all the grids due to shallow water effects 5 6 extreme wave heights lastly extreme value analysis for the selected 2 stations in each sub grid domain was carried out using the estimated annual maximum values for 31 years at the stations based on the gumbel distribution based on this method extreme wave heights with different recurrence intervals were estimated fig 17 in this figure the fitted trend lines of extreme wave estimates at the selected stations east of filyos sd2 and in the sinop sd1 sub grid domains almost coincide the trend lines of the extreme wave heights also show an increase from the west of filyos to the western end of the karaburun sd3 sub grid domain and thus waves with recurrence intervals increase from east to west in addition the 25 50 and 100 year recurrence interval extreme waves determined for the stations considered in this study are compared to the values presented in the turkish coasts wind and deep sea wave atlas özhan and abdalla 2002 this atlas is currently the only source used in the design of any coastal structure in turkey table 6 the results show that in the present study the values produced in karaburun sd3 sub grid domain are higher and the extreme wave heights determined for the locations in the other two sub grid domains are lower than the values presented in this atlas 100 year recurrence interval extreme waves by özhan and abdalla 2002 are up to about 2 2 m lower in karaburun sd3 domain and up to about 1 2 m higher in the other two sub grid domains 6 discussion this study focused on the development of a wave hindcast model using a calibrated nested grid system along the south west coasts of the black sea with the aim to obtain accurate long term wave climatology the results show that in our nested grid setup improved results were found by calibrating the whitecapping source term in connection with choosing the most appropriate wind input source term and time step for each grid system separately leading to different values per domain the different calibration results are a consequence of our initial choice in model setup by only considering wind input and whitecapping table 7 demonstrates whether there are improvements in model performance for the same years not used in the calibration in the same stations among the layers of the developed nested model it appears that there is a significant improvement in the estimation of the hm0 especially at the gloria station as it passes from the coarse grid to the fine grid at the coarse grid the bias nmb and hh error indicators are equal to 0 37 m 0 29 and 0 51 while they are 0 04 m 0 03 and 0 37 in the fine grid in this case we see that a slightly better performance was obtained for all of the error parameters at filyos location and for some of the error parameters at karaburun while at sinop fine grid presents a slightly worse performance however it should be noted that we focused on gloria location in the model calibration therefore it can be expected that an unimproved performance occurs in the south western part of the black sea although an improved performance was obtained for some of the error indicators at some locations table 7 also shows that as it passes from the fine grid to the sub grids an improved performance in the estimates of hm0 was obtained at all locations in terms of all error indicators scatter indices were determined as 58 53 and 47 in the fine grid while they are 55 47 and 34 in the sub grids at filyos karaburun and sinop respectively these results show that the nested swan model presents an improved performance on the one hand the most simple approach for a modeler engineer is to apply one model for the entire black sea to obtain fast and practical solution regarding wave hindcasts on the other hand developing an applying a nested swan model requires more time to run but it produces more accurate results in the comparison with the results of using a single model as our focus was on accuracy without time constraints we chose to develop the nested model approach a more generic approach would be to consider also other source terms like the one for estimating the non linear four wave interactions this approach however is not viable as long as these interactions are crudely estimated using the dia method in that way deficiencies in this term are compensated by tuning of other sources cf van vledder et al 2000 of which this study is a good example another interesting results of our calibration approach is that the time step was included as a calibration parameter leading to different optimal time steps per sub grid domain although it is generally expected that smaller time steps lead to smaller numerical errors we speculate that numerical errors are partly compensated by errors in the chosen physical processes in that respect one can also consider using recently developed source term like the so called st4 and st6 cf stopa et al 2016 rogers et al 2014 source term packages note the acronym st refers to source term package in the ww3 model of these new source terms the st6 source term package was included in the 2017 release of swan version 41 20 it would be interesting to investigate the effect of using st6 on model performance unstructured grids have become popular in recent years as they provide more flexibility in grid design and savings in computer requirements in view of the previous discussion it may not be effective as such a grid requires one physical and numerical setting for the entire domain a limitation of the present study is the scarcity of wave measurements in the black sea both in time and space to further improve any model setup for the black sea more buoy measurements are required not only along the coast but also further offshore to minimize orographic effects in wind forcing another option is to use satellite data for calibration and validation purposes but these are expected to be only applicable for the coarse grid with limited added value for the coastal grids another limitation of the present study is the coarseness of the coastal zone schematization which does not allow for a proper assessment of shallow water processes because the buoy location are effectively in deep water only applying high resolution grids can correctly represent the effects of these processes further nesting or further local refinement of an unstructured grid may solve that problem on the one hand a repeated nesting approach requires more computational requirements than using a single grid whereas on the other hand more accurate results can now be obtained this implies that any user should make a careful assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches 7 summary and conclusions the development of nested grid system for the south western part of the black sea consisted of the following steps firstly the swan model was calibrated per grid based on available measurements by finding the optimal settings of the wind input and whitecapping source terms their adjustable parameters and time step of the non stationary simulations secondly the accuracy of the calibrated swan model was verified based on measurement data not used in the calibration thirdly a 31 year long term simulation was performed providing a long term data set containing normal and extreme climate conditions results obtained during model development are as follows the swan model covering the entire black sea using the komen formulation for wind input and the janssen formulation for whitecapping cds 1 5 is the best model configuration with the lowest error and highest correlation the fine grid model set to cds 3 using the janssen formulae for both wind input and whitecapping processes operating with boundary conditions from the main domain has the best performance the swan model using komen for wind and janssen formulations for whitecapping as cds 3 for sd1 sinop cds 9 for sd2 filyos and cds 2 for sd3 karaburun is found to have the best performance for the three sub grids operated by taking the boundary conditions from the fine grid the most accurate results are achieved by operating the non stationary computation determined to have an effect on the model performance as 10 min in the sd1 sub grid 30 min in the sd2 sub grid and 20 min in the sd3 sub grid the calibrated nested swan model causes an improvement of about 14 for hm0 and 4 for tp for 2006 in wave hindcasts at gloria in comparison with those of the calibrated swan model including all the black sea in akpınar et al 2016 it also provides an improvement of 4 in the estimated wave heights at filyos against the calibrated swan model ran for all the black sea in akpınar et al 2016 results regarding wave climatology are as follows sub grid domains have a long term average of 1 m waves in the areas between şile shore of istanbul province and bulgarian border bartın province hisarköy shore to i̇nebolu shore and between capes of i̇nce and sinop between 1979 and 2009 the season with the highest average significant wave height is winter followed by autumn slightly lower values are observed in summer and spring a large part of the karaburun grid from pazarbaşı cape up to the bulgarian border is exposed to a long term annual average of 4 s wave energy period while most parts of filyos and sinop grids have energy periods of 5 s the values of 95 and 99 probability of non exceedance of significant wave height are 2 6 m and 4 m respectively in the western region of the karaburun grid and decrease towards the east in the filyos and sinop grids the values of both parameters are the lowest along the coast and increase towards the offshore the probability of the significant wave height being less than 0 5 m in the karaburun grid is around 60 65 along the coast from the şile coast to the bulgarian border while it has lower values along the coast in the other grid the probability of the significant wave height being greater than 4 m is around 1 along the shore from şile coast up to the border of bulgaria but less than 0 5 in other grids the largest estimated maximum significant wave height is about 10 5 m along almost the entire coastline of karaburun sub grid domain sd3 and it decreases to about 6 5 m towards to east in other two sub grids different re current periodic extreme waves produced in the present study are higher in the western part of karaburun sd3 sub grid in comparison with the results of the present wind and deep water wave atlas özhan and abdalla 2002 but they are lower in the other sub grids based on the results of this study the following conclusions are formulated the most effective calibration knob is the whitecapping coefficient the use of nested grids in combination with tuning per grid provides more accurate wave hindcast results in comparison with the results of a single wave model covering the entire black sea the time interval of non stationary computations has also shown to be effective in model tuning in general a finer temporal resolution improves model performance but for some sub grids this does not always lead to an optimal wave model setting the results of the calibration show that different settings were obtained per grid this indicates that no generic physical wave model setting yet exists the present wind and deep water wave atlas under estimates extremes in the south west coast of the black sea this study produced a huge wind and wave dataset for three sub grids focused on the south western part of the black sea this can be used for a variety of different purposes like guidelines for the

tests a general method for reathm testing of ocean structures has been proposed an experimental case study was carried out to illustrate the proposed method the study was conducted in a state of the art hydrodynamic laboratory where a physical cylindrical buoy was placed in a still water basin horizontal mooring loads from a numerical mooring system which were modelled using the nonlinear finite element software riflex were actuated onto the physical substructure system performance was verified through comparison with a physical horizontal mooring system consisting of physical springs keywords real time hybrid model testing marine hydrodynamics ocean structures cyber physical systems 1 introduction ocean structures are dynamic systems governed by different physical regimes where applications can range from e g offshore wind turbines deep sea oil and gas and aquaculture numerical simulations will often be insufficient to fully describe the complex hydrodynamics encountered in the design of ocean structures due to phenomena such as slamming wave current interactions and viscous effects most ocean structures are therefore experimentally tested for design verification model validation and load determination however conventional experimental test methods will encounter challenges when studying multi physical systems with phenomena founded in different physical laws the scaling of phenomena dominated by gravitational effects froude scaling is incompatible with scaling of friction dominated effects reynolds scaling newman 1977 this was exemplified in model scale testing of floating offshore wind turbines where scaling of the wave field and wind forces are incompatible bachynski et al 2016 ill conditioning can arise e g in model scaling of the geometry of very long and slender structural members or in interaction between systems with slow and fast dynamics furthermore when studying structures on very deep water the general spatial constraints of basins may limit the capabilities of conventional test methods this has lead to the proposal of using real time hybrid test methods in the design validation of ocean structures the denomination real time hybrid model testing reathm testing is used to specify the use of hybrid testing within the hydrodynamic model scale testing field in reathm testing the emulated system i e the system sought replicated in the model test is separated into numerical and physical substructures that are interconnected in real time through a control system fig 1 real time hybrid testing was originally developed as an extension to the pseudo dynamic testing of systems and components in earthquake design analysis of civil engineering structures nakashima et al 1992 the method was developed in order to analyse highly nonlinear and rate dependent components connected to linear structural finite element fe analyses this has been studied extensively within the seismic civil engineering community fundamental questions such as stability interface connection and numerical substructuring have been addressed by carrion and spencer 2007 terkovics et al 2016 while the effect and compensation for time delays were presented by horiuchi et al 1996 1999 chae et al 2013 similar parallel developments have been made in the aerospace and automotive engineering communities through hardware in the loop hil testing of control systems on physical hardware and model in the loop mil testing of structural members plummer 2006 reathm testing of ocean structures was first suggested as a means for overcoming ocean basin infrastructure limitations when testing ocean structures in deep water applications final report and recommen 1998 buchner et al 1999 stansberg et al 2002 the part of the mooring system that could not be represented physically and hence had to be truncated i e geometrically divided into substructures would then be modelled numerically and attached to the physical system through sensors and actuators these studies were at the time only realised as desktop experiments as the technology was not yet mature for full implementation due to e g insufficient computational power and limited actuator technology the research on reathm testing applied to mooring systems has been further developed in more recent studies cao and tahchiev 2013 reathm testing methods have also been proposed for offshore wind turbines chabaud 2016 one of the main challenges identified for model scale tests of offshore wind turbines is a disparity in scaling regimes as wave related loads and response should be froude scaled while wind related responses should be scaled using reynolds scaling with reathm testing it is possible to mitigate this challenge by computing the wind loads numerically based on the measured platform motions and simulated wind field and rotor dynamics which is in itself a challenge bayati et al 2017 and actuate them onto the physical system such studies have been conducted both in 5 degree of freedom dof sauder et al 2016 chabaud 2016 and 1 dof oguz et al 2018 a stepwise method for designing a reathm test for offshore floating wind turbines was presented by sauder et al 2016 the research objective of the work presented in this paper was to develop a more formal method for real time hybrid model testing of ocean structures the main scientific contribution of this study is the development of the formal method for performing reathm testing of ocean structures this study includes a reformulation of the design steps from sauder et al 2016 such that they are more general and hence applicable to a wider range of ocean structures the method was implemented and tested in a case study of a moored floating structure in the marine cybernetics laboratory mc lab at the norwegian university of science and technology ntnu representing a typical application with slender structures e g mooring lines and risers the control system components used in the case study were developed in a previous study vilsen et al 2017a due to the spatial limitations of the basin a proper physical validation test of a real mooring system would be infeasible the case study was therefore based on a simplified emulated system that was possible to set up both as a real time hybrid test and as a purely physical system he paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the general strategy and method for a reathm test a case study on horizontal mooring systems is presented in section 3 along with a physical verification study finally the results are presented in section 4 and discussed in section 5 before concluding in section 6 2 method since the primary motivation for the development of reathm testing is to enable testing of ocean structures that are difficult to study in purely physical laboratory experiments the initial considerations and studies to be performed are similar to those typically done for traditional hydrodynamic model scale testing i e identifying the dynamic system physical phenomena scaling regimes and quantities of interest with this as a basis and by generalising the design steps for offshore wind turbines presented by sauder et al 2016 it is possible to derive a design and execution method for reathm testing of ocean structures the following design steps are proposed 1 identify the dynamic system and governing physical laws 2 identify the quantities and temporal spatial domains of interest 3 identify ill conditioning and other constraints in model testing 4 choose a substructuring and control strategy 5 perform a fidelity analysis given physical constraints and substructuring 6 design and tune the control system 7 perform verification tests in the following the seven design steps are described in detail a chart of the design procedure is presented in fig 2 where the steps are categorized into an initial planning phase an analysis phase by numerical simulations and a design and test phase where physical hardware is included 2 1 identification of the dynamic system and governing physical laws it is essential to identify the physical laws governing the system or the phenomena acting upon it as these will determine how the system properties should be scaled in physical model representation in marine technology a wide span of different applications are possible relevant systems may include offshore wind turbines liquid sloshing in tanks moored offshore oil gas and aquaculture structures tension leg platforms and other slender structures such as pipelines and risers general characteristics of each structure and system may vary for the different applications and sites of operation the physical quantities of importance will also depend on which governing physical laws are dominating the system dynamics examples of such laws include the symmetry laws of conservation and continuity laws of motion such as gravitational laws or general newtonian mechanics and thermodynamic laws 2 2 identification of quantities and temporal spatial domains of interest the quantities of interest qoi and the temporal spatial domains of interest doi for a system must be identified to determine where and how to monitor the system in model scale representation the qois are physical quantities of the system which are desired to be directly or indirectly observed in model testing examples of relevant qois for ocean structures are motions and mooring forces the spatial doi is the spatial extent and location of the qois identifying the spatial domain is important for the truncation between the numerical and physical system and thereby placement of sensors and actuators examples of the spatial dois are the above water surface structure wind turbines the water column deep water applications the wave zone and the free surface area temporal dois are the frequency span and resolution of the qois and physical phenomena acting on the system and are necessary for designing the numerical model control and actuation system and logging system examples of the temporal dois are wave frequencies 1st order low frequency 2nd order high frequency such as vortex induced vibrations viv and rare events such as slamming qois and temporal and spatial domains are possible to derive based on the identified dynamic system and physical laws important for the system section 2 1 2 3 identification of ill conditioning and constraints in model scale representation of the system incompatibilities or ill conditioning of certain properties in the system may render traditional scaled model testing infeasible and hence requires that hybrid component testing methods are applied incompatibilities that arise when scaling the system dynamics according to the identified physical laws should be identified e g when scaling system properties founded in different physical phenomena thereby requiring use of different scaling laws ill conditioning in scaled representation of the system can also occur when some part exhibit much faster dynamics than the rest of the system or when scaling components with very large discrepancies in geometric extent e g mooring line with length 3000 m and diameter 300 mm furthermore very high scaling ratios may make high quality wave generation difficult the experimental model scale representation of the system can also be constrained by physical and geometrical constraints set by the available test materials and laboratory infrastructure 2 4 substructuring and control strategy the ill conditioned properties or physical constraints must be compensated for by performing substructuring that is partitioning the system into numerical and physical substructures to separate the different physical domains or phenomena the location of the interface where the substructuring is performed can be chosen based on various factors dynamics too complex to model numerically need to be modelled physically the validity of available numerical models will also impact how much of the system it is possible to treat numerically tuning these numerical models so that they give satisfactory results e g choosing the correct drag coefficients as input before using them in tests is a crucial and challenging task following froude scaling time scales with λ where λ is the geometric scale ratio the time scaling determines the computational requirement for the numerical models as the numerical substructure must be designed such that it simulates fast while still capturing the system dynamics when a substructuring strategy is chosen the most important and relevant dynamics of the substructures must be transferred across the interface this requires fulfilment of similarity conditions on the interface s to ensure that the dynamics from the substructures are fully coupled de klerk et al 2008 following e g bond graph terminology karnopp et al 2006 the exchange of energy between the substructures can be described by the product of the flow e g velocity and rotation rates and effort e g force or torque this is illustrated in fig 3 and is obtained by 1 ensuring compatibility of displacements in one interface direction 2 ensuring equilibrium of forces in the other interface direction using this definition the control system can be designed to use either flow or effort as the control output the choice might be affected by technical limitations possible external disturbances or dynamics of the control system time delays and actuator dynamics might affect the controllability ability to control a state to a desired setpoint and causality cause and effect on the interface meaning that the control system dynamics could affect the overall dynamics of the coupled system the actuator and sensor system must be placed such that they do not introduce physical disturbances that influence the fidelity beyond given limits 2 5 fidelity analysis the fidelity of a reathm system describes how well the hybrid system represents the emulated system a thorough definition of the fidelity will be given in sauder et al sørensen while sauder et al 2018 contains a more relevant version for marine applications sufficiently high fidelity in a test method is necessary for the design validation of ocean structures in order to ensure validity of the test results for reathm testing artefacts in the system such as actuation errors or measurement noise may affect the overall behaviour of the system for high fidelity to be ensured the quantities of interest should not be affected by such effects a sensitivity analysis must therefore be performed to identify which artefacts or error sources play the largest role in determining the fidelity of the system sauder et al 2018 investigation of the sensitivity to artefacts is possible by developing numerical proxies of the physical subsystem and the interface and using these to set up a numerical numerical system emulating the full hybrid test setup bachynski et al 2015 sauder et al 2017 the outcome of the fidelity analysis should specify the system requirements for e g sensor noise bias time delays and numerical model efficiency to achieve the desired fidelity level 2 6 control system design in general the term control system encompasses everything connecting the physical and numerical substructures including sensors and actuators the control system should be designed so that it fulfils the requirements derived in sections 2 4 and 2 5 the physical system must be equipped with a sensor system such that it is possible to measure or estimate the states or outputs of the physical substructure needed as inputs to the numerical model and in some cases for the control system as well the sensor system should further give access to the states necessary for observing evaluating or estimating the qois of the physical system the sampling frequencies should be chosen based on the identified temporal resolution and relevant sampling theorems similarly the control system should run fast enough to avoid any shortcomings in the model and signal reconstructions and aliasing the sensor system can for instance include both analogue and digital sensors with different sampling update frequencies continuous time signals should then be properly reproduced for input to the numerical substructure by using interpolation and extrapolation methods e g zero order hold as mentioned earlier the control system performance can be affected by artefacts such as time delays scaling errors sensor bias and noise wild points and drift time delays are particularly critical to system performance as they may induce errors or instability 7 to fulfil the equilibrium condition the corresponding force from the numerical model must in principle be applied at the same instant the measurement is made this is not practically possible due to e g non zero time delays from communication numerical computation and actuator dynamics the aim is therefore to 1 minimize time delays when possible 2 identify and compensate for time delays in the system an actuation system should ensure that the desired loads or displacements depending on the selected actuation strategy from the numerical substructure is actuated onto the physical substructure actuated quantities must be measured or estimated for traceability and feedback to the controllers this feedback must be fast enough to follow the reference without inducing artefacts in the form of time delays or actuation errors note that other types of artefacts than time delays cab be of importance e g force sensor calibration errors sauder et al 2018 2 7 verification tests the performance of a reathm test setup must be verified before it can be used as a basis for the design validation of ocean structures however verification is often a non trivial task as artefacts may induce variations in the dynamics of the coupled physical numerical system that are difficult to directly observe and quantify verification studies should therefore systematically test the system functionality to quantify if any errors are induced through artefacts or system dynamics such test schedules may include the interface connection between the numerical and physical substructures must be examined to verify e g that interface quantities and coordinate transformations are correctly transferred controller actions should be verified through static and dynamic tests the numerical model used in real time with sensor input must be verified by studying quantities such as jitter time lags clock synchronization and output noise repeatability of the output and qois should be verified by performing several tests in the same conditions time delays in the system should be quantified to verify the compensation scheme and ensure traceability of the induced delays errors all monitored artefacts should be within bounds defined in section 2 5 further verifications may include test of robust error handling and safety measures to avoid sending undesired commands to the actuators that may damage technical equipment validation tests of a reathm testing setup where the performance of a purely physical laboratory experiment equivalent to the hybrid setup is compared with the reathm test output should also be performed before the system is used for actual studies the core functionalities of the system and key parameters such as time delays allocation and controller action should then be validated against a reference system that is possible to set up as a purely physical system 3 case study horizontal mooring systems the stepwise method presented above was formulated as a general approach in order to design hybrid test setups for ocean structures however the specific design steps from idea to experiment will vary from system to system in the following the reathm testing method is applied to a case study focused on horizontal mooring of a cylinder buoy no external environmental loading waves current wind were acting on the system in this study only static displacement tests and free decay tests were performed however the system was developed to satisfy requirements for future studies with wave excitations 3 1 identification of the dynamic system and governing physical laws the emulated system was a moored floating cylinder buoy with a mooring system consisting of 12 mooring lines attached to its circumference this buoy has previously been used in studies where the keel geometry was varied vilsen et al 2017a a rounded corner geometry was used in the present study this system was chosen as a case study because the test campaign should serve as a principal study of the method while at the same time maturing the technology by introducing challenges that have not previously been addressed with respect to reathm testing the choice of a generic cylindrical shape gives a flexibility in testing as the hydrodynamic properties are then isotropic this also means that the methods developed will not be very application specific but can be utilized for testing any rigid floating structures e g offshore oil and gas or aquaculture systems for the case study to function as a benchmark test for hybrid model testing the scaling ratio was set very high at λ 144 this resulted in a time scale ratio of 1 12 which set a high requirement for the simulation speed of the high fidelity and possibly complex numerical substructure using a high scaling ratio also increased scaling and measurement uncertainty for the tests however as the primary research objective of the case study was to implement and study the performance of the reathm test setup the added experimental uncertainty was not of primary concern the properties of the cylinder buoy and mooring system in full scale and in model scale are presented in table 1 parameters of the cylinder buoy determined from inclination tests are presented in table a4 in the appendix the dominating physical laws and phenomena acting on the system are the inertia and viscous forces on the hull and mooring lines the equations of motion can be described by the 6 dof vectorial form presented by fossen 2011 derived from newton euler equations for coupled translational and rotational motions 1 m ν ν d ν ν g η τ e x t τ m o o r where η ℝ 6 is the 6 dof position given in a local earth fixed frame as north east down ned coordinates and euler angles and ν ℝ 6 is the 6 dof velocity in the body fixed frame given as linear translational velocities and rotation rates m ℝ 6 6 is the mass and added mass matrix of the cylinder buoy d ℝ 6 6 is the damping matrix g η ℝ 6 is the hydrostatic stiffness vector and τ e x t ℝ 6 and τ m o o r ℝ 6 are the external and mooring force vectors and moments acting on the buoy respectively for this type of system model testing is needed to identify the viscous drag and eddy making near the surface of the body which are challenging to compute numerically in decay testing the system may in rough terms be considered by only studying 1 dof motions of the floater in the decay direction isotropic parameters the matrices 1 then reduce to one equation with mass stiffness and damping as given in table 1 the linearised viscous damping estimate is averaged over one oscillation period for an excursion of 1 5 cylinder radius 3 2 identification of quantities and temporal and spatial domains of interest the qois are the oscillation period of the floating cylinder the top tensions in the mooring lines and the damping of the coupled system linear and quadratic damping coefficients p 1 and p 2 these quantities are related to the static and dynamic properties of the mooring system and the hydrodynamic added mass and damping as the system operates in full scale for the numerical substructure and model scale for the experimental substructure temporal and spatial resolutions change across the interface the maximum excursion applied was 1 5 times the radius of the cylinder approximately 63 m in full scale and 0 45 m in model scale the expected oscillation period of the surge motions was near 120 s in full scale and 10 s in model scale and an expected roll pitch period 12 s full scale and 1 s in model scale fig 4 the tangent stiffness of the mooring system at the origin was 282 6 kn m in full scale with the expected excursion this gives a maximum mooring force of approximately 18 3 mn in full scale and 6n in model scale table 2 for future applications that include wave forces a wave spectrum with significant wave height of 14 m and peak period of 12s in full scale would result in 0 1 m and 1s model scale parameters 3 3 identification of ill conditioning and constraints the ill conditioning of the dynamic system mainly consists of the radically different dimensions between the mooring system and the topside floating structure the large spatial extent of the mooring system 1494 5m radius for a single mooring line and 320m water depth requires a scaling ratio of 1 250 to fit the constraints of the 6m wide basin infrastructure such a large scaling ratio is not feasible for observing the hydrodynamic effects on the floater stansberg et al 2002 another aspect is that soil structure interaction occurs as mooring lines are lifted and lowered on the seabed which might be difficult to reproduce in physical model testing 3 4 substructuring and control strategy the substructuring was desired was set up to compensate for the geometric constraints in the laboratory infrastructure while retaining the complex flow regimes at the free surface the numerical nonlinear fe software riflex ocean 2016 was chosen to simulate the parts of the mooring system that did not fit in the basin the software has been thoroughly documented and validated and is thus considered sufficiently accurate to represent such mooring systems aksnes et al 2015 for simplicity the coupling on the interface was reduced to the 2 dof horizontal force components the vertical force component was excluded as the effect on decay testing in still water can be neglected however it may be of importance for other applications such as semi submersibles especially when damaged stability is in focus as only the horizontal force components were transferred and no physical part of the mooring lines were present in the tests the truncation point can be considered as the fairled points of the cylinder such that the entire mooring system was modelled numerically using the definition of truncation ratio given by sauder et al 2017 i e truncated length divided by total length this resulted in a truncation ratio of 1 the mooring lines were designed with four segments a top chain segment a fibre rope segment a heavy chain segment near the mud line and a long chain segment to the anchor each line being modelled by 60 elements distributed over the four segments the full model contained 720 elements the input values for the numerical model are presented in the appendix table a 5 with the longitudinal and lateral drag coefficients used in the morison equation for determining the hydrodynamic loads to satisfy the similarity conditions stated in section 2 4 a control strategy should be designed to control either the position velocity flow of the cylinder buoy or the force effort exerted upon the buoy as the response of the physical system to the hydrodynamic forces is a qoi the physical model should be able to interact freely with the hydrodynamic forces i e the dynamics remain undisturbed inertia dominated hydrodynamic forces on the cylinder depend on the acceleration i e the relative difference between the acceleration of the fluid and the cylinder if the position and velocity were to be controlled the measured acceleration would need to be correct as well to achieve correct forces this is challenging due to effects such as measurement errors actuator dynamics and time delays in contrast if force control is applied the cylinder can be controlled to better interact with the environmental forces by adding a compliant element and actively compensate for external disturbances disturbance rejection the restoring forces from the numerical substructure are then actuated onto the system separately induced errors or delays will then primarily be in the form of errors in the mooring force and not directly impact the hydrodynamic forces based on these observations force control was chosen for the case study with the measured position and velocities being input to the numerical substructure and calculated forces being actuated onto the experimental substructure the actuated dof s were then reduced to the horizontal ne components of the force computed by the numerical substructure 3 5 fidelity analysis one artefact in the case study is the reduced order of coupling on the numerical physical interface the substructure interface should ideally be designed to transfer the 6 dof dynamics between the substructures however the actuation of interface forces was limited to the 2 dof horizontal force resultants for simplicity in the case study only horizontal translational motions are considered where the stiffness from the mooring system can be described by the catenary effect further the total mass of the mooring system is small compared to the mass of the floating cylinder this means that the horizontal force resultants play the largest contribution while the influence of the vertical forces can be neglected faltinsen 1990 the physical substructure buoy had no stiffness in the horizontal plane besides that supplied by the numerical mooring system this meant that even small errors in the position and force measurement system would affect the overall dynamics further the system had a high scaling ratio and was sensitive towards scaling errors or dimensional errors as 1 n error in force measurement actuation in model scale results in ca 3 mn error in full scale due to the rounded corner geometry of the cylinder buoy very little physical damping was present in the reathm setup the system was therefore sensitive to time delays in the control system horiuchi et al 1999 ueland and skjetne 2017 3 6 control system design the architecture of the real time system was developed to accommodate the equilibrium and compatibility requirements on the interface see section 3 4 details on the control system algorithm have been presented in vilsen et al 2017a while the individual system functionalities are presented here fig 6 3 6 1 sensor system the physical substructure was placed at the center of the test basin and equipped with a sensor system consisting of an optical position measurement system three component accelerometers and load cells on the actuation lines fig 5b the optical positioning system logged the rigid body position and attitude of the physical substructure at a update rate of 100 hz given in ned coordinates with respect to a local earth fixed inertial reference system the accelerometers were placed on deck to measure the surge sway and heave accelerations of the physical substructure with respect to a body fixed non inertial reference system at a sampling rate of 300 hz a data acquisition system was placed inside the buoy for logging the sensor data the sensor data was timestamped to ensure traceability of time delays and sent to a control system on land through optic fiber wire 3 6 2 kinematic observer the measured states of the physical substructure were 6 dof position and attitude and 3 dof linear accelerations translational velocities are needed as input for the numerical models and for the controllers and are ideally obtained by integrating the accelerations however sensor bias in the accelerometers may then induce drift in the integrated values which may in lead to divergence hence a kinematic observer was implemented to estimate the states of the system through fusion of different sensor inputs a nonlinear passive observer for inertial measurement unit imu and global navigation satellite system gnss integration was chosen fossen 2011 using accelerometer and gyro measurements as proxies for imu data and optical position measurements as proxies for gnss data the observer outputs were the estimated position and instantaneous velocity along with the sensor bias for the accelerometer implementation of the observer has previously been described in 18 and the details can be found in appendix a 3 3 6 3 prediction time delays induced by the measurement system communication computation time and actuator dynamics were identified and a prediction scheme was introduced to compensate for the time delays since environmental loads affecting the experimental substructure and hence the motions of the floater are generally not modelled well it was not possible to use model based prediction methods instead a polynomial prediction procedure was applied for predicting future values of the estimated position and velocity a third order polynomial approximation was fitted to each individual physical quantity and prediction performed as polynomial extrapolation the polynomial identification was performed using the 50 previous data points 250 ms model scale and extrapolation was done 6 data points ahead corresponding to a 30 ms prediction in model scale 360 ms is full scale this prediction window was chosen primarily to compensate for the delay from the position measurement system without introducing unacceptable overshoot and noise 18 3 6 4 controller and actuation system the objective of the controller and the actuation system was to apply the loads τ ℝ 2 computed by the numerical substructure onto the experimental substructure the applied force must satisfy the equilibrium condition on the moving interface equivalent to the sum of the two main control objectives chabaud 2016 1 reference tracking of the desired force 2 disturbance rejection actively compensate for external disturbances on the physical substructure for the reathm test setup three actuators were placed in the horizontal plane with 120 spacing around the physical substructure the actuation was performed through a system consisting of a rotary actuator a brushless dc motor connected to a compliant clock spring the spring excited a pulley wheel which transformed the rotary motion into a translational motion through an actuation wire connected to the experimental substructure the compliant element was added to reduce the overall stiffness of the actuation system and thereby reducing the system response to external disturbances an allocation procedure was used to calculate the individual line tensions required from each actuator to apply the global load vector τ which is found by summing the horizontal top tension components from the mooring lines in the numerical substructure the theory behind this approach is briefly presented in appendix a 4 and can be found in full length in vilsen et al 2017a the first control objective reference tracking of the desired force was sought satisfied through two controllers first a reference feed forward controller that used a quasi static model of the actuation system to estimate the required actuation command to apply the desired force t r e f second an integral feedback controller that integrates the error between desired and measured force t m e a s to compensate for estimation error and drift in the other controllers the second control objective disturbance rejection was sought satisfied by a velocity feed forward controller which used the estimated velocity ν ˆ of the physical system in the inertial reference frame to find the elongation velocities of the individual actuation lines ν f f the elongation velocities were then integrated and the resulting position used to compensate the floater motions through motor commands 3 7 verification study the experiments were conducted at the marine cybernetics laboratory mcl at ntnu the laboratory is a 30 m long and 6 m wide wave basin with a wave generator at one end and wave absorption at the other the depth at the test section is 1 5 m when using riflex for simulation of the numerical substructure nonlinear damping is introduced from hydrodynamic drag on the mooring lines furthermore time delays are introduced from computation time and communication time with the external pc running the simulation for the verification study a linear isotropic stiffness model was therefore implemented directly in the control loop instead of using riflex as a numerical substructure the modelled stiffness was applied without introducing further time delays and with no damping model included the performance of the remaining components of the control system could then be tested isolated from the numerical substructure 3 7 1 tests performed static displacement test were performed to evaluate the allocation procedure and interface connection in the static case by verifying that the commanded load from the numerical model was correctly applied to the physical system this was done by applying a stepwise static displacement to the physical substructure and by comparing the applied load to the commanded load dynamic decay tests during which the buoy was manually pulled away from the equilibrium position and released were performed to evaluate the dynamic properties of the system including oscillation frequencies hydrodynamic damping and applied mooring loads several decay tests were performed to verify the repeatability of the results 3 7 2 analysis theory the applied horizontal load was found by using the instantaneously measured line tensions in the three actuation lines measured position of the buoy and the known positions of the actuators were first used to obtain the unit vectors of the actuation line tensions horizontal north and east components of the applied mooring force could then be found by vector summation the expected oscillation periods of the coupled buoy and linear numerical stiffness were estimated by 2 t 0 2 π m k where m is the measured total mass of the buoy plus added mass determined as 0 5 times the displaced volume and k is the horizontal stiffness of the numerical mooring system a method presented by 28 cp 7 was used to estimate the normalized damping coefficients the equation of motions is normalized and the linear and quadratic damping is described by coefficients p 1 and p 2 and the stiffness by the coefficient p 3 the 1 dof equation of motion for a decay can then be stated as 3 x p 1 x p 2 x x p 3 x 0 where x is the position excursion and x x represent first and second derivative with respect to time results from decay tests were used to estimate the linear and quadratic damping coefficients by using the relation 4 2 t m l o g x n 1 x n 1 p 1 16 x n 3 t m p 2 where t m is the oscillation period and x n is the amplitude of the nth oscillation the damping coefficients can then be found by performing a decay test and plotting 16 x n 3 t m on the x axis and 2 t m l o g x n 1 x n 1 on the y axis the slope of the line gives an estimate of the quadratic damping coefficient while the crossing with the y axis gives an estimate of the linear damping coefficient the sensor data were sampled in model scale time at 300 hz as the motions of such a system are at much lower frequency bands the sampled data was low pass filtered with a cutoff frequency at 4 hz in model scale which is equivalent to 0 33 hz in full scale the frequencies that are then filtered out lie well outside the expected frequencies of both the motion response and the expected external excitations where little energy would be present at higher frequencies than 0 2 hz in full scale and 2 4 hz in model scale faltinsen 1990 3 8 validation study a full physical test using physical horizontal springs to represent the mooring system was performed to validate the reathm test to validate both the statics and dynamics of the hybrid system it was desired to design a case that could be tested both experimentally and numerically with high fidelity and with static and dynamic equivalence between the systems the setup was developed such that each actuation line was replaced by a physical spring that was attached horizontally to the buoy with 120 spacing between individual lines similarly to the actuation lines for the hybrid system the initial length of the springs was 2 14 m and they were subjected to an initial elongation of 0 9 m the springs were individually pre tested and rated to have a stiffness of 8 7 n m the three spring system lead to an initial stiffness of 13 05 n m for a pull in a direction in line with one of the springs note that the stiffness is anisotropic with this setup if alternatively considering a vertical spring system using pulleys to apply the horizontal stiffness friction damping would be induced by the pulleys this is a problem as the damping of the system is a qoi 3 9 tests using riflex after verification and validation tests a test series was performed with the fully nonlinear fe model as numerical substructure as in the verification test both static and dynamic tests were performed 4 experimental results this section presents the results obtained through experimental testing 4 1 static displacement tests results from the static displacement tests are presented as the measured applied restoring force resulting from a stepwise excursion fig 7 the measured stiffness from the verification study corresponds well with the desired stiffness given as input for the linear stiffness model the static results from the validation study show a higher initial stiffness gradually sloping towards the same stiffness as that applied in the verification study 4 2 decay and repeatability results from three repetitions of decay tests are presented along with the estimated linear and quadratic damping coefficients for the verification study fig 8 and for the validation study fig 9 the decay results figs 8a and 9a are presented in terms of the normalized horizontal motions of the floater along the decay direction in the damping plots figs 8b and 9b the full drawn line indicates a fit to the first 8 oscillation amplitudes of all three tests the verification tests demonstrate good repeatability in oscillation period and damping fig 8a though variations in the oscillation amplitudes resulted in scattering of the estimated p 1 and p 2 between tests fig 8b oscillation periods from tests with varying stiffness were systematically lower than the theoretically expected results table 3 the validation test results showed good fit for the quadratic damping coefficient at large amplitudes while a transition towards linear damping was observed at smaller amplitudes fig 9b 4 3 applied load a time series plot of the applied load during a decay test in the verification study is presented fig 10 the commanded north and east resultants are presented along with the applied load the applied load in general show good correspondence with the commanded load though some undershoot is observed the sampled load signal included high energy content at higher frequencies which was removed by low pass filtering of the presented results 4 4 tests using riflex the results of the verification test using the nonlinear fe model riflex are presented for the static and dynamic case fig 11 the results show that the nonlinear geometric stiffness has been applied as intended fig 11a and that results from dynamic tests are repeatable fig 11b top tensions from all twelve simulated mooring lines during a decay test show a variation in individual loading with highest loads for those in line with the excursion direction fig 12 5 discussion in this section the presented results are discussed and the validity evaluated 5 1 verification study the results of the static displacement tests show that in the static case the control system was able to apply the correct restoring force the restoring force was applied by allocating the output from the numerical substructure to the three actuators and applying the allocated setpoints to the controllers the good correspondence between commanded and applied force implies that the allocation procedure performs well and that the individual line force controllers were able to track the desired static setpoint if the allocation procedure was not functioning correctly the static forces would not match for numerical and physical systems the good correspondence between the three decay test repetitions imply that the damping and oscillation periods qois of the system are highly repeatable since repeatability in the qois is very important for model testing in general this strengthens the impression that this reathm testing setup performs consistently the oscillation periods for the five different stiffness levels tested with the linear isotropic stiffness model in the hybrid system matched well with the theoretical period based on the mass added mass and stiffness of the system however the period applied with the hybrid system is systematically lower than the expected by approximately 2 5 this could be because the added mass was lower than theoretically expected possibly due to the rounded keel geometry the results of the commanded vs applied force show that the controller action was able to follow the commanded reference well there was a systematic undershoot of the applied force indicating that performance could be improved by applying faster control action however the dynamics of the actuation system generates high frequency vibrations which interact with the controllers by increasing the controller gains the interaction between vibrations and controller action is amplified this limits the possible controller configurations with the present system and indicates that improvements in the mechanical design are needed 5 2 validation study the results from the decay tests in the physical validation study demonstrated good repeatability in oscillation period and damping the comparison of the horizontal spring system and the results from reathm testing show a difference in the stiffness applied in the tests with the physical system exhibiting nonlinear anisotropic stiffness while the hybrid system was set up with a stiffness based on a theoretical stiffness obtained by using trigonometry and the individual spring stiffnesses the stiffness of the physical system was measured to be higher than the theoretical value probably due to the catenary effect of the suspended horizontal springs due to the higher physical stiffness observed during testing the stiffness of the hybrid system was changed to 14 7 n m corresponding to the tangent stiffness of the physical system at 1 6 radius excursion however this was an underestimation of the stiffness as the stiffness was higher near the equilibrium point and the anisotropic properties results in higher stiffness for excursion in the direction opposite to the tested the difference in stiffness resulted in longer oscillation periods for the hybrid system than for the physical validation tests given the discrepancies between the physical and hybrid system described above the present case does not serve as a full validation of the system however the results can to some extent still be used to validate the system dynamics as the springs in the physical setup were not in contact with water and no moving parts were introduced the springs should ideally not add any damping to the system in both the hybrid and purely physical setups the damping should therefore purely originate from the hydrodynamic damping of the buoy however artefacts in the actuation system such as time delays or actuator dynamics can appear as additive or dissipative energy in the hybrid system or negative or positive damping comparison of the damping levels of the two systems can then give an indication of the significance of the artefacts in the hybrid system 29 the induced damping varies with the velocity and therefore also by stiffness by using the method presented in section 3 7 the damping is normalised with respect to the excursion and the oscillation period the results presented for the hybrid test and physical test show that similar linear and quadratic damping levels are present in the two systems for both studies the damping is initially purely quadratic with a close fit to the straight line in the damping coefficient plot as the velocity decreases the damping goes towards linear damping this appears clearer in the physical test where the shift occurs gradually beginning from when the maximum velocity during an oscillation drops below 0 1 m s or equivalent to a keulegan carpenter kc number of 1 5 the damping is fully linear from the velocity drops below 0 055 m s equivalent to a kc number of 0 95 linear hydrodynamic damping arise from viscous skin friction on the cylinder surface while the quadratic damping is typically associated with eddy making damping due to flow separation faltinsen 1990 the increased linear damping observed for the hybrid system at very small amplitudes is opposite of what would be expected since time delays in the system would induce negative linear damping ueland and skjetne 2017 this could be due to errors in the disturbance rejection as identified in a previous study vilsen et al 2018 such effects may modulate the system dynamics due to the control system action further validation and verification studies are needed to prove that the present system will have satisfactory performance in future testing in addition to investigating the hybrid system s ability to reproduce the system characteristics stiffness and dynamics a full validation study should also validate the correct response given a range of relevant environmental loadings this may prove more challenging for the control system as much higher frequencies of excitation would occur when the system is exposed to environmental forces 5 3 nonlinear fe model the coupling of the nonlinear fe model riflex gave good results with the static displacement tests giving the expected nonlinear response and the decay tests showing good repeatability given that the general system functionality has been verified above the primary artefact introduced when using a more complex numerical substructure is time delays caused by communication from the real time system to the simulation pc and the numerical calculation time the time delays induced by using riflex in reathm testing was studied by vilsen et al 2017b their impacts on the qois implied that time delays induced by the numerical substructure are important performance indicators that must be in focus for future reathm testing applications 6 conclusion the experimental outcomes of this study suggest that the proposed method served as a good guide for how to design a reathm test although the method did probably not provide a fully generic setup for reathm testing of ocean structures it addressed which aspects to consider when designing such tests and proposed a guideline for how to systematically analyse the considered system the outcomes from the case study prove that it is possible to apply nonlinear mooring stiffness from a numerical model onto a physical system in reathm testing of marine structures however the method should undergo more extensive validation studies such that the technology can be raised to a trl level sufficiently high for the method to be used in design validation of ocean structures when testing systems where the vertical force component of the mooring load is of minor importance e g turret moored floating production storage and offloading fpso vessels the reathm testing approach used in this study would be sufficient to apply the correct nonlinear horizontal stiffness and mooring line damping however expanding the system to handle more degrees of freedom would enable further applications towards deep water acknowledgements this work was supported by the research council of norway through the centres of excellence funding

23039,this paper presents a method for real time hybrid model testing reathm testing of ocean structures reathm testing is an extension to traditional hydrodynamic model scale testing where the system under study is partitioned into physical and numerical substructures the physical and numerical subsystems are connected in real time through a control system based on experience with various reathm tests a general method for reathm testing of ocean structures has been proposed an experimental case study was carried out to illustrate the proposed method the study was conducted in a state of the art hydrodynamic laboratory where a physical cylindrical buoy was placed in a still water basin horizontal mooring loads from a numerical mooring system which were modelled using the nonlinear finite element software riflex were actuated onto the physical substructure system performance was verified through comparison with a physical horizontal mooring system consisting of physical springs keywords real time hybrid model testing marine hydrodynamics ocean structures cyber physical systems 1 introduction ocean structures are dynamic systems governed by different physical regimes where applications can range from e g offshore wind turbines deep sea oil and gas and aquaculture numerical simulations will often be insufficient to fully describe the complex hydrodynamics encountered in the design of ocean structures due to phenomena such as slamming wave current interactions and viscous effects most ocean structures are therefore experimentally tested for design verification model validation and load determination however conventional experimental test methods will encounter challenges when studying multi physical systems with phenomena founded in different physical laws the scaling of phenomena dominated by gravitational effects froude scaling is incompatible with scaling of friction dominated effects reynolds scaling newman 1977 this was exemplified in model scale testing of floating offshore wind turbines where scaling of the wave field and wind forces are incompatible bachynski et al 2016 ill conditioning can arise e g in model scaling of the geometry of very long and slender structural members or in interaction between systems with slow and fast dynamics furthermore when studying structures on very deep water the general spatial constraints of basins may limit the capabilities of conventional test methods this has lead to the proposal of using real time hybrid test methods in the design validation of ocean structures the denomination real time hybrid model testing reathm testing is used to specify the use of hybrid testing within the hydrodynamic model scale testing field in reathm testing the emulated system i e the system sought replicated in the model test is separated into numerical and physical substructures that are interconnected in real time through a control system fig 1 real time hybrid testing was originally developed as an extension to the pseudo dynamic testing of systems and components in earthquake design analysis of civil engineering structures nakashima et al 1992 the method was developed in order to analyse highly nonlinear and rate dependent components connected to linear structural finite element fe analyses this has been studied extensively within the seismic civil engineering community fundamental questions such as stability interface connection and numerical substructuring have been addressed by carrion and spencer 2007 terkovics et al 2016 while the effect and compensation for time delays were presented by horiuchi et al 1996 1999 chae et al 2013 similar parallel developments have been made in the aerospace and automotive engineering communities through hardware in the loop hil testing of control systems on physical hardware and model in the loop mil testing of structural members plummer 2006 reathm testing of ocean structures was first suggested as a means for overcoming ocean basin infrastructure limitations when testing ocean structures in deep water applications final report and recommen 1998 buchner et al 1999 stansberg et al 2002 the part of the mooring system that could not be represented physically and hence had to be truncated i e geometrically divided into substructures would then be modelled numerically and attached to the physical system through sensors and actuators these studies were at the time only realised as desktop experiments as the technology was not yet mature for full implementation due to e g insufficient computational power and limited actuator technology the research on reathm testing applied to mooring systems has been further developed in more recent studies cao and tahchiev 2013 reathm testing methods have also been proposed for offshore wind turbines chabaud 2016 one of the main challenges identified for model scale tests of offshore wind turbines is a disparity in scaling regimes as wave related loads and response should be froude scaled while wind related responses should be scaled using reynolds scaling with reathm testing it is possible to mitigate this challenge by computing the wind loads numerically based on the measured platform motions and simulated wind field and rotor dynamics which is in itself a challenge bayati et al 2017 and actuate them onto the physical system such studies have been conducted both in 5 degree of freedom dof sauder et al 2016 chabaud 2016 and 1 dof oguz et al 2018 a stepwise method for designing a reathm test for offshore floating wind turbines was presented by sauder et al 2016 the research objective of the work presented in this paper was to develop a more formal method for real time hybrid model testing of ocean structures the main scientific contribution of this study is the development of the formal method for performing reathm testing of ocean structures this study includes a reformulation of the design steps from sauder et al 2016 such that they are more general and hence applicable to a wider range of ocean structures the method was implemented and tested in a case study of a moored floating structure in the marine cybernetics laboratory mc lab at the norwegian university of science and technology ntnu representing a typical application with slender structures e g mooring lines and risers the control system components used in the case study were developed in a previous study vilsen et al 2017a due to the spatial limitations of the basin a proper physical validation test of a real mooring system would be infeasible the case study was therefore based on a simplified emulated system that was possible to set up both as a real time hybrid test and as a purely physical system he paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the general strategy and method for a reathm test a case study on horizontal mooring systems is presented in section 3 along with a physical verification study finally the results are presented in section 4 and discussed in section 5 before concluding in section 6 2 method since the primary motivation for the development of reathm testing is to enable testing of ocean structures that are difficult to study in purely physical laboratory experiments the initial considerations and studies to be performed are similar to those typically done for traditional hydrodynamic model scale testing i e identifying the dynamic system physical phenomena scaling regimes and quantities of interest with this as a basis and by generalising the design steps for offshore wind turbines presented by sauder et al 2016 it is possible to derive a design and execution method for reathm testing of ocean structures the following design steps are proposed 1 identify the dynamic system and governing physical laws 2 identify the quantities and temporal spatial domains of interest 3 identify ill conditioning and other constraints in model testing 4 choose a substructuring and control strategy 5 perform a fidelity analysis given physical constraints and substructuring 6 design and tune the control system 7 perform verification tests in the following the seven design steps are described in detail a chart of the design procedure is presented in fig 2 where the steps are categorized into an initial planning phase an analysis phase by numerical simulations and a design and test phase where physical hardware is included 2 1 identification of the dynamic system and governing physical laws it is essential to identify the physical laws governing the system or the phenomena acting upon it as these will determine how the system properties should be scaled in physical model representation in marine technology a wide span of different applications are possible relevant systems may include offshore wind turbines liquid sloshing in tanks moored offshore oil gas and aquaculture structures tension leg platforms and other slender structures such as pipelines and risers general characteristics of each structure and system may vary for the different applications and sites of operation the physical quantities of importance will also depend on which governing physical laws are dominating the system dynamics examples of such laws include the symmetry laws of conservation and continuity laws of motion such as gravitational laws or general newtonian mechanics and thermodynamic laws 2 2 identification of quantities and temporal spatial domains of interest the quantities of interest qoi and the temporal spatial domains of interest doi for a system must be identified to determine where and how to monitor the system in model scale representation the qois are physical quantities of the system which are desired to be directly or indirectly observed in model testing examples of relevant qois for ocean structures are motions and mooring forces the spatial doi is the spatial extent and location of the qois identifying the spatial domain is important for the truncation between the numerical and physical system and thereby placement of sensors and actuators examples of the spatial dois are the above water surface structure wind turbines the water column deep water applications the wave zone and the free surface area temporal dois are the frequency span and resolution of the qois and physical phenomena acting on the system and are necessary for designing the numerical model control and actuation system and logging system examples of the temporal dois are wave frequencies 1st order low frequency 2nd order high frequency such as vortex induced vibrations viv and rare events such as slamming qois and temporal and spatial domains are possible to derive based on the identified dynamic system and physical laws important for the system section 2 1 2 3 identification of ill conditioning and constraints in model scale representation of the system incompatibilities or ill conditioning of certain properties in the system may render traditional scaled model testing infeasible and hence requires that hybrid component testing methods are applied incompatibilities that arise when scaling the system dynamics according to the identified physical laws should be identified e g when scaling system properties founded in different physical phenomena thereby requiring use of different scaling laws ill conditioning in scaled representation of the system can also occur when some part exhibit much faster dynamics than the rest of the system or when scaling components with very large discrepancies in geometric extent e g mooring line with length 3000 m and diameter 300 mm furthermore very high scaling ratios may make high quality wave generation difficult the experimental model scale representation of the system can also be constrained by physical and geometrical constraints set by the available test materials and laboratory infrastructure 2 4 substructuring and control strategy the ill conditioned properties or physical constraints must be compensated for by performing substructuring that is partitioning the system into numerical and physical substructures to separate the different physical domains or phenomena the location of the interface where the substructuring is performed can be chosen based on various factors dynamics too complex to model numerically need to be modelled physically the validity of available numerical models will also impact how much of the system it is possible to treat numerically tuning these numerical models so that they give satisfactory results e g choosing the correct drag coefficients as input before using them in tests is a crucial and challenging task following froude scaling time scales with λ where λ is the geometric scale ratio the time scaling determines the computational requirement for the numerical models as the numerical substructure must be designed such that it simulates fast while still capturing the system dynamics when a substructuring strategy is chosen the most important and relevant dynamics of the substructures must be transferred across the interface this requires fulfilment of similarity conditions on the interface s to ensure that the dynamics from the substructures are fully coupled de klerk et al 2008 following e g bond graph terminology karnopp et al 2006 the exchange of energy between the substructures can be described by the product of the flow e g velocity and rotation rates and effort e g force or torque this is illustrated in fig 3 and is obtained by 1 ensuring compatibility of displacements in one interface direction 2 ensuring equilibrium of forces in the other interface direction using this definition the control system can be designed to use either flow or effort as the control output the choice might be affected by technical limitations possible external disturbances or dynamics of the control system time delays and actuator dynamics might affect the controllability ability to control a state to a desired setpoint and causality cause and effect on the interface meaning that the control system dynamics could affect the overall dynamics of the coupled system the actuator and sensor system must be placed such that they do not introduce physical disturbances that influence the fidelity beyond given limits 2 5 fidelity analysis the fidelity of a reathm system describes how well the hybrid system represents the emulated system a thorough definition of the fidelity will be given in sauder et al sørensen while sauder et al 2018 contains a more relevant version for marine applications sufficiently high fidelity in a test method is necessary for the design validation of ocean structures in order to ensure validity of the test results for reathm testing artefacts in the system such as actuation errors or measurement noise may affect the overall behaviour of the system for high fidelity to be ensured the quantities of interest should not be affected by such effects a sensitivity analysis must therefore be performed to identify which artefacts or error sources play the largest role in determining the fidelity of the system sauder et al 2018 investigation of the sensitivity to artefacts is possible by developing numerical proxies of the physical subsystem and the interface and using these to set up a numerical numerical system emulating the full hybrid test setup bachynski et al 2015 sauder et al 2017 the outcome of the fidelity analysis should specify the system requirements for e g sensor noise bias time delays and numerical model efficiency to achieve the desired fidelity level 2 6 control system design in general the term control system encompasses everything connecting the physical and numerical substructures including sensors and actuators the control system should be designed so that it fulfils the requirements derived in sections 2 4 and 2 5 the physical system must be equipped with a sensor system such that it is possible to measure or estimate the states or outputs of the physical substructure needed as inputs to the numerical model and in some cases for the control system as well the sensor system should further give access to the states necessary for observing evaluating or estimating the qois of the physical system the sampling frequencies should be chosen based on the identified temporal resolution and relevant sampling theorems similarly the control system should run fast enough to avoid any shortcomings in the model and signal reconstructions and aliasing the sensor system can for instance include both analogue and digital sensors with different sampling update frequencies continuous time signals should then be properly reproduced for input to the numerical substructure by using interpolation and extrapolation methods e g zero order hold as mentioned earlier the control system performance can be affected by artefacts such as time delays scaling errors sensor bias and noise wild points and drift time delays are particularly critical to system performance as they may induce errors or instability 7 to fulfil the equilibrium condition the corresponding force from the numerical model must in principle be applied at the same instant the measurement is made this is not practically possible due to e g non zero time delays from communication numerical computation and actuator dynamics the aim is therefore to 1 minimize time delays when possible 2 identify and compensate for time delays in the system an actuation system should ensure that the desired loads or displacements depending on the selected actuation strategy from the numerical substructure is actuated onto the physical substructure actuated quantities must be measured or estimated for traceability and feedback to the controllers this feedback must be fast enough to follow the reference without inducing artefacts in the form of time delays or actuation errors note that other types of artefacts than time delays cab be of importance e g force sensor calibration errors sauder et al 2018 2 7 verification tests the performance of a reathm test setup must be verified before it can be used as a basis for the design validation of ocean structures however verification is often a non trivial task as artefacts may induce variations in the dynamics of the coupled physical numerical system that are difficult to directly observe and quantify verification studies should therefore systematically test the system functionality to quantify if any errors are induced through artefacts or system dynamics such test schedules may include the interface connection between the numerical and physical substructures must be examined to verify e g that interface quantities and coordinate transformations are correctly transferred controller actions should be verified through static and dynamic tests the numerical model used in real time with sensor input must be verified by studying quantities such as jitter time lags clock synchronization and output noise repeatability of the output and qois should be verified by performing several tests in the same conditions time delays in the system should be quantified to verify the compensation scheme and ensure traceability of the induced delays errors all monitored artefacts should be within bounds defined in section 2 5 further verifications may include test of robust error handling and safety measures to avoid sending undesired commands to the actuators that may damage technical equipment validation tests of a reathm testing setup where the performance of a purely physical laboratory experiment equivalent to the hybrid setup is compared with the reathm test output should also be performed before the system is used for actual studies the core functionalities of the system and key parameters such as time delays allocation and controller action should then be validated against a reference system that is possible to set up as a purely physical system 3 case study horizontal mooring systems the stepwise method presented above was formulated as a general approach in order to design hybrid test setups for ocean structures however the specific design steps from idea to experiment will vary from system to system in the following the reathm testing method is applied to a case study focused on horizontal mooring of a cylinder buoy no external environmental loading waves current wind were acting on the system in this study only static displacement tests and free decay tests were performed however the system was developed to satisfy requirements for future studies with wave excitations 3 1 identification of the dynamic system and governing physical laws the emulated system was a moored floating cylinder buoy with a mooring system consisting of 12 mooring lines attached to its circumference this buoy has previously been used in studies where the keel geometry was varied vilsen et al 2017a a rounded corner geometry was used in the present study this system was chosen as a case study because the test campaign should serve as a principal study of the method while at the same time maturing the technology by introducing challenges that have not previously been addressed with respect to reathm testing the choice of a generic cylindrical shape gives a flexibility in testing as the hydrodynamic properties are then isotropic this also means that the methods developed will not be very application specific but can be utilized for testing any rigid floating structures e g offshore oil and gas or aquaculture systems for the case study to function as a benchmark test for hybrid model testing the scaling ratio was set very high at λ 144 this resulted in a time scale ratio of 1 12 which set a high requirement for the simulation speed of the high fidelity and possibly complex numerical substructure using a high scaling ratio also increased scaling and measurement uncertainty for the tests however as the primary research objective of the case study was to implement and study the performance of the reathm test setup the added experimental uncertainty was not of primary concern the properties of the cylinder buoy and mooring system in full scale and in model scale are presented in table 1 parameters of the cylinder buoy determined from inclination tests are presented in table a4 in the appendix the dominating physical laws and phenomena acting on the system are the inertia and viscous forces on the hull and mooring lines the equations of motion can be described by the 6 dof vectorial form presented by fossen 2011 derived from newton euler equations for coupled translational and rotational motions 1 m ν ν d ν ν g η τ e x t τ m o o r where η ℝ 6 is the 6 dof position given in a local earth fixed frame as north east down ned coordinates and euler angles and ν ℝ 6 is the 6 dof velocity in the body fixed frame given as linear translational velocities and rotation rates m ℝ 6 6 is the mass and added mass matrix of the cylinder buoy d ℝ 6 6 is the damping matrix g η ℝ 6 is the hydrostatic stiffness vector and τ e x t ℝ 6 and τ m o o r ℝ 6 are the external and mooring force vectors and moments acting on the buoy respectively for this type of system model testing is needed to identify the viscous drag and eddy making near the surface of the body which are challenging to compute numerically in decay testing the system may in rough terms be considered by only studying 1 dof motions of the floater in the decay direction isotropic parameters the matrices 1 then reduce to one equation with mass stiffness and damping as given in table 1 the linearised viscous damping estimate is averaged over one oscillation period for an excursion of 1 5 cylinder radius 3 2 identification of quantities and temporal and spatial domains of interest the qois are the oscillation period of the floating cylinder the top tensions in the mooring lines and the damping of the coupled system linear and quadratic damping coefficients p 1 and p 2 these quantities are related to the static and dynamic properties of the mooring system and the hydrodynamic added mass and damping as the system operates in full scale for the numerical substructure and model scale for the experimental substructure temporal and spatial resolutions change across the interface the maximum excursion applied was 1 5 times the radius of the cylinder approximately 63 m in full scale and 0 45 m in model scale the expected oscillation period of the surge motions was near 120 s in full scale and 10 s in model scale and an expected roll pitch period 12 s full scale and 1 s in model scale fig 4 the tangent stiffness of the mooring system at the origin was 282 6 kn m in full scale with the expected excursion this gives a maximum mooring force of approximately 18 3 mn in full scale and 6n in model scale table 2 for future applications that include wave forces a wave spectrum with significant wave height of 14 m and peak period of 12s in full scale would result in 0 1 m and 1s model scale parameters 3 3 identification of ill conditioning and constraints the ill conditioning of the dynamic system mainly consists of the radically different dimensions between the mooring system and the topside floating structure the large spatial extent of the mooring system 1494 5m radius for a single mooring line and 320m water depth requires a scaling ratio of 1 250 to fit the constraints of the 6m wide basin infrastructure such a large scaling ratio is not feasible for observing the hydrodynamic effects on the floater stansberg et al 2002 another aspect is that soil structure interaction occurs as mooring lines are lifted and lowered on the seabed which might be difficult to reproduce in physical model testing 3 4 substructuring and control strategy the substructuring was desired was set up to compensate for the geometric constraints in the laboratory infrastructure while retaining the complex flow regimes at the free surface the numerical nonlinear fe software riflex ocean 2016 was chosen to simulate the parts of the mooring system that did not fit in the basin the software has been thoroughly documented and validated and is thus considered sufficiently accurate to represent such mooring systems aksnes et al 2015 for simplicity the coupling on the interface was reduced to the 2 dof horizontal force components the vertical force component was excluded as the effect on decay testing in still water can be neglected however it may be of importance for other applications such as semi submersibles especially when damaged stability is in focus as only the horizontal force components were transferred and no physical part of the mooring lines were present in the tests the truncation point can be considered as the fairled points of the cylinder such that the entire mooring system was modelled numerically using the definition of truncation ratio given by sauder et al 2017 i e truncated length divided by total length this resulted in a truncation ratio of 1 the mooring lines were designed with four segments a top chain segment a fibre rope segment a heavy chain segment near the mud line and a long chain segment to the anchor each line being modelled by 60 elements distributed over the four segments the full model contained 720 elements the input values for the numerical model are presented in the appendix table a 5 with the longitudinal and lateral drag coefficients used in the morison equation for determining the hydrodynamic loads to satisfy the similarity conditions stated in section 2 4 a control strategy should be designed to control either the position velocity flow of the cylinder buoy or the force effort exerted upon the buoy as the response of the physical system to the hydrodynamic forces is a qoi the physical model should be able to interact freely with the hydrodynamic forces i e the dynamics remain undisturbed inertia dominated hydrodynamic forces on the cylinder depend on the acceleration i e the relative difference between the acceleration of the fluid and the cylinder if the position and velocity were to be controlled the measured acceleration would need to be correct as well to achieve correct forces this is challenging due to effects such as measurement errors actuator dynamics and time delays in contrast if force control is applied the cylinder can be controlled to better interact with the environmental forces by adding a compliant element and actively compensate for external disturbances disturbance rejection the restoring forces from the numerical substructure are then actuated onto the system separately induced errors or delays will then primarily be in the form of errors in the mooring force and not directly impact the hydrodynamic forces based on these observations force control was chosen for the case study with the measured position and velocities being input to the numerical substructure and calculated forces being actuated onto the experimental substructure the actuated dof s were then reduced to the horizontal ne components of the force computed by the numerical substructure 3 5 fidelity analysis one artefact in the case study is the reduced order of coupling on the numerical physical interface the substructure interface should ideally be designed to transfer the 6 dof dynamics between the substructures however the actuation of interface forces was limited to the 2 dof horizontal force resultants for simplicity in the case study only horizontal translational motions are considered where the stiffness from the mooring system can be described by the catenary effect further the total mass of the mooring system is small compared to the mass of the floating cylinder this means that the horizontal force resultants play the largest contribution while the influence of the vertical forces can be neglected faltinsen 1990 the physical substructure buoy had no stiffness in the horizontal plane besides that supplied by the numerical mooring system this meant that even small errors in the position and force measurement system would affect the overall dynamics further the system had a high scaling ratio and was sensitive towards scaling errors or dimensional errors as 1 n error in force measurement actuation in model scale results in ca 3 mn error in full scale due to the rounded corner geometry of the cylinder buoy very little physical damping was present in the reathm setup the system was therefore sensitive to time delays in the control system horiuchi et al 1999 ueland and skjetne 2017 3 6 control system design the architecture of the real time system was developed to accommodate the equilibrium and compatibility requirements on the interface see section 3 4 details on the control system algorithm have been presented in vilsen et al 2017a while the individual system functionalities are presented here fig 6 3 6 1 sensor system the physical substructure was placed at the center of the test basin and equipped with a sensor system consisting of an optical position measurement system three component accelerometers and load cells on the actuation lines fig 5b the optical positioning system logged the rigid body position and attitude of the physical substructure at a update rate of 100 hz given in ned coordinates with respect to a local earth fixed inertial reference system the accelerometers were placed on deck to measure the surge sway and heave accelerations of the physical substructure with respect to a body fixed non inertial reference system at a sampling rate of 300 hz a data acquisition system was placed inside the buoy for logging the sensor data the sensor data was timestamped to ensure traceability of time delays and sent to a control system on land through optic fiber wire 3 6 2 kinematic observer the measured states of the physical substructure were 6 dof position and attitude and 3 dof linear accelerations translational velocities are needed as input for the numerical models and for the controllers and are ideally obtained by integrating the accelerations however sensor bias in the accelerometers may then induce drift in the integrated values which may in lead to divergence hence a kinematic observer was implemented to estimate the states of the system through fusion of different sensor inputs a nonlinear passive observer for inertial measurement unit imu and global navigation satellite system gnss integration was chosen fossen 2011 using accelerometer and gyro measurements as proxies for imu data and optical position measurements as proxies for gnss data the observer outputs were the estimated position and instantaneous velocity along with the sensor bias for the accelerometer implementation of the observer has previously been described in 18 and the details can be found in appendix a 3 3 6 3 prediction time delays induced by the measurement system communication computation time and actuator dynamics were identified and a prediction scheme was introduced to compensate for the time delays since environmental loads affecting the experimental substructure and hence the motions of the floater are generally not modelled well it was not possible to use model based prediction methods instead a polynomial prediction procedure was applied for predicting future values of the estimated position and velocity a third order polynomial approximation was fitted to each individual physical quantity and prediction performed as polynomial extrapolation the polynomial identification was performed using the 50 previous data points 250 ms model scale and extrapolation was done 6 data points ahead corresponding to a 30 ms prediction in model scale 360 ms is full scale this prediction window was chosen primarily to compensate for the delay from the position measurement system without introducing unacceptable overshoot and noise 18 3 6 4 controller and actuation system the objective of the controller and the actuation system was to apply the loads τ ℝ 2 computed by the numerical substructure onto the experimental substructure the applied force must satisfy the equilibrium condition on the moving interface equivalent to the sum of the two main control objectives chabaud 2016 1 reference tracking of the desired force 2 disturbance rejection actively compensate for external disturbances on the physical substructure for the reathm test setup three actuators were placed in the horizontal plane with 120 spacing around the physical substructure the actuation was performed through a system consisting of a rotary actuator a brushless dc motor connected to a compliant clock spring the spring excited a pulley wheel which transformed the rotary motion into a translational motion through an actuation wire connected to the experimental substructure the compliant element was added to reduce the overall stiffness of the actuation system and thereby reducing the system response to external disturbances an allocation procedure was used to calculate the individual line tensions required from each actuator to apply the global load vector τ which is found by summing the horizontal top tension components from the mooring lines in the numerical substructure the theory behind this approach is briefly presented in appendix a 4 and can be found in full length in vilsen et al 2017a the first control objective reference tracking of the desired force was sought satisfied through two controllers first a reference feed forward controller that used a quasi static model of the actuation system to estimate the required actuation command to apply the desired force t r e f second an integral feedback controller that integrates the error between desired and measured force t m e a s to compensate for estimation error and drift in the other controllers the second control objective disturbance rejection was sought satisfied by a velocity feed forward controller which used the estimated velocity ν ˆ of the physical system in the inertial reference frame to find the elongation velocities of the individual actuation lines ν f f the elongation velocities were then integrated and the resulting position used to compensate the floater motions through motor commands 3 7 verification study the experiments were conducted at the marine cybernetics laboratory mcl at ntnu the laboratory is a 30 m long and 6 m wide wave basin with a wave generator at one end and wave absorption at the other the depth at the test section is 1 5 m when using riflex for simulation of the numerical substructure nonlinear damping is introduced from hydrodynamic drag on the mooring lines furthermore time delays are introduced from computation time and communication time with the external pc running the simulation for the verification study a linear isotropic stiffness model was therefore implemented directly in the control loop instead of using riflex as a numerical substructure the modelled stiffness was applied without introducing further time delays and with no damping model included the performance of the remaining components of the control system could then be tested isolated from the numerical substructure 3 7 1 tests performed static displacement test were performed to evaluate the allocation procedure and interface connection in the static case by verifying that the commanded load from the numerical model was correctly applied to the physical system this was done by applying a stepwise static displacement to the physical substructure and by comparing the applied load to the commanded load dynamic decay tests during which the buoy was manually pulled away from the equilibrium position and released were performed to evaluate the dynamic properties of the system including oscillation frequencies hydrodynamic damping and applied mooring loads several decay tests were performed to verify the repeatability of the results 3 7 2 analysis theory the applied horizontal load was found by using the instantaneously measured line tensions in the three actuation lines measured position of the buoy and the known positions of the actuators were first used to obtain the unit vectors of the actuation line tensions horizontal north and east components of the applied mooring force could then be found by vector summation the expected oscillation periods of the coupled buoy and linear numerical stiffness were estimated by 2 t 0 2 π m k where m is the measured total mass of the buoy plus added mass determined as 0 5 times the displaced volume and k is the horizontal stiffness of the numerical mooring system a method presented by 28 cp 7 was used to estimate the normalized damping coefficients the equation of motions is normalized and the linear and quadratic damping is described by coefficients p 1 and p 2 and the stiffness by the coefficient p 3 the 1 dof equation of motion for a decay can then be stated as 3 x p 1 x p 2 x x p 3 x 0 where x is the position excursion and x x represent first and second derivative with respect to time results from decay tests were used to estimate the linear and quadratic damping coefficients by using the relation 4 2 t m l o g x n 1 x n 1 p 1 16 x n 3 t m p 2 where t m is the oscillation period and x n is the amplitude of the nth oscillation the damping coefficients can then be found by performing a decay test and plotting 16 x n 3 t m on the x axis and 2 t m l o g x n 1 x n 1 on the y axis the slope of the line gives an estimate of the quadratic damping coefficient while the crossing with the y axis gives an estimate of the linear damping coefficient the sensor data were sampled in model scale time at 300 hz as the motions of such a system are at much lower frequency bands the sampled data was low pass filtered with a cutoff frequency at 4 hz in model scale which is equivalent to 0 33 hz in full scale the frequencies that are then filtered out lie well outside the expected frequencies of both the motion response and the expected external excitations where little energy would be present at higher frequencies than 0 2 hz in full scale and 2 4 hz in model scale faltinsen 1990 3 8 validation study a full physical test using physical horizontal springs to represent the mooring system was performed to validate the reathm test to validate both the statics and dynamics of the hybrid system it was desired to design a case that could be tested both experimentally and numerically with high fidelity and with static and dynamic equivalence between the systems the setup was developed such that each actuation line was replaced by a physical spring that was attached horizontally to the buoy with 120 spacing between individual lines similarly to the actuation lines for the hybrid system the initial length of the springs was 2 14 m and they were subjected to an initial elongation of 0 9 m the springs were individually pre tested and rated to have a stiffness of 8 7 n m the three spring system lead to an initial stiffness of 13 05 n m for a pull in a direction in line with one of the springs note that the stiffness is anisotropic with this setup if alternatively considering a vertical spring system using pulleys to apply the horizontal stiffness friction damping would be induced by the pulleys this is a problem as the damping of the system is a qoi 3 9 tests using riflex after verification and validation tests a test series was performed with the fully nonlinear fe model as numerical substructure as in the verification test both static and dynamic tests were performed 4 experimental results this section presents the results obtained through experimental testing 4 1 static displacement tests results from the static displacement tests are presented as the measured applied restoring force resulting from a stepwise excursion fig 7 the measured stiffness from the verification study corresponds well with the desired stiffness given as input for the linear stiffness model the static results from the validation study show a higher initial stiffness gradually sloping towards the same stiffness as that applied in the verification study 4 2 decay and repeatability results from three repetitions of decay tests are presented along with the estimated linear and quadratic damping coefficients for the verification study fig 8 and for the validation study fig 9 the decay results figs 8a and 9a are presented in terms of the normalized horizontal motions of the floater along the decay direction in the damping plots figs 8b and 9b the full drawn line indicates a fit to the first 8 oscillation amplitudes of all three tests the verification tests demonstrate good repeatability in oscillation period and damping fig 8a though variations in the oscillation amplitudes resulted in scattering of the estimated p 1 and p 2 between tests fig 8b oscillation periods from tests with varying stiffness were systematically lower than the theoretically expected results table 3 the validation test results showed good fit for the quadratic damping coefficient at large amplitudes while a transition towards linear damping was observed at smaller amplitudes fig 9b 4 3 applied load a time series plot of the applied load during a decay test in the verification study is presented fig 10 the commanded north and east resultants are presented along with the applied load the applied load in general show good correspondence with the commanded load though some undershoot is observed the sampled load signal included high energy content at higher frequencies which was removed by low pass filtering of the presented results 4 4 tests using riflex the results of the verification test using the nonlinear fe model riflex are presented for the static and dynamic case fig 11 the results show that the nonlinear geometric stiffness has been applied as intended fig 11a and that results from dynamic tests are repeatable fig 11b top tensions from all twelve simulated mooring lines during a decay test show a variation in individual loading with highest loads for those in line with the excursion direction fig 12 5 discussion in this section the presented results are discussed and the validity evaluated 5 1 verification study the results of the static displacement tests show that in the static case the control system was able to apply the correct restoring force the restoring force was applied by allocating the output from the numerical substructure to the three actuators and applying the allocated setpoints to the controllers the good correspondence between commanded and applied force implies that the allocation procedure performs well and that the individual line force controllers were able to track the desired static setpoint if the allocation procedure was not functioning correctly the static forces would not match for numerical and physical systems the good correspondence between the three decay test repetitions imply that the damping and oscillation periods qois of the system are highly repeatable since repeatability in the qois is very important for model testing in general this strengthens the impression that this reathm testing setup performs consistently the oscillation periods for the five different stiffness levels tested with the linear isotropic stiffness model in the hybrid system matched well with the theoretical period based on the mass added mass and stiffness of the system however the period applied with the hybrid system is systematically lower than the expected by approximately 2 5 this could be because the added mass was lower than theoretically expected possibly due to the rounded keel geometry the results of the commanded vs applied force show that the controller action was able to follow the commanded reference well there was a systematic undershoot of the applied force indicating that performance could be improved by applying faster control action however the dynamics of the actuation system generates high frequency vibrations which interact with the controllers by increasing the controller gains the interaction between vibrations and controller action is amplified this limits the possible controller configurations with the present system and indicates that improvements in the mechanical design are needed 5 2 validation study the results from the decay tests in the physical validation study demonstrated good repeatability in oscillation period and damping the comparison of the horizontal spring system and the results from reathm testing show a difference in the stiffness applied in the tests with the physical system exhibiting nonlinear anisotropic stiffness while the hybrid system was set up with a stiffness based on a theoretical stiffness obtained by using trigonometry and the individual spring stiffnesses the stiffness of the physical system was measured to be higher than the theoretical value probably due to the catenary effect of the suspended horizontal springs due to the higher physical stiffness observed during testing the stiffness of the hybrid system was changed to 14 7 n m corresponding to the tangent stiffness of the physical system at 1 6 radius excursion however this was an underestimation of the stiffness as the stiffness was higher near the equilibrium point and the anisotropic properties results in higher stiffness for excursion in the direction opposite to the tested the difference in stiffness resulted in longer oscillation periods for the hybrid system than for the physical validation tests given the discrepancies between the physical and hybrid system described above the present case does not serve as a full validation of the system however the results can to some extent still be used to validate the system dynamics as the springs in the physical setup were not in contact with water and no moving parts were introduced the springs should ideally not add any damping to the system in both the hybrid and purely physical setups the damping should therefore purely originate from the hydrodynamic damping of the buoy however artefacts in the actuation system such as time delays or actuator dynamics can appear as additive or dissipative energy in the hybrid system or negative or positive damping comparison of the damping levels of the two systems can then give an indication of the significance of the artefacts in the hybrid system 29 the induced damping varies with the velocity and therefore also by stiffness by using the method presented in section 3 7 the damping is normalised with respect to the excursion and the oscillation period the results presented for the hybrid test and physical test show that similar linear and quadratic damping levels are present in the two systems for both studies the damping is initially purely quadratic with a close fit to the straight line in the damping coefficient plot as the velocity decreases the damping goes towards linear damping this appears clearer in the physical test where the shift occurs gradually beginning from when the maximum velocity during an oscillation drops below 0 1 m s or equivalent to a keulegan carpenter kc number of 1 5 the damping is fully linear from the velocity drops below 0 055 m s equivalent to a kc number of 0 95 linear hydrodynamic damping arise from viscous skin friction on the cylinder surface while the quadratic damping is typically associated with eddy making damping due to flow separation faltinsen 1990 the increased linear damping observed for the hybrid system at very small amplitudes is opposite of what would be expected since time delays in the system would induce negative linear damping ueland and skjetne 2017 this could be due to errors in the disturbance rejection as identified in a previous study vilsen et al 2018 such effects may modulate the system dynamics due to the control system action further validation and verification studies are needed to prove that the present system will have satisfactory performance in future testing in addition to investigating the hybrid system s ability to reproduce the system characteristics stiffness and dynamics a full validation study should also validate the correct response given a range of relevant environmental loadings this may prove more challenging for the control system as much higher frequencies of excitation would occur when the system is exposed to environmental forces 5 3 nonlinear fe model the coupling of the nonlinear fe model riflex gave good results with the static displacement tests giving the expected nonlinear response and the decay tests showing good repeatability given that the general system functionality has been verified above the primary artefact introduced when using a more complex numerical substructure is time delays caused by communication from the real time system to the simulation pc and the numerical calculation time the time delays induced by using riflex in reathm testing was studied by vilsen et al 2017b their impacts on the qois implied that time delays induced by the numerical substructure are important performance indicators that must be in focus for future reathm testing applications 6 conclusion the experimental outcomes of this study suggest that the proposed method served as a good guide for how to design a reathm test although the method did probably not provide a fully generic setup for reathm testing of ocean structures it addressed which aspects to consider when designing such tests and proposed a guideline for how to systematically analyse the considered system the outcomes from the case study prove that it is possible to apply nonlinear mooring stiffness from a numerical model onto a physical system in reathm testing of marine structures however the method should undergo more extensive validation studies such that the technology can be raised to a trl level sufficiently high for the method to be used in design validation of ocean structures when testing systems where the vertical force component of the mooring load is of minor importance e g turret moored floating production storage and offloading fpso vessels the reathm testing approach used in this study would be sufficient to apply the correct nonlinear horizontal stiffness and mooring line damping however expanding the system to handle more degrees of freedom would enable further applications towards deep water acknowledgements this work was supported by the research council of norway through the centres of excellence funding

earth fixed reference frame here denoted with subscript n and the accelerations were measured with respect to a body fixed reference frame denoted with subscript b the observer rotates the

substructure this means that errors in the alignment of attitude and acceleration measurement or time delays between measurements can induce significant errors in the velocity estimation due to the
